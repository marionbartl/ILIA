Oil prices fell 7.6% in the last week following reports that OPEC countries and Russia might start producing more oils soon. Those countries cut production at the start of 2017, which helped take U.S. crude from about $50 a barrel in late 2016 to more than $70 this month. The countries had agreed to keep production at its current levels until the end of this year, but upheaval in Venezuela and new sanctions on Iran could change their plans.

WASHINGTON -
Thousands of children are heading to the White House for its biggest social event of the year: the annual Easter Egg Roll.
There had been some hand-wringing over whether President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, would be able to pull off a successful “egg-stravaganza.” Both the president and first lady have been slow to fill White House staff jobs.
But a downsized version of the 139-year-old event is kicking off early Monday on the South Lawn.
The White House is expecting more than 21,000 children and adults to attend the festivities. That's down from the 35,000 people who attended last year.
The first lady tweeted over the weekend that she's looking forward to hosting the Easter Egg Roll. The event was first held in 1878.
Olurotimi Akinosho — aka Rotimi — will star opposite Erica Ash in the indie romantic comedy “Singleholic,” based on the novel of the same name by Katharine Bing.
Bryan Barber is attached to direct the movie, which follows Ash, who wakes up on the morning of her 35th birthday and decides she wants to settle down and get married, so she goes on a series of hilarious dates. Rotimi plays Ash's main love interest.
Katharine Birbalsingh adapted the screenplay and Milan Selassie is producing the film, which is currently in production in Mauritius, East Africa. Cassian Elwes is overseeing sales. The film also stars Stephen Bishop, Tyson Beckford, and Vanessa A. Williams.
Rotimi just wrapped production as a lead in the digital series “A Luv Tale,” which he also serves as an executive producer on.
Most recently, he guest starred on “Law & Order: SVU” on NBC. Rotimi is best known for his role as the drug-dealing Dre Coleman on Starz's drama “Power,” which returns for its new season on July 1. The show is executive produced by S. Epatha Merkerson and Raynelle Swilling, produced by Sidra Smith, and directed and written by Kay Oyegun.
He is repped by Pantheon and Category 5's Brian Sher.
Environment Canada issued a special air quality statement on Monday for the Battlefords, Lloydminster, Biggar, Rosetown, Kindersley, Leader and Maple Creek areas.
Smoke from forest fires in B.C. is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility as it pushes across Alberta and into parts of western Saskatchewan.

Jupiter's famous storm, the Great Red Spot, penetrates well below the clouds — about 300 kilometres into the planet's atmosphere, suggest data collected by NASA's Juno spacecraft.
"One of the most basic questions about Jupiter's Great Red Spot is: how deep are the roots," said Scott Bolton, Juno's principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio.
"Juno data indicate that the solar system's most famous storm is almost one-and-a-half Earths wide, and has roots that penetrate about 200 miles (300 kilometres) into the planet's atmosphere," Bolton said.
The findings, based on data collected by the Juno spacecraft during its first pass over Jupiter's Great Red Spot in July 2017, were announced on Monday at the annual American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans.
The science instrument responsible for this in-depth revelation was Juno's Microwave Radiometer (MWR). The Great Red Spot is a giant oval of crimson-coloured clouds in Jupiter's southern hemisphere that race counterclockwise around the oval's perimeter with wind speeds greater than any storm on Earth.
Measuring 16,000 kilometres in width as of 3 April, 2017, the Great Red Spot is 1.3 times as wide as Earth. "Juno found that the Great Red Spot's roots go 50 to 100 times deeper than Earth's oceans and are warmer at the base than they are at the top," Andy Ingersoll, Professor at California Institute of Technology and a Juno co-investigator said.
"Winds are associated with differences in temperature, and the warmth of the spot's base explains the ferocious winds we see at the top of the atmosphere," Ingersoll added. The future of the Great Red Spot is still very much up for debate.
While the storm has been monitored since 1830, it has possibly existed for more than 350 years, according to scientists. In the 19th century, the Great Red Spot was well over two Earths wide. But in modern times, the Great Red Spot appears to be diminishing in size, as measured by Earth-based telescopes and spacecraft, the scientists said.
Juno also has detected a new radiation zone, just above the gas giant's atmosphere, near the equator. The zone includes energetic hydrogen, oxygen and sulfur ions moving at almost light speed.
Launched on 5 August, 2011, Juno has completed eight science passes over Jupiter to date. Juno's ninth science pass will be on 16 December, NASA said.
South Korea's top financial regulator said Tuesday he expects holders of commercial papers issued by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. to agree to a debt-for-equity swap plan by the end of this week.
If they accept the bailout plan, state-run creditor banks will begin injecting fresh funds into Daewoo Shipbuilding to keep the ailing shipbuilder afloat, Financial Services Commission Chairman Yim Jong-yong told reporters.
(Yonhap)
Yim made the remarks after Daewoo Shipbuilding received final approval from its bondholders for the painful debt-for-equity swap plan earlier in the day, clearing a key hurdle to receive the fresh funds."If there is an agreement from holders of commercial papers, a fresh cash injection for Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering will be implemented," Yim said.Late last month, state-run creditor banks announced a fresh rescue package worth 6.7 trillion won ($5.8 billion) for Daewoo Shipbuilding, but only if all stakeholders agree on the modification of the terms of the loan.The huge assistance measures represent the second round of bailouts for the shipbuilder that has been suffering from severe liquidity problems over heavy losses in its offshore projects.Under the rescue package, Daewoo Shipbuilding will receive new loans worth 2.9 trillion won if lenders and bondholders agree to swap 2.9 trillion won of debt for new shares in the shipbuilder.

Salem city officials issued a do-not-drink advisory Tuesday following the detection of low levels of toxins in city drinking water pulled from the North Santiam River.
The advisory affects children under 6 years old and vulnerable populations, such as nursing mothers and dialysis patients. Officials are urging them to drink bottled water.
Is there something that can be done to treat the water so it is safe to drink?
David Farrer, a public health toxicologist with the Oregon Health Authority, said there really isn't anything to be done to treat the water.
Boiling the water doesn't work; camping filters don't work; nor do the filters that attach to faucets. Farrer said it's best for children and others in vulnerable populations to not drink the water until the advisory is lifted.
What are cyanotoxins?
A common bacterium called cyanobacteria sometimes produces a natural poison called cyanotoxins. In mammals, exposure to cyanotoxins can cause allergic reaction and respiratory issues, and cause acute illness, including liver and kidney damage, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. With extreme exposure, symptoms may include organ failure, paralysis and even death.
Toxins in water: Salem drinking water contaminated, children shouldn't drink tap water
How long are the drinking water restrictions expected to last?
"I cannot give you a definitive answer," Lacey Goeres-Priest, Salem's water quality supervisor, told the Statesman Journal.
City officials said in an advisory posted online, "City of Salem is working closely with local and state public health and emergency response agencies to address the situation and to quickly reduce Cyanotoxin levels in tap water."
"City of Salem will post an updated advisory when: the Cyanotoxin levels are less than or equal to the national drinking water Health Advisories, this Does Not Drink Advisory is lifted and/or if there are any changes to the conditions of this Do Not Drink Advisory.
"Updates will be provided Thursday, May 31, 2018 via the City of Salem web page, CityofSalem.net; City of Salem Alert System; local media; City of Salem social media. Residents can sign up on CityofSalem.net to receive emergency alerts from the City."
The health advisory for Detroit Lake was issued last week. When did officials learn that the river water was a problem?
Water was sampled late last week and officials received the results of testing the water on Saturday, said Goeres-Priest. The results showed toxin levels were higher than a health advisory level for vulnerable communities and children, but remained below safe levels for adults.
The city has been coordinating with the Oregon Health Authority over the weekend.
After consulting with the OHA and Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday, Salem issued the advisory based on the data.
"We wanted to be proactive because we're coming up on the 10-day exposure period — if people are exposed to it for 10 days that's when the probability of health issues increases," said Greg Walsh, emergency manager for City of Salem.
May 23 health advisory: Health advisory issued for Detroit Lake after discovery of toxic algae
Detroit Reservoir has algae blooms every year. Why is it so bad this year?
"Every bloom is different," Goeres-Priest said.
She said it depends on, among other factors, the level of toxins being produced in the watershed and whether toxins are making their way all the way down the river to the water treatment facility.
"It's hard to say exactly why this year is different than last year," Goeres-Priest said. "We just know that based off the sample results that it is."
Three toxic blooms were identified in locations around Detroit Lake — at Blowout Arm, Heater Creek Arm and near the dam. That's more than in the past.
The bloom in Blowout Arm had a particularly high concentration of toxins, officials said. A liver toxin called "microcystin" was tested on May 23 at 48.21 parts per billion in that location. A health advisory is triggered when levels are just 4 parts per billion.
What is recommended for expectant or nursing mothers?
Farrer said he didn't know of good data on whether toxins can transfer from a nursing mother to her baby. But officials definitely do not want mothers drinking the water — they should stick with bottled water.
He said breastfeeding in this case is preferred to preparing formula with tap water.
Can I use my water filtration system to purify the water?
"Most water filters and purifiers will not remove this toxin from drinking water," the advisory states. "See manufacturer's recommendation for water filtration capabilities."
What is Salem-Keizer Public Schools doing for water for students and staff?
Kindergarten and younger children, as well as other at-risk children (such as those who are medically fragile) will be provided bottled water, said Joel Smallwood, manager of maintenance and construction services with Salem-Keizer Public Schools.
Schools on Keizer's water system are not affected.
Food services will use bottled water for all food prep throughout the district that's fed by Salem water, he said.
"We've got a team delivering right now," Smallwood said.
Bottled water: Shortages in Salem follow report of toxins in tap water
What cities outside of Salem are affected by the drinking water restrictions?
Stayton and Turner are falling in line with Salem's water advisory.
"We do test our water," said Keith Campbell, Stayton's city manager. "I don't know if it's as frequent as Salem, but our tests hadn't come up with anything."
Still, "we're going with just following the advisories with the city of Salem," he said.
David Sawyer, Turner's city administrator, said Salem officials contacted his city last week and told them about the concern.
"All of the water that comes into Salem, basically we tap into those lines as they come down the canyon. It's the same system," Sawyer said. "Because of the size of our distribution system, we're testing for E coli and we're testing for chlorine and things like that, just to make sure."
What about restaurants?
Farrer said that restaurants that use city water should not use the water to serve customers.
Health officials also are advising against using the water for cooking and washing food, he said.
Why is it considered safe to bathe and wash dishes with the water?
City officials said the water is OK to use to clean, bathe and wash dishes, as well as cleaning laundry, washing your hands and flushing toilets.
"However, infants and young children under the age of six should be supervised while bathing and during other tap water-related activities to prevent accidental ingestion of water," the advisory states.
Farrer said these toxins are not absorbed through the skin and the only way for them to get into people is if they are swallowed.
Alert confusion: Prepare for action': Vague emergency alert alarms Oregon residents
Health officials are recommending that children who are being bathed be supervised to make sure they don't drink the water, Farrer said.
Even so, a small amount of consumption is not going to be a harmful, such as the amount you swallow when washing your face or the little bit of water that gets into your mouth when you shower, Farrer said.

As much of Canada continues to bake in the sun, it's fair to say most Canadians are sweatier than usual.
But some people are dripping sweat no matter the situation, said Dr. Youwen Zhou, a dermatology professor at the University of British Columbia – even if they're not hot, or nervous or in any of the usual sweat-inducing situations.
These people suffer from a condition called hyperhidrosis, where they produce more sweat than is necessary to keep themselves cool. The Canadian Dermatology Association estimates around three per cent of Canadians, or about 950,000 people have hyperhidrosis.
“Patients affected by this condition could just be sweating for no reason when other people in the same environment, same conditions, do not,” said Zhou, who founded a hyperhidrosis speciality clinic at the Vancouver General Hospital.
While it's not dangerous, it's definitely unpleasant and many patients feel embarrassed, he said.
“They feel embarrassed. They feel embarrassed that when they interact with other people, that their shirt will be all wet. That sweat will drip down from their face, nose, and they feel the urge of constantly wiping off the sweat drops.”
Many sufferers will avoid social situations that could involve shaking hands, for fear that someone will feel their clammy palms, he said. It can even limit career choices – it's tough to use a keyboard or operate machinery with extremely sweaty hands.

Zhou acknowledges that there is a spectrum of sweatiness – some people hardly sweat at all, and some people sweat so much that they have difficulty in social situations, with most people somewhere in between.
But if you define hyperhidrosis as sweating so much that you feel your life is limited by sweating on half of all days, then about 10-15 per cent of the population reports suffering from the condition, according to his research. About five per cent could benefit from medical care, he thinks.
“Sweating by itself may or may not be a problem. But it is a problem if it becomes a limiting factor in people's activities, in people's lives.”
Dr. Anatoli Freiman, a certified dermatologist in Toronto, said that if people are sweating excessively, they should talk to their doctor. “It's important to seek a doctor to make sure there's no other reason for hyperhidrosis. A number of medical conditions, for example, thyroid disease, can cause hyperhidrosis. Some medications can do it. So it's important that patients get evaluated to exclude other possibilities.”
Treatments
If it turns out that there aren't any underlying conditions causing sweating, there are treatments available.
Antiperspirants, even those available at the drugstore, can help with mild cases.
Botox on the affected area, like the armpits, can work very well, said Zhou. “If you inject right in the armpit where people sweat, the sweat stops.”
There are also some medications, though they come with side effects. He's hopeful that newer medications applied topically, like a moist towelette just approved by the FDA in the U.S. to treat excessive sweating, will have fewer side effects because they stay on the affected area rather than being fully absorbed through the digestive system.

Surgery can disrupt the nerves that are triggering the excessive sweating – though in some cases, patients simply start sweating more elsewhere to compensate. And some patients benefit from an electrical therapy, immersing their hands or feet in water and receiving light shocks.
And don't worry about overheating, said Zhou.
Sweat is a natural and necessary function to help cool you off, but treating excessive sweating shouldn't impair that, he said. “If you stopped sweating in the entire body, yes, it would be dangerous,” but most treatments target a single area, like the armpits.
WASHINGTON - America has "no interest" in regime change in Pyongyang or the accelerated reunification of the two Koreas, two top US officials said in a message calibrated to cool last week's heated rhetoric.
Pentagon chief Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece that the United States favors a diplomatic solution to the nuclear stand-off, especially with help from China, though they stressed diplomacy is "backed by military options."
"The US has no interest in regime change or accelerated reunification of Korea," Mattis and Tillerson wrote.
"We do not seek an excuse to garrison US troops north of the Demilitarized Zone. We have no desire to inflict harm on the long-suffering North Korean people, who are distinct from the hostile regime in Pyongyang."
The message, published Sunday evening, came after tensions soared between North Korea and the United States last week after President Donald Trump made repeated bellicose statements to Kim Jong-Un, including the promise of "fire and fury" if Pyongyang continued to threaten America with nuclear weapons.
Mattis and Tillerson called on China, which is North Korea's main trading partner and ally, to take advantage of an "unparalleled opportunity" to assert its influence on Pyongyang.
"If China wishes to play a more active role in securing regional peace and stability - from which all of us, especially China, derive such great benefit - it must make the decision to exercise its decisive diplomatic and economic leverage over North Korea," the US officials wrote.
Their opinion piece came the same day as CIA director Mike Pompeo offered assurances there was "nothing imminent" in terms of conflict with North Korea.
Mattis and Tillerson also credited UN efforts and said the United States was willing to negotiate with North Korea, but said Pyongyang should indicate a desire to show good faith by halting weapons and nuclear tests.
General Joseph Dunford, who is Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and the top officer in the military, met Monday with South Korea's defense minister, Song Young-Moo, and defense chief, General Lee Sun-Jin.
"He stressed that North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs threaten the entire global community and endanger peace and stability in the region," Navy Captain Darryn James said.
And he "conveyed America's readiness to use the full range of military capabilities to defend our allies and the US homeland."

Hopes are running high that Goa, the oldest nursery of football in India, will nurture world-class players as it plays host to Group C of the FIFA U-17 World Cup at the Nehru stadium at Fatorda from Saturday.
Germany, Iran, Guinea and Costa Rica have during their training in Goa, since their arrival, opened an assortment of talent and a bag full of statistics that may make those who have still not purchased their tickets rue their luck.
Not a single boy from the state is playing for India. Yet, in these five days Goa will be hosting eight teams – two of which will be determined as the tournament wears on. From the six known, two are the countries that constantly nurture football to heights that leave many lose control of their emotions.
Germany is one team which will play during the first three days of the tournament in the state. They were the first to arrive and could be the last to depart if they maintain their quest right up to the quarterfinals.
The reigning world and European champions look resolute; they have demonstrated a lot of composure and have rarely left bystanders realise that they belong to the batch of 2000. Germany is yet to win the U-17 title, and has stood third twice and fourth once.
From the six announced teams to play in Goa only Brazil has won more than the Germans. Brazil has won the title twice; they were runners-up twice and finished fourth once.
Like India, Goa too is host to a tournament of this magnitude for the first time and talent is not bound by age restrictions. The good always finds a way of showing itself and this will be a bounty that will be left by all the matches to be played in the state.
Iran of Group C is not new to Goa. They won the U-16 AFC Cup on the same ground and will be looking to continue impressing with India playing in New Delhi. Iran played decently to be champions a year ago but the boys have grown skillfully and physically. Iran, like India, is showing a more intense relationship with the ball and they could well be the team that could start spilling beans of surprises in this edition of the World Cup. However, their surprises will not leave football fans aghast.
Costa Rica is full of South American tang in them. Filled with the spirit of living, the boys from Costa Rica have in practice shown that they have come prepared not just to be noticed during this World Cup but to make themselves marked in the eyes of the scouts coming from major football countries in the world. Four countries from South America have shared the limelight in 16 years of the World Cup. Costa Rica could be the fifth.
Guinea is the fourth team with the youngest player of the tournament in 15-year-old Sylla Ibrahima. A few players from Guinea do not have the height but that does not deter them from playing their game with the ball.
Football is not about passing and shooting. Or about scoring and saving. It is about how human emotions – and the best emotions – can be experienced through discipline.
If anything, this U-17 World Cup in Goa will leave our colts a lesson on discipline, best taught by the ball.
Coleman softball cruises to twinbill sweep
CARSON CITY — Coleman softball cruised to a pair of Mid-State Activities Conference victories at Carson City-Crystal on Tuesday.
The Comets won the first game 13-2 in five innings, before earning a 15-0 victory in three innings. Coleman is now 6-2 overall and 3-1 in the MSAC.
Jaden Berthume earned the complete-game victory in the first game, allowing three hits and striking out eight. Brianna Townsend, Makailyn Monson and Kenzie Miller all had two hits and two RBIs for the Comets. Faith Barden chipped in with a hit and two RBIs.
Barden threw a three-inning no-hitter in the nightcap, striking out six. Annabelle Bovee had a double, two walks and four RBIs to lead the Coleman offense, while Monson, Autumn Tubbs, Berthume and Miller each had two hits. Monson and Tubbs had two RBIs apiece, while Berthume and Miller each drove in one run.
“The girls came out swinging some good bats,” Coleman coach Chad Klopf said. “Jaden and Faith looked good in the circle. When that happens, things usually go well for us.”
The Comets return home for a doubleheader with Vestaburg on Thursday.
BioOx, a cutting-edge air cleaning system from Air & Water Solutions, was in operation for the Winter Junior Nationals at the University of Tennessee last week, where swimmers, coaches and parents praised the comfortable conditions and improved air quality. The system led to a reduction in coughing and sneezing, allowing competitors to lessen their use of inhalers and granting parents of asthmatic swimmers a peace of mind not commonly found at indoor swim meets. In the words of a swimmer from North Penn Aquatic Club, “the air quality at this meet has been awesome.”
The BioOx system is composed of several free-standing units placed around the edge of the pool deck. BioOx media, a patented solution comprised of organic enzymes, is added to each unit along with several gallons of water. The enzymes and water combine to form a solution that neutralizes harmful toxins in the surrounding air. Clean air is then expelled through an in-unit fan. This process creates a Clean Air Zone, which continues to expand the longer the units are in use and leaves behind crisp, breathable air.
At meets of this size, which feature hundreds of swimmers in the pool at the same time, natatoriums can quickly become the scene of coughing fits and unbreathable air. At the Junior Nationals, swimmers and coaches alike spoke of the pleasant conditions, which many declared better than the majority of facilities they've visited for competition. A coach from Y-SpartAquatics in South Carolina noted that “we are on the 2nd or 3rd day of the USA Junior Nationals and I can breathe. No sneezing, no eye problems. The barrels are amazing.” A North Penn Aquatic Club swimmer, who spoke of air quality at his home club so bad that a friend once got sent to the hospital, commented that despite having asthma, “it's really good here and I haven't had any problems.” A parent of a swimmer with asthma called the conditions at the Junior Nationals “far and above the best we've ever experienced.”
For swimmers who train outdoors, the conditions at indoor meets can be particularly difficult. A mother commented that the air quality at the indoor meets her daughter attends in Florida typically poses a problem, but said it's “been wonderful” at the Junior Nationals and “she hasn't had any breathing issues.” Another mother explained that her daughter has ended up with bronchitis by the end of the last few indoor meets she's attended due to poor air quality, noting that “the air quality has been great” at Tennessee.
Some attendees acknowledged that, while conditions were noticeably better, there is still room for improvement. A swimmer from Nashville Aquatic Club commented that “with this many swimmers it's hard to make it perfect, but it's definitely better.”
“We knew coming to a meet of this size was going to be a big challenge,” said Ken Schapiro, director of sales at Air & Water Solutions. “Our system has greatly improved the 24/7 air quality, here at UT and at facilities on the East Coast, but this is the first 1,000-plus swimmer meet we've worked. We're encouraged by the positive feedback we've received, and we look forward to fine-tuning both the quantity and layout of the units to successfully impact conditions not just on the deck but also in the stands for the next large meet we have the opportunity to be a part of.”
About Air & Water Solutions: At Air & Water Solutions, we're changing the way people think about the air they breathe. We're leaving a positive impact on the health of the Earth, and making it a safer, more enjoyable place for the people who live here.

Under Armour's Kevin Plank became the second CEO to announce Monday that he is leaving President Trump's Manufacturing Jobs Initiative committee in the wake of a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that turned violent and resulted in the death of a 32-year-old woman and injuries to at least 19 others.
Trump blamed "many sides" for the violence when he spoke Saturday, a stance that prompted even members of his own party to criticize him for his failure to explicitly cite and denounce white supremacists.
On Monday, he read a statement from a teleprompter that included specific references to the "KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups," saying that they "are repugnant to all that we hold dear as Americans."
His statement came after Kenneth Frazier from the pharmaceutical company Merck -- one of the most prominent African-American CEOs -- announced early Monday morning that he was resigning from the council. "As a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism," Frazier tweeted.
Trump responded by attacking him in two tweets, and Frazier stood alone among CEOs in his protest until Under Armour released Plank's statement Monday night.
"I love our country and our company and will continue to focus my efforts on inspiring every person that they can do anything through the power of sport which promotes unity, diversity and inclusion," Plank wrote.
I love our country & company. I am stepping down from the council to focus on inspiring & uniting through power of sport. - CEO Kevin Plank pic.twitter.com/8YvndJMjj1 — Under Armour (@UnderArmour) August 15, 2017
Plank had already faced heat from prominent celebrities with Under Armour endorsement deals, including Stephen Curry, Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson and ballet star Misty Copeland because of Trump. In February, shortly after joining the committee, Plank told CNBC that Trump was a "real asset for the country."
Curry responded by telling the Mercury News, "I agree with that description, if you remove the 'et' from asset."
Plank placed a full-page ad in the Baltimore Sun to explain himself. Part of the open letter said that during the CNBC interview, his "choice of words that did not accurately reflect my intent."
Under Armour's lineup of athletes includes some of the biggest names in sports: Tom Brady, Cam Newton, Michael Phelps, Clayton Kershaw, Bryce Harper, Julio Jones, Jordan Spieth, Lindsey Vonn, Buster Posey and Carey Price.
SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 6,400 pounds of supplies to the International Space Station including 20 live mice and some ice cream.
The rocket launched a Dragon capsule from Kennedy Space Center, on its way to the international Space Station. It catches up with the orbiting lab Wednesday.
On board – 20 live mice that will be used to study the effects of long-duration space flight. Florida State University researcher Michael Delp wants to solve some biological problems astronauts face in space. To do that, he's sending the group of mice to the station. For nearly a month, the mice will live in micro-gravity.
“The research is really geared to address several biomedical issues that face astronauts with long-duration space flight,” said Delp.
Also on board – ice cream. And not the freeze-dried stuff, either. NASA had extra freezer space on board, so it decided to send the six ISS astronauts vanilla, chocolate and birthday cake ice cream cups.
After lofting the Dragon into orbit, SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of the rocket back at Cape Canaveral.

This is SpaceX's 12th mission to the ISS. NASA pays private companies to ship supplies into orbit. The next launch, handled by another commercial partner Orbital ATK, is slated for later this year.

EDWARDSVILLE — Madison County is planning to raise the “woof” for animals this week.
Madison County Animal Control is partnering with Best Friends Animal Society, Metro East Humane Society and Partners for Pets from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday to host a microchip clinic and adoption day in the plaza between the Administration Building and Courthouse.
The microchip clinic will recognize National Pet ID Week, an annual nationwide event to educate owners on getting identification for their pets in case the animals become lost. The cost to microchip a pet will be $15. The cost to register a microchipped animal is free at Remember Found Animals, https://microchipregistry.foundanimals.org.
Two of the county's rescue groups were asked to participate in the adoption event, which will occur prior to the County Board meeting. The board will vote on a resolution “setting a goal to save healthy and adoptable dogs and cats in the possession of animal control by Dec. 31, 2021.”
The Public Safety Committee passed the resolution on April 10. The resolution states the county will work on a comprehensive plan in collaboration with individuals and organizations to include humane societies and rescue groups including Partners 4 Pets, Metro East Humane Society, Hope Rescue, Highland Animal Shelter, 4 Paws Sake, Spencer's Rescue, Gateway Pet Guardians and 5 A's to save adoptable dogs and cats.
County Board Chairman Kurt Prenzler said pet owners are passionate about their canines and felines and he knows partnering with rescue groups and organizations will help save the lives of hundreds of animals that are euthanized each year in Madison County.
“This is something I said I would do if elected chairman, and this is what county residents want as well,” Prenzler said.
Madison County records show more than 2,000 animals were received at animal control in 2016 and half were euthanized.
“Best Friends Animal Society supports public-private partnerships that can save the lives of dogs and cats,” Ledy VanKavage, a legislative attorney with Best Friends Animals Society, said.
VanKavage said as a lifelong resident of Madison County, she applauds County Board members and Prenzler for the commitment to improve the save rate for animals.
“Hundreds of cities and counties across the country are collaborating with nonprofits and now saving over 90 percent of the pets they bring in,” she said. “Madison County can do this, too. The microchip clinic, adoption event and the ‘no-kill' resolution is a great starting point to save lives and tax dollars.”
“Metro East Humane Society is pleased to be partnering with Madison County and Partners for Pets for the adoption event,” Anne Schmidt, executive director of MEHS, said. “Initiatives like Wednesday's event helps bring awareness and encourages the public to adopt from their local shelters.”
Erika Pratte, Partners for Pets project manager, said her organization is always working to re-home and reconcile unwanted animals in the Madison County area.
“We are ecstatic to be teaming up with Chairman Prenzler, Madison County and Metro East Humane Society to help make that dream come true,” Pratte said.
MEHS adoption rates for the event will be $125. Partners for Pets will take $25 off all its adoption fees during the event.
Prenzler said the county is making progress and knows going “no-kill” will take time.

Adam Schefter reports on what an NFL executive had to say about the Browns' interest in Baker Mayfield. (1:58)
Schefter: Mayfield definitely in running to be No. 1 pick (1:58)
Baker Mayfield "definitely" has been a part of the Cleveland Browns' considerations with the No. 1 draft pick, a league source told ESPN's Adam Schefter, and the former Oklahoma quarterback cannot be ruled out as a possibility for the top overall selection Thursday night.
The source said the Browns may have already decided whom they would select at No. 1. But before that final decision, whenever it was made, Mayfield was in that conversation.

The inclusion of Mayfield in the Browns' conversation adds murkiness to the top of the draft, where Cleveland owns picks Nos. 1 and 4.
Browns general manager John Dorsey didn't provide many hints on the team's draft strategy when he met with reporters last Thursday, saying that he expected at least four quarterbacks to be picked in the first round.
The Browns, coming off an 0-16 season, are expected to select a quarterback with one of their first two picks. ESPN's Mel Kiper projected Cleveland to select Wyoming quarterback Josh Allen at No. 1 in his most recent mock draft, with Mayfield going to the Miami Dolphins with the 11th overall pick.
USC's Sam Darnold also is widely viewed as a candidate for Cleveland with the first overall pick, and UCLA quarterback Josh Rosen has been projected ahead of Mayfield among draft-eligible quarterbacks.
Mayfield, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner, recently visited with the Browns. Dorsey referred to Mayfield as a "pleasant fella" during his Thursday news conference.
"The only thing I care about is, do guys win?" Dorsey said. "Does he have accuracy? Does he have a strong arm? Can he throw the ball in the red zone in tight windows? Can he drive the ball? At the end of the game, does he win? That's what I look for."
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.
A Virginia judge on Monday declined to set bail for James Alex Fields Jr., the 20-year-old Ohio man accused of second-degree murder and other charges after authorities said he plowed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters near the scene of a white supremacist rally that erupted into violence.
That means Fields, whom news reports have described as fascinated by Nazism, will remain jailed at least until he has an attorney.
The local public defenders' office informed the court it could not represent him because of a potential conflict of interest — someone in the office has a relative who was hurt during Saturday's violence in Charlottesville.
A local attorney will be appointed to represent Fields and could request bail before the next scheduled hearing, Aug. 25.
Fields, clad in a black-and-white striped uniform, appeared via video link for the hearing. He briefly responded to questions from Judge Robert Downer, replying “No, sir,” when asked if he had any ties to the Charlottesville community.
Saturday's car rampage killed 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who was among the crowd of counter-protesters responding to the rally by white nationalists and others who oppose a plan to remove from a Charlottesville park of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Fields was taken into custody soon afterward.
The hearing came soon after Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions said the attack met the legal standard for an act of domestic terrorism. Speaking on ABC's “Good Morning America,” the attorney general called the car rampage, which injured 19 other people, an “unequivocally and unacceptable evil attack.”
Sessions, who was to meet later Monday with President Trump, also defended the president against widespread criticism that he had not specifically condemned white supremacists in connection with Saturday's events, but instead blamed “many sides” for inciting the violence. Critics have called on the president to explicitly denounce the right-wing hate groups behind Saturday's march.
“He said that yesterday, his spokesman did,” the attorney general said in the ABC interview. He was referring to a White House statement, issued Sunday without a spokesperson's name attached to it, which maintained that Trump's previous comments had implicitly included condemnation of white supremacists and allied groups.
Other senior Republicans, including Vice President Mike Pence, on a trip to Latin America, have denounced by name various hate movements including white nationalists, neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan.

In 2013, the NDP had a 522 vote win (47.7 per cent to 43.3 per cent).
Incumbent NDP MLA Robin Austin is not seeking re-election, so the party loses the incumbent advantage. The BC Liberals landed a star candidate in Ellis Ross, former chief of the Haisla First Nations and a prominent aboriginal leader, who is known for his support of industries such as LNG. Always a close race, given the low population base/turnout.
In 2009, NDP incumbent Robin Austin won this riding over Liberal Donny Van Dyk by nearly 1,500 votes (51 per cent to 37 per cent).
History & Geography: The Skeena riding has been on the hustings since the 1924 election, often changing boundaries but generally containing the main cities between Prince Rupert and the Nechako area. The riding includes Terrace, Kitmat, and a number of smaller aboriginal communities. The NDP has won seven of the last 10 elections here, and while the Liberals tend to do well in Terrace, there are other areas of the riding where the NDP gets over 10 times the votes of other parties.
Candidates
BC Liberals – Ellis Ross: Former chief councilor of the Haisla Nation, first elected to Council in 2003. In 2012, Ross was appointed the inaugural Chair of the Aboriginal Business and Investment Council (by Christy Clark). A star First Nations candidate.
NDP – Bruce Bidgood: A researcher and instructor at UNBC, Bidgood is a former two-term Terrace City Councillor and served as chair of the Regional District of Kitimat-Stikine.

ISLAMABAD, Oct 6 (APP): Minister for National Food Security
and Research Sikandar Hayat Khan Bosan Friday apprised the National
Assembly that surplus stock of essential food items including wheat,
rice, sugar and maize, was available in the country.
Responding to various questions during Question Hour, he said
currently 5 million tons wheat, 4 million tons rice, 1.5 million
tons sugar and 2 million ton maize were in the stock.
He said there was no proposal under consideration to introduce
Ration Card system in the country as rationing was introduced
during shortage and price hike.
The Minister said the government used the channel of utility
stories corporation for supply of the essential food items to the
general public at the reasonable rates whenever required.
Regarding a supplementary question, he said Pakistan Agricultural
Storage and Services Corporation Ltd (PASSCO) procured over 100,000
tons wheat in Sindh and surplus stock was available in Sindh and Balochistan.
Regarding inquiry about appointments in PASSCO, the minister said
National Accountability Bureau was conducting inquiry in this regard.
Meanwhile, Minister for Housing and Works Akram Khan Durrani
said summary had been sent to the Prime Minister for eligibility
of constitutional bodies employees for government accommodation.
The case was being pursued vigorously, he added.
The structure of director Michael Winterbottom's trio of pseudo-travelogues – “The Trip,” “The Trip to Italy” and the latest, “The Trip to Spain,” ( which opened in theaters Aug. 11) – are always similar: U.K. comedian Steve Coogan and friend/fellow laugh-getter Rob Brydon traverse a specific region – ostensibly on assignment – eating at top restaurants, hanging out and bickering. With the pair playing loose versions of their real selves, the movies overflow with bracing improvised wit, celebrity impression contests and lots of midlife crisis moping. And even though Coogan and Brydon have little to say about the impeccably prepared food they're eating, cult followers of the films have been known to duplicate the pair's culinary journeys, matching them bite for bite.
That means whatever measure of gastronomic allure the “Trip” road pictures offer can be credited to the lush cinematography of director of photography James Clarke (whose U.K. resume is rife with cooking competition shows) and to Winterbottom, who assigned himself the enviable task of restaurant curator: Once the country of choice is selected, he compiles a list of the area's eating destinations, visits them multiple times, then begins figuring out which ones fit into his loose storyline. “It's fun, all that research,” says Winterbottom, who turns his “Trip” producers into mealtime companions. “I try not to go alone. That would be too depressing.”
Recently we tracked down Winterbottom in Puglia, Italy, to talk about the humor in Coogan and Brydon's food ambivalence, the absence of paella and what it was like to taste the best Spain has to offer, from the Michelin-starred Etxebarri's 15-course tasting menu to the sizzling gambas pil pil at El Refectorium in the southern port city of Málaga. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Besides Coogan referring to Etxebarri's fresh goat butter as “life affirming,” that's about it for restaurant criticism. Why is that?
The idea of doing “The Trip” had come from having various lunches with Steve and Rob, thinking they'd make an enjoyable location for a film. But I knew they weren't foodies, that they weren't going to be obsessed. I did think that given that they were going to all these great restaurants they might occasionally mention the food. But I realized quite soon that they wouldn't. I've given up trying to persuade them. There's something funny about Steve and Rob eating great food while all these people are slaving away in the kitchen and all they're interested in is talking about themselves and their careers.
Each of the “Trip” films first premiere in England as a multi-episode television series. Is it true that a dedicated foodist might find the TV version is a better fit?
In the episodic version there's more meal, there's more of everything. There's more time, so there's also more conversation, more journey. On the first film, the journey was actually quite short. It was going around the Lake District in England. Whereas on “The Trip to Spain,” they set off by ferry from London and drive their way all the way through to the Sahara desert.

As a director of narrative features like “24 Hour Party People” and “A Mighty Heart,” how long did it take to figure out an approach to lovingly composed glamour shots of food?
We don't have one to be honest. The whole idea of the filming is that we shoot it as simply as possible. We shoot the food in exactly the same way as we shoot Steve and Rob, the restaurant and the countryside. Obviously we're choosing restaurants with really great food. But we don't really try and make the food look good, we just try to capture the experience of what being in the restaurant and the experience of being at a lunch with Steve and Rob is like. So if the food looks good it's purely by virtue of the food, rather than the filming. If the food looks delicious it's because it is delicious.
Do you ever get pushback from your stars about your restaurant lineup?
Rob and Steve don't get any choices. But they don't mind. I just tell them where we're going – and they don't care.
The first restaurant they go to, Txoko, is in a storybook fishing village where just-caught anchovies are grilled over an open wood fire. What led you there?
Initially we were recommended Getaria by a couple of chefs in London. There's a Michelin-starred restaurant there that's really good but it didn't feel like the right place for filming. So we went down on the ports, and there was a whole string of restaurants. In the end, the one we chose was partly because the chef was really friendly and also it's a good location because it's close to the water.
The true no-brainer was Etxebarri, which was voted the sixth best restaurant in the world in 2015.
If you go to Spain, you should go to that restaurant. [The chef, Victor Arguinzoniz] does only one meal a day, a set menu. It's fantastic food. Apparently he used to be a carpenter, working in wood, then he started cooking. He has no formal training. In all the restaurants in Spain, they cook on wood on the street. But at Etxebarri, he has covered wood fired ovens and uses all different sorts of wood.
In this film you'll see Spanish classics like chorizo casero, jamón ibérico, and all manner of croquetas. Nowhere, however, is paella. Was that by choice?
It was a little bit of a choice. If Valencia was on our route in the end, maybe we would have included paella. But in England, the one cliché of Spanish [cuisine] would be paella. So it was quite nice to avoid it.
Talk about the scene where Steve meets a young traveling musician who airily opines that they're eating in all the wrong places.
I just liked the idea of making fun of Steve's pomposity. He's like an earlier version of Steve, just as annoying but better looking. We thought that'd be quite funny. But all those places that he mentions? There were lots of great restaurants that in the end we had to cross off because they just weren't on our route. So that was just our way of sneaking in references of places we didn't end up filming.
Will there be a fourth “Trip” installment?
When we did the first one we said, “There will be just one,” so who knows? I think enough time will have to go by so Steve and Rob will have grown and changed in some way. For me, I'd like it to be in Sweden or somewhere in the Arctic Circle. It would be funny to deposit them somewhere cold.
The federal government says that Canadians generally support its planned approach to the legalization of marijuana, including detailed proposals surrounding plain packaging and warning labels.

As part of a broader release of the results of its public consultations, Health Canada announced on Monday that all cannabis products sold to consumers will need to be child-resistant, with plain packaging that is a single, uniform colour and does not include any graphics or images.
“(The package) cannot be embossed, shiny or metallic,” according to the department. “The use of branding and logos will be restricted.”
WATCH: Expect marijuana legalization this summer, promises Trudeau
Labels, meanwhile, will need to include mandatory health warning messages to warn Canadians of the potential risks of cannabis use, a red “stop sign” symbol with a cannabis leaf and the letters THC, plus the product's THC and CBD content, “so that consumers can make informed choices.”
The government has provided over a dozen options for warnings, including that “regular use of cannabis can increase the risk of psychosis and schizophrenia” and “adolescents are at greater risk of harms from cannabis.”
Government officials said on Monday that the messages were crafted after an “exhaustive review of the available scientific evidence.”
“These measures are consistent with the government's public health approach to cannabis and the recommendations of the federal Task Force on Cannabis Legalization and Regulation,” Health Canada said.
“They are in addition to the restrictions set out in the proposed Cannabis Act, namely that packaging and labelling must not appeal to youth, not contain lifestyle elements, present testimonials or endorsements, nor communicate false statements.”
READ MORE: Canadians pay $6.83 on average for a gram of marijuana
The department launched a 60-day public consultation last fall on its proposed approach to developing regulations under the proposed Cannabis Act. It says it received 3,218 responses to the online survey and 450 written responses. Just under 200 “interested parties” participated in roundtables and 343 more participated in webinars.
Canadians, in general, “supported the proposed approach to the regulation of cannabis,” Health Canada said Monday.
The report does outline specific areas in which there were varied responses, however. For example, there was some pushback on plain packaging, and “mixed views” on the proposed concentration limit of 30 milligrams of THC per millilitre of cannabis oil, with some feeling it was too low.
Licenses and edibles
Monday's report also provides new details about micro-cultivation licenses, for growing marijuana commercially
or for processing it into a final product for sale. Micro-growers (producing cannabis for sale) would need a micro-cultivation licence that would authorize the cultivation of a plant “canopy area” not greater than 200 square metres.
A micro-processing licence “would authorize the processing of no more than 600 kilograms of dried cannabis (or equivalent) per year, or the entire output of a single micro-cultivation licence.”
Cannabis concentrates and edibles (products that can be consumed that contain marijuana) are also touched upon. The government heard feedback that suggested that these products be made legal this summer, along with other cannabis products. But Health Canada seems to have discounted this idea.
“Necessary regulations addressing edibles containing cannabis and cannabis concentrates will be put in place within one year following the coming into force of the proposed Cannabis Act, if it is passed by Parliament,” the government noted.
More to come.

My friend and mentor, John Maxwell, has written and spoken about being mentored by the great coach John Wooden, among others.
Hearing this, a pastor asked me these questions: “How does one go about getting the greatest NCAA coach as a mentor? Did he (Maxwell) just ask for regular meetings, and what does mentorship look like?”
Good questions.
I will admit that getting John Wooden as a coach is an extraordinary circumstance involving an extraordinary leader. But on the other hand, John Maxwell didn't start there. It was only after nearly 30 years of successful leadership that John was able to connect with Coach Wooden.
It was John's desire to grow and his great passion to add value to people's lives that made the difference. The fact that John is a tremendous student is also a very significant part of the story.
Over the years I've wondered which is more important—to have a great mentor or to be a great student? The easy answer is both. But more and more, I think the secret is in being a great student.
You can have the most brilliant mentor in the world, even a famous one, but if you aren't ready to pay the price, dig in, learn and change, it won't matter.
There are many stories of men and women who received an hour or so of someone's time but arrived ill-prepared. They had no written questions. They talked more than they listened and expressed very little gratitude. It was almost as if they had some time to kill and thought it might be fun. So when someone does say yes, show up prepared.
And, if you want a meaningful mentoring relationship, let me offer more good advice.
1. Be good at something.
This might sound strange, but you need to be good at something before you ask someone to help you be great at something.
You can be good at anything! What it is doesn't matter. You may want to be a great leader, and your only claim to fame is that you are good at golf or giving a talk. Maybe you are brilliant at math or are a techy genius type.
Here's the point, if you are good at something, you have shown the passion and discipline to create the needed potential to become great at what you really want.
2. Seek someone just a little ahead of you.
A common mistake is to think: “If I'm going for a mentor, I'm going right to the top and get the best.” I appreciate that you think big, but you are likely making a mistake.
For example, if a pastor who serves in a church of 500 seeks a mentor who pastors a church of 7,000, the two of them live in two different worlds, and they barely speak the same language.
Yes, the leadership principles are the same. But you are much better off being mentored by someone who understands where you are, and their current reality is closer to yours.
If you lead a church of 200, try to get a mentor who leads a church of 400 to 800. This is not a legalistic thing. Don't get hung up on the numbers; just go with the idea.
Make the ask. If the person says they are not able, don't get upset or discouraged. Ask God to lead you to another person.
3. Think intentionally organic.
Don't ask for lots of regularly scheduled meetings. You will likely lose a potential mentor that way. I recommend that you don't ask for monthly or even quarterly connects. Go for a more intentionally organic approach.
Here's what I mean. If you can hang with a couple of meetings a year, over phone or in person, plus a few short emails, you might be surprised by how quickly you get a yes. “Intentionally” refers to staying strategic and on purpose, and the “organic” simply means to catch the meetings when it works out naturally for both your schedules.
You don't need many meetings, not if you really want to change and grow.
If you connect with a mentor two or three times in a year, that is plenty. It will take you at least that much time between conversations to really put into practice what was given to you. Do the math: if you have two mentors, you can see that would be four to six connects a year. You can't absorb and practice more than that.
Note: When it's a boss/employee relationship, of course, you will meet much more often, but much of that will be about doing ministry. In fact, if you are “mentoring” weekly, you are probably doing something closer to a counseling relationship than coaching or mentoring.
Also, if an employee is struggling with competence, you should meet more often, but that would be more skill coaching than mentoring.
Coaching and mentoring have overlapping characteristics, but I define the primary difference as:
Coaching deals with day-to-day skills and practices.
Mentoring deals with lifelong wisdom and principles.
4. Work harder than your mentor.
Invest your time and your mentor's time well. Show up with well-thought and relevant questions. Take notes. Work hard to practice what was discussed, and the next time you talk, tell him or her what you have done.
A good mentor will always have some questions, a resource or two and good advice, but the mentoring is more your job than his/hers.
You set the agenda and come with it in writing. If your mentor asks you to do something, make the necessary adjustments, but do it.
This does not prevent a respectful disagreement within honest conversations, but overall, you either want their advice, or you don't. If you don't, that's OK. But if that becomes a pattern, perhaps you should say thanks and bring closure to the mentoring relationship.
I've been blessed with five mentors over the course of my life, and I'm grateful! I'm sure that's part of the reason I'm eager to pass on as much as I can. I trust that you will also pass on what is given to you.

A New York judge set a June 15 deadline Wednesday for lawyers for President Donald Trump's personal lawyer and Trump to make attorney-client privilege claims over data seized in April raids, saying it was important not to delay the criminal investigation.
U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood said a special taint team of prosecutors will make determinations after that date.
Wood presided over a hearing at which a prosecutor revealed that the contents of a shredder and two Blackberry devices were all that remained to be turned over to a court-appointed special master screening evidence for attorney-client privilege. Also reviewing the materials are lawyers for Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, the president and the Trump Organization.
Cohen's lawyers asked to be allowed to review materials from the April 9 raids of Cohen's office and home until mid-July, but Wood said she had to balance their needs to protect their client with the need of prosecutors to pursue their criminal fraud case against Cohen.
Cohen did not speak during the court proceeding, which lasted more than an hour and featured a colorful argument between lawyers for Cohen and Trump on one side and California attorney Michael Avenatti on the other as they discussed Avenatti's public statements on behalf of his porn-star client, Stormy Daniels.
Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said she had sex once with Trump in 2006. Trump denies it. Daniels was not in court Wednesday.
Stephen Ryan, an attorney for Cohen, argued that Avenatti had acted outrageously by releasing banking information related to Cohen publicly and by criticizing Cohen in dozens of television appearances.
Wood noted that Avenatti would have to stop making comments about his perception of what he believed was wrongdoing by Cohen if he wanted to formally intervene in Cohen's efforts to protect materials seized from violations of attorney-client privilege.
Cohen's lawyers said they had finished studying about a third of the materials that were seized and were working around the clock.
Special Master Barbara Jones said in a letter Tuesday that lawyers Cohen, Trump and the Trump Organization have designated more than 250 items as subject to the privilege. She said the material includes data from a video recorder.
Jones said more than a million pieces of data from three of Cohen's phones are ready to be given to criminal prosecutors, and more than 12,000 pages of documents from eight boxes that survived attorney-client privilege scrutiny already have been given back to prosecutors. More than a dozen electronic devices were seized or copied in the raids, and Jones said she has not yet received data from three seized items.
The raids on Cohen were triggered in part by a referral from special counsel Robert Mueller, who separately is looking into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Wood became involved after Cohen came to court, complaining that he feared attorney-client privilege would not be protected. Trump also expressed those concerns on Twitter.
Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said she had sex once with Trump in 2006. Trump denies the affair.

Just three days before nomination ballots for the Golden Globes were due, Sony Pictures screened a rough cut of “All the Money In the World” for the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn.
One week later, the kidnapping thriller earned three nominations: Ridley Scott for best director, Michelle Williams for actress in a drama film and Christopher Plummer for supporting actor. The latter nod was particularly surprising, given that the 87-year-old was only cast in the film in November.
That's right — Plummer was cast in, shot and earned a nomination for “All the Money In the World” basically in the span of a month.
The whirlwind began on Oct. 29, when Kevin Spacey — who had already wrapped his role in Scott's movie as oil tycoon J. Paul Getty — was first accused of sexual harassment by actor Anthony Rapp. Spacey apologized for the behavior and entered treatment, but more than a half dozen others then came forward with their own misconduct allegations against the actor.
He was fired from his Netflix show, “House of Cards” — which, in 2015, brought Spacey his only Golden Globe victory to date — and on Nov. 8, Scott announced he was taking unprecedented action with his film: The director said he would cut Spacey from the movie and replace him with Plummer. Reshoots, the filmmaker said, would begin immediately, and he intended to make his initial release date of Dec. 22.
"There are over 800 other actors, writers, artists, craftspeople and crew who worked tirelessly and ethically on this film, some for years, including one of cinema's master directors,” the film's U.S. distributor, Sony, said at the time. “It would be a gross injustice to punish all of them for the wrongdoings of one supporting actor in the film.”
For the most part, Scott has remained true to his word. After completing reshoots on Nov. 30 — and editing on-the-fly — the movie is still on target to be released at the end of the month, shifting a mere three days to Dec. 25.

“Despite the unexpected challenges we encountered after shooting was completed, we were determined that audiences around the world would be able to see our film,” Scott said in a statement following Monday's nominations. “So the fact that we have received these wonderful acknowledgments this morning is especially gratifying.”
The film, based on the 1973 kidnapping of John Paul Getty III — a grandson of Plummer's character — will screen for the press later this week. How it will fare during the rest of award season remains to be seen, but don't expect to see it on the list when SAG Award nominations are announced this Wednesday — the film did not screen in time for that guild's voting deadline.
The Spacey-Plummer casting drama is the most high-profile example of how the numerous sexual harassment revelations that have rocked Hollywood this fall are impacting awards season.
“Transparent,” the critically-beloved Amazon show starring Jeffrey Tambor as a transgender parent, was not recognized by the HFPA in any category for the first time since it debuted in 2014. Tambor, who won a Golden Globe for his role in 2015, was last month accused of inappropriate behavior by his former assistant. Though he denied the allegations, the actor said he didn't “see how [he could] return to ‘Transparent'” given “the politicized atmosphere” on set.
Dustin Hoffman, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women over the last few months, also did not receive a nomination Monday. The actor, who had earned early praise for his turn in Noah Baumbach's “The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected),” was grilled about the allegations by HBO host John Oliver in New York during a public Q&A last week.

Also missing from the Globes crop? “Wind River,” a murder-mystery set on a Native American reservation. The film, which stars Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, was beloved by many critics but was initially released by the Weinstein Co. in August. After the controversy involving the company's then-chief executive broke, TWC's name and logo were removed from the film and an awards campaign funded by some of the film's producers was launched to emphasize a separation of any link with Weinstein.
Meanwhile, Geoffrey Rush — who appears as Albert Einstein in National Geographic's limited series “Genius” — scored a nomination after being accused of “inappropriate behavior” during an Australian stage production “King Lear.” Rush is suing Australia's The Daily Telegraph over the allegations, though he did resign as president of Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts.
“This is good news for Albert Einstein. I believe in science,” Rush said in a statement Monday. “I also believe in the complexity of humankind. I am honoured to be in the company of fellow nominees who, with their artistry, have strived to define the multiplicity of dimensions in the male experience.”

Syphilis, though treatable with antibiotics, continues to be a big issue around the world because of its highly infectious nature to transfer into multiple bodies, cause harm or even death.
So researchers at the University of Victoria have patented a protein that could one day be a trump card against the sexually transmitted disease.
In 2016, the B.C. Centre for Disease Control released a statement that said it saw 755 reports for syphilis, the highest rate in 30 years.
READ MORE: Why STI rates are steadily going up in Canada
“It's a pathogen that can pass from the bloodstream into the brain, and from a pregnant woman to her fetus,” Caroline Cameron, professor of microbiology at the University of Victoria, said.
WATCH: Metro Vancouver health officials warn of syphilis outbreak
Cameron, who is also one of the researchers for the vaccine, patented the protein so it could be protected.
“The first step is to obviously really understand the function of the protein. If you understand how the protein contributes to the infection, you can have a better idea whether it's actually going to work as a vaccine,” Cameron said.

She said the disease interacts with the infected body by mimicking the person's cells.
“It's called a stealth pathogen,” Cameron said. “It has a good mechanism for looking like the host, looking like what the cells in the body already look like or components of those cells.”
Finding the protein is a good start she says, but finding a vaccine is still quite a ways down the road.
A couple is safe after their car exploded while leaving the Central Florida Fairgrounds.
It happened over the weekend in Orlando, Florida. Officials say the two were wrapping up a BBQ when they packed up their gas grill inside of their red Kia.
But, the grill was still attached to a propane tank.
Authorities say when the woman lit a cigarette, the tank exploded, causing the windows to shatter. The driver veered off the road and hit a pole.
Emergency crews transported the two to a medical center where they were treated for burns.
British police said Wednesday that two people are in a critical condition in a Salisbury hospital after being exposed to an "unknown substance" not far from where former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned.
Police said they considered the situation a “major incident.”
The two patients “are both currently receiving treatment for suspected exposure to an unknown substance at Salisbury District Hospital,” Wiltshire police said.
“They are both in a critical condition”.
The two people, a man and a woman both in their 40s, were discovered unconscious on Saturday June 30 at a house in the village of Amesbury, which is around 12 kilometres (eight miles) from Salisbury.
Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found slumped on a bench in the city in southwestern England where the former double agent lived in March, sparking a bitter diplomatic crisis between Moscow and London, which says a Soviet-made nerve agent dubbed novichok was used on the pair.
Wiltshire police said they initially suspected that the two people had fallen ill after using “possibly heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs.”
“However, further testing is now ongoing to establish the substance which led to these patients becoming ill and we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding this incident,” they said.
Security cordons have been set up around the areas where the two people went before they fell ill, police said, and security has been boosted in both Amesbury and Salisbury.
A Public Health England (PHE) spokesman said “it is not believed that there is a significant health risk to the wider public.”
“This will be continually assessed as further information becomes known,” they said in a statement.
The hospital said it remained “open as usual” and advised people to attend routine appointments unless contacted to do otherwise.
Wiltshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Angus Macpherson said the police had worked hard at “containing any risk that might be there”, the BBC reported.
Macpherson said there was “no reason to think it's connected” to the Skripal case.
Skripal, 67, and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia, who was visiting from Moscow, collapsed on March 4 in Salisbury. They were treated for an extended period of time before being released from Salisbury hospital.
A police officer who came to their aid, Nick Bailey, was also treated in hospital.
Russia has rejected British accusations of involvement in the Skripal poisoning, which sparked a diplomatic crisis that saw Russia and the West expelling dozens of diplomats in tit-for-tat moves. DM
Doerries Yachts' Mystique Concept Challenges Everything
The New York-based Gill Schmid Design is back in our attention with a new incredible yacht concept, a 75 m (246 ft) ICE-class expedition vessel called Mystique, that's apparently going to be built by Doerries Yachts in Germany. It will be completed in about three years, and when it's ready this bold and powerful explorer yacht aims to conquer the entire world.
There are a number of unique features on board, such as the enclosed helicopter hangar and an Ocean Farm, where solar panels support sustainable fish tanks and hydroponic growing facilities for true self-sufficiency while on board. There's also a food lab, where your own chef could experiment and come up with delicious recipes that will have you begging for more. But what's so mysterious about this vessel?
Well, I guess the first look at this stunning yacht concept won't have you thinking about so many unique features. For instance, there is also a helipad that can be used as a basketball court or dance floor, as well as a large beach club, with a submersible pool that doubles as a place to store tenders and water toys.
The layout accommodates up to 14 guests across seven suites, with a crew of 25 prepared to offer a smooth and enjoyable trip. Other features that are rather unusual for an explorer yacht are the gym and spa, the sundeck Jacuzzi and a lovely aft deck pool, as well as several alfresco lounges and dining areas. Judging by these renderings, reaching the farthest corners of the world will be beyond special.

It's been nearly three weeks since 2,800 unionized workers hit the picket lines at General Motors' CAMI Automotive plant in Ingersoll, Ont.
A solidarity rally is being held today at the plant as talks continue between Unifor and GM. The union is expecting thousands of people to show up to show their support for striking workers at the facility who are entering Day 19 of their strike.
The major issues in the dispute are wages, benefits and job security.
READ MORE: CAMI strike impacts London parts supplier
Unifor wants GM to make assurances about CAMI's future, calling on the automaker to make the plant a lead producer of the Chevy Equinox.
Union spokesman Mike Van Boekel told AM980 they had a good week of negotiations, but they're still stuck on some big issues, specifically job security.
“[We're] still optimistic … we're waiting for a letter from them [GM] and we'll sit out there until we get one but right now it's in their hands we're just waiting for that letter to show up,” Van Boekel said.
CAMI used to produce the GMC Terrain, but the company moved the production line to Mexico earlier this year resulting in hundreds of layoffs.
The two sides have agreed to break for the Thanksgiving long weekend and will pick up discussions again on Tuesday.

Today's rally is set to run from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian security forces were warned about the presence of Boko Haram fighters near the town of Dapchi, but failed to respond, allowing insurgents to kidnap 110 schoolgirls almost unharrassed, Amnesty International said on Tuesday.

The kidnapping on Feb. 19 of the girls from Dapchi, aged between 11-19, had echoes of the Islamist insurgency's abduction in 2014 of 276 students from the town of Chibok, which shot Nigeria's conflict with Boko Haram, now nine years old, into the global spotlight. [nL8N1QJ5HG]
It threatens to be a thorn in the side of President Muhammadu Buhari, whose 2015 electoral victory was built on criticism of his predecessor's failure to protect Nigerians, particularly in the wake of Chibok, and his promises to defeat Boko Haram.
“The Nigerian authorities have failed in their duty to protect civilians, just as they did in Chibok four years ago,” said Osai Ojigho, Amnesty's Nigeria director, in Tuesday's report.
“Despite being repeatedly told that Boko Haram fighters were heading to Dapchi, it appears that the police and military did nothing to avert the abduction,” she said.
A military spokesman denied that they had been warned of Boko Haram presence in the region, saying: “There was nothing like that.” He said if Amnesty had important information, the watchdog should notify a presidential panel set up in the wake of Dapchi to investigate the incident.

Amnesty alleged that the Nigerian army and police received at least five phone calls warning that Boko Haram was on the way to Dapchi as early as four hours before the attack, but did not take “effective measures” to halt the militants or rescue the girls once they had been taken.
“The military withdrew troops from the area in January, meaning the closest personnel were based one hour's drive from Dapchi,” the report said.

One month after the abductions, there has been little sign of the fate of the 110 schoolgirls.
Neither their parents nor Nigerian authorities have publicly acknowledged receiving any proof of life, the students have not appeared in any media issued by the kidnappers, nor has there been a public ransom demand.
“The Nigerian authorities must investigate the inexcusable security lapses that allowed this abduction to take place without any tangible attempt to prevent it,” said Ojigho in the report.
Nigeria's Buhari said last week he had ordered all military and security agencies to search for them, vowing that the government would not rest until the last girl kidnapped by insurgents has been released. [nL8N1QW59L]
Buhari has also said he plans to negotiate for their release - a sign that the military may not be able to successfully rescue them. [nL8N1QU5XX]

Coopers at a North Yorkshire brewery are creating plenty of “pin-terest” with their mini Christmas casks.
T&R Theakston Ltd's brewery craft cooper, Jonathan Manby, and his apprentice, Euan Findlay, have been spending the last few weeks of the year making traditional wooden “pins”, which will be filled with the world-renowned Theakston's Old Peculier ale.
Each pin holds 4.5 gallons or 36 pints, and are made by hand using the traditional tools of the trade, namely seasoned oak, iron hoops and flames.
T&R Theakston Ltd Executive Director Simon Theakston said: For many real ale lovers our Christmas pins are a festive tradition as important as roast turkey, Christmas pudding and mince pies. For the last few weeks, Jonathan and Euan have been spending each and every day in the cooperage making our Christmas pins, the traditional way. In the next week, these pins will be filled with our Old Peculiar, ready for the customers who have ordered them. There is always plenty of ‘pin-terest' in our Christmas pins, and this year is no exception.

We're just around the corner from your weekend and while there will be chances for a beneficial rain for a lot of Mid-Michigan, it won't be a complete washout. There's plenty to talk about, and we break that down in your forecast below!
Today & Tonight
As we've gone through the morning commute, outside of the I-69 corridor, the passing showers from overnight have started to wind down across Mid-Michigan. A few showers will still linger near the I-69 corridor, but that area of showers has remained on the lighter side, which is great news for the commute.
After the early morning showers, we will have a fairly dry period to the lunch hour and into the early afternoon. Skies are expected to be largely mostly cloudy through the day, which will keep our temperatures in the 60s in most areas this afternoon.
Eventually, scattered chances for rain return as the afternoon goes on, even more so into the evening hours. While there's no guarantee your Friday Night Lights game tonight, have the umbrella handy just to be on the safe side. This is especially true the farther southwest you are.
Showers become widespread during the late evening and overnight period and last through early Saturday morning. No severe weather is expected, but a few thunderstorms will be possible with some pockets of moderate to heavy rainfall.
With plenty of clouds around, overnight low temperatures will manage to stay in the 50s and 60s tonight.
Saturday
Saturday is the day that requires the most explanation through your weekend. Just like you'll likely have things going on, the weather of the day will a lot going on as well.
Let's start with the morning. We'll have the round of rain moving through from Friday night into the early morning hours before eventually things quiet down for the later morning into the early afternoon after the warm front passes through.
It's not unreasonable that some locations may even sneak in some sun during this time. Temperatures will also jump well into the 70s with some areas even reaching into the 80s.
Lost in the talk about rain will be the gusty winds that will come along with this storm system especially during Saturday afternoon and evening. Winds will be sustained out of the southwest around 15 to 25 miles per hour with gusts in the 35-40 mph range. Wind advisories may not be out of the question.
As we get closer to the evening, that's when we'll need to keep an eye on a cold front passing through the region. This cold front will bring more showers and thunderstorms, moving in a line west to east across Mid-Michigan.
We aren't expecting severe weather, but not only will we have gusty winds at the surface, we have even stronger winds above our heads. If thunderstorms develop, some of those winds may be brought down to the surface, so we'll need to watch the line closely as they may have some strong wind with them.
For the Michigan tailgating activities, we should be able to squeeze in plenty of dry time. As game time nears, shower and thunderstorm chances will be increasing. We may start the game dry for tomorrow, but be prepared for rain at some point during the game.
Once the rain moves out Saturday night, expect clearing skies toward Sunday morning, with overnight lows falling into the 50s.
Rainfall totals when all is said and done should fall between .50" to 1" across most of the TV5 viewing area.
Sunday
Sunday will be far and away the best day of the weekend as skies will be fairly clear and feature plenty of sun from morning until evening. Humidity values will remain low and we should have no trouble warming up into the middle and upper 70s for afternoon highs.
Plans outdoors Sunday? Headed to the cider mill or pumpkin patch? You're picture perfect for Sunday!
Skies will stay clear through the evening hours, with a comfortable night of sleeping ahead. Lows will bottom out in the upper 40s and low 50s heading into Monday morning.

The light rail vehicles which will be part of the ION transit system are currently under investigation to see if there are defects similar to the ones found on TTC streetcars, according to a statement from Waterloo Region.
On Tuesday, the TTC announced that 67 of the 89 streetcars which had been produced by Bombardier needed to be sent back for preventative repairs of “inferior frame welds.”
READ MORE: Bombardier's newly built TTC streetcars already being sent back for repairs
The TTC was made aware of the issue in the fall of 2017 and a plan was developed which would see the streetcars repaired in small batches over the next few years.
In the statement, the region said it was aware of the impending repairs to the TTC streetcars.

“The Region of Waterloo is aware that some of the TTC's streetcars require corrective work,” the statement read. “At this point, Bombardier is examining the Region's light rail vehicles to determine if a similar issue is present on our vehicles.”
The region ordered 14 cars from Bombardier in 2013. The vehicles were to originally arrive by the end of 2016, with service scheduled to begin in fall of 2017. Delays have pushed back the start date until December 2018.

“We remain focused on ensuring that service will begin in December 2018, and on providing a quality and safe service to our passengers in Waterloo Region,” the statement noted.
The first stage of the Ontario region's transit plans include a 19 km route between Conestoga Mall in Waterloo and Fairview Park Mall in Kitchener, with a rapid bus system to Cambridge.

Many Patriots reported for the team's voluntary OTAs, which continued Wednesday after players got the long weekend off.
Bill Belichick doesn't hesitate to include sports stars, TV stars and coaches from every sport in the Patriots' practices. In last week's OTA session, Belichick invited a handful of college football coaches to observe practice. He has also invited Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens with regularity. Even Donald Trump was known to hang around Gillette Stadium before becoming a politician.
It will be interesting to hear if Bryant spoke to the team.

The Iron managed to grind out a 1-0 victory over Walsall on Saturday, against a Saddlers side that had looked to come and settle for a point.
The fact that sides now come to Glanford Park looking to stifle the Iron says a lot for how far they have come in the last two seasons.
It perhaps explains to a certain point why the Iron have struggled in front of their own fans this season but it says a lot that the club is not thought of ‘little old Scunthorpe' any more but are a respected side that have challenged at the top of League One for the last two seasons.
Scunthorpe is likely to face another stiff test against MK Dons on Saturday, who could be on the brink of relegation by the time United visit Stadium:MK.
“We have earned the respect of everybody in this league and those that have left it over the last 18 months,” Daws told the Telegraph.
“Everybody would prefer that the points would come in a nicer fashion than they did on Saturday but it is the end of the season, pitches are a bit bobbly and you have teams fighting for their lives.
“But I am confident we have got a foundation in place to carry on and win in whichever way we feel fit.
“Myself and Andy have been tasked with trying to turn the results around and we have done that so far.
“There are three games to go, the next one is the most important and we will have to be at our best again to beat MK Dons.”
Daws and Andy Dawson remain unbeaten and have taken eight points from their four games in charge so far.
Another nine points from their next three games will guarantee them a place in the top six and that is what Daws are aiming for.
“We had points taken off us at Oxford, had to grind one out at Wimbledon, were outstanding last week, and we had to dig in on Saturday, so I am happy overall,” Daws said.
“As long as the points keep coming, however they come, we will still be aiming for maximum points that will guarantee us a play-off place.”

A Federal High Court sitting in Osogbo has granted an order of mandamus to compel the National Assembly to begin impeachment process against President Muhammadu Buhari, based on some alleged constitutional breaches.
Justice Maureen Onyetenu gave the ex parte order on Wednesday, following a motion filed before her by the Chairman, Nigeria Bar Association, Ilesa branch, Mr. Kanmi Ajibola; and a human rights activist, Mr. Suleiman Adeniyi.
The activists had, about three months ago, written to the Senate and the House of Representatives to begin impeachment process against the President, based on the continuous killings and spending without lawmakers' approval.
However, the duo approached the court seeking an order to compel the National Assembly to begin the process following their refusal to impeach Buhari based on the activists' letters.
They alleged that the President did not possess a certificate to be qualified as a President and should be impeached based on this and other alleged impeachable offences.
The judge, in her ruling, granted the leave to compel the National Assembly to commence impeachment process against the President.
DOHA - Qatar and the Philippines have signed trade agreements worth $200 million during the final leg of President Rodrigo Duterte's Gulf tour, Manila's trade and industry secretary told reporters in Doha.
Ramon Lopez said 6,000 jobs would be created in the Philippines as a result of the 13 agreements signed between private companies at the weekend, which covered areas such as health, defence and tourism. "The private firms in Qatar have shown great interest in various projects (in the) Philippines," Lopez told the Qatar Tribune newspaper. "There are many more opportunities where they can invest."
His comments came as Duterte prepared to meet senior government officials in Doha on Sunday, and less than 24 hours after the controversial former mayor addressed an adoring crowd of almost 7,000 supporters in Qatar. Duterte thrilled a sell-out audience by reiterating his uncompromising policy pledges on drugs -- which has gained him popularity at home and notoriety in the West -- and warned those in the drug trade not to test him.
During an hour-long speech, Duterte spoke also about his pledges on clamping down on corruption and sang a duet with a local Filipino singer, Hanna Uddin. Some 240,000 Filipinos live in Qatar, and a large majority voted for the president in last year's election.
Despite criticism of the way some Filipino workers are treated in the Gulf, Duterte said earlier on his visit that expats managed to send home more than $7 billion (6.6 billion euros) in remittances in 2016. The president returns home on Sunday after also visiting Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.
Nothing makes an iMore writer feel more stylish than a sweet Apple Watch band.
The Apple Watch is more than just an accessory. It's a way to keep you connected to the real world while also helping you keep from missing important notifications. Just the same, you need to accessorize it like you would any watch. The iMore team loves to show off our Apple Watches with our favorite bands.
Serenity: Tahoe Blue Woven Nylon Band
I could wax poetic about Apple's Woven Nylon band series all day — and I likely have, if you string together my multiple reviews of the bands on iMore. They're lightweight, absorb sweat without staining or feeling gross on the skin, and Apple offers them in a variety of multicolored options. While I'm currently rocking the company's Pride woven nylon band, I have a soft spot in my heart for the Tahoe Blue look: It's a tri-blue band that goes well with just about anything, and it's named after one of my favorite lakes in the High Sierras.

Cella: Hermès Double Buckle Cuff
I'm not normally someone who rocks an Apple Watch, but the minute I laid my eyes on the Hermès Double Buckle Cuff, it was love at first sight!
The band is so beautifully designed and the rich brown leather makes it the perfect casual or going-out accessory. Plus Hermès has been one of my favorite luxury brands for years alongside Louis Vuitton and Chanel, so seeing such a high-end band — with such a different design — available for the Apple Watch was super exciting.
I hope that more high-end designer brands come out with bands for the Apple Watch in the future (give me that classic LV pattern, bay-bee!)
See at Hermès
Joe: Midnight Blue Classic Buckle
Being a fan of more muted colors when it comes to the things that I wear, Apple's Midnight Blue accessories have been some of my favorites. I also love the feel of the leather band more than the Sport or Woven Nylon bands that I own, and it's easy to wear all day. The leather band also helps the Apple Watch feel more like a classic watch than a device you strap to your wrist — at least to me.

Lory: Catalyst Case for Apple Watch
Catalyst makes fantastic waterproof cases for Apple products and the Apple Watch gets the protection treatment, too. It's made with a polycarbonate casing with a silicone waterproof seal that covers the back and sides of the actual Apple Watch but makes it possible for you to continue using your heart rate monitor. The case wrap seals around the screen, leaving it exposed so you can perform touch functions uninhibited. The band is made from silicone, so it's significantly less bulky than other rugged Apple Watch bands (though, it is still bulky). I know you're thinking, "But the Series 2 Apple Watch is already swim-proof," and you're right. But the Catalyst makes it waterproof up to 330 feet, so you can actually take it scuba diving.
The Catalyst for Series 0 and 1 is only available for the 42mm Apple Watch. The Catalyst for Series 2 is available for both the 38 and 42mm Apple Watch. It costs $60 and comes in a variety of colors, depending on the size and series you buy, including my personal favorite: glow-in-the-dark (which is $70).

Mikah: Black Woven Nylon
I have the Space Gray Apple Watch and I absolutely love it, but it tends to limit the number of Apple Watch bands that I personally feel look good with the graphite case color. There are days when I'm OK with going against my better (read: minimalist) judgment by slapping on a wildly colored band, but I stick to the darker, simpler colors for the most part.
That's why I love the Black Woven Nylon band. It's the perfect blend of black and silvery-gray and it perfectly compliments the look of my Space Gray Watch. I've also always loved nylon bands — they're breathable, non-irritating on the wrist, easy to clean, and less rigid than leather (at least when it comes to a brand new leather band). The Black Woven Nylon band is my default Apple Watch band. It's the one I wear almost always, with other bands filling specific roles based on my activities. If you're looking for a simple, understated, comfortable band for your Apple Watch that's (IMHO) better than the Sport band that comes with the Space Gray Apple Watch, this is the band for you!

Luke: Anthracite/Black Nike Sport Band
I tend not to wear my Apple Watch every day, but I always wear it when I workout. Three times a week I hit the gym, and after about 20 or 30 minutes of strength exercises, I hit the treadmill, bike, elliptical, or the track and I blast through a good 30 to 40 minutes of cardio. This means I sweat, a lot!
In my opinion, the Anthracite/Black Nike Sport Band is just a bit better than the classic sport band that Apple offers when dealing with sweat. The air holes help keep the skin under the watch band much drier and I haven't experienced any discomfort when I'm in the middle of a long run.

Mike T: Midnight Blue Sport Band
I don't wear an Apple Watch, but I had one for a short time and it came with the Midnight Blue Sport Band. I'm a simple man and I like things done simply. That's the beauty of the Sport Band. It's durable enough to last as long as you need and the deep blue color pairs very well with any color Apple Watch.

Last night on ABC, the world received the “Countdown to Nick” as everyone prepared for his season on The Bachelor. All of the drama will begin this evening with the 2017 season premiere where Nick will meet the 30 women of his dreams. Unfortunately for some of them, they won't make it past the first night and 29 of them won't make it as his final choice. Let's check out how the rose ceremony eliminations go the rest of this season. Please let it be known that there are possible spoilers ahead for the new and upcoming season of The Bachelor starring Nick Viall. If you don't want to know them, stop reading now. Yes, 30 lovely ladies will begin the season tonight with the same and equal opportunity to become the one that the leading man truly loves.

That leaves 22 remaining which means a lot more rose ceremony eliminations It is time to check out the order of the rose ceremony eliminations for the rest of the 2017 season of The Bachelor as revealed by Reality Steve. Again, if you don't want to know when the contestants go home and who is there at the end, you need to stop reading right away. Episode 2 – Jan. 9 Lacey Mark Elizabeth Whitelaw Hailey Merkt Liz Sandoz Liz will actually be sent home during a group date to the Museum of Broken Relationships and not even make it to the rose ceremony elimination. Down to 18 women Episode 3 – Jan. 16 Christen Whitney Brittany Farrar Dominique Alexis Dominique will also not make it to the rose ceremony as she is eliminated during the group date of these episodes as well. Down to 15 women Episode 4 – Jan. 23 Astrid Loch Sarah Vendal This is an easy week as the rose ceremony elimination appears to go off without a hitch, but that will change in the coming weeks. Down to 13 women Episode 5 – Jan. 30 Alexis Waters Josephine Tutman Jaimi King Taylor Nolan Taylor will be sent home before the rose ceremony elimination. She ends up going out on the 2-on-1 date with Nick while The Bachelor is in New Orleans, but she won't safely make it through that outing.

Before the ceremony, the leading man walked in and sent Kristina home so no need to hand out roses. Down to 4 women Episode 8 – Feb. 20: Hometown Dates For the Final Four, there will be a pretty big and shocking happening, but Reality Steve wants everyone to realize that it isn't what ABC will make it out to be.

Corinne Olympios Down to 3 women Episode 9 – Feb. 27: Overnight Fantasy Suite Dates Rachel Lindsay Down to 2 women Episode 10 – March 6: The “Women Tell All” Special Obviously, there will be no rose ceremony elimination on this episode as it will only be the castmates sharing secrets and tales from the season. Episode 11 – March 13: Season Finale US Weekly reports that Nick has “definitely found love” on this season of The Bachelor and that things are going well for him. Well, he has two beautiful ladies to choose from in the finale and the final elimination is Raven Gates which means Nick is engaged to Vanessa Grimaldi.

CAERSWS will bid to avoid an upset when Welsh Alliance Two leaders Prestatyn Sports arrive at the Recreation Ground in the first round of the JD Welsh Cup on Saturday.
The Seasiders are unbeaten this season but Caersws will go into the tie as favourites and with confidence boosted after claiming their first home win of the campaign last week.
Manager Graham Evans said: “It was our best performance of the season, we had hunger and desire and I am proud of the lads. Prestatyn Sports are a physical side but we are ready for the battle.”
Gavin Samuel, Craig Harris and Lance Jones return to contention with the Bluebirds sweating on the fitness of Jack Hughes and Craig Whitfield.
Guilsfield entertain Mold Alexandra with manager Nathan Leonard calling for his side to be ruthless against the Wrexham League side.
“Mold will come and give it a go so we will have to be on top of our game,” said Leonard. “We had a great run last season and it would be great to do the same again.”
The tie of the round pits local rivals Abermule at home to A483 neighbours Berriew with the Spar Mid Wales League Two hosts plotting an upset.
However both sides go into the tie licking their wounds after suffering comprehensive league defeats last weekend with a bumper gate expected at the Community Centre Ground.
Carno bid to cause an upset at home to Huws Gray Alliance side Gresford Athletic while Llanrhaeadr will also be confident of springing a shock at home to FC Queens Park.
Meanwhile Llanfair United will renew rivalries with a trip to old Huws Gray Alliance rivals Flint Town United with the club keen to repeat their Welsh Cup runs of recent years.
Bow Street make the daunting trip to Huws Gray Alliance leaders Airbus UK Broughton while Spar Mid Wales League One leaders Llanidloes Town will be confident of progressing at Wrexham League One strugglers Buckley Town.
Meanwhile Rhayader Town face a trip into the unknown with a trip to Cwmmaman United of South Wales League Two while Penrhyncoch will travel with a depleted squad to Garden Village with Antonio Corbisiero, Nashawn Blake, Liam Lewis and Rob Murfet doubts.
Mid Wales interest is completed by Aberaeron who welcome South Wales League One leaders Llanelli and their talisman Lee Trundle to Cardiganshire.
(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) said on Monday it had abandoned its bid for most of the assets of Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O), leaving Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) as the sole suitor in pursuit of the $40 billion-plus deal. FILE PHOTO - The NBC and Comcast logo are displayed on top of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, formerly known as the GE building, in midtown Manhattan in New York July 1, 2015. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo “When a set of assets like Fox's becomes available, it is our responsibility to evaluate if there is a strategic fit that could benefit our company and our shareholders,” Comcast said in a statement. “That is what we tried to do and we are no longer engaged in the review of those assets. We never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer.” Disney's negotiations with Fox are continuing, and a deal could be reached as early as this month, sources close to the situation said on Monday. The persons asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Disney did not immediately respond to request for comment. A Fox representative declined to comment. The assets in question would have expanded Comcast's international footprint through ownership of European pay TV provider Sky Plc (SKYB.L) and Star network in India. A source told Reuters in mid-November that Comcast had approached Fox about its interest, and talks were in early stages. Comcast shares were up 1.5 percent in after-hours trading, while Disney shares were up 0.2 percent and Fox shares fell 1.3 percent.

Days after the National Council for Higher Education (NCHE) listed Blantyre International University (BIU) among those currently not accredited; the school has expressed its determination to reclaim its accreditation status once the recommended improvement plan is implemented.
NCHE revoked accreditation for BIU last year and ordered the institution to furnish NICHE with improvement plan which, among others, requires the institution to formulate gender and HIV/AIDS policies.
Speaking during the University's sixth congregation for 220 students which was held in Blantyre on Thursday, BIU's chancellor, Professor Charles Chamthunya said the school's improvement plan was already approved by NCHE in November last year (2017).
He said currently, two of the key issues listed in the plan have already been tackled. He added that once all is done, NCHE will pay them a visit to assess the facility in the prescribed areas.
“Our degree programs have already been reviewed, we have developed gender, HIV and AIDS and disability policies to fulfill one of the key issues recommended in the improvement plan.
“Currently, what remains are for the school to relocate to its new campus in Michiru where construction works have reached at an advanced stage,” explained Chamthunya.
The BIU Chancellor, however, faulted some media reports which he said have gone ahead to tarnish the school's image due to what he called irresponsible journalism.
“Some media houses ignore BIU to hear its side of the story when they are making reports concerning the school and its accreditation stand and that has negatively impacted on the school's reputation,” said Chamthunya.
While that is the case, the chancellor thanked parents, guardians, sponsors and students of BIU for their unwavering support for continuing to send their children to the school.
He said the school management is working tirelessly to get the school's glory back on track.
One of the graduated students for the sixth congregation, Ousman Kennedy, who made it with a distinction in law studies, expressed his worry on the mindset of employers who may be reluctant to hire BIU graduates considering that as of now the institution remains unaccredited.
“An education institution is measured by the knowledge that one acquires from it as such, I would like to believe that employers will employ us based on our ability,” explained Kennedy.
Blantyre international University opened its doors in 2014 and to this far, the school has graduated almost 1500 students with various degrees.
Many former students have been employed both in public and private sectors while others have been allowed by public universities to pursue post graduate studies as well.
While bunnies may seem like a great fit for Easter, pet stores in Lethbridge say they don't make for great gifts and buying them for others can lead to an increase in abandonment.
“Some people come in and it's an impulse buy or it's for the kids and the kids lose interest after a year or even a couple of months and then the parents have to take care of them or they get passed around from home to home,” said Lindsey Beekman, a pet counsellor at Pet Parade.

Beekman says a spike in bunny demand is something they face every spring.
“We try to educate people as much as possible on how long the bunny actually lives,” she said.
“Some people think it's only a couple of years, where they can actually live about 10 or so years. They do get quite big.”
It's not just their size people need to consider before making the purchase.

“They do chew on everything, they need to constantly chew. Their teeth grow and they need to be let out on a daily — if not every other day — basis,” Beekman said. “They do like to interact with other animals too. They are social so they don't like to be cooped up by themselves constantly.”

Proper diet, along with spaying and neutering, can also add up.
“Rabbits are considered exotic pets so the vet cost for a rabbit compared to your standard cat or dog is a whole lot more,” said Andrew Penton, a municipal enforcement officer with the Lethbridge Animal Shelter.
Penton says, after the holiday, the novelty can often wear off.
“We do have the increase in calls and we do have to tell people, ‘That's not our spot. Here's a list of rescues, here's a list of options,'” he said.
READ MORE: The dos and don'ts of adopting pets for Christmas
Some local pet stores have helped ease the burden when it comes to finding new homes.
“Even though we are a pet store, we have those rescue bunnies that need it,” Beekman said. “There's definitely a lot out there. People think it's more dogs and cats but sometimes the rescues get bombarded with 40 or 50 rescues at once.”
If you're thinking about letting your rabbit go free, the Helen Schuler Nature Centre says that's not a good idea.
“You're releasing it to likely either starve to death — because the rabbits don't recognize food sources so they're not sure what is good for them to eat versus plants that are toxic,” Manager Coreen Putman said, “or you're releasing them to become food for other animals.”

Beekman says, unless you're willing to commit to a rabbit for life, you're better off sticking to the chocolate version.
LISBON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Portugal's Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation is in talks to sell its fully-owned oil and gas business Partex, which has stakes in oilfields from Oman to Brazil, the foundation said on Friday.
The private philanthropic entity, which finances arts, education and science, said in a statement it had been approached by various potential buyers over the past years and lately received an acquisition offer from an unnamed company.
“The Foundation ... is at this moment in the process of negotiating with the interested group. After an analysis of all the conditions, a decision will be taken in the defense of the best interests of the Foundation,” it said.
Local media said private conglomerate CEFC China Energy, which last year bought the insurance business of small Portuguese bank Montepio, is the potential buyer and the deal could be worth around 500 million euros.
Noone was immediately available for comment at the company's Shanghai headquarters.
The latest available Partex financial data for 2016 put its oil and gas properties at $472 million and total assets at $720 million, with oil and gas revenues at $252 million on an output of 6.4 million barrels of oil equivalent for the year, the bulk of it coming from Oman.
Partex was founded in 1938 by Portugal-based oil magnate of Armenian origin, Calouste Gulbenkian, who later left the company to the foundation started at his bequest. (Reporting By Andrei Khalip, editing by David Evans)

True Twin Peaks fans will remember David bowie's cameo in the Twin Peaks film Fire Walk with Me. Bowie played Phillip Jeffries, a FBI agent involved in the “Blue Rose” task force.

In last night's episode of the Showtime reboot Twin Peaks: The Return, Bowie's character appeared during FBI director Gordon Cole's (played by series creator David Lynch) description of a strange and revelatory dream he had, according to Spin.
Last year, Harry Goaz (who plays the character Andy) mentioned to Dallas News that Bowie was supposed to return for another cameo for the revamped season, but was unable to do so before he passed away.
For the episode, Lynch used old footage of Bowie from Fire Walk With Me instead of recasting the role or changing the plot. During the end credits, there is a note dedicating the episode to Bowie's memory.
Three women in an Indian Head care home have seen a lot of changes in their time. Roma Inglis, 101, Ann Emerson, 102, and Mary Anaka, 101, have all celebrated New Year's Day for more than a century.
Inglis fondly remembers dressing up in fancy gowns for for New Year's Eve dances at Hotel Saskatchewan when she was younger.
“We'd sneak little bottles of liquor in and keep it under the table because they didn't allow drinking in those days,” she laughed.
Inglis said she's never been a fan of making New Year's resolutions.
“I never did because you couldn't keep them,” she said.
Inglis, Emerson and Anaka were born near the beginning of the First World War, before radios were popular in the home and before television had been invented. Lynn Emerson, Ann's daughter, said the changes her mother lived through were remarkable.
“How hard they had to work, how resourceful they had to be. How they made do with very little,” Lynn said.
Lynn attributed her mother's longevity largely to healthy habits.
“Nutrition, an inquisitive mind and an open, loving heart,” she said.
Inglis said she didn't have a secret to living a long life.
“I didn't smoke and I took a drink once in a while at a party… well, you had to do that if you went to a party,” she said.
The Australian actor donned a full body wetsuit to catch some waves on Vancouver Island this weekend

More and more actors and actresses are spending time in British Columbia, mostly due to Vancouver solidifying itself as Hollywood North for major TV and movie productions.
It's no longer unusual to see famous celebrities eating at the same restaurants we frequent or hanging out at the same places we've long since known as local gems. And with the influence of social media these days, many are also chronically their journey for the rest of us to follow along.
Australian actor Chris Hemsworth, known for his title role as Thor in the Marvel movie universe since 2011, has kept himself busy this past week on the West Coast. He's been spending time in Vancouver shooting the movie ‘Bad Times at the El Royale', and last week shared a video view of his condo from high above Stanley Park.

A few days later he took in some Rugby Sevens action at B.C. Place and handed out a prize following the final match.
But this past weekend it was time for Hemsworth to head over to Vancouver Island and catch some waves near Tofino.
He posted to Instagram: ‘Not sure if we're robbing banks or surfing but it's damn cold in Canada. Well worth it though, what a beautiful place!!'
According to his Instagram page, the 34-year-old looks like he surfs a lot — including with his young daughter.
And after spending some time in a full body wetsuit, Hemsworth made sure to warm up with a steaming bowl of Vietnamese Pho as he continues to conquer mountains, embrace challenges and push phoward.

Every year, more than 8 million people go to the doctor for shoulder problems. This doesn't even count those of us who refuse to go to the doc, because “It'll probably fix itself”. More than half of those that show up to the doctor are fighting rotator cuff injuries, and this number is rising.
Thanks to technology, our bad posture is here to stay. Between our computer and cell phone, and the fact that many of us sit for seven or more hours per day, Upper Crossed Syndrome (UCS) has become a big problem for many people.
UCS is when the muscles of the upper traps and pecs are tight, and the muscles of the mid back and the neck are too weak to combat the tightness. The result is shoulders that are rolled forward and a head that juts forward instead of being directly on top of the neck and shoulders.

This body position over time can lead to shoulder pain and injury, as well as a decrease in strength in the gym. Poor posture also communicates a lack of confidence and energy.
Whether you're crushing barbell workouts or not, it's important to keep your shoulders strong and mobile. This will allow you to lift longer, feel better, and avoid a visit to the orthopedic surgeon.
Full Range of Motion Exercises
When doing shoulder exercises, it's important to make sure that you're using the full range of motion (ROM). The more ROM you can control, the better your shoulders will feel.
Start your workout with these exercises to set your posture in a solid position. Finish your workout with the mobility exercises below.
Scapular Push-ups
Get into a strong pushup position with abs and glutes flexed. With your arms straight, retract your shoulder blades by letting your chest “fall” towards the ground. Don't lose your posture here.
At the bottom position, reverse the movement and push the shoulder blades forward. Make sure that the entire exercise is done with straight arms.
Instructions: Do 2-3 sets of 5-10 reps.
Band Face Pull
Loop a band around something sturdy and then set like you're about to do a row with perfect posture.
Pull the band back towards your face. At the end position, your thumbs should be between your ears and jaw. Make sure that your shoulders are away from your ears, and the shoulder blades are pinched together like you're trying to hold a pencil with them.

Instructions: Do 2-3 sets of 20-40 reps.
Band Pull Apart
This is a low impact move that should be a staple in your warmups, and can be done daily.
Holding a band with your arms straight, pull apart like you're trying to tear something in half, making sure that you're “trying to touch your elbows behind your back” rather than doing the move with just the hands.
The elbows should be unlocked, but should not move during the exercise.
Instructions:Do 2-3 sets of 30-50 reps, or 100 daily.
Some Things You'll Need
PVC Pipe
Yes, this does look like piping for your next DIY home project but it's also your best option for mobilizes your shoulders. No need to pick up any expensive mobility tools. You could even perform these moves with a broom stick. But utilizing a PVC pipe allows a little flexibility with the pipe so help keep your shoulders in safe positions.

WODFitters Resistance Band
The important note here is that you don't need a high resistance band. It's best to start with a looser band and work your hands in closer together for more resistance and a further to reduce the resistance. These can also pull double-duty for assisted pull-ups, banded good morning and loads of other mobility moves.

Shoulder Mobility Moves
If you're already tight, or have some pain, start your workouts with these mobility drills. If not, you can use these to build mobility after upper body days.
Band Alternating Pass Throughs
Starting with a band (or PVC pipe) in front of you, bring the left arm overhead and behind the back.
Then bring the right arm overhead to return to the starting position. After finishing 5-10 reps on one side, reverse the movement.
Instructions: Do 2-3 sets of 10 each side.
Hollow Body PVC Pass Throughs
This is a more difficult move than the Band Alternating Pass Throughs, but it's more effective because it requires that you set up with a strong core, which minimizes any movement through the low back.
Set up in a hollow body position. On your back with shoulders and legs off the ground and core engaged. Hold a PVC pipe in front of you and pass it over your back as far as you can without touching the ground. Repeat for five reps.
Related: Four Stretches You Should Absolutely Do Before Lifting
Then without touching the ground with your feet or shoulders, roll into a Superman position – chest and feet off the ground, glutes tight.
Now pass the PVC over your back and in front again for five reps. Roll over and repeat.
Instructions: Do 2 sets of 10 each side.
Skin the Cat
A great move if you already have some shoulder mobility and are looking to increase it, but if your posture isn't great or you're coming back from an injury, it may be better to keep away from this one.
Hang from a bar, then pull your legs up and through your arms. From the inverted position, drop your legs behind you slowly while still maintaining control.
Reverse the move and pull your legs back through your arms. Return to a hanging position. Repeat, still under control, but trying to get a little bit deeper every rep.
Instructions: Do 2-3 sets of 3-5.
Shoulder Stretches
After an upper body day, or if you're feeling tight, use these stretches to improve your flexibility and loosen up tight shoulders.
Prone Scorpions
Lay on your stomach with your arms spread out to the sides in a T position. While keeping your left arm and chest on the ground, try to lift your right foot up and bring it as close to your left hand as possible. Alternate sides.
If this seems impossible, just do your best with the leg. Remember we're really stretching the chest and shoulder here, so just make sure that you're feeling the stretch, rather than worrying about how far you got your leg. Hold each for 5-10 seconds.
Do 2 sets of 5 each side
Seated Shoulder Stretch
Sit on the ground and put your hands on the ground behind your back with your fingers pointed away from your body and elbows bent slightly.
Keep your chest big, and scoot your butt toward your heels to get a deeper stretch through the front of the shoulders. Hold for 30 seconds
When you finish holding with the bent arms, straighten the elbows and hold again for 30 seconds.
Instructions: Do 2 sets of 30 seconds each.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May hailed “a new sense of optimism” in Brexit talks, telling parliament on Monday an agreement to move negotiations on to future trade ties is progress and will reassure those concerned Britain may leave with no deal. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May meets the Prime Minister of Bulgaria, Boyko Borissov, at 10 Downing Street in London, December 11, 2017. REUTERS/Toby MelvilleMay, weakened after losing her Conservatives' majority at a June election, rescued an agreement last week to move the talks to unravel more than 40 years of union on to a second phase after easing the concerns of her Northern Irish allies over the future role of the border with EU member Ireland. But the discussion of Britain's trade relationship with the EU after Brexit contains many pitfalls and could widen differences among her top team of ministers, or cabinet, over how Britain should look after it leaves the bloc. In a statement to parliament, May took to task those who doubted that she could move the talks beyond the initial stage of agreeing terms on how much Britain should pay, citizens' rights and the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. “This is good news for people who voted leave who were worried we were so bogged down in the tortuous negotiations it was never going to happen,” she told parliament. “It is good news for people who voted remain who were worried were going to crash out without a deal.” May will head to Brussels on Thursday for a summit meeting at which she expects the leaders of the other 27 EU states to approve an assessment by negotiators that the sides have made “sufficient progress” to move on to phase two. TROUBLES AHEAD But she warned that the government will only pay a financial settlement if Britain and the EU secure a future trade deal. FILE PHOTO - Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May and European Council President Donald Tusk meet at the European Council in Brussels, Belgium, December 8, 2017. REUTERS/Eric VidalThe deal to launch further talks looked in jeopardy a week ago when May was forced to abandon a choreographed meeting in Brussels intended to seal the deal after her allies in Northern Ireland expressed fears she was proposing a special status for the region - out of sync with the rest of the United Kingdom. After days of diplomacy, there was a compromise - if no overall Brexit deal is secured, Britain will keep “full alignment” with those rules of the EU's single market that help cooperation between Ireland's north and south. But those words have reverberated in both London and Belfast, with Brexit minister David Davis saying they were more “a statement of intent” than a legally binding move. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May and her husband Philip leave church, in Sonning, Britain, December 10, 2017. REUTERS/Peter NichollsOn Monday, Davis told LBC radio his words had been taken out of context and denied he was backing away from the commitment, which the EU described as “a deal between gentlemen”. “And it is the clear understanding that it is fully backed and endorsed by the UK government,” the European Commission's chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporters in Brussels. Davis' comments may have been aimed at members of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May's Conservative minority government in parliament after the party expressed concerns about how alignment could work without Britain staying in the EU's single market and customs union. Or he may have wanted to ease the fears of some campaigners for Britain to leave the EU, who say the possibility of having to follow the bloc's rules would mean that they would have Brexit in name only. But May said the commitments made in the first round of talks -- which includes a payment of 35-39 billion pounds over many years to meet EU obligations -- were necessary to sever ties with the bloc. “In doing so we can move on to building the bold new economic and security relationships that can underpin the new deep and special partnership we all want to see,” she said. “A partnership between the European Union and a sovereign United Kingdom that has taken control of its borders, money and laws once again.”

Following a three-day holiday break, the Arizona Coyotes were back in action on Tuesday night at Gila River Arena against the Dallas Stars, but dropped their fifth consecutive game by the score of 3-2 as they struggled badly on special teams.
The Coyotes wrapped up their five-game homestand against the New York Rangers on Thursday night looking to avoid a sixth consecutive defeat, but were unable to pick up the victory as they allowed four power-play goals in a 6-3 loss.
Arizona then traveled up north to the Saddledome to finish out the 2016 portion of their season against the Calgary Flames with a win, but instead allowed four first-period goals and dropped their seventh consecutive game in regulation by the score of 4-2.
Starting the New Year on the Road
Following their New Year's Eve tilt in Calgary, the Coyotes will have a few days off to rest, relax, and regroup before heading to Vancouver for a matchup against the Canucks on Wednesday night. The Coyotes are just 1-5-2 in their last eight against the Canucks and will be looking to have some success against a team they've struggled with recently. Puck drop is scheduled for 7:00 P.M. in Vancouver (8:00 P.M. in Arizona).

After wrapping things up in British Columbia, the Coyotes will head down to Anaheim for a Friday night matchup against the Ducks. The Coyotes have dropped three straight games against the Ducks and have allowed five goals in each of the losses. Puck drop is scheduled for 7:00 P.M. at the Honda Center (8:00 P.M. in Arizona).
Following their game on Friday night in Orange County, the Coyotes will pack up and return home to Gila River Arena for a Saturday night contest against the visiting New York Islanders. The Isles have struggled badly on the road this season, as they possess the league's worst road record at 4-8-2. Puck drop is scheduled for 6:00 P.M. in Glendale.
Duclair Heating Up?
Anthony Duclair has struggled badly this season in Arizona as he's scored just three goals through 34 games, but he finally appears to be heating up after a rough start in the desert; he scored two goals in three games last week and also fired eight shots on goal while averaging nearly 17 minutes of ice time per game.
The Duke is at it again. pic.twitter.com/wxWdQ4i5GD — NHL (@NHL) December 30, 2016
Duclair possesses the ability to be an elite goalscorer at the NHL level, and the Coyotes are hoping that his back-to-back goals last week have given him the confidence to return to the level that he played at for most of the 2015-16 season.
Dvorak, Perlini Quickly Adapting to NHL Game
When Christian Dvorak made the Coyotes' opening night roster this season, many expected that he'd immediately make an impact in the NHL similar to how his former London Knights teammate Max Domi did during the 2015-16 season.
Through 33 games, Dvorak hasn't disappointed. He's posted four goals and eight assists while playing the difficult center position, and, at plus-five, is one of just three Coyotes players to have a positive plus/minus rating. The Coyotes have struggled badly as a team in their last seven games, but Dvorak's play has been one of their few positives during that time; he's recorded two goals, two assists, and a plus-four rating during the team's current seven-game losing streak, and has markedly improved upon his play as the season has progressed.
Perlini, on the other hand, didn't start the season with the Coyotes, but has quickly made up for lost time in the NHL. He's scored three goals in his first 12 games and has impressed many with his outstanding speed and solid wrister. He's currently on pace to score 15 goals despite spending the first three months of the season in the AHL, and should only continue to get better as he grows into his 6'3″ frame. Both players are enjoying solid rookie seasons, and are big parts of the future in Arizona.
Strome, Keller Excelling at World Juniors
Dvorak and Perlini have both managed to make an impact as rookies with the Coyotes this season, but they're not the only young players that Coyotes fans need to be keeping their eyes on. Clayton Keller and Dylan Strome, the team's last two #1 draft selections, both are tearing up the competition at the World Junior Championships in Canada.
Dylan Strome scored a pair in Canada's tournament-opening win over Russia. https://t.co/6LhIT9PkrP pic.twitter.com/6TUYfZXxgC — Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) December 27, 2016
Keller and Strome are squarely in the spotlight at the World Juniors at the moment and find themselves among the tournament leaders in scoring. Strome ranks second in points with eight while Keller is tied for fourth with seven points himself. The two Coyotes prospects have stolen the show for their respective countries and will be two players to keep an eye on as the tournament progresses.
Pacific Division Roundup
The San Jose Sharks continue to lead in the Pacific Division, but have very little breathing room as both the Oilers and Ducks are within two points of the division lead. Here's how Arizona's other division rivals fared last week:
Anaheim Ducks (19-12-8, 46 points)
Last week: 2-0-2
2-0-2 Analysis: The Ducks have points in five straight games, but have won just two of them. They're still in good position in the Pacific, but one has to imagine that they'll need to start winning some more games in order to keep pace down the stretch.

In order for Glen Gulutzan's squad to remain in playoff contention, both Chad Johnson and Brian Elliott will need to continue providing solid goaltending.

However, they'll face off against Columbus in their next game on Tuesday. Will they become the 16th straight team to fall at the hands of the red-hot Blue Jackets?

3-0-0 Analysis: The Canucks swept their three games last week against Pacific Division opponents, and have climbed to within three points of a playoff spot despite having the West's worst road record at 5-12-1. If they can figure out how to win away from Rogers Arena, they could make some noise in the Pacific this season.

The Coyotes are currently mired in a seven-game losing streak and haven't been particularly competitive at all during that stretch. If they want to have any hope of climbing back into the thick of things in the Western Conference, they'll need to regroup quickly and start the 2017 portion of their season on a high note on Wednesday night in Vancouver.

Dual Meet Format
FINAL TEAM SCORES:
MEN: Texas 159, TCU 108
WOMEN: Texas 162, TCU 105
The Texas men and women closed out their regular dual meet season against TCU on Friday night. There were a few notable absences at the meet. John Shebat, who was absent during the team's meets against Arizona State and Arizona, didn't compete for the Horns tonight. Fellow All-American Joseph Schooling was also sitting out of this meet. TCU was without Head Coach Sam Busch, who has been placed on administrative leave.
One of the highlight swims of the meet for the men came from Texas' Ryan Harty. In the 200 back, Harty blew away the field by nearly 8 seconds. He flipped in 50.05 through the halfway point, pulling farther and farther ahead as he busted out a 1:41.56 for the win. Harty also placed 2nd in the 100 breast, touching in 55.36 behind teammate Casey Melzer (54.30).
The Texas women ended their season at 9-0 as they defeated TCU tonight, giving them their first undefeated season in 30 years. Claire Adams and Kaitlin Harty each contributed a winning double to help them achieve their perfect dual meet record. Adams was the only swimmer to break 23 in the 50 free, winning by over a second in 22.62. She returned for the 100 fly, dominating there as well in 52.87. Harty came from behind in the 100 back, outpacing teammate Remedy Rule (55.44) through the back half to win it in 55.00. She made it a stroke sweep in the 200 back, touching over 11 seconds ahead of the field in 1:57.13.

POST-MEET COMMENTS
Texas senior swimmer Rebecca Millard
On what it means to finish strong on senior day
It is really fun ending the dual meet season here. I am really grateful for that. I am also very grateful that we get to race TCU. They are a great school, very kind and good competitors. It was fun because you get to swim “off” events, things you are not used to and things that are fun. I got to focus solely on the 100 free and post a time that I could really be proud of. I am very proud of my 100 free. It is the best I have done this season.
On the culture at this meet
It unites the team in reminding us how the sport is fun, why we chose to do this sport, and it brings us all together. There were a lot of really great and really surprising swims. Like Remedy's (Rule) 100 back was really good, Logan (Shiller) suited up and did a really good 500 free, Joanna' (Evans) 200 free was really good too. It was a low-stress environment, centered around having fun…being together and being one team and getting ready for the conference (meet).
On finishing 9-0 for the third time in program history
This team is really cool. They are fighters. They are tough. There were some meets where we were in a lot of pain. That is how Carol (Capitani) sets up our schedule. She makes it hard, because anything that is easy isn't going to be worth it. It was really fun. It was nine really solid wins. Nine times where I feel like we really got together and I think it has been a long time coming. Every year we have gotten stronger and stronger and I think this 9-0 record really shows that.

Josh Levine, owner of the auction house who was called to look at the poster, estimated the signed Lakers memorabilia would be worth about $300. But when they went to the man's garage, what they found could be 50,000 times more valuable.”
Question: I've seen some headlines about the bank stress tests in the past few weeks. I own a few bank stocks. What does this mean to me?
Answer: Remember how during the 2008 financial crisis many banks were being referred to as "too big to fail"? Well, the stress tests are designed to ensure that any bank that is too big to fail doesn't fail – under any circumstances.
The stress tests apply to all banks over a certain size. In 2017 and prior years, the threshold has been $50 billion in assets. Recent rollbacks of banking regulations have increased the threshold to $100 billion for 2018, and this will gradually rise to $250 billion over the coming years.
The tests are designed to discover what would happen to the nation's largest banks in the event of a severe global recession, which is defined as negative 7.5 percent GDP growth over seven quarters, 10 percent unemployment, a 65 percent drop in stock prices and a few other pretty terrible conditions.
For investors, aside from learning how well-capitalized each bank is, the most important thing the stress tests do is determine whether or not each bank's capital plan is approved by the Federal Reserve. In other words, these large banks (formally referred to as systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs) need the Fed's approval before paying dividends or buying back shares with their capital.
Finally, it's important to mention that while there are minimum capital levels that need to be maintained under adverse conditions, there's no pass/fail threshold when it comes to the capital plans. In other words, it's entirely possible for a bank to pass the stress test and still have its capital plan rejected.

"Just 4 days ago Bernie Sanders ordered his followers to 'take down' Trump," he tweeted.
It didn't take long for some to connect the shooting to Sanders himself. One person in particular, Jack Posobiec — a Trump supporter who has pushed the conspiracy theory surrounding DNC staffer Seth Rich's death — especially fueled that idea.
The gunman who attacked Republican congressional members at a baseball practice Wednesday morning campaigned for Sen. Bernie Sanders during the presidential election.
The headline, "Sanders to faithful: Take down Trump, takes over Democratic Party," refers to Sanders' message of resistance to the establishment rule, one that he campaigned on and since has reiterated, and his strong criticism of Trump.
Sanders did not say that. Posobiec seemed to pull it from a CNN headline that describes Sanders' nearly hourlong speech at Sunday's People's Summit.
Sanders called Trump "perhaps the worst and most dangerous president in the history of our country" in his speech and ended by saying, "I want you to think about the incredibly brave heroes and heroines in our history against unbelievably daunting odds who risked their lives for social justice, for economic justice, for racial justice."
But he did not at any point say anyone should "take down" the president.
CNN anchor Fredricka Whitfield, in her description of Sanders' speech, said he urged supporters "to take down President Trump's agenda."
But the mischaracterization hasn't stopped people from retweeting Posobiec, who has hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers. The tweet also made its way to the top of "The Donald" subreddit — a discussion group for Trump supporters.
Sanders since has commented on the shooting.
"Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society, and I condemn this action in the strongest, possible terms," Sanders said.

LONDON (AP)  Prince Harry has broken with royal tradition of maintaining silence about mental health issues by speaking candidly about his severe emotional problems following the death of his mother Princess Diana.
The 32-year-old prince told The Daily Telegraph in an interview published Monday that he had nearly suffered breakdowns since his mothers 1997 death in a car crash and had needed counseling in his late 20s.
It was by far the most frank interview of Harrys life, and gives the public its first glimpse of the inner turmoil he suffered growing up in the public eye after losing his mother when he was only 12.
He told the newspaper he shut down all his emotions for nearly 20 years and had been very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions.

He describes a long, painful process of refusing to face his sense of loss that only came to an end when he was in his late 20s and sought professional counseling to cope with the pressures and unhappiness.
My way of dealing with it was sticking my head in the sand, refusing to ever think about my mum, because why would that help? he said of his teens and 20s, a period in which he embarked on a successful military career but also occasionally attracted unwanted headlines, notably for being photographed playing strip billiards in Las Vegas.
In the interview, Harry said he had at times felt on the verge of punching someone and had taken up boxing as an outlet for the aggression he felt.
He said the long suppression of his grief eventually led to two years of total chaos.
He said he was pretending that life was great until he started counseling and faced his problems head on.
All of a sudden, all of this grief that I have never processed started to come to the forefront and I was like, there is actually a lot of stuff here that I need to deal with, he said.
Along with his brother Prince William and sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge, Harry has worked with a charity that promotes mental health. They have argued that mental health problems must be given the same priority as other illnesses and should be spoken about openly and without stigma.
Harry has also worked extensively with wounded veterans and has organized the Invictus Games to foster international sporting competition for injured or ill service personnel and veterans.
Harry told interviewer Bryony Gordon, who has written extensively about her own struggles with depression and other issues, that he is in a good place now, and praised William for helping him seek help after many years of suffering in silence.
Harry has never before spoken publicly about his problems dealing with Dianas death. He and William have both been wary of press coverage, in part because of the way photographers shadowed their mothers every move.
New York Jets linebacker Dylan Donahue, who was arrested for DWI last month after driving the wrong way in the Lincoln Tunnel and crashing into a bus, also faces a drunken-driving charge in his home state of Montana, ESPN has learned.
Donahue, 25, was involved in a car wreck last May 9 in Billings -- nine days after he was drafted by the Jets in the fifth round. An affidavit from the Billings City Attorney's office, obtained by ESPN, claims Donahue committed a DUI and that his blood alcohol content was tested at 0.137. The legal limit is 0.08. Police arrived at the scene at 2:25 a.m., where they found Donahue's SUV flipped over on its roof, according to the affidavit.
Donahue and an unidentified male passenger were bleeding from visible injuries. Donahue told police that he slammed into a parked, unoccupied pickup truck. He claimed he looked down to check his phone and, upon looking up, he saw the parked truck but couldn't stop in time. He said the truck was partially blocking his lane with no lights on.
A police officer detected the smell of alcohol, and Donahue admitted he had "several alcoholic drinks earlier in the evening," per the affidavit. He was transported to St. Vincent's Hospital, where he gave a blood sample that came back with the 0.137 reading. Donahue was charged with felony criminal endangerment, but it was declined by the county attorney's office and forwarded to the city attorney's office as a misdemeanor DUI charge.
It's still pending, the city attorney's office said Monday. It's unclear if the Jets had knowledge of the Montana incident. They weren't immediately available for comment. Coach Todd Bowles, speaking to reporters two days after Donahue's Lincoln Tunnel arrest, was noncommittal on his roster spot. Bowles indicated they'd let the NFL handle any potential discipline.
"You've got to wait and see what the league does first before we do anything," Bowles said. "So it's a legal matter now and we've got to wait our turn, see what happens and go from there."
Asked about the circumstances surrounding the tunnel arrest, Bowles said, "That's not a good thing, that's not something we condone. We hope the people are all right in the other vehicle, but that's a pending legal matter."
Donahue is subject to NFL discipline under the league's substance-abuse policy.
On Feb. 26, Donahue was traveling eastbound into Manhattan at about 2 a.m. ET. He drove into the wrong tube of the Tunnel and crashed into into a 15-passenger bus. Four of the passengers were taken to a local hospital with minor injuries, according to New York/New Jersey Port Authority police.
Donahue failed sobriety and breathalyzer tests at the scene, police said. He also was charged with reckless driving.
Donahue played in only four games last season before suffering a season-ending elbow injury in a Week 4 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. He finished his rookie year with four tackles. The Jets are counting on him to be a core special-teamer and perhaps contribute as a situational pass-rusher.
The Jets have experienced a rash of arrests over the last 10 months. Aside from Donahue, the others are wide receiver Robby Anderson (twice) and cornerback Rashard Robinson.

Daisy Sweeney was that teacher for Montreal jazz pianist, composer and arranger Oliver Jones.
Sweeney died aged 97 on August 11.
“I went to her for theory and composition,” Jones recalled.
Sweeney's daughter, former Olympian Sylvia Sweeney, said her mother took to classical music from very humble roots.

“She was a maid, because that was the only job a black woman could have in Montreal. She was born here in 1920,” Sylvia said.
Sweeney used some of the money she made to put herself through music school at McGill University.
It was her father, a railroad worker who was himself a piano player, who insisted that she learn to play and teach her younger siblings — including her brother, Oscar Peterson, one of Canada's most celebrated pianists.
With her piano training, she taught the countless kids in the local black community to play.
“She would charge 25 cents a lesson, and she would have a class of 60 students,” Sylvia said.
Among her pupils over the years was Oliver Jones.
“I got caught up in listening to Oscar Peterson, and got my parents to make sure that I started to take my lessons from Daisy,” Jones said. “He was just eight years old at the time, and Sweeney remained his teacher for twelve years, until he too went to McGill.
Sweeney's approachable nature, and her ability to bring out the best in her students, always stood out to Jones. “I was extremely, extremely shy as a youngster, but I was able to speak with her no problem,” he said.

Sweeney made such an impression on the young Jones that even when he started performing professionally, he would always call her for advice.
He said he still has music books that she gave him, even though “it's only been 50 years!” Jones grins.
Her influence extended beyond her piano students — among her many other accomplishments, she was also the co-founder of the Montreal Jubilation Gospel Choir.
But her biggest legacy, says her daughter, was as a teacher who showed black kids in the 1960s that they had options for their future.
“She brought those children in St. Henri into a world that would not really be welcoming to them,” Sylvia notes.
That included Jones, who went on to an illustrious career in the world of jazz.
“She has done so much for so many youngsters, giving them confidence,” he said. “I'm going to miss her.”

It was Senior Night on Monday at Pauley Pavilion.
Playing the last home game of their college careers, Dominique Billings, Jordin Canada and Kelli Hayes combined for 23 first-half points as the UCLA women's basketball team cruised past Creighton, 86-64, in the second round of the NCAA tournament.
The third-seeded Bruins (26-7) advanced to the Sweet 16 for the third straight year — a first in program history — and will face second-seeded Texas in the semifinals of the Kansas City regional Friday at 6 p.m. PDT.
"It was special leaving the game for the last time with Mo and Kelli and the crowd cheering," Canada said. "Thinking about what we've built here, why I came here ... it all came back to me. To get a win in my last home game here ever is awesome!"
UCLA is one victory away from its second Elite Eight appearance. The first came in 1999.
"I'm so proud of our players for sustaining their identity and focus for 40 minutes against a really good team," coach Cori Close said. "Our seniors have set a new standard for UCLA and when we finally took them out, I felt like a proud parent."

The game was more one-sided than the teams' other meeting in November, when the Bruins pulled away in the second half to prevail 72-63 at the South Point Thanksgiving Shootout in Las Vegas. This time UCLA shot 57.6 percent from the floor over the first two quarters to forge a 17-point lead.
"We knew we had to dictate better tonight," Canada said. "We saw there were a lot of upsets earlier in the day and we wanted to make sure that's not going to be us."
After Creighton forward Audrey Faber opened the scoring with a three-pointer, UCLA went on a 13-0 run. Hayes and Lajahna Drummer hit jumpers in the lane, Billings made a bank shot and a layup, Kennedy Burke connected from beyond the arc and Canada swished a fadeaway jumper following a timeout.
"UCLA was terrific tonight," Creighton coach Jim Flanery said. "They defended us well, they were sharp offensively, they forced the pace and they pressed more than I expected. We play Marquette and DePaul and those are super up-tempo teams so we're used to it, but we needed to do better from a communication and physicality standpoint. In retrospect maybe we should've played more man-on-man from the beginning."
Creighton (19-13), which finished fourth in the Big East Conference and was seeded 11th, upset sixth-seeded Iowa 76-70 in the first round Saturday, but trailed by as many as 28 in the second half against the Bruins.
"Offensively, they made everything hard for us," said Faber, who had a team-high 20 points. "I didn't do much differently to be honest, I just take what they give me."
Billings finished with 15 points and nine rebounds, Hayes had four points and Canada, a McDonald's All-American at Los Angeles Windward, added 21 points, eight assists and five steals and was subbed out to a standing ovation with 1:57 left.
Japreece Dean scored 16 points, Kennedy Burke had 11 and Drummer added 10 for the Bruins, who improved to 19-1 when scoring at least 70 points and won for the 15th time in 18 games. UCLA is 8-1 all time against Big East opponents.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) recently released a circular on categorisation and rationalisation of mutual funds, MFs, to ensure different schemes are clearly distinct in asset allocation, investment strategy etc. The market regulator wants to bring uniformity in the characteristics of similar schemes to ensure an investor is able to evaluate various options before making any investments.
Before this, there weren't any standard definitions of MF categories. MFs were free to determine a scheme's characteristics and investment strategy while seeking approval from Sebi to launch a fund, within a broad framework. As a result, MF companies, research and advisory firms came up with their own definitions and methodologies of categorising funds.
Further, MFs launched multiple schemes with similar strategies. For instance, currently there are around 280 open end equity funds including 65 to 70 large cap funds and a similar number of flexi-cap schemes, depending on the category definitions used, across 42 Asset Management Companies (AMCs) indicating multiple schemes with similar strategies being launched by AMCs.
Non-standard or ad hoc category definitions and the large number of schemes makes it difficult for advisors and investors to meaningfully evaluate and compare funds and select suitable one for investment.
For instance, an AMC might consider one of its equity funds as large-cap, but an advisor might categorise it as a flexi-cap or diversified equity fund based on its methodology, hence creating confusion and making comparison with other funds difficult.
The circular defines broad groups within which AMCs need to classify their existing funds. The broad groups are as follows:
Equity schemes
Debt schemes
Hybrid schemes
Solution oriented schemes
Other schemes
Sub-categories within each of these groups have been defined. For instance, equity schemes would include such categories as large-cap, multi-cap, mid-cap, etc. with clearly defined parameters for schemes in each category. Further, an AMC can have only one fund in a category, expect for categories such as thematic, sectoral, index funds, ETFs. These guidelines would result in a rationalisation of funds across categories.
The standard definitions for each category would result in funds with uniform strategies being classified together, making evaluation and selection of funds easier. Although the large number of categories within equity (10 standard and 3 to 4 other categories) and debt (16 categories) might continue to pose challenges for investors to navigate.
As a consequence of the above guidelines, AMCs would need to categorise their funds into defined sections and seek approval from the regulator prior to finalising the same.
AMCs, particularly those running multiple funds with similar mandates, would either need to make changes to the investment strategies or mandates or merge them with other existing funds.
Sebi requires AMCs to submit their fund categorisation and rationalisation proposals by the December 15, 2017. Once the regulator provides their view on the proposals, AMCs would need to implement required changes within three months.
AMCs would be required to communicate any changes in fund attributes, mergers, etc. to investors within a stipulated period and typically in case of significant changes in attributes, exit options would be provided to investors.
As an investor, it would be advisable to keep a track of any changes related to fund attributes, etc. announced by AMCs over the next few months.
Significant changes in the investment strategy or mandate might result in a fund becoming unsuitable for one's portfolio based on investment horizon, risk appetite or desired portfolio mix.
For instance, a large cap fund being reclassified as a large and mid-cap fund would result in a change in the fund's risk and return attributes.
Going ahead, investors should evaluate a mutual fund scheme by comparing it with peers classified as per the Seni categorisation.

Toronto: The man accused of plowing a rental van into pedestrians on a crowded Toronto sidewalk, killing 10 people in Canada's deadliest mass killing in decades, left a “cryptic message” on social media before his attack, police said on Tuesday.
Suspect Alek Minassian, 25, was charged with 10 counts of murder and 13 counts of attempted murder in the incident.
One possible clue to his motive emerged on Tuesday as Facebook confirmed Minassian wrote a post before the incident that referenced an “incel rebellion.” The term is shorthand used in some online message boards for “involuntary celibacy”, a loose social media movement of men who blame women for their celibacy.[L1N1S11Z5]
Canadian authorities have declined to say whether anger toward women had motivated the attack.
The post also voiced admiration for a man who killed six college students before taking his own life in California in 2014 and who cited the “cruelness of women” for his virgin status.
“The accused is alleged to have posted a cryptic message on Facebook minutes before” the attack, Graham Gibson, a Toronto police detective sergeant, told a news conference. The majority of the victims were women, ranging in age from their mid-20s to early 80s, Gibson said.
He said the question of whether the attack was driven by anger against women was “going to be part of our investigation.”
Facebook has since deleted Minassian's account, a representative said. “There is absolutely no place on our platform for people who commit such horrendous acts,” she said in an email.
Minassian kept his shaved head down during a brief court appearance in Canada's largest city, speaking quietly with a defence lawyer and stating his name in a steady voice when asked to do so.
The incident had the hallmarks of deadly vehicle assaults by Islamic State supporters. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there was no reason to suspect any national security connection.
Trudeau called on all Canadians to stand united with Toronto as flowers and scrawled messages in multiple languages piled up at a makeshift memorial in the city's north end, an ethnically diverse neighbourhood of towering office buildings, shops, restaurants and homes.
“We cannot, as Canadians, choose to live in fear every single day as we go about our daily business,” Trudeau told reporters outside of parliament in Ottawa.
The prime minister said the incident had not changed the country's threat level or security preparations for a G7 summit in Quebec in June.
Minassian had briefly served in Canada's armed forces in late 2017 but asked to be voluntarily released after 16 days of training, defence ministry spokeswoman Jessica Lamirande said.
The suspect's two-story red-brick home in a suburb north of Toronto was a crime scene on Tuesday, taped off and surrounded by police vehicles. Officers went in and out of the house.
South Koreans among victims
Details about the dead began to emerge on Tuesday, with a South Korean foreign ministry representative saying that two of that country's citizens were killed and one injured in the attack. The representative spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media.
A Jordanian citizen was also killed, said an official at the country's embassy in Ottawa.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corp identified one of the victims as Anne Marie D'Amico, an employee of asset manager Invesco Canada. In a statement, Invesco confirmed that one of its employees had been killed but did not name her.
It could be days before all the victims are publicly identified, said Ontario chief coroner Dirk Huyer said, adding that the extent of their injuries was making some identities difficult to determine.
“It ranges from scrapes and bruises to terrible injuries that I won't get into discussing here,” Gibson added.
The attack shook the usually peaceful streets of Toronto, which recorded 61 murders in 2017.
The drama started at lunchtime on a warm spring day, when the driver drove his vehicle into the crowds. The street was soon covered in blood, empty shoes and bodies.
Last October, eight people died in New York when a man driving a rented pickup truck mowed down pedestrians and cyclists on a bike path. The Islamic State militant group encourages its supporters to use vehicles for attacks.
The midweek Premier League fixtures threw up interesting results for FPL managers as those who like to experiment were more likely to succeed than those who stuck with conventional picks.
Kevin de Bruyne was the only man selected by more than 10 percent of FPL managers to make it to the Dream Team, as Theo Walcott, Emre Can, Nick Pope, Nathan Ake and Kieran Trippier made it a memorable gameweek for the mavericks likely to dabble in the differential market.
One man, in particular, is slowly but surely turning FPL heads on his return from injury.
Callum Wilson's good run benefits FPL backers
To fight back from one career-threatening injury is brave enough, to return from two and make it count like Callum Wilson seems to be doing is remarkable.
No one has benefitted from Eddie Howe's tweaks to the Bournemouth set-up than the English striker as he made it to the Dream Team for the second time in three weeks.
After a hat-trick in gameweek 12 against Huddersfield, Wilson went quiet till gameweek 20, where he bagged a goal against West Ham. In his last six gameweeks, the Englishman has fetched 41 points, courtesy of four goals and two assists.
More importantly, his two double-figure totals have come against Arsenal and Chelsea, in weeks when managers were likely to bench Wilson.
For Wilson, there's more at stake than just Premier League survival for his team. His form is peaking at the right moment, meaning that the only man ahead of him, Sergio Aguero, is priced double that of the Bournemouth forward.
As the race to be back-up to Harry Kane heats up, Wilson is certainly making a case for his inclusion with some fine hold-up play and incisive finishing. If 7 goals and 2 assists in 15 games since his return from injury are an indicator of his progress under Howe, that plane to Russia might just a seat with his name on it.
Hazard's erratic form a worry
The Belgian, normally one of the most reliable faces in the game, has been underwhelming by his own lofty standards this season. Goals and assists have come in patches, but much like Chelsea's own form, it's just not been consistent enough.
Now in his sixth season of English football, Hazard is headed for his second lowest points total ever, after the disastrous season of 2015-16. Despite having missed the first three games through injury, the Belgian has notched a goal or an assist on only eight occasions this term.
The flip-side to dropping players like Hazard is their tendency to explode but in the last 13 gameweeks, on only five occasions has he scored or assisted a goal. Many transferred him in for Chelsea's home game against Bournemouth, but the 3-0 loss merely prolonged the agonies of Hazard owners this season.
All eight midfielders with a higher total than the Chelsea wide midfielder have a lower price than him and barring Dele Alli, a higher points-to-minutes ratio than him. Others such as Anthony Martial, David Silva, Willian and Jesse Lingard have also done more justice to their time on the pitch than the Belgian.
At 10.7, it's not time to drop Hazard just yet but if you do have him in your team for more than 10 gameweeks now, maybe it's time for a re-think or a swap with a cheaper, more effective option. Raheem Sterling and Christian Eriksen present interesting alternatives.
Laporte may be fixed for City defence
A few weeks back, this column had advocated against City defenders due to the error-prone re-emergence of John Stones. With Aymeric Laporte's club-record acquisition from Athletic Bilbao, those problems may be a thing of the past as Laporte slotted in effortlessly alongside Nicolas Otamendi.
The obvious winners in this case are Kyle Walker owners, as they can look forward to a clean sheet alongside an assist or two. Those plumping for Ederson over David de Gea or Nick Pope are blessed as well, with the Brazilian having one of the safest pair of hands in the division.
The losers? Stones obviously as Guardiola's patience runs thin with the young English centre-back. Vincent Kompany's injury troubles could mean the end of his time at the Etihad. Laporte at 5.5 and Oleksandr Zinchenko at 5, also look good value for money in a new-look City defence.
Sturridge, Walcott, Benteke, Vardy, Sanchez: the differentials
West Brom managed to pull a mini-coup of sorts by signing Liverpool forward Daniel Sturridge. Body popping aside, the obvious benefits of signing a player of his calibre could be felt in his link-up play with forward Jay Rodriguez.
As with Wilson, both stand an outside chance for Russia 2018 but another man who has made a switch and reaping massive benefits is Theo Walcott. His two-goal return last week was the first time he netted a brace since 2016 and although a return to the Emirates is on the cards this week, the former Arsenal man could be an invaluable long-term addition before a potentially sudden price rise.
Christian Benteke's form isn't too shabby going into a home fixture against Newcastle as his last four returns for Crystal Palace read 5, 5, 5, 8. In Riyad Mahrez's absence, Jamie Vardy might have to do the heavy lifting and although not as prolific as Leicester's title winning season, 11 goals this term is a decent return for a club in mid-table.
Last but not least, Alexis Sanchez didn't have the best of starts for Manchester United but could be in the thick of things against a Huddersfield team going through the motions. A wounded United could easily run riot at Old Trafford and expect the Chilean to get involved in some goal-scoring action as Jose Mourinho's men look to bounce back from a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Tottenham Hotspur.
Captaincy picks
For the second week in a row, we would recommend staying away from the obvious obsession that is Harry Kane as Spurs travel to Liverpool. Now, the Reds have conceded a fair few this season but if anyone should be tipped to score in this match, it should be that man Mohamed Salah.
However, this column is obliged to go with form favourite Aguero for the second gameweek running as a trip to Turf Moor could mean trouble for Sean Dyche's Burnley. For all of Kane's exploits this season, Aguero stands only four goals and 18 points behind the Englishman and could close the gap further this weekend.
As long as Gabriel Jesus and Leroy Sané remain on the sidelines due to injury, a greater share of the goalscoring duties fall on the Argentine's head which mean that more play is likely to go through City's all-time leading goalscorer.
Risk-takers may involve Firmino or even Olivier Giroud, who is likely to start his first Chelsea game against Watford. It will be interesting to see how the latter syncs up with Hazard, as the Frenchman will be expected to hit the ground running owing to Alvaro Morata's wretched form.
For those with an even greater risk appetite, Wilson or even a rejuvenated Jordan Ayew, with four goals in his last seven might present a tempting option.
LaVar Ball said he could make the BIG3 league's four-point shot with his eyes closed.
Maybe that was his problem Sunday during a BIG3 event at Staples Center.
Ball made just one of those 30-foot shots during a shootout against BIG3 founder Ice Cube, while the rapper made two during the side-by-side competition to claim victory over the world's most notorious basketball dad.
Once a scoring-challenged college basketball player, Ball has made headlines by boasting that he could have beaten Michael Jordan in a one-on-one basketball game. Ice Cube challenged Ball to see who could make more four-point shots — a gimmick of the BIG3 — in a 90-second period when the touring league came to town this summer.
“Love what you're doing, baby!” Ice Cube said while issuing the friendly challenge. He added that he'd buy Big Baller Brand basketball shoes ($495 each) for every member of Ball's AAU basketball team.
Ball accepted the challenge last week with a recorded video message that was very LaVar Ball.
“Me and my crew gonna show you what we do,” said Ball, whose oldest son, Lonzo, was drafted No. 2 overall by the Lakers this summer. “I ain't scared of you, man. You know I hit them shots with my eyes closed.”
In the end, though, Ball wasn't able to live up to his boastful words. None of his shots went in — even though he crept up in front of the four-point zone for several of them — until the final 10 seconds of the challenge.
But, chances are, we haven't heard the last from Ball about his skills. Can't wait to hear what kind of spin he puts on this one.

At this point in the season, you've likely heard about the Columbus Blue Jackets and their 15-straight-wins-and-counting streak. They haven't lost a single game during the month of December, and on top of that, they've won several games in which they've scored six to 10 goals in:
Dec. 10, 2016, Vs. NYI: 6-2 CBJ
Dec. 20, 2016, Vs. PIT: 7-1 CBJ
Nov. 12, 2016, Vs. STL: 8-4 CBJ
Nov. 4, 2016, Vs. MTL: 10-0 CBJ
Considering the state they were in last season, finishing last in the Metropolitan Division, who would have projected them to end up where they are now? They've exceeded a lot of expectations, and the way they're going is a good indicator of how well they'll do in the 2017 Stanley Cup Playoffs.
In a fairly recent interview with Dean Lombardi, general manager of the Los Angeles Kings, he briefly talked about the Pittsburgh Penguins, who won the 2016 Stanley Cup, in a sit down for ‘Coffee with Bob', and this is some of what he had to say:
… part of a great regular season is that you're getting better throughout the whole season, and you're starting to peak at the right time. You can see it. Pittsburgh's formula is very similar – different team – but you saw those young players come up, there actually had been a coaching change, look at their record going into the playoffs. You catch people off guard, because they had their struggles early, but if you looked at that team from January on, that is where you want to be…
Columbus Blue Jackets Peak at Right Time
We're actually seeing this exact same scenario roll out in Columbus:
They're getting better throughout the season.
They have many young players coming up: Josh Anderson, Boone Jenner, William Karlsson, Lukas Sedlak, Alexander Wennberg, Scott Harrington, Seth Jones, Ryan Murray, Markus Nutivaara and Zach Werenski (all these guys are 23 or younger).
There had been a coaching change when they fired Todd Richards and brought in John Tortorella.
People were caught off guard by their sudden improvement.
They had their struggles early, especially in the 2015-16 season.
When it comes to the Stanley Cup Playoffs, though, winning games requires a different strategy than it does during the regular season. The Columbus Blue Jackets are accustomed to playing a different team every game night, and the playoffs just don't work that way. So what's going to happen if they get stuck playing a team who's strength is their strength? Will they be able to sustain record-setting wins if they face the San Jose Sharks four to seven games in a row?
The Power Play Is Trending
For those who've been keeping up with the Columbus Blue Jackets, you're well aware their special teams aren't just special, they're royal. They've established themselves as forces not to be reckoned with, and as a result, the Blue Jackets are leading the NHL on the power play.
Utilizing the power play to win games seems to be trending right now. It's how the United States were finally able to beat Canada at the 2017 World Juniors on New Year's Eve. They scored two power-play goals during the first period and ended up beating Canada 3-1 by the end of the night.
It's also how the Los Angeles Kings lost in the first round of the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs when the San Jose Sharks made beating them their official priority.
2010-11: Beat the Kings in the Conference Quarterfinals, 4-2
2011-12: Kings won Stanley Cup
2012-13: Lost to the Kings in Conference Semi-finals, 3-4
2013-14: Lost in the First Round, 3-4 and Kings won Stanley Cup
2015-16: Beat the Kings in the First Round, 4-1
The Sharks have spent the last two decades fighting for a Stanley Cup, and they knew their only chance at eventually winning one would rely on a plan to wipe out the Kings early on during the playoffs. So when the Sharks played the Blue Jackets on Oct. 15 and Oct. 27, 2016, it really wasn't all that surprising to see the Sharks come out on top.
The underlying question is, will the Blue Jackets be prepared in time to face the San Jose Sharks during the playoffs?
The only teams who've had success in beating the Blue Jackets rank high on the penalty kill:
Carolina Hurricanes Boston Bruins (beat Columbus twice) Washington Capitals St. Louis Blues (beat Columbus once) Minnesota Wild Toronto Maple Leafs Florida Panthers (beat Columbus once) New York Rangers San Jose Sharks (beat Columbus twice) Los Angeles Kings (beat Columbus once)
There's actually one team who saw victory over Columbus this season, who doesn't rank among the top 10 for penalty killing, and that is the Calgary Flames, who currently rank at #17.
Although the Sharks won't be playing against the Blue Jackets again during the 2016-17 regular season, if both teams do make the 2017 playoffs, Columbus may need to re-evaluate their strategy for success.
When Ruth Pahlke came home Friday evening from a Relay For Life event, she found she was unusually tired.
The next day, while packing for a trip, Pahlke felt completely sapped of energy and experienced pressure in her chest.
She went to the emergency room at the University of Alberta Hospital and was admitted for what doctors confirmed was a heart attack.
The unusual part is that she didn't have any blockage in her heart arteries — the cause of a traditional heart attack — Pahlke had a different, relatively unknown, type of attack. The condition is known as myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries, or Minoca.
READ MORE: B.C. man survives heart attack during CPR class
Dr. Kevin Bainey is a cardiologist at the Mazankowski Alberta Heart institute and happened to be Pahlke's doctor. From 2002 to 2014, Bainey conducted a study examining over 36,000 heart attack patients in Alberta. The results led to a few surprising conclusions.
“We found that the incidence of Minoca was about six per cent. In terms of their profile, this condition was found more commonly in females, as opposed to traditional heart attacks where they tend to be more common in males.”
The reason behind the increased risk for women to suffer Minoca is still mostly unknown, as the research around it is still in early stages.
Another implication of the study came in the rate of resurgence surrounding Minoca.
“In hospital, these patients had a one per cent chance of dying,” Bainey said, “but out at one year, these patients, their chance of death or having another heart attack was about five per cent. And out to five years, the chances of these patients dying was about 11 per cent.”

Bainey said that because the attacks aren't the result of arterial blockage, patients with signs of Minoca are sometimes sent home soon after their admittance, often prematurely. For this reason, Bainey made sure that Pahlke was not discharged until her condition could be properly treated.
“We need to be more vigilant about investigating the ultimate cause, because it has implications on the appropriate therapies for these patients,” Bainey said. “(Pahlke) needs to find out a cause before she goes home.”
Pahlke, sitting in her hospital room with one of her daughters and a grandchild visiting her, expressed gratitude over the diligence surrounding her care.
“I'm very fortunate to have (Dr. Bainey) as the first doctor they got ahold of, because it could quite possibly have happened that way, that they had just sent me home.”
Bainey's research study can be found in the International Journal of Cardiology.
A Seattle-area company has removed a school shooting video game from its online platform following widespread backlash.
The "Active Shooter" video game was pulled days before it was to be released on the video game marketplace Steam.
Valve Corp. as Steam's parent company said Tuesday that it was removing the computer video game because the developer was a "troll with a history of customer abuse."
The game was developed by Revived Games, published by Acid and led by a person named Ata Berdiyev. Valve spokesman Doug Lombardi says Berdiyev had previously been kicked off the platform under a different business name.
The game allows players to re-create school shootings by stalking school hallways and racking up kills.
It was condemned by the parents of students killed during a Florida school shooting in February.
The Seattle Times reports that an online petition urging Valve to pull the game before its scheduled June 6 release had more than 100,000 signatures.
Valve is a privately held company which has developed popular games such as "Dota 2" and "Half-Life."

The Sunil Mehta panel report on NPAs is nothing new. It's a rehash of what is already known, but neatly compartmentalised . It has also fought shy of suggesting 'roots and branches' reforms in our bank loan sanctions.
Despite embracing universal banking, banks are not ideally suited for funding mega projects and long term requirements. Their fixed deposit span is an average three years, and loans beyond this duration gives rise to the bankers' nightmare --- asset liability mismatch (ALM) --- though bankers overcome it by the hook or crook, brazening it out by liberally dipping into savings account deposits, secure in the knowledge that there is no one-to-one relationship established in this country between loans and their source. Be that as it may.
One significant 'roots and branches' reform on the banking front that the Modi government can make immediately is to shut the PSB doors to loans to big industrial houses, including listed companies, and generally to loans in excess of Rs 500 crore from the entire banking system.
There are companies in India that have already learnt to bypass bank loans for working capital purposes, by directly accessing the market through the issuance of commercial papers (CP). CPs are issued by profitable and reputed companies, at a discount to face value, for maturities ranging from 30 days to 365 days. It works out much cheaper than bank working capital loans sans security. Ironical as it might sound, banks, the very institutions sought to be bypassed, are the heaviest investors in CPs!
Bank loans should not be available for listed companies and other big ticket borrowers. Those borrowers must be forced to access the market through bonds of varied duration to meet their short, medium and long term requirements. bondholders' interests are taken care of by the trustees who are empowered to sell the mortgaged securities in case of default.
The Securitisation Act should be tweaked to allow trustees of bondholders too to take possession of the mortgaged assets and sell them without court approval. The market is a ruthless place and names and shames defaulters like no one does. Its an open and subterranean network of information flow and is dreaded by promoters of companies, because 'junk' status accorded to a company's bonds put the company, the group and the promoters in the doghouse like nothing else.
The bond market for the public in India is as good as non-existent and to whet the appetite of the small investor in particular, there must be made available a conversion (into equity shares) option on attractive terms.
Banks appraise loan applications themselves and are often blasé about the whole thing. Bonds to be issued to the public on the other hand are appraised by qualified merchant bankers who stand to lose their license should they be slack in their work. Indeed the 'Gangotri' of bad loans is the slack loan application appraisal. And industrial loans are by the very nature of things difficult to appraise in view of the vicissitudes of market and technology, unlike a simple gold or home loan.
It is best that banks shun them to start with for big ticket borrowers. Collateral that seems adequate to start-with slowly starts dissipating, all thanks to the vagaries of business and passage of time and also due to the shenanigans of the promoters.
Bonds generally do not command premium in the market unless they are convertible and the company is doing extremely well, rendering conversion a very good option. They also command a premium when the interest rates go down, and when the interest rates go up, the bond prices in the bourses go down. This is the fabled inverse relationship between bond prices and interest rates.
At present, there is no linkage between equity quotations in the bourses and the company's financial behavior with its bankers. But when bonds are also simultaneously listed, share quotations take a beating on any default in servicing bonds along with a sharp dip in bond prices.
Bank loans are not meant for big ticket borrowers. Congress president Rahul Gandhi's charge, that the suited and booted are walking away with poor depositors' money, may be long on spite and short on facts. But, the truth is big companies must be thrown to the harshness of the market.

There are few organizations in the world that can claim more expertise when it comes to storytelling than Pixar. The Disney-owned animation studio is known for its ability to consistently create world-class movies with gripping narrative alongside stunning visuals. Now, Pixar is helping others learn the secrets of great storytelling – for free, in partnership with online education provider Khan Academy.
The two have teamed up to create “Pixar In A Box,” and in this third instalment of the series, lessons are sourced from Pixar directors and story artists including Inside Out and Up director Pete Docter, Brave director Mark Andrews, Inside Out story artist Domee Shi, and Ratatouille animator Sanjay Patel.
The first lesson is available now, and will provide an introduction to storytelling as well as help you hone your initial creation of things like setting and character. The lessons include both videos and activities for students to complete, and provides a general basis on which to build. The next instalment will focus on Character creation specifically, and others segments will address storyboarding, emotional appeal and more, with releases happening throughout 2017.
Pixar's previous Khan Academy courses include topics like virtual cameras, effects and animations, but this is the first to focus on the less technical aspects of movie creation. I expect Pixar will offer me a job upon completion of this course and then I'll win my Oscar.
Edwards Design and Fabrication Inc. (Meridianville, AL, US), a specialty fabricator, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) have developed a modular protective system (MPS) that features PolyOne's GlasArmor continuous glass fiber-reinforced composite panels. This system creates modular ballistic shelters that are designed to protect American and allied soldiers in the field.
Concrete walls, sandbags and other traditional ballistic structures are heavy, difficult to move and time-consuming to construct. In contrast, MPS shelters are lightweight, portable and can be constructed in hours, rather than days, allowing soldiers to quickly deploy and establish positions of relative safety – even in remote locations.

Passengers on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship who were expecting to be on their way to the Bahamas instead spent the night stuck at a port in central Florida after Coast Guard inspectors found safety issues on board the ship.
News outlets report that passengers had already boarded the Majesty of the Seas when their Monday afternoon departure from Port Canaveral was delayed.
Coast Guard spokesman Ryan Dickinson said the delay had to do with the life-saving equipment on board, not the ship's engine. He did not give further details.
Royal Caribbean apologized to the delayed guests on Twitter and asked for patience.

Queen movie review: This is not a review, this is a protest
(Our critic has refused to rate this film)
This is not a review, this is a protest against whoever allowed this kindergarten-grade project to come to mainstream movie halls.
On most days, I would not have bothered to write about a nondescript film of such abysmal quality. Queen, however, must be discussed because its arrival is a symptom of what continues to ail India's distribution and exhibition sectors where so many good films — including some that have earned awards and critical acclaim at festivals — struggle to get a theatrical release for various reasons including, either that they are not big-banner, star-dominated ventures, or their producers do not have the clout or conviction to persuade theatre owners to give them shows.
I had read about this Malayalam film before I watched it this weekend. The Times of India, in a report dated 31 January, 2017, thought it fit to devote a whole article to Queen although it has no particular credentials to recommend it for such space. This was even before the casting, a time when indies by unknowns never get written about in the serious film press because critics are, rightly, waiting for the film to speak for itself. Yet TOI helpfully informed readers an entire year before Queen was out that it “is inspired from a real-life photograph which was floating around the internet once, of a girl in a sari walking the street before an entire group of her boy classmates. The director, Dijo Jose Antony, says that he himself is an engineer and he visited the college in the photo to learn more about their lives.” (sic)
What inspired The Times to expend so many words on Queen? Had they read the script and been convinced of its potential? If yes, could they tell us who on their staff displayed such godawful lack of discernment in not dismissing the script as the worthless potpourri it was/is. The nation — to borrow a line from one of this media group's most famous ex-employees — wants to know.
A day after the TOI report appeared, there came one in The New Indian Express (TNIE) dated 1 February, 2017, with more details of the project. TNIE went so far as to call Queen “a fun-filled college movie” although it was, as mentioned in the same sentence, yet to be made.
Now that I have seen Queen, I can assure you it is no fun at all. The story begins in a setting now familiar in Malayalam films: a college campus where male students fight with each other, harass women students and behave as if female Homo sapiens are rarer than Yeti and the Loch Ness monster. This obnoxious scenario where over-wrought masculinity plays out was most visible in last year's Chunkzz. That film was deeply offensive, but had a better cast and production values. Queen looks shabby and washed out in addition to being creepy.
The writing team's focus is the college's Mechanical Engineering course where the men break out into a testosterone-induced frenzy when they hear that a woman is joining their class. This leads to further disturbing scenes of stalking and harassment projected as comedy. I am not bothering to spare you from spoilers here, because this film does not deserve that effort.
So anyway, next the woman wins the men over with her sunshine smile. Once they stop misbehaving with her, they fight with others who do. Once they are done with that they discover she has cancer. Once the film is done with that episode, she heads straight out of the hospital and on to the college campus to dance in a bright red sari surrounded by hordes of her male college mates and — for some reason I did not bother to wrack my brains over — an elephant. Next she is raped and killed. Next her character is assassinated in court, in the press and on the streets. Next, her classmates fight for justice for her. Next, they win. Next, the film ends.
The tragedy is that in the courtroom scenes, a lawyer (played by veteran Salim Kumar) does make a couple of pertinent points about the victim shaming flying around. Those questions do not matter though because for this film, rape is not an issue of serious concern as much as it is yet another masala item to throw into the mix to spice up a screenplay.
Come to think of it, calling Queen a film is a compliment. An uncharismatic lead cast and some established character artistes have come together in this non-film to act out an amateurish screenplay on sets that might not pass muster with the drama team of a respected school.
What is infuriating is not just that Queen was made but that it somehow travelled to theatres in Kerala and from there has even travelled outside the state. This is no mean feat.
One of the films on my list of Best Mollywood Films of 2017 published on this website last month was Dr Biji's Kaadu Pookunna Neram (When The Woods Bloom), a gripping tale of the troubled equation between oppressed tribal communities and the state as represented by the police. It starred Rima Kallingal and Indrajith Sukumaran (both marquee names), it boasted of world-class cinematography, it was intelligent, politically courageous and entertaining. Biju is a multiple National Award winner. Kallingal has won several prestigious awards. None of this was enough to recommend Kaadu Pookunna Neram to distributors and theatres outside Kerala. Even getting to a theatre within Kerala was a struggle.
There are so many great films that audiences are deprived of seeing because their producers do not push them enough, and when they do, India's distribution companies and theatres do not want to risk backing them, if not because they lack star value then because of their unconventional themes. In a scenario where the likes of Kaadu Pookunna Neram struggle to get to us, it is almost criminal that Queen has come so far.

I'm a big fan of what 20th Century Fox has done with their revitalized Planet of the Apes franchise. Rise of the Planet of the Apes successfully rebooted the title back in 2011, acting as a palate cleanser to Tim Burton‘s 2001 mess of an attempt. Then, defying all expectations, the 2014 sequel Dawn of the Planet of the Apes outdid its predecessor, shifting the focus to Caesar as he rallied his fellow apes against the humans. Now, this summer's War for the Planet of the Apes looks to be the most action-packed installment yet, but it also promises to have unique characters for audiences to meet.
Enter: Bad Ape, the curiously named critter for which Steve Zahn provides the voice and motion-capture performance. The new character is introduced in this lengthy clip, and it's clear that he's not the most stable of the apes. How that pans out for Caesar and his crew remains to be seen…
Also starring Andy Serkis, Woody Harrelson, Amiah Miller, Karin Konoval, Judy Greer and Terry Notary, Matt Reeves‘ War for the Planet of the Apes opens July 14th.
Check out the new clip from War for the Planet of the Apes, followed by a new poster featuring Bad Ape:
And here's the official synopsis:
In War for the Planet of the Apes, the third chapter of the critically acclaimed blockbuster franchise, Caesar and his apes are forced into a deadly conflict with an army of humans led by a ruthless Colonel. After the apes suffer unimaginable losses, Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and begins his own mythic quest to avenge his kind. As the journey finally brings them face to face, Caesar and the Colonel are pitted against each other in an epic battle that will determine the fate of both their species and the future of the planet.

Alix Matthew, Gael Gonzalez-Peltier, Amy Eloi, Edna Constance, Sierra Richards and Rainah Winston all earned bachelor of science degrees specializing in biology with chemistry minors.
Kyle Gordon earned a bachelor of science in mechanical engineering.
Rochie Royer earned a bachelor of applied arts and sciences.
Both Gordon and Graham were honored for outstanding leadership and contributions to the Caribbean program.
However, the Dominican students, in general, were outstanding ambassadors for the program, according to Dr. Randy Glean, program director.
Keynote speaker, Dr. Jenner Joseph, a Dominican who was the first student enrolled in the university's Caribbean program in 1993, encouraged the students to bring positive changes to their world as they seek to enhance their credentials. He urged them to maintain the social conscience that formed the core value of the program.
Dr. Joseph, an SMA alum from Goodwill, graduated from MSU in 1997 before earning his doctorate at Washington University. He is now
a medical systems engineer.
Over 200 Dominican students have earned degrees from Midwestern since 1995 and eighty-five students are currently enrolled, making it the largest contingent from any foreign country at the university.
Twenty new students from Dominica will arrive at the university to begin studies in August.
The Government of Dominica provides support to the largest contingent of students from the region in a working partnership with the university.
Mr. David Vital of Lead Institute, also an MSU alumnus, serves as the local facilitator. Minister of Education, Hon. Petter Saint Jean visited MSU last April and pledged continuing support for the partnership with the government.
South Africa telecommunications regulator Indepdent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) has included a shared 100 kHz wide band at 5 MHz (60 meters) of 5,350 to 5,450 kHz in its just-published National Radio Frequency Plan 2018, at a maximum power of 15 W EIRP. The band is being made available on a non-interference basis. In addition, ICASA allocated a single channel at 5,290 kHz for the 5 MHz propagation research project. The National Radio Frequency Plan 2018 is a nearly 300-page document that covers the entire radio frequency spectrum. South African Radio League (SARL) President Nico van Rensburg, ZS6QL, said the SARL had worked with ICASA to get the new allocation.
“Clearly, our persistent interaction with ICASA has paid dividends,” he commented. “This is, however, not the end of the road as, in the new band plan, power on 5 MHz is restricted to the WRC-15 agreement of 15 W EIRP. Continue to use 5,290 kHz for WSPR and await the announcement of the 60-meter band plan before operating on the new allocation.”
The channel of 5,290 kHz has been allocated for WSPR beacons deployed in the SARL Propagation Research project. Due to licensing issues, the SARL has kept low key on the 5,290 kHz beacon project.
“We now can go full steam ahead,” SARL Regulatory Manager Hans van de Groenendaal, ZS6AKV, said. “There are no longer any restrictions, and no application for use of the 60-meter band is required.” — Thanks to SARL and to Paul Gaskell, G4MWO, editor of The 5 MHz Newsletter
In another White people's version of thug life, one English driver was like “eff the police” when he decided to throw his middle finger up at speed cameras while driving.
Timothy Hill, 67, even fitted a laser jammer to his Range Rover to prevent any device from picking up his speed. Timothy was thus able to throw the big ones up and possibly get away with speeding back in December 2017, according to BBC.
However, this all turned out to be the wrong move since police were able to identify Timothy via the cameras. He even tried to destroy his laser jammer when he found out police were investigating.
With the footage as evidence, cops were able to bring Timothy in for questioning.
He eventually admitted to his middle finger mischief, although they couldn't charge him with speeding since his speed couldn't be picked up. They did however slap him with “perverting the course of justice” and he was jailed for eight months and banned from driving for 16 months.

Eesh.
Makes me wonder, did the fam have their “Free Timothy” shirts on and ready…
…or maybe not.
Also On Magic 95.9:
Henry James, T.S. Eliot and W.H. Auden did not want to endure a biography, and tried desperately but vainly to prevail against predatory life-writers. In his essay on the French novelist George Sand, James boldly mounted a military defense: “The pale, forewarned victim, with every track covered, every paper burnt and every letter unanswered, will, in the tower of art … [withstand] the siege of all the years.”
Like the biographer in “The Aspern Papers,” whom Henry James calls a “publishing scoundrel,” James Atlas penetrated the citadels of Delmore Schwartz and Saul Bellow, who portrayed Schwartz as the title character in his novel “Humboldt's Gift.” Schwartz achieved a stunning success with his first story, “In Dreams Begin Responsibilities,” but Atlas had difficulty describing the depressing descent of the writer, during the last half of his life, from literary god to self-destructive drunkard. Schwartz also wrote a mass of inferior work and the tin-eared Atlas is forced to praise his feeble imitations of Eliot.
Atlas is a literary biographer who attempts in “The Shadow in the Garden” to provide an account of his work and his obsessions. The biographer is an artist on oath who must weigh all the evidence like a lawyer and always do justice to the subject. Atlas was awed at first by the magnitude of his task, resurrected many obscure but worthy figures, didn't linger on boring genealogy, felt the voyeuristic thrill of discoveries that seemed to jump off the page, delighted in knowing more about the subject than anyone else in the world, struggled for permission to quote (sometimes rescinded), fended off the political correctness of editors, remembered to thank everyone in the acknowledgments (some authors chastise those who refused to help) and got both nasty and gratifying letters from readers.
Biographers should remain an unobtrusive presence, concentrate on the reader's interest rather than their own obsessions.
But with Bellow, as with Schwartz, Atlas was not always equal to the task. Bellow's life was lacerated by outraged friends, family vendettas and extortionate ex-wives. Atlas declares that “the multiple marriages and general chaos of his life exacted a high toll.” But he doesn't recognize that these personal disasters provided incandescent material and inspired Bellow's imagination. Bellow thrived on chaos and needed to suffer in order to create: no tears in the writer, no tears in the reader. He was alienated from his three sons by three different wives, but compensated with three literary replacements: Martin Amis, James Wood and Leon Wieseltier.
On March 30, 1994, after I'd asked Bellow about writing his biography, he explained that Atlas “came to me and told me he had already signed a contract for the book. On a few occasions I have talked to him about my life and deeds. But I have his number I assure you.” In this book, Atlas admits that he was “ungenerous” and “had outbursts of spite.” He describes how he cunningly allayed the suspicions of the patient and generous Bellow and extracted what he needed. During the 11 years he took to write the biography, he fell prey to a common danger and resented Bellow for devouring his life. His biography was unremittingly negative and his moral judgments portrayed him as superior to his subject. Atlas is least interesting in the present book when he talks about himself and tries to disguise his egoism and arrogance with a veneer of mock modesty.

He is severe about the social critic Dwight Macdonald, who spent many hours editing Atlas' life of Schwartz. An envious blowhard, Macdonald exclaimed that “Hemingway couldn't write” and that the learned man-of-letters Edmund Wilson was only interested in “showing off how much he'd read.” Atlas later notes that Wilson “never showed off his vast erudition.” Finally, Atlas found the “fierce, irascible, antagonistic” Macdonald intolerably oppressive.
Atlas' portraits of Alfred Kazin and Richard Ellmann are accurate. Kazin, whom Schwartz called “a serious menace to criticism,” was venomous, rebarbative and bitter. Ellmann, whose life of James Joyce is the greatest modern biography, was brilliant and kind. But in a fit of pique Atlas misjudges John Bayley, who refused to tutor him at Oxford. Bayley (I can attest) was an exceptionally stimulating lecturer and teacher. His memoir of his wife Iris Murdoch descending into the darkness of Alzheimer's, “Elegy for Iris” is not “pitiless,” as Atlas asserts, but self-sacrificial and sympathetic.
Atlas is least interesting in the present book when he talks about himself.
“The Shadow in the Garden” has no clear structure. Atlas was urged to follow chronology and avoid a meandering narrative. But he has no table of contents, chapter titles or preface to guide the reader through his chaotic work. He jumps around like a demented frog, returning to the same subjects in different chapters and dropping derivative sketches of Greek and Roman historians into the middle of the book. Hundreds of pointless and irritating footnotes force the reader to jump between two parallel texts. The friends he profusely thanks for reading his typescript should have corrected his two-dozen errors (list on request).
Atlas describes following the authors' trajectory from birthplace through foreign travels to the grave (“Death,” Atlas sadly observes, “is the biographer's worst enemy”), studying unpublished letters and manuscripts in widely scattered archives, searching for school records, finding family and friends to interview, and discovering that famous older people are often quite lonely. During interviews he did not use a tape recorder. He learned to draw people out and remain silent, to take notes while eating and (sometimes) getting drunk, adding to his notes immediately after leaving. He refereed fights, often about money, between the children of different wives. My own responses from valuable sources ranged from “I curse the day you ever heard my name” when I tried to extract a privately owned manuscript by Somerset Maugham to “I've been waiting all my life for you to come” from the daughter of Robert Frost's lover.
But there's no need, as Atlas suggests, to “get it all in.” Not everything matters and you don't have to scrutinize “every electric bill, every grocery list, every torn envelope.” Biographers should remain an unobtrusive presence, concentrate on the reader's interest rather than their own obsessions and focus not on the facts of the life but on what these facts mean.
Atlas, who can't quite break free from his subject, ends his book with a description of his own life that inadvertently recalls the sad end of Schwartz. The writer took out his garbage, suffered a heart attack and died in the elevator of a seedy Times Square hotel. Atlas carries his garbage bag out to the hall, pushes the button of the elevator and hurries back to his apartment before something terrible happens to him.
Meyers has published 25 biographies of authors, artists and actors. His memoir with biographical chapters, “Resurrections: Writers, Heroes — and a Spy,” will appear next year.

A man vomited on the windows and seats of a train to Scunthorpe before urinating at the town's station and trespassing on the railway, police say.
Officers from British Transport Police have released an image of a man they wish to speak to in connection with the incident, which happened on Monday, January 8.
Police say they believe the man in the image may have information which could help the investigation and have asked anyone who thinks they may know his identity to come forward.
A British Transport Police statement said: "The incident happened between around 3.25pm and 4.25pm on Monday, January 8.
"The offender boarded a train at Grimsby Town station with two friends who were all behaving in an anti-social manner.
"On the train, he threw up on the seats and windows, then spat on the windows.
"They left the train at Scunthorpe where the offender urinated under the station footbridge. He then trespassed on the railway by walking across the railway lines from platform 2 to 1 to re-join his friends and leave the station.
"If you think you may know who this man is, please call BTP on 0800 405040 or text 61016, quoting reference number 316 of January 8, 2018."
When astronauts set foot on Mars, they may stay for months rather than days as they did during Apollo missions to the moon. The surface of Mars has extreme temperatures and the atmosphere does not provide adequate protection from high-energy radiation. These explorers will need shelters to effectively protect them from the harsh Martian environment and provide a safe place to call home.
For researchers at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, the best building material for a new home on Mars may lie in an unexpected material: ice.
Starting with a proposed concept called “Mars Ice Dome,” a group of NASA experts and passionate designers and architects from industry and academia came together at Langley's Engineering Design Studio. The project was competitively selected through the Space Technology Mission Directorate's (STMD) Center Innovation Fund to encourage creativity and innovation within the NASA Centers in addressing technology needs. This is just one of many potential concepts for sustainable habitation on the Red Planet in support of the agency's journey to Mars.
“After a day dedicated to identifying needs, goals and constraints we rapidly assessed many crazies, out of the box ideas and finally converged on the current Ice Home design, which provides a sound engineering solution,” said Langley senior systems engineer Kevin Vipavetz, facilitator for the design session.
The team at Langley had assistance in their concept study, as a collaborative team from Space Exploration Architecture and the Clouds Architecture Office that produced a first-prize winning entry for the NASA Centennial Challenge for a 3D-printed habitat (Mars Ice House) played a key role in the design session.
The “Mars Ice Home” is a large inflatable torus, a shape similar to an inner tube, that is surrounded by a shell of water ice. The Mars Ice Home design has several advantages that make it an appealing concept. It is lightweight and can be transported and deployed with simple robotics, then filled with water before the crew arrives. It incorporates materials extracted from Mars, and because water in the Ice Home could potentially be converted to rocket fuel for the Mars Ascent Vehicle, the structure itself doubles as a storage tank that can be refilled for the next crew.
Another critical benefit is that water, a hydrogen-rich material, is an excellent shielding material for galactic cosmic rays – and many areas of Mars have abundant water ice just below the surface. Galactic cosmic rays are one of the biggest risks of long stays on Mars. This high-energy radiation can pass right through the skin, damaging cells or DNA along the way that can mean an increased risk for cancer later in life or, at its worst, acute radiation sickness.
Space radiation is also a significant challenge for those designing potential Mars outposts. For example, one approach would envision habitats buried underneath the Martian surface to provide radiation shielding. However, burying the habitats before the crews arrive would require heavy robotic equipment that would need to be transported from Earth.
The Ice Home concept balances the need to provide protection from radiation, without the drawbacks of an underground habitat. The design maximizes the thickness of ice above the crew quarters to reduce radiation exposure while also still allowing light to pass through ice and surrounding materials.
“All of the materials we've selected are translucent, so some outside daylight can pass through and make it feel like you're in a home and not a cave,” Kempton said.
Selecting materials that would accomplish these goals was a challenge for materials experts.
“The materials that make up the Ice Home will have to withstand many years of use in the harsh Martian environment, including ultraviolet radiation, charged-particle radiation, possibly some atomic oxygen, perchlorates, as well as dust storms – although not as fierce as in the movie ‘The Martian',” said Langley researcher Sheila Ann Thibeault.
In addition to identifying potential materials, a key constraint for the team was the amount of water that could be reasonably extracted from Mars. Experts who develop systems for extracting resources on Mars indicated that it would be possible to fill the habitat at a rate of one cubic meter, or 35.3 cubic feet, per day. This rate would allow the Ice Home design to be completely filled in 400 days. The design could be scaled up if water could be extracted at higher rates.
Additional design considerations include a large amount of flexible workspace so that crews would have a place to service robotic equipment indoors without the need to wear a pressure suit. To manage temperatures inside the Ice Home, a layer of carbon dioxide gas would be used as in insulation between the living space and the thick shielding layer of ice. And, like water, carbon dioxide is available on Mars.
It's important, Kempton said, for astronauts to have something to look forward to when they arrive on the Red Planet.
“After months of travel in space, when you first arrive at Mars and your new home is ready for you to move in, it will be a great day,” he said.
No. 1 Dow tennis team going for third straight state title
You could call them the Warriors and the Cavaliers of Division 1 girls tennis in Michigan.
Just as those two basketball teams are meeting for a fourth straight year in the NBA Finals, it appears that Dow High and Northville will be the top contenders for the fourth straight time in the Division 1 state tennis finals on Friday and Saturday at the Greater Midland Tennis Center.
Dow is ranked No. 1 and Northville No. 2. The two teams tied for the state title last year, Dow took first and Northville took second in 2016, and Northville won and Dow was runner-up in 2015.
"The two of us are probably in the best position based on the draws, and (No. 3) Bloomfield Hills is a slight step behind," Dow tennis coach Garrett Turner said. "It looks like it's probably going to be another showdown (between Northville and us) on Saturday.
"But we have to take care of business on Friday (first)," he noted.
Competition begins at 8:30 a.m. Friday.
Each of the four singles flights and four doubles flights has five rounds of play at the single-elimination state tournament, three of which will be completed on Friday - leaving only the semifinal and final rounds to be played Saturday morning and early afternoon.
Twenty-two teams will be represented at the tournament, including one other local team, Saginaw Heritage.
Every Dow flight earned a first-round bye.
Dow's Jessica Brown at No. 1 singles is unseeded in the toughest flight of the tournament. She'll open against unseeded Margaret Goldberg of Ann Arbor Pioneer in the second round, and the winner will likely face second seed Tia Mukherjee of Bloomfield Hills in the quarterfinals.
Zoe Angell is the third seed at No. 2 singles and opens against unseeded Caroline Norton of Ann Arbor Skyline.
Sarah Ismail is the top seed at No. 3 singles and will face an unseeded player to be determined in her first match.
Hadley Camp is the second seed at No. 4 singles and likewise will face an unseeded player to be determined.
At No. 1 doubles, Tatum Matthews and Kelly Livingston have the second seed and will meet an unseeded team in their opener.
At No. 2, Meghan Killmaster and Victoria Leiti have the third seed and play Megan Foley and Saige Jost of Saline to start.
At No. 3, Giacomina Fabiano and Christina VanderKelen are the third seed and play Nina Ellsworth and Sarah Roberts of Saline to start.
At No. 4, Amelie Kraef and Reema Patel are the top seed and will face an unseeded team to start.
Seven of Dow's 12 starters are seniors - Brown, Ismail, Camp, Matthews, Livingston, Fabiano and VanderKelen - and have already achieved unprecedented success as a class in the Charger tennis program.
"They've already created a strong footprint," Turner said. "They've been runners-up and have won two state titles. No other (class of) tennis players at Dow High can say they've been able to do what these girls have done."
Northville's singles players, meanwhile, are seeded first, second, fourth and fifth in their respective flights.
The Mustangs' doubles flights are seeded first, first, fourth and second, respectively.
This will be one of the few times in recent years that the Dow seniors won't have their commencement ceremonies on the Friday evening of the state tennis tournament - since commencement was held last Thursday at Dow Diamond for the first time.
"That's one thing that they don't have to deal with this year, and hopefully that will be helpful (to allow them to focus on the tournament)," Turner said.

In an industrial park on the edge of Shanghai, a dozen Chinese teenagers are taking a break from battling digital armies to focus on their yoga. They are members of EDG, one of China's top electronic sports teams, who spend six days a week in a military-style training compound to become world beaters in video games.
EDG's players — when not doing yoga to stay limber — spend most of their time at the camp wielding virtual weaponry playing multi-player battle games like “League of Legends” or Tencent Holdings Ltd's popular “Honour of Kings”.
The team's top players can rake in up to 30 million yuan ($4.54 million) a year each from tournament prize money, commercial endorsements and payments from avid fans who spend hours watching them play online.
China's craze for e-sports is being propelled by the country's booming video game market, the world's largest and one that is expected to register $27.5 billion in sales this year, according to the gaming consultancy Newzoo.
Game developers like Tencent and NetEase Inc, and others like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, are competing to market video games, fill stadiums with fans and sell broadcast rights to the matches.
“We have found the fastest-growing and biggest demand is in e-sports, and we are following that trend,” said Wang Guan, general manager of e-sports at Alisports, an Alibaba subsidiary.
Cities around the country are looking to cash in on the market's fast growth with video game theme-parks and e-sports venues. Some universities are even rolling out gaming degrees.
Alisports, which organises the World Electronic Sports Games, successfully lobbied the Olympic Council of Asia to include e-sports at the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou.
The extent of the e-gaming boom was on display in Beijing in November at the world final of League of Legends, with a prize of over $4 million at stake.
A crowd of more than 40,000 people packed into the city's Olympic Bird's Nest stadium to watch the South Korean gaming stars Faker and CuVee go head to head.
The raucous crowd, a bigger turnout than most local soccer games, underlined how popular gaming as a hobby and spectator sport has become in China.
Jiang Ping, 17, a university student in Beijing, paid 4,000 yuan to watch the final with his aunt. They were lucky: tickets sold on the grey market reportedly rose to more than 20 times the original price due to high demand.
“When I started playing this game five years ago, there weren't that many people,” Jiang said. “Now the numbers are huge, and even the game itself is now owned by a Chinese firm, Tencent.” Tencent owns the League of Legends developer Riot Games.
Tencent or Die
The city of Wuhu, a backwater three hours away from Shanghai, is a symbol of China's gaming potential — as well as its risks.
Many local governments have been seeking to develop more specialised industries, and Wuhu has targeted e-sports. In May, the city signed a deal with Tencent to build an e-sports university and a stadium for events. Other cities, like Zhongxian in the municipality of Chongqing, are also building facilities to profit from the e-sports boom.
Some industry participants, however, are already worried about a bubble forming, and rising debt levels as local governments jump into e-sports investment.
“Maybe some of the developers don't have pure intentions, they are just using e-sports as an excuse to get land at a cheap price from local government,” said Tao Junyin, marketing director of VSPN, a leading e-sports content company.
Han Li, manager of Wuhu's e-sports association, said the city had discussed ideas including an e-sports-themed hotpot restaurant, bar and cinema, in addition to the gaming school and arena.
Ultimately, though, China's gaming giants are the ones calling the shots, he said. “Tencent has a controlling power in the whole industry, so we have to find a way to work with Tencent. You either die or you go Tencent,” he said. Tencent declined to comment.
Socialist Values
Local gamers also face tougher regulation than peers in the United States, South Korea or Japan, with a recent government push to emphasize “core socialist values” in entertainment products including songs, online streaming and video games.
This year, Tencent limited the time children could play its popular Honour of Kings game after coming under fire over gaming addiction. In November it said it would bring the top-selling game “Playerunknown's Battleground” to China, but would tweak the game to fit with “socialist core values”.
Tencent's main local rival, NetEase, has already embedded banners with patriotic slogans into one of its popular battlefield games to head off official criticism. “In China, you have to follow the government's decree,” said Tao of VSPN. “But you can always make moderations to the games so that it will pass the censor.”
Nonetheless, China's youth seem enthralled, prompting some universities to start offering e-sports degrees, from professional gaming to e-sports commentating and graphic design. Liu Xuefeng, a freshman from Anhui province, applied for a gaming degree program in the western city of Chengdu - despite facing push-back from his concerned parents.
“I am very interested in this program, and they couldn't stop me, so they had to cave in the end,” he said, adding that he wanted to be an e-sports commentator. “There is great potential in the development of the gaming business.”
The allure of becoming the next big gaming star is already sparking fierce competition to get into the market, said David Ng, head of Super Generation Investment, which owns the EDG e-sports team.
“Sometimes we will have a thousand application letters in our mailbox to join our team on a single day.”

Police officers in a district of southern India had an unusual assignment. They traveled from village to village early this month to tell people that some messages that had gone viral on the WhatsApp service were fake.
The messages claimed that a gang from northern India had arrived to kidnap children. One showed two photographs of a man being taken away by police with the text: “Please take care of your children. Don't send them alone.”
S.P. Pakalavan, police superintendent in the Vellore district of Tamil Nadu state, ordered officers at the 57 stations under his jurisdiction to dispel the rumor. Traveling by motorbike and auto rickshaw, some with speakers mounted on top, they covered nearly 700 villages over four days, Pakalavan said.
“That was the only way to pacify the panic-stricken residents,” he said.
Other parts of Tamil Nadu were not so fortunate. Two people were killed in the state on May 9 by mobs that believed they were child traffickers. A man was beaten and hanged from a bridge, and separately a 63-year-old woman was lynched when she and her relatives, while traveling to a temple, reportedly stopped to hand candies to children.
Police say there was no truth to the rumors and that WhatsApp has become a vehicle for mayhem and fake news in India, its biggest market with 200 million active users. Law enforcement officials say they are struggling to combat the spread of false information on the popular platform, especially messages that preach communal hatred or encourage violence.
Shirish Inamdar, a former deputy police commissioner in the western state of Maharashtra, said in an interview that the messaging service has become “a monster” as uneducated users lack the awareness to verify rumors and educated users use the platform to spread hate.
Officials with the Menlo Park-based company, which is owned by Facebook, say that policing false information is challenging because unlike Facebook, WhatsApp messages are private and encrypted and the company does not read content unless a user reports it for being offensive. The company says it is trying to educate users to be more vigilant about potentially harmful messages.
“WhatsApp has made communications easier and more reliable for millions of Indians, including community organizations and local police. Though sadly, some people also use WhatsApp to spread harmful misinformation,” the company said in a statement to The Times.
“We're stepping up our education efforts so that people know about our safety features and how to spot fake news and hoaxes.”
According to police, at least five people were killed in southern India over the past two weeks in connection with rumors on WhatsApp of child kidnapping gangs, including some that “smash skulls and devour brains.” Another 10 people were beaten in related cases, police said.
In Karnataka state, the messages involved violence, including videos of mobs dragging a bloodied man through the street and roughing up two unidentified men before handing them over to police.
An accompanying message claimed that 400 child traffickers had arrived in Bangalore, the state capital, and said in English: “Be on high alert. 3 kids were kidnapped from my friend's area this morning. There were 10 guys giving biscuits and people from that area have caught all 10, and five more based on their information.”
Another message accused transgender people of being involved in child trafficking. Over the weekend, in the southern city of Hyderabad, a mob attacked a group of transgender women, killing one and seriously injuring two.
When police arrived, onlookers reportedly attacked their vehicle, accusing them of protecting kidnappers. Some officers were injured. More than 20 suspected attackers were arrested, and police said they were placing members of the transgender community, homeless people and others at risk of beatings into shelters, or asking them to leave the city temporarily.
Hyderabad police launched a campaign to urge people not to believe the social media content “which is creating unnecessary panic.”
They were not the first instances of violence related to WhatsApp messages, authorities said. In May 2017 in the northern state of Jharkhand, police said seven innocent men were killed after messages spread about a kidnapping gang from other parts of India. Two men were arrested in the killings.
In September 2015, Hindu extremists in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh spread word that a Muslim man had killed a cow — which is sacred to orthodox Hindus — and kept it in his refrigerator. A mob subsequently barged into his house and lynched him. Police filed charges in the killing against nearly 20 people, most of whom are out on bail.
Indian political parties have used WhatsApp to rally followers, and radical groups are using it to promote communal hatred in a country increasingly divided between majority Hindus and members of minority communities, including Muslims.
In a recent state election in Karnataka, party workers were among those blamed for circulating fake polls, hoaxes about the killings of Hindu activists and false claims that a Muslim lawmaker had promised “unending bloodshed of Hindus” if voted into power.
Amid the growing outcry, and with national elections due next year, WhatsApp said this month that it had instituted new features for its group messaging option — one of the most common ways that hoaxes spread rapidly — giving administrators greater control over membership in the group. The company is also expected to introduce a feature that will make it more obvious when a new message has been forwarded by another user, in a bid to encourage the reader to think twice about its content.
But some say that Indians will remain vulnerable to false messages that confirm their prejudices.
“In a society increasingly polarized along caste and religious lines, it becomes easier to exploit that through WhatsApp [messages],” said Inamdar, the former police official.
“The ones [often] sharing communal propaganda on WhatsApp are educated people, the middle class, which we used to call the backbone of our society,” he said. “That is most worrying. Our law-and-order machinery, along with cybersecurity bodies, have failed miserably to judge this danger.”

If you're a fan of physicists Lawrence Krauss, here's a half-hour video in which he's interviewed by Steve Paikin of the Candian channel TVO's show The Agenda. (Paikin is 57: can you believe it?) I was once on his show, and was impressed by Paikin's preparation and probing questions, as well as his ability to direct the interview and his practice of letting the interviewee speak without excessive intrusion. He's one of the best interviewers going, and I'm sure he read Krauss's book (as he read me, as it was full of his notes and bookmarks).
Krauss's spiel is very similar to his talk at to Imagine No Religion meetings (for which he got a standing ovation), and is centered on his new history of modern physics,The Greatest Story Ever Told–So Far: Why Are We Here? Although the book doesn't add much to similar histories, Krauss excels in his public talks on physics, infecting the audience with his own enthusiasm for science. You get a flavor of this in the interview.

In college, Mike Webster was the best center in the Big Ten. He was drafted in 1974 to the Pittsburgh Steelers, where he served as starting center for 150 straight games, bringing the team to four Super Bowl victories. At 260 pounds, “Iron Mike” was the toughest player on the field; he played bare-fisted in freezing weather and took injuries in stride.
At age 50, Webster died of a heart attack — homeless, divorced, and having suffered from dementia, amnesia, depression, and acute bone and muscle pain for years. After his death, he was diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease found in those who have had multiple head injuries. Webster's doctors believed his disability was directly linked to multiple football-related head injuries, and they are continuing to diagnose a number of other former players with CTE. The autopsies led to an eventual lawsuit resulting in a multi-million dollar settlement by the NFL and a fierce nationwide debate on the unspoken risks of football.
The data is in, and the potential life-long damage of football is becoming ever more apparent. Studies by researchers at Boston University have found evidence of CTE in 99 percent of former NFL players studied (110 of 111 brains), including one who had never had a concussion, as well as 91 percent of college football athletes and 21 percent of high school players. CTE is characterized by tiny tangles of tau protein clustered around blood vessels; defective tau is associated with CTE as well as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. While the study represents a biased sample, based on brains donated by families of individuals who likely showed potential signs of CTE, it is still a breakthrough in this area of study, demonstrating the inextricable link between football and brain damage.
A study from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill showed that 11 percent of former NFL players suffer from clinical depression, with a threefold risk in those with a history of three or four concussions.
Though Webster's case is extreme — a result of years of tough professional football — young athletes are far from immune to lifelong brain damage.
A recent study in the medical journal Translational Psychiatry showed that kids who played football before age 12 were more than twice as likely to have impaired mood and behavior later in life. And in one of the Boston University studies, while the high school players studied showed mild symptoms, both the professional and college players showed severe symptoms. Many high schools have dropped football due to well-founded worries about its effects on their players, and at the college level, even in the NESCAC, the hits are often even harder.
Though football is an American pastime, the most popular form of entertainment nationwide, is the harm it can cause to players worth the risk?
Tufts should say no. As a research university with a medical school and as a supposedly progressive institution, Tufts should join the movement to challenge football as it exists currently. With resources to de-stigmatize and cope with mental illness, it is imperative that Tufts also challenge the risks football poses to students' mental health. Radically restructuring the football program and investing in resources to make the sport safer would send a strong message to other educational institutions that students' health and safety is a priority.
Aside from their associated health risks, college football programs — especially at the non-Div. I level — are notoriously difficult to maintain. Universities such as Boston University, the University of Vermont and Northeastern University are a few schools who have disbanded their teams, some of whom cited financial strain. For most, the financial costs of upkeep for football teams far outweigh their potential revenue.
However, many schools have continually maintained and even added football programs in recent years in an effort to drive alumni donations and raise their profiles among prospective students. University officials also say football is a source of school pride, bringing the community together through games and homecoming events. But football isn't the only way to achieve those goals; there are many other programs, such as the dance and theater programs, that could fulfill this role.
Tufts should critically examine the football program and work to make it safer. Simple steps like strengthening concussion protocols, continuing to work with partner institutions and eliminating kickoffs — a change that is already being discussed in the NFL — are necessary to ensure that our program is safe for students. If none of these avenues lead to risk reduction, Tufts should re-evaluate the place of its football team altogether.
As evidence mounts and debate kicks up, there's a long road ahead for American football. But Tufts can be on the right side of history by taking a stand.
Alison Brie may play a character in need of a career boost on TV, but she's doing just fine in real life.
The “GLOW” actress was among the actors who got good news when the Golden Globe nominations were announced early Monday.
Brie was nominated for lead actress in a musical or comedy for her Netflix series role as Ruth Wilder, a struggling actress looking for her big break who finds her way into a female wrestling show. Brie is nominated alongside Pamela Adlon (“Better Things”), Rachel Brosnahan (“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"), Issa Rae (“Insecure”) and Frankie Shaw (“SMILF”).
We spoke to Brie by phone while she was in her trailer preparing for a day of shooting on the second season of “GLOW.”
An obvious question to get out of the way: How did you get the news?
I was running out the door to go to work. And I ran in to kiss my husband goodbye, and he had it streaming on his phone. And he was like, the Golden Globe nominations are happening right now. And I was like, oh my God, well, I gotta go. I gave him a kiss and then we heard my name right then. And then we just looked at each other and screamed and like kicked our legs. We did kicks. I was jumping up and down. I was like, “I have to go to work!” I was late.
How were you greeted on set?
No one is here! I'm the first person here. I was jumping up and down with the hair and makeup people. I'll be shooting here all day. I'm sure I'll be doing more happy dancing here with my co-stars because I've never worked with a more supportive group. I just can't wait for all the girls to get here so I can jump and down with all of them.
Does a Golden Globe nomination cure soreness?
Oh my God, it's funny you ask because I did wake up super-sore today, and I was so tired and thinking, how will I get through this day? And then I got this jolt of energy and was doing kicks. So many kicks.
How would Ruth Wilder take the news, if she were the one nominated?
Crying. Tears of joy everywhere. She's practiced this speech thousands of times. I picture her taking a private moment — Ruth doesn't have very many friends she could be celebrating this with. I picture her running into a bathroom and just bursting into tears.
When the show starts, Ruth is frustrated with her career, and the kind of parts she is auditioning for — a criticism woman in the industry still face.
I think that's one of the great things about our show, that it's offering so many incredible roles for women. I think that's one of the great things about our show. We have 14 female regulars on our show. Even looking at the nominations today, you see how many amazing roles there are for women today. But it's a constant battle. We're always trying to move forward and diversify and create more interesting roles for women. Actresses will always be looking for something more interesting than “the wife” or “the girlfriend” parts. It's an exciting time because we're seeing those opportunities be less hard to find. There can always be more.
And, I'll say, it was life-changing being on a show with a predominantly female cast. And having women at the top and so many women behind the camera changed the way we all worked. It was a really comfortable set. It was a really ego-free set all of the time. Very collaborative, open and free. I think that enabled myself and all the women to take bigger risks with our performances.
You've talked about how much you wanted this part and about the audition process. Why did you fight so hard to play Ruth? What did you see in her?
I loved the writing so much and, I guess, I just realized opportunities like this don't come around all that often where you find a role in which you are going to showcase every tool in your actor's toolbox. And this was that show. For a long time, I felt like: I have more to show you, if you'd only let me. This show, certainly, was that opportunity for me.
The show hit Netflix just as we were starting see the rumblings of a feminist revolution taking shape. What's it been like working on Season 2, being a part of a show like this — of women demanding to be heard and seen in a male-driven world?
I feel like we're really on the right side of history. More than anything, I think I feel relieved and grateful that I get to come to work in such a safe and encouraging environment — working with all these women on material that I really believe in. The stuff that we're reading about every day did not exist on this set. And, if anything, we're creating a forum to talk about that through the art that we're making. So in that way, too, it's really gratifying.

Chelsea striker Diego Costa is reportedly set to sign a new deal at Stamford Bridge worth a whopping £57million.
The Spain striker was the subject of bids from the Chinese Super League during last month's transfer window, but according to the Sun, he is now ready to commit his future to the Blues.
They report that an agreement has been reached in principle which will see the striker net £220,000-a-week plus bonuses, which could see him ney as much as £65milion over five years.
While this does not match the offer of £30million-a-year that Tianjin Quanjin were ready to offer him it, the new deal will make the 28-year-old the highest-paid player at Stamford Bridge.

A dramatic photo has surfaced showing the aftermath of a vehicle crashing into a washout in B.C.'s south Okanagan earlier this month.
Two people were taken to hospital after their vehicle crashed into a washout on Summerland-Princeton Road, one kilometer west of Mountain View Road.
It was early in the morning of Monday, April 16, and in the darkness, police said, the driver of a Chevy Malibu didn't notice that rain had washed out a seven-metre wide section of the road.

RCMP Cpl. Don Wrigglesworth said the washout had taken out a section of the roadway around and the vehicle “went straight over the side of the washout and slammed into the top of the opposite wall before falling to the bottom.”
Police said the two occupants of the car were able to walk out and call for help and were taken to hospital.

The second half of Gotham Season 3 is nigh upon us, and a new trippy promo from Fox is previewing the war to come, and the “dark hero” who will rise. It looks like we'll be seeing the first hints at Bruce Wayne's (David Mazouz) transformation, as well as the return of Jada Pinkett Smith‘s Fish Mooney, Hugo Strange (BD Wong) and Barnes / The Executioner (Michael Chiklis). Plus, we have a few teases of what The Riddler (Corey Michael Smith), Selina Kyle (Camren Bicondova) and Barbara (Erin Richards) might be up to as they come together for new trouble in the second half of the season.
Check out the new promo below:
Gotham returns Monday, April 24th on Fox. Stay tuned for more on Gotham, including some exclusive quotes from the cast on Ra's al Ghul, the Riddler's rise, and Penguin's musical moment. For now, check out the synopses of the next two episodes:
In the all-new spring premiere, “Heroes Rise: How The Riddler Got His Name,” airing Monday, April 24(8:00-9:00 PM ET/PT) on FOX, Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) convinces himself that he doesn't need Penguin (Robin Lord Taylor) to succeed and begins to introduce himself to Gotham as “The Riddler.” Bullock (Donal Logue) and Lucius Fox (Chris Chalk) get caught up in Nygma's mind games, Gordon (Ben McKenzie) learns troubling news about his father's death and the Court of Owls reveals its next move.
Previous requests for police investigations from opposition parties at Queen's Park have resulted in charges against two of Premier Kathleen Wynne's Liberal organizers in the 2015 Sudbury byelection — although a judge dismissed that case in October.
“I have no faith in the Liberal government's ability to punish the companies responsible.”
“I have serious concerns about what appeared to be a broad and systemic abuse of the energy system and, ultimately, the hard-earned money of ratepayers,” Smith added.
These are “abuses so egregious that a second look by law enforcement is only prudent,” Tory MPP and energy critic Todd Smith says in a one-page letter to OPP Commissioner Vince Hawkes.
The Progressive Conservatives are calling on police to investigate $260 million in “ineligible expenses” — including staff car washes and scuba gear — billed by nine power plants, as revealed in last week's auditor general report.
The hard-hitting report by auditor general Bonnie Lysyk blamed lax oversight of electricity companies by the province's Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) for the questionable expenses getting through.
A verdict in that trial, involving two former key McGuinty aides who have pleaded not guilty, is due Jan. 19 . McGuinty was not under investigation and co-operated with police.
There were also criminal counts in regard to allegedly deleted documents after two gas-fired power plants were scrapped by then-premier Dalton McGuinty before the 2011 election.
Once they were discovered through internal audits, the agency responsible for meeting Ontario's daily electricity needs issued orders for repayment of $169 million against nine power plants.
One company, which operates the Goreway natural gas-fired power plant in Brampton, was fined $10 million and directed to repay $100 million in a 2015 order.
While the Goreway case was revealed in an Ontario Energy Board probe, the IESO says it cannot name the other companies in question because of privacy rules.
The Conservatives and NDP have been calling on the Liberal government to force full repayment of the monies, arguing $92 million of the $260 million cited by Lysyk as outstanding and should be returned to hydro ratepayers.
But IESO vice-president Terry Young has said the $260 million number is “extreme,” with $200 million being a more “reasonable” interpretation.
“We aren't going to be taking further action,” he told the Star last week, adding the eligibility of some expenses was in dispute, and the agency determined that the costs of litigation were not worth the financial risk.
Police were not called about the ineligible expenses because the IESO has been acting under regulations it established for companies supplying power to the grid in Ontario's electricity marketplace, Young has said.
But Smith, who represents the Belleville-area riding of Prince Edward-Hastings, said the internal rules don't go far enough.
“Abuses by the insiders at these electricity companies, including at the publicly owned Ontario Power Generation, appear to be flagrant, systemic and repeated,” his letter to the OPP said.
Smith noted the Liberal government has been warned by the Ontario Energy Board since 2009 about the possibility for companies to exploit the expense rules.
He also said the Wynne administration, which is up for re-election next June 7, “deliberately swept them (the expense abuses) under the rug.”
In her report, Lysyk detailed a number of ways ineligible expenses were being reimbursed.
“The ISEO was not reviewing all cost claims submitted by generators before paying,” she wrote.
“Generators claimed thousands of dollars for staff car washes, carpet cleaning, road repairs, landscaping, scuba gear and raccoon traps, which have nothing to do with running power equipment on standby.”
One unidentified company claimed $175,000 for parkas and coveralls over a two-year period. Goreway's claims included $300,000 for landscaping, $6.5 million for gas to fuel a steam turbine that does not consume any gas and another $17 million for which it had no supporting records, according to the auditor general's report.
Under the rules, power companies called on to produce electricity on short notice to meet peak demand from consumers are entitled to claim only the “incremental costs” involved in being on standby, Lysyk said.
Another way power companies got around the rules was to shut down their equipment while on standby, only to restart again within two hours.
“This allowed generators to submit their equipment start-up costs,” Lysyk's report said. “Running their equipment continuously would have saved money, but generators could not have then submitted the additional start-up costs for reimbursement.”
A spokesperson for Energy Minister Glenn Thibeault said risks of questionable expenses being reimbursed have been “corrected” because the IESO has now changed its procedures so that eligible costs must be pre-approved.
St John Fisher Catholic High School's new all-weather pitch will be officially opened this weekend.
The 3G pitch is set to be a key venue for the development of girls' football participation in the area, with eight brand new female teams planned, including a women's open-age side.
It will be used by students as well as partner clubs Harrogate Town AFC and Pannal Sports JFC.
The pitch has been funded by a grant from the Premier League and the FA Facilities Fund.
Staff members Max Mills MBE (pictured) and Mike Knowles will officially open the pitch this Saturday (October 7) with MP for Harrogate and Knaresborough Andrew Jones.
The grant has enabled the school to replace an existing grass pitch, prone to waterlogging, with a state-of-the-art third generation (3G) artificial grass pitch (AGP).
Both partner clubs previously had to travel for training due to a lack of adequate facilities in the area.
They will now base all of their training at the school pitch.
Partner club Harrogate Town AFC, who sit top of National League North, will also use the pitch to deliver community outreach programmes.
Since 2000, the Football Foundation Funding Partners' investment has provided 520 grants worth £19.4m towards grassroots sports projects worth over £38.4m across the whole of West Riding.
Founded in 2000, the Football Foundation is the largest sports charity in the UK funded by the Premier League, The FA and Government, via Sport England.
It develops new and refurbished grassroots sports facilities in order to improve the quality and experience of playing sport at the grassroots level.
Since it was launched in 2000, the Foundation has awarded around 15,000 grants worth more than £580m towards improving grassroots sport, which it has used to attract additional partnership funding of over £800m – £1.4bn of investment into the grassroots game.

With Oscar-nominated filmmaker Hany Abu-Assad (Omar) new movie, The Mountain Between Us, opening this weekend in North America, I recently spoke to Cinematographer Mandy Walker about making the disaster drama. If you haven't seen the trailers, the film is based on the novel of the same name by Charles Martin and revolves around an neurosurgeon (Idris Elba) on his way to perform surgery and a photojournalist (Kate Winslet) on the way to her wedding who charter a plane together as strangers to get to their destinations, only to have the plane crash and leave them as the only survivors in the freezing wilderness. Scripted by Chris Weitz and J. Mills Goodloe, the film also stars Beau Bridges and Dermot Mulroney.
During the interview, Mandy Walker talked about the fantastic, four-minute oner (where the shot keeps going without any edits) that captures the plane crash and how challenging it was to shoot, why they had to have the cameras on 24 hours a day and the challenges of calibrating the lenses due to the cold temperature, how two people slept on the mountain with the cameras in their sleeping bags to make sure they wouldn't freeze during the night, and so much more.
Check out what they had to say in the player above and below is exactly what we talked about and the official synopsis. You can also watch the trailer here.
Mandy Walker:
She talks about the plane crash being a long oner and how the shot came about. Reveals they did 24 takes!
Talks about what cameras they used and why.
Reveals why they had to have the cameras on 24 hours a day and the challenges of calibrating the lenses.
How 2 people slept on the mountain with the cameras in their sleeping bags to make sure they wouldn't freeze during the night.
Says she is shooting the live-action Mulan next.
How early on from filming is she involved in a project.
Here's the official synopsis for The Mountain Between Us:
It's the absolute best that a festival of this size has remained free for the public and is able to be as transparent and compatible to each listener through its programming. The combination of genres and sheer talent is enough for thousands of people to come each year to become a part of the music community. It's still an excellent and fresh way to expose awesome new artists for those who attend every year. Check out a gallery of photos from LotG after the jump!
Highlights
Overall, the programming this year is arguably the best it has ever been. Lightning understands their younger audience is attracted to the “indie” sound, so this year they stacked the lineup with hard hitters like Local Natives, Spoon, Real Estate, Bahamas, Minus the Bear, LP, Paper Route, the Weeks, Future Islands, and Portugal. The Man. However, they didn't neglect their older audience members and Nashville natives by booking bands such as Michael Franti and Spearhead, Drew Holcomb and the Neighbors, The Lone Bellow, The Record Company, Guthrie Brown, The Delta Saints, Sheryl Crow and many more.
The overall atmosphere changed from act to act mostly due to the come-and-go freedom of the park and the difference in genres throughout the day. Some audiences where younger than others, but the overall energy remained the same. However, the best crowd wasn't the biggest or the youngest. Instead, they were obvious fans of Future Islands.
Going into Future Islands' set, I didn't quite know what to expect. I have heard some of their songs before, but I wasn't grabbed by the recording material. However, seeing them life put their songs in perspective for me. Here are some dudes from North Carolina combining deep soul and electronics to challenge musical perspectives and genre barriers. With Samuel T. Herring's voice (and mutton chops), Gerrit Welmers slamming the keys, William Cashion slapping bass, and Michael Lowry on the drums the group knew how to read a crowd and bring out the best in Nashville.
It's hard to determine who the best group was. In fact, I think many of the bands are so different and original in sound that it's impossible to compare. However, the ones that stuck to me most were St. Paul & the Broken Bones, Future Islands, LP, Local Natives, Michael Franti, Spoon, and Real Estate. This is mostly due to the mastery of their musical ability and their relationship with the crowds; taking their performances to higher levels than many of the other acts.
First off, Michael Franti showed some unbelievable compassion to his fans by allowing a girl (Hannah) to come on stage sing a song with him, playing in the crowd a hefty chunk of the show (more than a Cage the Elephant performance), brought other kids on stage to sing together, and staying after his set to greet every single person in the front row which most artists would never have the patience to do. His performance with Spearhead was tight, energetic and filled night with music fitting the summer heat.
Local Natives showed insane growth within their live set (especially with material from their newest album “Sunlit Youth”). Real Estate brought the vibes, while Portugal brought the rock. LP showed off her insane vocal range, and Spoon brought one of their best performances that I've seen in comparison to their other sets that I've experienced (which would be my fifth).
If I had to choose one performance that truly encompassed the feeling of the festival; who's performance left a permanent impact upon the crowd and the town it would be St. Paul & the Broken Bones. Almost feral at times, the ferocious Paul Janeway echoed from the stage all the way to East Nashville and beyond, bringing heat and energy to the stage. Their performance was truly unlike anything I have ever experienced in a festival environment. The band was raw and rich throughout the entire performance – flexing their musical muscles and effectively connecting to the Nashville audience.
Importance
Fests like this truly bring the music to the people and not necessarily the fans… What I mean is free festivals like these bring a lot of people to the yard and provides exposure that wouldn't be granted otherwise. This is even better with massive funding from a media company HQ'd in the heart of Music City. This kind of backing is important to the artist you don't see headlining; the artist that playing the small stage and possibly struggling to get attention in a market that no longer values physical representations of music. Most importantly, it's important to Lightning 100 who has also been able to remain relevant in a market that doesn't support a classic Radio format. Adaptation and multimedia platforms is key when managing a station in the 2010's.
Unfortunately, Mother Nature had other plans – washing two days of the fest out and forcing Lightning to cancel one day entirely and moving another to Sunday. However, the festival remained strong and a sizable crowd came in support on the first Sunday slot for the fest showing that bigger crowds are probably in Live's future.
Bruno Mars tapped Zendaya for the visuals to “Versace on the Floor” and it's only fitting that the pair both wear custom Versace in it.
The video takes place in a hotel, where Mars and Zendaya are staying in adjacent rooms. After catching glimpses of one another in the hallway and entering their respective spaces, Mars proceeds to serenade Zendaya through the wall.
His custom outfit includes a short-sleeved silk shirt, black pants and smoking slippers emblazoned with gold Medusa emblems. Zendaya, styled by Law Roach, dons a custom gold chainmail minidress with dramatic bell sleeves, a low neckline and an exposed zipper to highlight Mars' lyrics.
Mars has been on tour for his latest album, “24K Magic,” and Donatella Versace has shown him much love throughout. Last week, she shared her own version of the music video for “Versace on the Floor” and today, she declared her approval of Mars' official visuals.
Versace on the floor, indeed.
Watch as Zendaya's stylist Law Roach talks about her look for the “Spider-Man: Homecoming” premiere in the video below.

A grand Christmas party was held for clients of the St. Lucia National Mental Wellness Centre last Friday. Staff of the Wellness Centre treated patients to gifts and a special lunch, allowing them to experience the love and joy of the Christmas season.
The Mental Wellness Centre was buzzing with laughter, music and excitement as clients and staff celebrated their biggest Christmas party ever. Occupational Therapist at the St. Lucia National Mental Wellness, Jane Charles, was the main organizer of this Christmas activity.
“Every year, the National Mental Wellness Centre hosts a Christmas party for the patients. However, we wanted it to be bigger and greater. We got a few sponsors and so I came up with the idea of having every staff member adopt a patient for the day. In so doing, they were supposed to buy them a gift that would be presented to them on the day of the party.”
The Occupational Therapist was pleased with the level of involvement by both staff and clients.
“The staff participated, the patients were excited, as most of them received gifts and we found that very important because we really wanted to increase interaction between the staff and the patients. We felt that it would help improve the patients' overall well-being.”
Charles reminded the public not to ignore their mentally-ill family members and friends during the festive season as it goes hand in hand with therapy.
“I would really appeal to persons who have patients with mental illness to pay them a visit. The patients don't need very much — just a visit, talk to them. I am not even saying to buy them a gift; just to spend time with them is what they would require right now.”
Several people are in hospital Tuesday morning, after a high-speed crash in Vancouver's west end involving a police cruiser.
Police say the cruiser was heading southbound on Denman when a silver Acura flew through the intersection at Alberni and smashed into the cruiser, which had its lights on.

The two officers in the car and a passenger in the Acura were taken to hospital. All are expected to be OK.
"You want to give those guys in the top of the order some at-bats, like Grimm and Parrott, and although those guys are 10th-graders, if they get us started then we have the two big 12th-graders behind them," Crescenta Valley coach Phil Torres said. "And that's tough for the other team, because if those guys get on early in the lineup, they have to throw to the other guys because you have runners on base."
DUBAI - Opener Dimuth Karunaratne compiled a brilliant century to put Sri Lanka in a commanding position at 254 for three on the opening day of the second day-night Test in Dubai on Friday. The left-hander was unbeaten on 133, adding 118 for an unbroken fourth-wicket stand with skipper Dinesh Chandimal (49 not out) after Sri Lanka won the toss and batted on a flat Dubai Stadium pitch.
Karunaratne batted with authority and style to reach his seventh Test a hundred off 197 balls, hitting Mohammad Aamir for two consecutive boundaries to complete three figures. He batted for 381 minutes, hitting 15 boundaries and a six.
Karunaratne fell seven runs short of a hundred in the first Test in Abu Dhabi where Sri Lanka won by 21 runs to take a 1-0 lead in the two-match series. Chandimal followed his 155 not out in the opening Test with another confident innings, collecting five boundaries as the Sri Lankan pair blunted Pakistan's bowling attack.
"It's satisfying to score a hundred," said Karunaratne, who needs just 10 more to reach 3,000 Test runs. "I missed that chance in Abu Dhabi. It was tough to bat early on, but once I had my eyes set in I batted with confidence. "It was nice to have a good partnership with Chandimal and that has given us a good score which we need to build on tomorrow."
Pakistan had got themselves in the match soon after the tea break, when Samarawickrama and Kusal Mendis fell in quick succession. Though they had Sri Lanka 136 for 3 at one stage, no further wickets would come in the second half of the day. Their frustrations were compounded in the last half an hour when Aamir pulled up in the middle of 88th over and left the field clutching his thigh, prompting concerns over the state of his hamstring. Sarfraz Ahmed also burned their two reviews trying to dismiss the irritating Chandimal. Pakistan took the second new ball after 82 overs but failed to claim any further wickets. Pakistan, who have never lost a Test series in the United Arab Emirates, also wasted both their reviews off the second new ball to cap a woeful day for them.
Leg-spinner Yasir Shah was the pick of bowlers with 2-90 while Aamir returned figures of 1-59. Karunaratne and opening partner Kaushal Silva (27) provided a solid platform for Sri Lanka with a 63-run stand before Pakistan hit back with three wickets in quick succession. Shah delivered the much-needed breakthrough for his team when he had Silva caught behind off a short delivery.
Debutant Sadeera Samarawickrama impressed during his quick-fire 38, smacking five boundaries and a six before he miscued a pull and was caught and bowled by Aamir. Kusal Mendis played a rash drive off Shah and was caught in the slips for one.
Karunaratne crunched three boundaries in an Aamir over and then hit Shah for another to reach his sixth Test fifty. Sri Lanka made two changes from the first Test, leaving out Lahiru Thirimanne and Lakshan Sandakan for Samarawickrama and paceman Lahiru Gamage while Pakistan brought in fast bowler Wahab Riaz in place of the unfit Hasan Ali.
This is the sixth day-night Test with a pink ball since Australia and New Zealand played the first such contest at Adelaide in December 2015.

Kris Singh's Aston Martin Valkyrie painted with moon dust Enlarge Photo
Kris Singh is a partner in a private investment firm who has used his success to buy a spate of amazing cars. So when the Aston Martin Valkyrie became available, the avid car collector made sure he was one of the lucky ones to take delivery of the hypercar. He will do just that in the near future, but his car will be even more special. He's announced a rather unique exterior hue that includes actual moon dust.
According to Singh's Instagram account, his Valkyrie will feature the first paint formula to include an actual space ingredient. Singh said he sourced an authentic moon rock that will be ground and incorporated into his car's Karosserie Lunar Red exterior hue. The rendering above shows what the color will look like when Aston Martin completes the car.
Singh said the idea came to him after he realized the Valkyrie reminded him of a spaceship. So, he decided the final specs of the potent hypercar, which will make at least 1,000 horsepower via a 6.5-liter V-12 and a KERS-style hybrid system, was absolutely worthy of moon-dust infused paint.
The renowned car collector will be one of 150 lucky individuals to take delivery of a Valkyrie. Aston Martin has opened up the customization to nearly endless possibilities, and reportedly even laser scans buyers to ensure custom-tailored seats. Another 25 Valkyrie hypercars will be track-only examples.
When Singh does take delivery, the Valkyrie will join his extensive collection of cars, which includes a Koenigsegg Agera XS, Lamborghini Veneno, Pagani Huayra, Pagani Huayra BC, Aston Martin Vantage V12, and a Lamborghini Aventador.
Meet the Houston Texans' new team doctor.
Or at least, that's what J.J. Watt's new degree technically could say.
On Tuesday, Watt received an honorary doctorate from Baylor College of Medicine for his relief efforts during Hurricane Harvey. It was a dream come true for the four-time Pro Bowler -- even though his degree is a ceremonial one.
Iâve had a lot of big dreams in my life, but not even I dreamt that I could one day become a Doctor. I am truly humbled and honored to receive the degree of Doctor of Humanities in Medicine from the Baylor College of Medicine! #CanTheyPutMDonMyJersey pic.twitter.com/7TyNKrvhh7 â JJ Watt (@JJWatt) May 30, 2018
Watt, who raised over $37 million in humanitarian aid, received the honor alongside Houston Emergency Medical Services Director Dr. David Persse. Both men addressed the new class of graduates and spoke about their community roles when Hurricane Harvey hit.

This makes Watt the second NFLer to receive a doctorate in as many days. Chiefs guard Laurent Duvernay-Tardif received his medical degree after graduating from McGill University's medical school in Montreal.

There is no bond stronger than a mother's unconditional love. Even after the hugs and laughs, and tears and tantrums, when that bond is torn in a moment's notice, seconds become hours and memories fade.
When a mother tragically loses her child, grieving becomes less of a step-by-step healing process and more of a mental battle each and every day.
As Mother's Day comes with flowers and gifts, and barbecues and brunches, for a mother who has tragically lost a child, it was a day that held an achy happiness.
The Original Black Panthers of Milwaukee catered to five mothers who had lost their children in the community for the second annual Black Panther's Mother's Day Extravaganza. Antoinette Roberts, Leesha Love, Larticia Robinson, Carrie Scott-Hanley and Gwendolyn Thomas were all treated to a professional hair and nail makeover as well as a five-star dinner with the Black Panthers.
“I think it's important that the queens know we are behind you 100 percent because we support you, we respect you and we will do anything that we need to just to be there for you,” said King Rick, Original Black Panther general. “I know in times like this, it's heartbreaking and heart wrenching that we as a community cannot come together to solve the social and economic conditions that plague us.”
Every mother had a different story, and each had to live through the traumatic experience of losing a child to violence or neglect.
For the second year in a row, Angela Jackson volunteered her staff's services at Naturally Naps Hair Salon (5804 W. Forest Home Ave.)
Jackson said she enjoyed helping out in her community. She added that Naturally Naps Salon participation in the second Mother's Day Extravaganza was a total no-brainer.
“Just because I am where I am doesn't mean I can't be there for them,” Jackson said. “I want them to be happy because I can't change what happened to them, but I can give them something for one day.”
Several of the mothers met with the Courier before the event to share their children's story and describe the struggles of keeping a calm headspace after losing a child.
The mothers agreed they were set back when the Black Panthers reached out to them, but felt grateful for the opportunity.
“When I read his e-mail, I cried,” Robinson said. “It touched me in a way.”
Robinson lost her 19- year-old son, Devante Reed, to gun violence. Reed was gunned down on his mother's front porch and died in her arms. She said she still has his bloody t-shirt unwashed because it was still a traumatic experience.
Roberts lost her son, Kindell Jefferson-Roberts, when he was only two-years-old. While extended family member were downstairs supposedly be watching her son, he was playing on a bunk bed and accidentally fell while coming down.
“When you sit, and think, it's really a blessing,” Roberts said. “Some people are not able to help someone else, and this is helping us mother's feel a little better about our situation.”
Roberts said as the years went on the loss was just as familiar as the day her son passed.
“Every year it gets harder and harder because it's like another year that he's not here,” Roberts said. “Just the fact that back-to-school shopping will never happen and prom preparation is out of the question. I won't have his grandchildren, I won't have a school picture, I won't have anything.”
Love said that even on adventures with her 3-yearold son, who was a spitting image of her son Justin Evans Jr., the sadness and loss remained close.
Evans Jr. was only 6-years-old when he was struck by a stray bullet.
“Everything you do reminds you of your child you just lost,” Love said.
She said that even after fun trips with her son, like going to Chuck E. Cheese, the sadness and loss crept through cracks.
“I would just sit in my car before I pull off and think, ‘I just had tons of fun without my child,' and it's not the same anymore,” Love said. “For my baby, not to be able to play with his older brother like he used to, brings me to tears.”
Having listened to the mother's stories, tears were met with subtle laughs and encouraging advice.
“You queens are so strong because I can't even imagine what you went through, and I bow to you,” Rick said.
Though the road to healing was a rocky one, the Panther's ensured that for one day, the loss these mothers felt hurt a little less.
This story is dedicated to all of the mothers who have lost a child, Justin Evans Jr., Audrey “Tu Tu” Scott, Kindell Jackson and Devante Reed.
Being too much involved in the market can make it tough to keep holding the positions especially the profits ones. It has happened to me quite often in the past and I repeated the same in few of my investments in my open portfolio.
Have you ever wondered why it is tough to keep holding the profits but it is a lot easier holding on to the losses? Let me share my views on it.
1. We Start as a Trader
The journey of a retail investor in market starts as a trader because this is how we are sold the demat and trading account. Soon we realize it is tough to consistently make profits as a part-timer in the market.
Once we aren't consistently making profits, we start digging things on the Internet and do the research. We stumble upon some rules of trading and the first rule as a trader is to book profits regularly but investors let the profits ride, multiply and compound over time.
Traders cash in the profits at the resistance levels and often have targets based on ROI but investors have an approach of don't care about resistance levels because they know it may take some time for the resistance to cross. If it can't cross because of one-quarter results, it may do so in the coming quarters or may be in the coming years. As long as management is great and a company is doing things as expected, it is a matter of time when the stock price breaks out of the resistance.
This makes the approach of a trader and investors after taking up the position is totally different but as a trader, it is really toughs from being an active trader to a passive investor.
2. The Liquid Factor
If an investor wishes to liquidate his or her investment in the market, it shouldn't take a lot of time or effort to do so. Other forms of investment like real estate which may need a buyer to liquidate or physical gold may need physical effort to liquidate.
Stocks or mutual funds are easy to liquidate and the first choice of fund for any investor is the stock market investment because of its liquid nature. Out of these investments, the first choice of stocks and mutual funds are those that are profitable. Ideally, it should be the other way round but booking losses is tough.
The easy and liquid nature of the market which is the biggest advantage for the investor makes it tough for investors to hold on to the profits as well.
3. The Inevitable Comparision
The high flying stocks hitting circuit after circuit and your investment not doing anything for an elongated period of time, makes it tough for you to keep patience and even doubt your own approach to investing in the market.
Are you playing it too safe in the market? Do you want to allocate some part of your portfolio in those high beta high volatile stocks to make even better returns? Is focus investing approach correct or should diversify?
Many such questions clutter the mind and lead to profit booking. Holding the losses is easier because if you don't want to be booking a loss, there is nothing that can be done right at the moment when you have such questions in your mind but for profit, you may want to look for other investment opportunities which may provide much better returns and this makes it tough for an investor to stay put.
4. Profits Too Soon
Big profit way too soon for an investor can also mean one wants to book it. Investors need to stay put and ignore such price movements but it is really tough doing it. It is very easy to write what one should be doing on a blog but it is really tough to actually do it.
A trader isn't concerned about why the price moves and is focused on how the price moves. An investor should know why there is a price movement. If one isn't sure of the reason behind the price action (a news breakout and temporary in nature or due to good earnings and is more permanent in nature), it becomes tough to remain put.
Conclusion
Holding profits will be tough even when you make profits too fast and if you don't make them as fast as the high flying stocks. The only way to make the most of your investment is to be able to have the margin of safety and invest in the right strategy and approach.
Do you find it tough to hold on to your profits? If yes what's the reason behind it? Share your views and ideas in comments below.
ISLAMABAD, Feb 15 (APP): Pakistan Volleyball Federation (PVF) is about to hire services of Iranian coach ‘Hamid Movahedi'to tarined the national junior and senior team players.
Talking to Radio Tehran, PVF chairman Chaudhry Mohammad Yaqoob has said that we are very close to sign a contract with Hamid Movahedi adding that the Pakistani officials have ‘talked to Iran Volleyball Federation (IVF) and have also written to the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB).
Yaqoob described Movahedi as a highly qualified and a good specialist person to coach and train Pakistan's both senior and junior national volleyball teams.
He said Movahedi has coached Nepal national Volleyball team last year and has a good experience with Iranian professional teams. It would be after eight years that Pakistan is to hire a foreign volleyball coach, he added.
Ali Reza Moammeri' of Iran was the last foreign coach that Pakistan hired in 2007-08. Ali Reza created history when he guided Pakistan to a bronze medal, their first, in the 26 years history of the Asian Junior Volleyball Championship in Iran in 2008.
From May 1-9, Pakistan will take part in the Asian Under-23 Championship in Iran. Pakistan's camp for this event has already
been held at Peshawar. Pakistan senior team will feature in the
Islamic Games to be hosted by Azerbaijan in Baku from May 12-22.
HALIFAX—The developers of Canada's only commercial spaceport are hoping Nova Scotia's eastern shore will eventually be the site of as many as a dozen rocket launches annually.
Proponents of the project gathered in a Halifax boardroom this morning to plan the next steps, which will rely first on the province approving an environmental assessment plan.

Stephen Matier, president of Maritime Launch Services Ltd., said the goal is to break ground by mid-May, and to begin launching satellites from the $200-million project near Canso in 2020.
The consortium of three American firms is working with the Ukrainian-based Yuzhnoye Design to create the launch complex at the site in Guysborough County.
In the middle of a pool game in the back room of the Flying Bull tavern, my new friend, Jarrod Stout, pulled me aside. He wanted to make sure I had his back if things got rough. As soon as he'd come into the bar he had gotten glaring looks from some of the white patrons, and now a grim-faced guy with a custom-made pool cue was acting a bit strange.
Jarrod is a young black college student with dreadlocks, a quick wit and a magnetic gregariousness. He grew up in a comparatively open, accepting Seattle suburb where black families are scarce but not scorned. The vibe he was getting in the Gettysburg bar was something he was not used to; a small-town narrowness that felt personal.
The night passed without incident, but the next day inside the elaborate visitors' center at the Gettysburg battlefield, Jarrod felt it again. The little white kid who gave him a smile was followed by a parent with eyes that displayed anything but welcome. A string of other tourists would not return his hello or his grin. And then there was the young black man in a red T-shirt sporting the words “Make America great again.” These encounters rattled him.
Jarrod found himself doing that thing that black Americans must do so many days of their lives: questioning himself and asking, “Am I imagining this or do these people detest the color of my skin?”
As a white male, there are a lot of questions I do not have to answer. If I am pulled over by a cop, I do not wonder if I might get shot for doing or saying the wrong thing. I have never worried that I would not be hired for a job or not allowed to rent an apartment because of the way I looked. My racial identity is not something I think about each morning when I look in the mirror.
In these days of identity politics when Americans seem to be retreating into separate tribes, I find it impossible to tie my own sense of self to any narrow group. That attitude is more than a perk of white privilege; it is based on a conviction that extreme tribalism — a militant and exclusive loyalty to a certain religion or race or ethnic group or nation — is the scourge of humanity. We need to find common ground wherever we can, even as we celebrate and respect the richness of cultural differences.
Riding on the bus with my Project Pilgrimage companions, I got into a discussion with Esmy Jimenez, an aspiring young journalist who recently graduated from the University of Southern California. I told her I felt no compelling link to the lands of my ancestors, England and Norway. The United States is my home and I am nothing if not an American. I think she found this a bit mystifying, but said maybe she could feel more that way if the country she grew up in would open its arms and embrace her.
Esmy, you see, is a “Dreamer.” Her family crossed the border from Mexico without documents when she was a child, and now, after receiving a promise that young immigrants like her could stay and be a vital part of American society, the promise has been revoked by presidential order. That may change or it may not. All her ambitions are in jeopardy. No wonder she finds her identity through other connections.
As our group walked the ground over which the Confederate and Union armies fought, I wondered if Esmy and Jarrod and the other twentysomethings among us could relate to what they were seeing. Why should they care that tens of thousands of white men spent three deadly July days slaughtering each other in this place more than 150 years ago? They have their own battles to fight in today's America. I thought of my own ancestor who wore Union blue and managed to survive the war. I know little of the man, but I think it likely he shared the prejudiced ideas that were common in his day, and joined the Army not to free slaves but to have an adventure. Still, if men like him had refused to fight, the slave masters would have prevailed.
As we stood at the line where a small contingent of Union cavalry awaited reinforcements and held fast against Robert E. Lee's oncoming rebel army, I pointed out to my young companions that if those few men had failed, the war might have been lost right there, the country would have permanently split and slavery would have gone on for many more grim decades. I don't know whether that impressed them or not. It seemed important to me.
The next morning we gathered at the cemetery where the Union dead are buried, the spot where Abraham Lincoln gave the Gettysburg Address. Our group leader, David Domke, chair of the Department of Communication at the University of Washington, drew us to the shade of the trees down below a memorial to Lincoln. Domke asked us to form a circle, then he passed out copies of the Gettysburg Address. Working clockwise around the circle, each person recited a line from the speech. I had read and heard Lincoln's phrases many times in my life, but they had never sounded more immediate.
Lincoln spoke of the men who died on the battlefield to save a nation “dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” He said, “It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work … the great task remaining before us — that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion … that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom.”
In that moving moment, we all stood together — young millennials and aging baby boomers, black, white and brown — and resolved, each in our own way, to carry on with the unfinished work of freedom.
This is the last installment of a five-part series.

Danquah Addo-Yobo is Managing Director of Yara Ghana Limited
The Eight Edition of the annual Pre-harvest Agribusiness Conference and Exhibition was on Tuesday launched to take off from October 3-5 in Tamale, with a call on stakeholders to build value-chain partnerships.
Mr Danquah Addo-Yobo, the Managing Director of Yara Ghana Limited, who made the call, said building value chain partnerships were critical to ensure the end-to-end cycle for agribusiness.
He said the partnership, which required scale, financing and a guaranteed market would help to deliver full agribusiness package for sustainable transformation of the agriculture sector in general.
The event is on the theme: “Transforming Agribusiness in Northern Ghana: The Future is Now,” and would give opportunity to value chain actors to establish business relationships and discuss contracts.
He said the lack of guaranteed market and the lack of financing to relevant sectors of the agribusiness value chain were the impediments that required attention and resolution for a successful transformation.
He noted that the Northern Region had been the food basket for the country and, hence, transforming agribusiness there would have a significant impact on transforming the sector.
The profitability of the farmer needed to be intensified to ensure and secure the drive to transform the agribusiness sector, Mr Addo-Yobo said.
Ms Alberta Nana Akyaa Akosa, the Executive Director of Agrihouse, the organisers of the event, said it would provide the right platform for bringing commodity buyers, agribusiness service providers and farmers to explore and exploit other growth opportunities.
She said the Pre-harvest Conference and Exhibition was developed by experts with in-depth experience of the agricultural sector, which is also a data-driven and research oriented with a priority to finding and providing solutions to the challenges with agribusiness.
The event is in line with the Government's flagship Planting for Food and Jobs Campaign as it would create the most appropriate place for businesses to identify new opportunities, discuss deals and forge partnerships.
Ms Akosa said over the last seven years, the event had helped farmers to access new market opportunities, products, services and higher yielding inputs to increase agriculture productivity.
She appreciated the efforts by all partners and sponsors - AFGRI John Deere, Ecobank, Interplast as well as the World Food Programme and Yara Ghana Limited.
Dr Nurah Gyiele, the Minister of State in charge of Agriculture, who launched the Conference and Exhibition, said it had become necessary to sustain the growth of agribusiness.
He noted that the country's sector grew from 3.0 per cent in 2016 to a provisional 8.4 per cent in 2017, according to the Ghana Statistical Service.
He said to sustain the growth rate, there was the need to increase both public and private sector investments in the agriculture sector to generate significant gains in productivity, employment and rural poverty reduction.
Dr Gyiele said the Government's Planting for Food and Jobs programme was making impressive strides adding that it would welcome and support such complimentary contributions of organisations to support the initiative.
"It pleases me more that this effort has welcome bias for Northern Ghana where agricultural growth would help tremendously in our poverty reduction drive in that part of the country," he said.
He noted that if agriculture (farming and agribusiness) became successful in Northern Ghana, the problems of unemployment, low incomes and food insecurity would be solved.
The 2018 annual pre-harvest conference and exhibition is scheduled to take place at the Tamale Sports Stadium.
Mr Nanga Kaye, the Sustainable Food Systems Coordinator at the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), said they had seen some improvement in Ghana's food supply chains from production to distribution.
He said to assist in addressing supply chain challenges along value chain, WFP had been partnering government in its "One District, One Warehouse" initiative.
He said: "We understand that supply chain management in agribusiness has the potential to strengthen the agricultural marketing channels to play major roles in the supply of foods.”
Tokyo: Japan enacted a controversial anti-terror law on Thursday, that sparked street protests and warnings from critics that it would stomp on citizens' privacy rights.
The upper House of Parliament passed the conspiracy bill after political wrangling through the night, overcoming the weak opposition's no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Cabinet and a censure motion aimed at Justice Minister Katsutoshi Kaneda.
The bill passed the more powerful lower House last month — Abe's ruling coalition has a comfortable majority in both houses. The new law allows investigators to charge an individual or organisation which conspires to engage in terrorism or other serious crimes.
But rights groups, Japan's national bar association and numerous academics have opposed the bill, saying it is so broad that it could be abused to allow wiretapping of innocent citizens and threaten privacy and freedom of expression guarantees in the constitution.
US surveillance whistleblower Edward Snowden and Joseph Cannataci, UN special rapporteur on the right to privacy, have
both criticised the law. It has also sparked regular street protests nationwide.
The government argues that the legislation is necessary to prevent terrorism ahead of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. Officials also say it is a prerequisite for implementing a UN treaty against transnational organised crime which Japan signed in 2000.
The bill was revised several times over the years, as earlier versions met with fierce resistance and never made it through parliament. The latest bill reduced the number of targeted crimes to some 270 offences and narrowed the definition of terrorist and criminal organisations.
Earlier, versions of the law targeted more than 600 crimes unrelated to terrorism or crime syndicates. Japan's bar association argued, however, that the current law still gives police and investigators too much leeway in deciding what constitutes a criminal organisation.
The general public could be targeted on conspiracy charges via monitoring phone and online conversations, it warned. Some Japanese media have likened the bill to the World War II-era "public order maintenance law" under which ordinary people were arrested for political offences, exercising labour rights and anti-war activities.
The Weinstein Co. may release employees from their non-disclosure agreements as part of a bankruptcy filing, giving a boost to those who are pursuing cases against Harvey Weinstein, a source tells Variety.
The company is expected to declare bankruptcy as soon as Monday, after a deal to sell the company to an investor group backed by Ron Burkle fell apart two weeks ago.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman had been pushing the company to waive its non-disclosure agreements. That would assist the office in its pending discrimination suit against the company and against Harvey and Bob Weinstein. It would also free employees to speak to the media about their experiences at the company.
Several actresses and former employees have filed suit against the company in Los Angeles, New York, and Toronto, alleging that the company was complicit in Weinstein's misconduct. A bankruptcy filing would put those suits on hold, though Schneiderman's case would be allowed to continue.
Criminal investigators in Los Angeles, New York and London are also investigating allegations against Weinstein.
Schneiderman's office attempted to mediate a sale to the Burkle group last month, and has continued to talk to the company since the talks collapsed. A release of the non-disclosure agreements could form one part of a settlement of the attorney general's case against the company.

Every dog has his day, goes the old saying. The truth of the axiom was proved at New Delhi's Siri Fort Indoor Stadium on Friday, when Chinese-born American Zhang Beiwen registered her first victory in four career meetings over India's pride and joy, Saina Nehwal, to barge into the semi-finals of the India Open World Tour badminton championships.
On what proved to be a disastrous day for Indian shuttlers, Zhang, who occupies the 11th spot on the Badminton World Federation (BWF) rankings, won the battle of the 27-year-olds by a runaway 21-10, 21-13 scoreline in two minutes over the half-hour mark, leaving top-seeded PV Sindhu the sole survivor from the host nation in the two stellar singles events.
The changeling we saw on court on Friday was not the Saina who had knocked out the likes of China's Chen Yufei, compatriot Sindhu and Thailand's former world champion Ratchanok Intanon, on her way to the Indonesian Masters final, where she had lost to Taiwan's World No 1, Tai Tzu Ying. This particular Saina appeared exhausted by her exploits of the previous week, and was unable to raise a gallop against the Chinese-American, to whom she had never lost earlier.
It further spotlighted the reprehensible manner in which the BWF has been killing the goose that lays the golden eggs, cracking the whip on the players and making it mandatory for the top-15 stars to play at least 12 of 15 designated tournaments. And this, in a year which also has the Asian Team tournament, the Commonwealth Games and the Thomas/Uber Cup team events, all of which require turning out for the country.
It is, therefore, not surprising to find Saina writing to the Badminton Association of India to excuse her from the Asian Team event on the grounds that her ageing body is refusing to take such sustained punishment. It is not as if Saina can be accused of being anti-national, for she has consistently turned out for the country in the past, and owns the record of being the only player to have participated in every edition of the Indian Open since its inception 10 years ago, and has also won it twice.
Following Saina's eclipse, her compatriot and defending champion, Sindhu, was left to carry the country's flag in its home event. The lanky Hyderabadi, who had driven Indian badminton fans wild last year by winning the women's crown, even as Kidambi Srikanth had ended supreme among the men, was far from convincing while eliminating Spain's No 8 seed, Beatriz Corrales, at 21-12, 19-21, 21-11 after 54 minutes of battle.
Sindhu, who coasted through the opening game, played untidy badminton in the second stanza to fall behind at 11-19 and 13-20. Suddenly realising that she would be placed under enormous pressure if there was a decider, she tightened up and rattled off a six-point reel to come within striking distance at 19-20. But the Spaniard was able to take the contest to a third game which, mercifully, Sindhu won untroubled.
Shockingly, Corrales' compatriot, Rio Olympic gold medallist, Carolina Marin, the No 2 seed, was bounced out of the tournament by Hong Kong's sixth-seeded Cheung Ngan Yi, with the latter securing a 21-12, 21-19 verdict in a 48-minute encounter that happened to be their second career meeting. Marin had won their first meeting at the Malaysia Open, three years ago.
However, she was well below par on Friday, unable to raise her mental level after playing too much competitive badminton in the past couple of months. She had withdrawn from the year-ending Superseries grand finals in Dubai in mid-December 2017, citing injury, but had then gone into the Premier Badminton League (PBL) in India, where, as captain, she had helped Hyderabad Hunters to the title. Then had come the two Masters-level tournaments in South-east Asia, and now the India Open, leaving her looking almost as stale and tired in the India Open as Saina.
The exit of the second and fourth seeds left the top seed Sindhu facing Thailand's No 3 seed, Intanon, in Saturday's semi-finals, even as Zhang is to square off against Cheung. Intanon made the last-four grade with a routine 21-11, 21-11 win over the No 7 seed, Yip Pui Yin of Hong Kong.
So far as the men's singles of the $350,000 event was concerned, the rather sparse crowd that had braved the Delhi winter cold to witness the quarter-final proceedings was left stunned and disappointed when all the three Indians – B Sai Praneeth, Parupalli Kashyap and Sameer Verma – who had made the last-eight stage of their home tournament were escorted to the exit door en masse.
There was not much surprise about eighth-seeded Praneeth's 43-minute 15-21, 13-21 loss to Chinese Taipei's No 3 seed, Chou Tien Chen, for the Taiwanese world No 7 player had not lost to the Indian in three previous meetings, all of which had taken place last year. So quick on his feet was Chou, and so much in control of the rallies, that he often toyed with Praneeth, who appeared a half-step slower on his feet than when he had won the Singapore Open Superseries title in mid-2017.
Nor did 31-year-old Kashyap really trouble China's Qiao Bin in what was their second meeting in the past ten months. Having slipped it across the Indian veteran at the 2017 China Masters in three games, Qiao had the confidence to be authoritative while notching a 21-16, 21-18 triumph at the Siri Fort Stadium on Friday. Kashyap did show glimpses of his renowned fighting spirit when he made up a crippling 8-16 deficit in the second game, to draw level at 18-all, but he just could not force a decider.
As for Verma, who had knocked out Indonesian Tommy Sugiarto the previous day, the Madhya Pradesh native crashed to his second defeat in as many career meetings with Malaysian Iskandar Zulkarnain Zainuddin, who emerged from the qualifying rounds to barrel into the semi-finals of the year's third international event.
The 23-year-old Indian, who slid from the 30th to the 41st spot in the new BWF rankings list, put up an insipid performance in the face of a fine, all-round showing from the 26-year-old Kuala Lumpur resident, who was far more aggressive than he had been the previous day against second-seeded Srikanth. The qualifier appeared to benefit from the pointers suggested to him by courtside coach and former Malaysian great, Misbun Sidek.
The 86th-ranked Zulkarnain, who has returned to international competition after more than a year on the sidelines, thanks to a slipped disc, won their 49-minute duel by a 21-17, 21-14 margin, drawing away from 13-11 in the second game, to win eight of the final 11 points, as the Indian repeatedly erred in length and made several unforced errors at the net.
The Malaysian giant-killer, who appears to be on a roll, will take on China's No 4 seed, Shi Yuqi, in the semi-finals, while Chou clashes with the unranked Qiao Bin. The 21-year-old Yuqi has beaten Zulkarnain on the only occasion they have clashed earlier – at the 2016 French Open, 15 months ago – and is favoured to repeat that triumph.
The 25-year-old Qiao, ranked 35th in the world, actually leads Chou, three years his senior, 2-1 in career meetings, having beaten the third-seeded Taiwanese on the two most recent occasions that they have clashed, both in 2016. It remains to be seen whether the more fancied player can restore parity in their head-to-heads.
The Los Angeles Unified School District has cut its student suspension rate in half since 2013, thanks in part to an alternative discipline approach called restorative justice that relies on methods such as talking circles and trust-building to get at the the root of conflicts and resolve them.
Now the district is considering the same approach for a different group: parents and principals.
The school district's board considered a resolution Tuesday that would require the superintendent to create a pilot program to train school administrators in using restorative-justice practices with parents. Such a program, the resolution said, would aim "to restore and strengthen school and parent relationships and school communities when conflict arises."
The discussion began after the nonprofit advocacy group Parent Organization Network examined more than 450 "disruptive person letters" that principals sent to parents to bar them from school campuses without permission. The group pointed out the lack of oversight in the process. Last November, the school board created an appeals process for these decisions.
Some parents say that principals abuse the letters, using them to silence parents advocating for their children.
“Listen to our parents. Don't restrict their access," David Gomez, chairman of the L.A. Unified parent advisory committee, told the board Tuesday.
He said in an interview that he wasn't against all disruptive-person letters but felt "they're being used inappropriately, as a first resource rather than a last resort."
The school board plans to vote on the resolution next month.
In a town full of venture capital firms, Storm Ventures has made its mark with a singular focus on the enterprise. This week, the company announced it has taken on two freshly minted partners, Arun Penmetsa and Paul Willard, to continue the mission. They are doubling the number of partners with this announcement.
Penmetsa has been a principal at Storm for the last 3.5 years before being promoted to partner recently. Before joining Storm he worked as an engineer at Oracle and Google. Meanwhile, Willard, who was previously a partner at Subtraction Capital and has had stints as CMO at Atlassian and Practice Fusion also joined Storm as a partner this year.
The two men join a firm with over $800 million in assets under management and each brings real world experience working at successful enterprise companies
Willard says he felt like he found kindred spirits when started talking to the folks at Storm because their mission matched so well with his work helping young enterprise companies. “Part of the reason I came on board is I align so well with them,” Willard told TechCrunch.
As he pointed out, the company has been working with early-stage enterprise startups for the past 17 years and most VC firms in Silicon Valley are lacking that concentrated enterprise experience. “Everyone else might have a partner or two, but the enterprise is not the [primary] focus of their existence,” he said.
Penmetsa, who was hired by Storm out of graduate school at Stanford, has worked his way up the company the ladder the old fashioned way. He says working at a venture capital company that emphasizes the enterprise has its advantages. “Storm's strategy is pretty focused on enterprise and enterprise SaaS companies. We focus on that one area, and spending more time in that area, we have some sense of how [enterprise] companies evolve. It's not a blueprint, but patterns do emerge,” he explained.
In his role at Storm before the promotion, Penmetsa worked with a variety of enterprise startups including TruStar Technology, a security startup concentrating on threat information sharing and ShoCard, a blockchain identity startup. He plans to continue to looking at security, while also exploring digital healthcare as well.
Willard, who was an aerospace engineer at Boeing in the 1990s, has a passion for airline-related startups, and when he was at Subtraction he helped a number of companies including Zipline, which is building robot airplanes to deliver emergency supplies like blood and medicine and Boom, a company building a new generation of supersonic transport planes. He plans to bring that experience to bear at Storm as well. While he says that he is open to talking to any enterprise software startup, he has his eye on Robotics as a Service and drone companies in particular at the moment.
The two new partners are already on board and at work at Storm. Today marks the formal announcement of their hiring.

The death toll in a fire disaster that destroyed a 24-story block of flats in London was expected to rise on Thursday, with many people still missing and firefighters facing hazardous conditions as they searched the charred carcass.
Smoke was still wafting out of the shell of the Grenfell Tower on Thursday morning, 30 hours after fire engulfed the building in the early hours of Wednesday and turned it into a huge flaming torch in a matter of minutes.
Authorities have confirmed 12 deaths, but have said that figure would rise. Firefighters rescued 65 people from the building.
Survivors who have lost everything spent the night at emergency shelters, as charities and local support groups were flooded with donations of clothes and bedding from shocked Londoners.
The fire brigade said the inferno was unprecedented in its scale and speed.
READ MORE: London high-rise building fire death toll rises to 12, police confirm
The tower, a social housing block built in 1974 in North Kensington, an area of west London, contained 120 flats and was thought to have been home to about 600 people.
Harrowing accounts emerged of people trapped inside as the blaze destroyed everything around them, shouting for help and trying to escape through windows using makeshift ropes made from bedsheets.
By Thursday morning, there was no sign of life in or around the blackened hulk. Security cordons were in place around the base of the tower, where the ground was littered with charred debris.
Outside the cordons, impromptu tributes had appeared, with photos of missing people, messages of condolences, flowers and candles.
Emergency services said it was too early to say what had caused the disaster. Some residents said no alarm had sounded. Others said they had warned repeatedly about fire safety in the block.
The building had recently undergone an 8.7 million pound ($11.08 million) exterior refurbishment, which included new external cladding and windows.
The charges against Arizona Cardinals rookie wide receiver Christian Kirk stemming from a February incident in Arizona were dismissed Wednesday by the Scottsdale City (Ariz.) Attorney's Office.
Kirk was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and property damage on Feb. 3. Kirk was seen throwing rocks at cars with a friend while attending the Waste Management Phoenix Open at TPC Scottsdale earlier this year, according to the Scottsdale police.
"The suspects were intoxicated and leaving the WMPO," the Scottsdale police told azcentral.com. "As they were walking through a parking lot, security personnel observed them throwing rocks at cars and breaking a window of at least one of them."
According to a police report obtained by NFL.com, the arresting officer was alerted to two men, one of whom was Kirk, by a man lying down in a van allegedly damaged by a rock thrown by Kirk and his friend. The man then observed Kirk and his friend throwing rocks at other cars and semi-trucks.
The Cardinals selected Kirk with their second-round pick (No. 47 overall) in the 2018 NFL Draft.

A woman has admitted stealing almost £900 worth of perfume from a single shop.
Michelle Criddle managed to swipe the hoard of fragrances from the Lloyds Pharmacy in Thornbury.
The 30-year-old from Holly Hill Road, Kingswood, appeared at Bristol Magistrates' Court on Friday, January 2.
Criddle was charged with two counts of theft and one count of failing to comply with a community order.
She appeared in courtroom two wearing a black top and spoke to confirm her date of birth, address and nationality.
The defendant pleaded guilty to stealing a whopping £897 worth of perfume from a display cabinet in the Thornbury store on October 14, 2017.
The prosecution told the court Ms Criddle had entered the store and gone straight to a display cabinet where she had tampered with the lock.
She then left and returned later, once again tampering with the lock and this time making off with the perfume, with a retail value of almost £900.

Criddle was later identified on CCTV.
Ms Criddle also pleaded not guilty to stealing £5 from a man in Staple Hill on June 28 last year.
The defence told the court Ms Criddle had a history of drug addiction and mental health problems, and that a prison sentence would undermine her recent progress with Bristol's drug services.
He recommended a suspended sentence which was heeded by magistrates.
Criddle was handed a 26-week suspended prison sentence and ordered to pay £200 in compensation to Lloyds Pharmacy. She thanked magistrates for the opportunity to continue her rehabilitation as she was returned to the cells.

The heart of the matter
Both the Money in the Bank ladder matches had four spots for each of the brands. All eight participants for the women's ladder match were confirmed after Sasha Banks won the Gauntlet match as the final star on Monday Night Raw.
The men's ladder match has had all the spots filled up as well. The New Day won a tag team match against the Bar, to secure a position for any one member of their team on the match. Since winning the match, they did not announce which member of their team would compete in the bout.
The past two weeks saw them teasing selecting a member, but so far no one has been announced yet. According to speculation by Cageside Seats, the fans will not get to know which member of the New Day, be it Big E, Kofi Kingston or Xavier Woods, will compete in the match until the Money in the Bank pay-per-view itself. The expectation is that the decision will be made public moments ahead of the bout.
What's next?
The Money in the Bank pay-per-view is set to take place on the 17th of June. It will be interesting to see which member of New Day participates. There has been speculation about New Day splitting up in the near future as their gimmick has grown old. Money in the Bank may be the pay-per-view that sets the split in motion.

Rams players suffered multiple injuries in their defeat by the Philadelphia Eagles, but coach Sean McVay said Monday that he anticipated that cornerback Trumaine Johnson and offensive linemen Andrew Whitworth and Rob Havenstein would recover and be available for Sunday's game against the Seattle Seahawks in Seattle.
The trio was among four players who came out of the game during Sunday's 43-35 loss to the Eagles at the Coliseum.
Cornerback Kayvon Webster suffered a season-ending torn Achilles, and on Monday was put on injured reserve. The Rams re-signed cornerback Dominique Hatfield to the practice squad.
Webster, who intercepted a pass in the first quarter, wrote in an Instagram post Monday that he also had been playing through a shoulder injury.
Webster's absence, McVay said, is “a big loss” for the Rams.
“Made a huge impact on this team,” McVay said, “not only on just the field but the way he carries himself day in and day out.”
With Webster out, Nickell Robey-Coleman is expected to start. Troy Hill and Kevin Peterson also are expected to play.
Safeties Lamarcus Joyner, Blake Countess and John Johnson also could figure in the equation.
“The next guy is going to have to step up and make plays,” Countess said.
On Sunday, it was announced that Trumaine Johnson left the game in the second half because he was in concussion protocol.
But McVay said that Johnson sustained a “stinger,” which is a neck and shoulder issue.
“That was a little bit of a misunderstanding,” McVay said, “so that's positive news on Trumaine.”
Whitworth, the starting left tackle, and Havenstein, the right tackle, were announced as having suffered ankle injuries.
But McVay said that both linemen, who returned to the game, were dealing with knee issues. Whitworth “checked out good” on Monday and Havenstein “was in good spirits,” McVay said.
“They'll be day to day,” McVay said, “but it was very positive when you look at just the way that they both got rolled up on, and in terms of what can kind of come out of some of those types of plays.
“And, fortunately for us, it didn't result in something that was going to be season ending.”
Both linemen could be available against the Seahawks, McVay said.
“That's the anticipation,” he said, adding, “It's going to be one of those things where you never really, truly know until you see how they really respond a couple days out.”
Darrell Williams played in place of Whitworth and Havenstein against the Eagles.
Despite the injuries, the Rams actually could gain some roster strength when they play the Seahawks.
McVay said that receiver Robert Woods and linebacker Connor Barwin were on track to practice this week and possibly return for a game with huge NFC West implications.
Woods has been sidelined three games because of a shoulder injury, Barwin two games because of a forearm injury.
The Rams are 9-4 and in first place. The Seahawks, who defeated the Rams in Week 5, are 8-5 and in second place.
The Rams' loss to the Eagles was tempered by the Seahawks' loss at Jacksonville.
“It was a disappointing day, but our guys aren't discouraged,” McVay said, adding, “We've got a great opportunity with the things that took place [Sunday] to still be in first place in our division and go to a great Seattle team and get a chance to try to go win our 10th game and try to stay on top off the division.”
Running back Todd Gurley rushed for 96 yards in only 13 carries against the Eagles. “However you want to cut it, I've got to get him going, give him more opportunities with the way he was running it and have a better feel for the flow of the game,” McVay said. “That was something that I didn't think I did very well yesterday.”… Receiver Cooper Kupp caught five passes for 118 yards and a touchdown against the Eagles, establishing a Rams rookie season record with 56 receptions. “When you look at with Robert going down,” McVay said, “I think he's gotten a little bit more targets and some more [opportunities] over the last handful of weeks just based on he and Sammy [Watkins] kind of being your primary targets.”… The Rams are off Tuesday. They resume practice Wednesday.

Thiruvananthapuram: Transgender students will now get reservation in universities and affiliated colleges in Kerala. The state government has issued an order reserving two additional seats exclusively for transgender members in all courses in universities and affiliated arts and science colleges in the state.
The admission of transgenders in the reserved seats would be subject to the fulfilment of qualification, the order issued by the Higher Education Department said. The objective of the move is to provide the marginalised group better opportunities for higher education and bring them to the forefront of society, official sources said.
The order is based on a recommendation of the Social Justice Department. "Due to societal issues, these students often have to discontinue their studies or join other academic institutions after an academic year or after the admission process is closed," the order said. The CPI(M)-led LDF government had recently decided to provide shelter homes for transgenders who would join the continuing education programme of the state's Literacy Mission.
A recent survey conducted by the Mission has found that around 50 percent members of the transgender community survive on a monthly income of Rs 1,000 or less. While 28.53 percent of the survey had a monthly income between Rs 1,000 and Rs 5,000, 19.46 percent earned between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 a month. A total of 20.35 percent of transgenders, the surveys revealed, were
unemployed, and over 30 percent were engaged in some form of self-employment.

Avenfield reference
Staff Reporter
Islamabad
PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif's son-in-law, retired Capt Muhammad Safdar, on Wednesday de-cided against producing any witnesses in his defence in an accountability trial, inform-ing the court that had made this decision because the prosecution had failed to es-tablish a case against him.
Safdar was recording his statement in the Avenfield reference under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedures Code (CrPC). He is named in the reference alongside Nawaz and Maryam, and his brothers-in-law, Hassan and Hussain Nawaz.
A day earlier, he had admit-ted that he was a signatory of the trust deeds of offshore companies Nielsen and Nescoll while his wife Maryam was a trustee.
Safdar, like Maryam had dur-ing her testimony, claimed that he had been victimised and dragged into the case to exert pressure on Nawaz.
He claimed that the joint in-vestigation team's (JIT) deci-sion to include him in the references despite not being named in Supreme Court's April 20 judgement showed that the JIT's “intentions are malafide”.
When asked to disclose the source of the funds with which Maryam had bought the Avenfield apartments, he denied that Maryam was the owner of the said property.
Safdar also told the court about his military career, right from his joining of the Pakistan Army to his posting as Nawaz's security officer.
He then drew upon the events of the 1990s to try and prove how his father-in-law had been ‘wronged' multiple times, first in 1993 by then president Ghulam Ishaq Khan and then in 1999 by former chief of army staff Gen Pervez Musharraf.
“Nawaz Sharif wisely saved the region from an imminent war but he could not save his own regime,” Safdar said, re-ferring to the Kargil Opera-tion which had sparked a tiff between Nawaz and Mushar-raf which eventually esca-lated into the infamous coup.
Safdar skipped most of the questions posed to him, deeming them “irrelevant”. In the end, when asked if he wanted to add something, he simply claimed to be inno-cent.
Following the conclusion of Safdar's testimony, the ac-countability court summoned JIT head Wajid Zia to appear tomorrow when he will be cross-questioned by Nawaz's counsel in connection with the reference concerning Al-Azizia Steel Mills.Meanwhile, the court will hear final arguments on the Avenfield reference on June 5.
SISTERS HAVE raised more than £1,100 for a domestic abuse charity after running the Asda Foundation 10k in Leeds, in memory of their older sister Tracy Cockrell.
Tracy, who was known to her family as Tracy Johnson, was killed by her ex-partner near Machynlleth in April 2016.
Her sister Sharron Rogers and Cheryl O'nions donated £1,115.25 to Montgomeryshire Family Crisis Centre (MFCC) the specialist domestic abuse service which covers North Powys.
Both sisters and their mum, Janet Lancaster, came to Newtown to hand over the money and meet the MFCC team.
Sharron said: “It was great to see, first hand, the valuable work MFCC carry out, including meeting some of the survivors they support and seeing how the money raised will impact on their recovery.
“Tracy was a kind, caring person and would have been proud that the money raised was going to help people experiencing domestic abuse.”
Jane Stephens, team leader at MFCC, said: “It was a privilege to meet Sharron, Cheryl and Janet, we can't thank them enough for the fantastic amount raised for our organisation.
“We have created a new garden area at our female refuge in celebration of Tracy's life, as suggested by Tracy's family.”
The bodies of Tracy Cockrell and Nigel McGrath were found at a smallholding at Llanwrin near Machynlleth on April 10, 2016.
An inquest recorded that McGrath had suffocated her, before hanging himself.

WILKES-BARRE TWP. — As a member of the Utica Comets, defenseman Andrey Pedan considered the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins one of the toughest teams to play against.
He's excited to see what it's like to play for the Penguins this season.
Pedan, acquired by Pittsburgh earlier this week in the Derrick Pouliot trade, is the newest addition of the 31 players listed on Wilkes-Barre/Scranton's opening- night roster. A 6-foot-5 defenseman, the Kaunas, Lithuania, native has played in 97 AHL games over the last two seasons, recording 10 goals and 35 points.
While his height makes him easily noticeable on the ice, Pedan is hoping his
200-foot game is what merits the attention with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton.
“I have a big shot, so I'll use it when there's a time and place,” Pedan said Friday at Mohegan Sun Arena, “but I'm just trying to work on being solid on defense.”
Penguins head coach Clark Donatelli said Pedan will fit in with the team because he is tough and a good skater.
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton is noticeably bigger on the blue line this season, with five defensemen checking in at 6-foot-3 or taller. But, as Donatelli points out, they all have the shooting and skating ability that can allow the team to flourish.
“We'll take big with skill any day,” Donatelli said.
Pedan also doesn't anticipate a long adjustment period with his new teammates, adding he played with fellow Penguins defenseman Frank Corrado in Utica. So, he can focus on maximizing his opportunity to showcase himself for a new organization.
“You have to work on the little details and try to get better every day,” Pedan said. “I'm not looking ahead; I'm just taking it day by day and working on the little things.”
Captain's crew
It was a foregone conclusion that Tom Kostopoulos would be the Penguins captain for opening night, but Donatelli said Friday that defenseman Chris Summers and forward Garrett Wilson will be the assistant captains against Charlotte.
“Garrett is a leader on and off the ice, the way he works,” Donatelli said. “He's the heart and soul of our team, so that's an easy (choice).
“Chris, he's new to our organization, be he's come in and he shows leadership qualities.”
Donatelli also said that, although those two will wear the “A” on their sweaters tonight, he thinks many of the team's new additions will be a key piece of its overall leadership going forward.
Injury report
Forward Colin Smith and defensemen Jeff Taylor and Jarred Tinordi are all “week to week,” according to Donatelli.
Forward Troy Josephs was on the ice during practice Friday, but is still out indefinitely.

Patna: The main opposition party in Bihar, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), hit the streets in Patna on Monday against the sand mining policy of the Nitish Kumar government in the state, throwing vehicular traffic out of gear.
RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav also announced a statewide bandh on 18 December against the "anti-poor" attitude of the NDA dispensation in the state.
The protest march, which was led by RJD national vice presidents Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and Shivanand Tiwary and state president Ramchandra Purve, started from the party office at the Birchand Patel Marg and concluded at the Kargil Chowk, a few kilometres away.
The JD(U)-BJP coalition government, after coming to power in the state in July, had come up with a new policy, in a bid to put an end to illegal sand mining and regulate its trade.
Lalu Prasad Yadav's party has been critical of the policy.
Road traffic was badly affected along the route of the march at the heart of the town with vehicles, including school buses and ambulances, seen stranded for hours.
Reacting to the RJD stir, Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi told reporters, "They are not agitating for any hardship caused to the common man. They are desperately trying to protect the sand mafia, which has been funding their party."
Told about the deputy chief minister's remark, Tiwary angrily retorted, "The state government is neck deep in corruption which has been proved by scams such as Srijan. It has no moral right to speak about the mafia funding any party."
Singh, who is also a former Union minister, said, "Construction activities have come to a standstill in the state since July, when the impractical sand mining policy came into being. Thousands of workers have been rendered jobless and compelled to migrate to other states in search of a livelihood."
Tejashwi said, "The JD(U)-BJP government is anti-poor, anti-worker and anti-Dalit. Even the directions of the Patna High Court seem to have fallen on deaf ears.
"Left with no other choice, we will now be staging a Bihar bandh on 18 December. The bandh will get support from every section of the society as the state is reeling under rampant corruption, deteriorating law-and-order and anti-people policies of the government, which seems indifferent to the plight of the common man."
“Hello, baby, how are you doing,” Princess Nokia greets me on the phone. Her voice is tender and genuine. She has been touring for the last year and a half and remains ridiculously busy, but in this rare free moment she's chatting about 1992 Deluxe, Rough Trade's expanded re-release of last year's breakout mixtape 1992. Even through the phone she comes across as an innovator, business mogul, and badass as she articulates her art and vision.
Destiny Frasqueri has gone by a few names in her musical career including her birth name, an imagined sixth Spice Girl called Wavy Spice, and her most well-known moniker, Princess Nokia. Born and raised in New York City, the 25-year-old began releasing music as Wavy Spice on SoundCloud in 2012. She's been writing music and releasing videos consistently since then, highlighted by 2014's Princess Nokia full-length Metallic Butterfly and last year's 1992. The new deluxe version of that release features an additional eight tracks that are consistent with Nokia's admiration for NYC (“ABCs Of New York” and “Brick City”) and '90s nostalgia (“Goth Kid”).
Frasqueri's music scans as mostly autobiographical, but at times it's only ostensibly so, as she explores alternative and even fantasy versions of herself. She's a proud Afro-Puerto Rican woman that showcases the intersectionality of her identity, exposing that we can be more than a 2-D representation of ourselves. Her shows are a safe space for LGBTQ+, women, and people of color. Her music is a safe haven for the spectrum of identity, as she embraces every aspect of herself even if society systematically tries to silence that beauty. From dissing white supremacy and xenophobia in “ABCs Of New York” to institutionalized misogyny on “Receipts,” Princess Nokia is a voice against inequality and prejudice amidst a background of hard-hitting trap triplets and pointed electronic drumbeats.
Her rap persona is a pristine and colorful embodiment of the city she comes from. From her beats to her content, Nokia is as diverse as the city blocks that stretch from the Bronx to LES. Read our Q&A below.
STEREOGUM: When you put out the 1992 Deluxe, did you already know what songs you wanted to add or what tweaks you wanted to make?
PRINCESS NOKIA: I made the eight new songs directly after I recorded 1992. 1992 the original version only was available on a personal website of mine. It wasn't available on any streaming services or anything, and I just really wanted to put out 1992 again with a proper release. I thought why save it for another project? It was the same material that I wrote when I did the album. It only added to it and gave it a definite fullness.
STEREOGUM: Did you produce your new tracks?
PRINCESS NOKIA: No, actually I get a lot people that send me beats. I had a lot of beats on my computer, and I just used those. I have my engineer Benjamin Julia, who did a lot of engineering on the first album. I had him come to my house, and I recorded the entire second half of Deluxe in my room with a friend and a home mic. It was really cool. It was really easy.
STEREOGUM: I was curious how the new and old songs interact for you. Were the new songs inspired by the older tracks or were they already written?
PRINCESS NOKIA: Not inspired by the older tracks, I just write rhymes. I wrote poetry in my notebook. They're all just poetry in my notebooks from a perspective of a New York City high school kid who drank a lot of beer and smoked a lot of weed, had a lot of fun, and went to a lot of rock concerts. I just observed everything around me. All the songs come from a really unique, individualistic, youthful place. It's about being a misfit. It's about being different. It has the vein of classic hip-hop. It has a uniqueness to it, certainly.
STEREOGUM: Because you're touring a lot, and I get the sense that you schedule is really busy. Is your music going to be inspired by that same perspective?
PRINCESS NOKIA: I think it always is. I think the person that I am in 1992 is still who I am now. The music that I will continue to make will certainly draw upon those experiences of being a loner, of being an emo goth kid, of being a New York City aficionado, of being a witch, a feminist, a brown radical woman. I think those things are still very relevant in my life. A lot of things have changed: my entire demographic, my spectrum, my success, my entire life. My coexistence with the music is different, but I am still the same person. I still very much deal — not deal, but experience the life that I narrated in 1992. It's not different.
STEREOGUM: It's amazing to look at your catalogue and career in the sense that you've had so many different sounds and representations of your identity. What have you learned over the years about how you present yourself and what you put out into the world musically and visually?
PRINCESS NOKIA: I think that the power of reinvention is very important. I understand the power of reinvention and how it can allow an artist or someone to not be confined into one specific sound or idea or time in music. I feel like I've had a really great time just being able to make all the music that I've always liked to make and listen to and expressing it in different ways. It doesn't work for everybody, but I love reinvention. I love being able to create, and recreate, and draw upon many inspirations. I think that's probably the biggest part of my musical career and identity that I can be so interchangeable. It's exhausting to be honest with you, I exhaust myself sometimes.
STEREOGUM: Do you ever lose track?
PRINCESS NOKIA: No, I don't really lose track. There's a whole bunch of bits of me everywhere in my life.
STEREOGUM: Do you have specific artists that inspire you for that chameleonlike skin?
PRINCESS NOKIA: Yeah! I like a lot of older rock ‘n' roll artists, like legends like Freddie Mercury and David Bowie. They really influenced me to be very, very androgynous and very commanding, and very very — I wouldn't say odd, but I would say eccentric. Those types of people have always been like, “Oh my god they're so awesome.”
STEREOGUM: You made a short film for your song “Flava.” Could you elaborate on the thought process that went into the song and its visuals?
PRINCESS NOKIA: The song “Flava” is one of the funner, shorter songs on the album, which I like having fun with. I like making that kind of young music. It's fun to be a bit silly with it. The lyrics are not too off-kilter. They're super, super gaudy, but still very relevant to my life. [She begins to rap] ‘Little instances like eating duck in Paris and eating Rösti in Switzerland and talking to my financial advisor.' I try to take those visually rich parts of my life and go oh wow this is the life that I live. They're not just me saying them because they sound good. They're personal. My writing is my observations from my life. They get translated into that type of sound. It's not always me, though, but I like to have fun with it.
With the short film, I'm a director. I'm a very serious film director. I take that very seriously about my life. I directed 15 music videos in the last four years. I'm a big — I just love creating film. I love creating cinematic narrative. I wanted to make a short film that went with my album and spoke from the beauty and the narrative of urban women and self-love and empowerment and cultural appropriation. The women in my life are always my muses. I'm always trying to put in this lens of the woman that I am raised with, that I live with, that I coexist with, that lives in my neighborhood. It's a very strong piece that had a lot of very strong beautiful women. It was such a joy to make. I was so happy during that shoot.
STEREOGUM: Who were the three women you were walking around with in the video?
PRINCESS NOKIA: One of them is actress Maya Monès. The other two are two friends of mine from down the block.
STEREOGUM: You obviously are going to continue working with visuals?
PRINCESS NOKIA: Eventually I want to direct my own film. I work within a film team with Milah Libin, who was my co-director, and her brother Travis Libin. Me and the Libins have been making video or film for some time. We're working on short films together as well.
STEREOGUM: Since it is the topic of many of your songs, I was curious how your experience of New York has changed, if at all, along with your rise in notoriety and popularity?
PRINCESS NOKIA: I certainly do want to continue to write about New York. No matter how much New York changes, it will still always be a big part of me. I try not to let the changing of New York take away my poetry and the way that I honor it.

PRAGUE Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said on Wednesday he would step down as the leader of his Social Democrat party but remain the head of the government, a move to shore up his party's prospects before an October parliamentary election.
The changes in the party come as the Social Democrats slip further in polls behind the junior ruling party ANO, led by the billionaire former finance minister Andrej Babis.

Ahmedpur East-UNESCO has put historical Derawar Fort on its World Heritage List tentatively as it is not run by the state. If the Punjab government manages to nationalise it without mentioning the name of Abbasi family, UNESCO will preserve the fort.
UNESCO Director Vibke Jensen stated that she will soon meet the Punjab chief minister in this regard and will discuss the issue with him. She said that UNESCO is interested in the renovation of the historical shrines of Uch Sharif but has not decided which shrine will be preserved by UNESCO in near future.
It is pertinent to mention that Derawar Fort is a large square fortress in Bahawalpur. The forty bastions of Derawar are visible for many miles in the Cholistan Desert.
Derawar Fort was built by Rai Jajja Bhatti, a Rajput ruler of the Bhatti clan. The fort was built in the 9th century AD as a tribute to Rawal Deoraj Bhatti, a Rajput sovereign king of the Jaisalmer and Bahawalpur areas who had his capital at Lodhruva. The fort was initially known as Dera Rawal, and later referred to as Dera Rawar, which with the passage of time came to be pronounced Derawar, its present name.
In the 18th century, the fort was taken over by Muslim Abbasi Nawabs of Bahawalpur from the Shahotra tribe. It was later renovated by Abbasi rulers, but in 1747 the fort slipped from their hands owing to Bahawal Khan's preoccupations at Shikarpur. Nawab Mubarak Khan took the stronghold back in 1804.
The historically-significant fort presents an enormous and impressive structure in the heart of the Cholistan desert, but it is rapidly deteriorating and in need of immediate preventative measures for preservation.
After calls at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London last week for a ban on plastic straws in all Commonwealth nations, a Kingston restaurateur is trying to do his part to make a difference.
Tim Pater of Black Dog Hospitality, which owns several restaurants in town, has replaced all plastic straws with plant-based ones.
Pater, who owns Le Chien Noir, Atomica, Harper's Burger Bar and Diane's Fish Shack and Smokehouse, says that although it's more expensive to go with compostable straws, for him it's worth it.

“We all have to be aware of how serious the problem is. There is an island in the Pacific, three-times the size of France, of plastic floating around.”
But plastic pollution is not only an issue in oceans, it is also affecting local water systems in the Kingston area.
“We know that a lot of those small products like disposable plastic straws are ending-up in there and they are polluting our waterways,” says Heather Robert from Kingston solid waste. Despite that knowledge, she says the city is not testing the effects of all the plastic going into the local waterways.

During the Commonwealth summit, which took place April 16-20, British Prime Minister Theresa May pledged to do away with plastic waste by 2042 as part of a “national plan of action.”
Although Trudeau was asked to bring Canada into the fold on the plastic ban, the prime minister simply answered that he would be considering various solutions to the plastic issue.
Despite the prime minister's trepidation on a plastic ban, restaurateurs all around Canada are making the move away from plastic straws.
Pater says it may be a small step, but at least it's raising awareness of the plastic problem, especially plaguing water systems. Pater says he's a scuba diver and that he takes a special interest in keeping lakes and oceans free of plastic.
He says he and his businesses have always tried to be environmentally conscious. He says that if everyone does their part, it can add up.
“Even taking that one step of not automatically putting straws in every drink. Do we really need it?”

This move from Pater comes on the heels of Kingston's annual pitch-in week, run by Sustainable Kingston, in which businesses and volunteers are invited to gather and clean the streets, parks and waterfronts in the area of debris left over from the winter.
This year, the 10-day event had 5,365 volunteers sign up for the city's spring cleaning. The event also expanded its focus in 2018 to the waterways in the area by partnering with The Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup, an organization run out of the Vancouver Aquarium that has been organizing shoreline cleanups across the country since the early 2000s.
CKWS met up with one group cleaning up along Kingston's inner harbour.
Eric Gallaway, one of the volunteers, says he found a number of things in the water and beached on the shore where they were cleaning up.
“Just debris and litter accumulating from over the winter,” says Gallaway who added that he found “a lot of straws.”
The event began April 15 and finishes Tuesday. On Wednesday, all the bags of garbage collected by volunteers will be picked up by the city.

That response may have contributed to Strand's departure from the church just a few months later.
Strand, who stresses that the church's finances played a role in her decision to leave, is now going through the discernment process in the Episcopal Church, a first step toward her goal of becoming ordained as a priest. She also occasionally preaches at other churches as a guest.
Across the country, quietly and sometimes more publicly, religious leaders have come forward as transgender in Christian and Jewish denominations.
One of the first was Rev. Erin Swenson, who successfully fought to retain her ordination in the Presbyterian Church of the United States in 1996.
"It's surprising to me that it is still surprising when I tell people that I was the first openly transgender person to have her ordination upheld through my gender transition, and that it happened in the 1990s and it happened in Georgia," Swenson said.
It's unclear how many transgender people are serving as clergy members in the United States, but Swenson said their numbers remain modest. "It's too difficult, it's too hard for people to go through," she said.
Most denominations don't have policies prohibiting transgender people from being ordained, but the cultural and political realities can make it difficult, said Chris Paige, executive director of Transfaith, a national organization led by transgender people that focuses on faith and spirituality.
The Episcopal Church approved the ordination of transgender priests in 2012, while the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America ordained its first transgender minister in 2015. Transgender people serve in the clergy of the United Methodist Church, the United Church of Christ and the Presbyterian Church.
Even where there are policies allowing transgender clergy members to serve, in the end, it's how members of a congregation feel about the issue that ultimately determines whether transgender clergy members are able to stay and continue their religious work, Paige said.
"It can be a shock to folks' system, and some congregations are more ready to adapt, than others," Paige said. "Even in the Episcopal Church, where there are explicit non-discriminatory policies, there have been examples of folks who have transitioned in a church where they were successful clergy functioning in the role, and the church just wouldn't have them."
As long as Strand can remember, she has identified more closely with women than men, and as a child wished she had been born a girl. She always felt different, but the thought of changing her gender hadn't crossed her mind.
"It took a long time to sort things out, it took a really long time," said Strand, 60. "Inwardly I felt one way; outwardly I'm living another role. I'm always living this role, and was just trying to do the best I could."
Growing up, she was not familiar with the word "transgender." She said she was motherly toward others and became interested in the bible and Jesus at a young age.
In 2010, she said, she began to see books about people who had changed genders. The books fascinated her and spurred her to do some research.
"I didn't know it was possible," she said. "Then I started to look at more clinical type books, I wanted to read what therapists said ... and the more I read, the more it described what I was feeling."
Strand, who was married at the time, decided she needed to see a therapist who could help her understand and resolve what she was feeling.
"I knew I wanted to talk to a professional and find out if I was crazy," she said.
After meeting with the therapist in December 2013, Strand said her suspicions were confirmed. She was transgender.
"It was like everything fell into place," Strand said. "My understanding is that I was in denial. My stereotypes of a transgender person was like everybody else's. I knew I wasn't gay, I knew I wasn't into cross dressing or any of that stuff. ... So when I began to understand it, it was like, 'Oh, so the stereotypes had to break down.'"
Once she accepted that she was transgender she said she felt free to be stronger in her faith and closer to Jesus.
"I am who I am, but my inner gender and my outer gender are in contradiction," she said. "I've been female; that is who I have always been."
The Record (Hackensack, N.J.)
Best overall Samsung Chromebook Plus See at Amazon Samsung and Google have built the best Chromebook you can buy with the Samsung Chromebook Plus. It's incredibly well built, has one of the best displays of any laptop and is the first Chromebook with the new Pen that adds pressure sensitive drawing. The bottom line: For anyone who wants to use a Chromebook on a regular basis, and values getting extra performance and hardware quality at an added price, Samsung has made the Chromebook for you. One more thing: There's also a Samsung Chromebook Pro, built with a stronger Intel processor and available for a bit more money.
Why the Samsung Chromebook Plus is the best
Samsung has built a beautiful Chromebook with an incredible display.
The display on the Samsung Chromebook Plus is a 12.3-inch 2400x1600 IPS touch panel that steals the show. It's beautiful to look at and supports a stylus, which makes it the first Chromebook with a pen.
That doesn't mean everything else isn't great, though. You'll have plenty of power for the browser or to pull up spreadsheets and presentations in Google Docs and Android apps while you're working. Or play something from Netflix on the gorgeous screen when you're not.
With a more power-hungry screen than many other Chromebooks, the Chromebook Plus still had great battery life. It will last most people a full workday (8-10 hours) on a single charge. And when it's time to charge the battery, you'll appreciate the standard USB-C charging instead of a proprietary input. With the right cable, your Chromebook Plus will charge anywhere your phone does.
The Samsung Chromebook Plus is a great all-around package, and right now it's the best Chromebook available.
Best on the go ASUS Chromebook Flip (C100) See at Amazon The ASUS Chromebook Flip was rather unassuming and a little confusing when it was first unveiled, but has turned into a mini revelation. This little laptop with its 10.1-inch display and folding design that turns it into a pseudo-tablet is the go-to choice for anyone that wants a good, inexpensive and hyper-portable Chromebook. For less than $300 you're getting a 1280 x 800 touch screen, a metal build, great battery life and solid performance. If you're always on the move and looking for a great Chromebook, you can't do much better than this. Bottom line: The Chromebook Flip is also one of the first models slated to pick up Android app compatibility through the Google Play Store, which could tip the scales a bit for folks looking to be ready for the new feature addition.
Best on a budget Acer Chromebook R13 See at Amazon The Acer Chromebook R13 is a mid-range offering that seems like it should cost more. It has a 1080p IPS touch screen for interaction with Android apps, can fold back into various modes for an all-touch experience, and charges using the new USB-C standard rather than an older connector. The standout feature of the Chromebook R13 is the great way it's built. It's solid and well machined and not something you would expect from a sub-400 dollar laptop. The Chromebook R13 is an excellent choice for anyone who wants a premium product without a premium price. Bottom line: The Acer Chromebook R13 looks and feels like a laptop that would cost a lot more, and is a great choice for savvy shoppers.
Conclusion
There's a Chromebook to satisfy most any need that you may have. Whether you're buying for yourself, as a gift, or giving guidance to someone else for their own purchase, be sure to start here before making a buying decision. For most people, though, most of the time, the Samsung Chromebook Plus is the overall best bet.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in mood for a massive restructuring at the top echelons of the bureaucracy. In his own nuanced yet firm message to an assembly of secretaries to the government of India on 4 June, he sent a chill down the spine of the bureaucracy, especially the old guard, by indicating that automatic elevation to the post of secretary based on tenure and seniority will be a thing of the past.
Modi said this rather subtly by referring to his first meeting with the secretaries in 2014. Immediately after taking oath as prime minister in 2014, he had convened a meeting of all secretaries. "Exactly three years ago, I held a similar meeting with nearly 85 secretaries. Of those 85, only four are present here today. And even those four officers are on extension."
What he was highlighting was the fact that within these three years, while the political leadership remained the same, the entire top bureaucracy had changed. All secretaries to the government of India had retired. This, he said, sets government's agenda behind because with an entire new set of leaders at the helm in bureaucracy political and administrative goal-setting would have be revised, revisited or rebooted every once in a while.
The implicit message was that officers with less than two years for superannuation would have a slim chance henceforth of being considered for elevation to the level of secretary. Only those officers with at least a three-year stint as secretary would be considered to give them a long-enough run to actualise the vision of the government.
That change is not for the future, it is already happening, the prime example of which is the appointment of Sanjay Mitra as defence secretary. Mitra, a Bengal cadre officer, was considered to be a favourite of the UPA government headed by Manmohan Singh. He served in the Manmohan PMO for seven years before going back to Bengal as chief secretary. He had on occasion taken public positions against Modi, then the Gujarat chief minister. But the Modi government sought him out and brought him back as secretary of Road Transport and Highways, before appointing him as Delhi as defence secretary last month. Secretary of Defence is a fixed-tenure posting. Mitra will serve there for two years but his appointment is meant to send a signal that merit scores over seniority.
Those in attendance at the meeting said that the prime minister was quite categorical that it would be unfair to expect an official, who becomes secretary barely a year before his superannuation, to deliver effectively. In his view, such officers would be prone to "packing their bags" instead of focussing on making plans for the government.
There seems to be unease at the top over the discontinuation of the practice of time-bound elevation. A section of officers, who regarded promotion as their entitlement, is quite irked with the introduction of a new methodology known as 360° appraisal for promotion. This methodology entails a complete feedback about the officer's behaviour, professional competence not only on the basis of assessment of seniors but also from juniors. Many senior officers have been denied promotions after this methodology kicked in.
Those working closely with the prime minister testify that the 360° methodology is quite similar to the one applied to the bureaucracy in Gujarat. Even in his stint as BJP state unit general secretary (organisation) during Keshubhai Patel's time in 1995, he introduced rigorous scrutiny for the posting of officials. "For the first time in Gujarat, in the first stint of Keshubhai's regime, officers with impeccable credentials got posted," said an officer who has been working with Modi for a long time. "You see he was very keen to make the profile of state employees younger, because in 2007, the average age of state employees in Gujarat was 52 years of age. We brought it down to the early 40s," he added.
The prime minister is keen to implement similar measures at the national-level and will favour younger bureaucrats with longer service to entrust them with the task of realising the government's vision. In effect, he will disabuse career-bureaucrats of the notion that they can attain the peak and continue to occupy it based solely on the length of their service.
The prime minister even narrated an anecdote to underscore this new thinking. "Once, a politician who reached the pinnacle of political power by a quirk or circumstances was asked how long he planned to stay at the top. The politician replied, 'nobody scales the Everest to make a home there'."
Modi told the secretaries that scaling the peak is an objective of mountaineering, but it does not apply to governance.
Anushka Shetty on greatest accolade for Bhaagamathie performance: A call from Rajinikanth
Anushka Shetty is basking in the phenomenal success of her latest release, Bhaagamathie, which has emerged as a blockbuster after striking gold at the box-office. Anushka, since the film's release, has been praised for her performance from audiences and her peers within the industry.
After watching the film, Ram Charan took to Facebook and wrote, “Happened to watch Bhaagamathie last night. Mind-blowing performance by Anushka. Great technical and productional value. Huge shout out to team Bhaagamathie.”
In a media interaction on Friday, Anushka said that she got an appreciation call from superstar Rajinikanth for her performance in the film. “Rajinikanth sir watched the film and called me and passed his compliments. I was so happy because I never expected a call from him. His compliments are the best thing to have happened to Bhaagamathie so far,” Anushka said. In the film, directed by Ashok, she plays the role of an IAS officer who is held captive in a haunted mansion as part of a secret investigation by the police. Her performance as queen Bhaagamathie was widely appreciated, with critics calling it easily her best role since Arundhati.
The film has done exceptional business at the ticket window. With over Rs 50 crore gross worldwide and counting, Bhaagamathie is believed to be the first heroine-centric film to breach into the Rs 50 crore club. In the USA, the film is set to join the million dollar club over the weekend and its earnings so far are around Rs 5.58 crore.

James Alex Fields Jr. (Photo: AP)
Charlottesville, Va. — The driver charged with killing a woman at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville was previously accused of beating his mother and threatening her with a knife, according to police records released Monday.
Authorities say 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. rammed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters on Saturday in Charlottesville, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.
The records from the Florence Police Department in Kentucky show the man's mother had called police in 2011. Fields' mother, Samantha Bloom, told police he stood behind her wielding a 12-inch knife. Bloom is disabled and uses a wheelchair.
In another incident in 2010, Bloom said that Fields smacked her in the head and locked her in the bathroom after she told him to stop playing video games. Bloom told officers Fields was on medication to control his temper.
Earlier Monday, Fields was denied bond after the public defender's office said it couldn't represent him because a relative of someone in the office was injured in Saturday's protest. The judge was forced to find a local attorney to fill in, Charles Weber, who did not immediately respond to phone messages. No one answered the door at his office Monday.
Fields was not present in the courtroom but appeared via video monitor dressed in a black-and-white striped uniform. Seated, he answered questions from the judge with simple responses of “Yes, sir” when asked if he understood what was being explained to him. Fields also replied “No, sir” when asked if he had ties to the community of Charlottesville.
Judge Robert Downer set an Aug. 25 hearing for Fields, who has been charged with second-degree murder and other counts.
Fields was fascinated with Nazism, idolized Adolf Hitler, and had been singled out in the 9th grade by officials at the Randall K. Cooper high school in Union, Kentucky, for his “deeply held, radical” convictions on race, his former high school teacher Derek Weimer said Sunday.
Keegan McGrath, 18, who said he was roommates with Fields on a class trip to Europe in 2015, said Fields referred to Germany as “the Fatherland,” had no interest in being in France, and refused to interact with the French.
“He just really laid on about the French being lower than us and inferior to us,” McGrath told the AP on Monday.
McGrath challenged Fields on his beliefs, and the animosity between them grew so heated that it came to a boil at dinner on their second day. He said he went home after three or four days because he said he couldn't handle being in a room with Fields.
The incident shocked McGrath because he had been in German class with Fields for two unremarkable years.
“He was just a normal dude” most of the time, although he occasionally made “dark” jokes that put his class on edge, including one “off-hand joke” about the Holocaust, McGrath said.
McGrath said that Fields wasn't ostracized and doesn't believe Fields deserves sympathy.
“He had friends, he had people who would chat with him, it wasn't like he was an outcast.”
Weimer described Fields as an “average” student, but with a keen interest in military history, Hitler, and Nazi Germany.
“Once you talked to James for a while, you would start to see that sympathy toward Nazism, that idolization of Hitler, that belief in white supremacy,” Weimer said. “It would start to creep out.”
Fields also confided that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was younger and had been prescribed an anti-psychotic medication, Weimer said.
The violence in Charlottesville also was blamed for the deaths of two Virginia State Police officers who were killed when a helicopter crashed during the large-scale police response.
Fields had been photographed hours before the attack with a shield bearing the emblem of Vanguard America, one of the hate groups that took part in the “take America back” campaign to protest the removal of a Confederate statue. The group on Sunday denied any association with the suspect.
Meanwhile, a message posted Saturday night on a leading neo-Nazi website called The Daily Stormer promised future events that would be “bigger than Charlottesville.”
The mayor of Charlottesville, political leaders of all political stripes, and activists and community organizers around the country planned rallies, vigils and education campaigns to combat the hate groups. They also urged President Donald Trump to forcefully denounce the organizations, some of which specifically cited Trump's election after a campaign of racially charged rhetoric as validation of their beliefs. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced late Saturday that federal authorities would pursue a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the crash.
Weimer said Fields left school for a while, and when he came back he was quieter about politics until his senior year, when politicians started to declare their candidacy for the 2016 presidential race. Weimer said Fields was a big Trump supporter because of what he believed to be Trump's views on race. Trump's proposal to build a border wall with Mexico was particularly appealing to Fields, Weimer said. Fields also admired the Confederacy for its military prowess, he said, though they never spoke about slavery.
As a senior, Fields wanted to become a tank commander in the Army. Weimer, a former officer in the Ohio National Guard, guided him through the process of applying, he said, believing that the military would expose Fields to people of different races and backgrounds and help dispel his white supremacist views. But Fields was ultimately turned down, which was a big blow, Weimer said. Weimer said he lost contact with Fields after he graduated and was surprised to hear reports that Fields had enlisted in the Army.
Army spokeswoman Lt. Col. Jennifer Johnson said Fields reported for basic military training in August 2015, but was released from active duty four months later “due to a failure to meet training standards.”

PANAJI, India (Reuters) - India's gold imports are likely to jump by a third in 2017 to 750 tonnes on restocking by jewellers and as good monsoon rainfall is expected to boost demand in rural areas during the upcoming festive season, a leading refiner told Reuters.
Higher imports by the world's second biggest consumer will support global prices, which are trading near their highest level in two months, but could widen the country's trade deficit.
"Demand and imports are normalising after taking a hit last year. Jewellers are restocking after destocking last year," said Rajesh Khosla, managing director of MMTC-PAMP India, the country's biggest refinery.
India, whose gold consumption is rivalled only by China's, imported 557.7 tonnes of gold in 2016, the lowest in 13 years, according to the World Gold Council.
In the first seven months of the 2017, imports more than doubled to 550 tonnes from the same period a year earlier, according to provisional data from consultancy GFMS.
But import growth would taper off in coming months as jewellers had restocked earlier than usual this year, fearing higher taxes, Khosla said on the sidelines of the International Gold Convention in Panaji, capital of India's western resort state of Goa.
As part of a new nationwide sales tax regime that kicked in on July 1, the goods and services tax on gold jumped to 3 percent from 1.2 percent previously.
"Jewellery demand has improved this year but investment demand is still weak due to a rally in the stock market and the appreciating rupee," said Prithviraj Kothari, managing director of RiddiSiddhi Bullions.
The rupee has risen nearly 6 percent so far in 2017 and is trading near its highest level in more than two years.
"Monsoon rainfall is normal this year. This will boost rural demand during the festivals," said a Singapore-based official with a leading gold supplying bank to India.
Two-thirds of India's gold demand comes from rural areas, where jewellery is a traditional store of wealth.
The quarter ending in December typically accounts for about a third of India's gold sales since it includes the start of the wedding season and festivals such as Dhanteras and Diwali, when buying gold is considered auspicious.
The forthcoming Electric Production Car Series has been officially sanctioned by the FIA - the governing body for world motorsport - ahead of its inaugural 2018 season.
The series will be contested by up to 20 identical, race-prepared Tesla Model S P100Ds, modified to produce 784bhp (585kW) and capable of 0-62mph in 2.1 seconds thanks to a vastly reduced kerbweight.
Thirty years ago, the first issue of this magazine rolled off the presses.
It was 1987. A gallon of gas cost 89 cents. Ronald Reagan was telling Mikhail Gorbachev to “tear down this wall,” while the Bangles were telling us to “Walk like an Egyptian.” Andy Warhol had just died, and Colin Kaepernick had just been born. The Iran-Contra affair was the political scandal du jour, and the 24-hour news cycle became part of life when “Baby Jessica” fell down a Texas well and was rescued before a TV audience of millions.
Closer to home, Duke had just hired Steve Spurrier as our new football coach. Elvis Costello played to a packed audience in Cameron Indoor Stadium. And a talented young student named Melinda Gates earned her MBA from the Fuqua School of Business.
Meanwhile, here in the library, real history was being made. The card catalog was going online!
No longer was a system of tiny drawers and meticulously organized index cards the swiftest search engine. Now you could find any book held by Duke, UNC, or NC State with a few keystrokes. (Well, any book published after 1979. It would take years before the vast majority of our holdings had electronic records.)
Automation was all the rage. We were even testing a new circulation system that would replace handwritten call slips with scannable barcodes. Would wonders never cease?
Needless to say, a lot has changed in thirty years. But a few constants remain.
One of the cover models featured on Volume 1, Issue 1 of this publication was Jim Coble, then head of the Library Systems Office. Jim still works here today, now as a Digital Repository Developer. In fact, he's one of nearly thirty library employees who have been here for thirty years or more. Commitment like that is unusual in today's work environment. But it says something about the kind of place this is. Working in a library comes with many rewards, not least of which is an enlightened appreciation for things that last. You could even say it informs everything we do.
And because it's more fun to celebrate the passage of time than to lament it, we decided to mark three decades in print with a makeover—our first redesign in ten years. It's inspiring to flip through our past issues (all digitized now, of course) and see all the people we've profiled, discoveries we've made possible, and stories we've accumulated over the years.
But that's the thing about libraries and stories. No matter how many we already have, we're always collecting more.
Thanks for reading and being part of our story.
Nearly a month after the release of Selena Gomez's latest single, "Bad Liar," the 24-year-old singer finally dropped a much-anticipated video for the sultry lovesick anthem — and it doesn't disappoint.
Billed as a "film" in its promotional poster, the video sees Gomez seamlessly juggling four characters, all of whom interact with one another — a quiet teenager, her stay-at-home mother, schoolteacher father and even the coquettish woman who may or may not be the object of Dad's affections.
With a melody that borrows its bass line from Talking Heads' "Psycho Killer" and a directorial vision by Lemonheads bassist (and, more recently, TV director) Jesse Peretz, the video fuses a retro '70s aesthetic (Farrah Fawcett wigs and all) with an eerie, seductive atmosphere.
The video closes with a brief teaser for Gomez's next project, called "Fetish," coming soon. The last thing we see is a fleeting clip of Gomez, with an expression somewhere between vacant and austere, staring solemnly into the camera before tearfully mouthing "fetish" in a close-up of her lips.
Watch Gomez's "Bad Liar" video above.
As Amazon established its dominance in online retail, logistics and cloud computing, the company's headquarters in Seattle grew appropriately massive. Today it represents a $5 billion investment in 33 buildings, 8 million square feet and more than 40,000 employees.
Just this month, the digital giant confirmed it would be leasing another 722,000 square feet in a 58-story tower in the heart of the city's downtown.
Amazon has helped establish Seattle as one of the great tech meccas, behind the San Francisco Bay Area. But the concentration of tech growth on the West Coast has come with a cost, in terms of skyrocketing housing costs and jammed freeways.
Now, as Amazon ponders where to locate a second headquarters site and 50,000 workers — proposals are due by Oct. 19 — it is raising questions about whether the industry, and America, would be better off spreading the tech-jobs wealth.
Clustering is not new to tech. Think Los Angeles and Hollywood. Or Detroit and automakers, Pittsburgh and steel, Houston and oil. Like those earlier examples, tech centers were kick-started by one or two big successful companies. In Silicon Valley, it was Fairchild Semiconductor and Hewlett-Packard; in Seattle, Microsoft.
The advantages of clustering are well-known: Companies get easy access to specialized investment expertise and skilled workers. Workers have many choices of employers. Engineers with an idea can break away to form a start-up knowing the infrastructure is already in place.
“The history of the United States is wrapped around this clustering,” said Christopher Thornberg, founding partner with Beacon Economics. “If you are ahead of the game when an important cluster is formed, it gives you an advantage for decades to come.”
That dynamic can be seen in the desires Amazon set out for its new headquarters site. The company says it wants a metro area with more than a million people, a highly educated labor pool and a strong university system.
Another request? An international airport with daily direct flights to Seattle, New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington, D.C.
Amazon says it will make its choice known next year.
“It's basically narrowing down the [competition] to a handful of cities,” UC Berkeley economist Enrico Moretti said. “And even those that qualify under that criteria, there are some that have much more of a comparative advantage.”

The costs of such concentration, however, are growing.
Years of high job growth in the well-paying sector — a software developer earns roughly $100,000 annually, double the national average for workers in all industries — have helped drive up rents by 46% in Seattle since 2012, and 35% in San Francisco. Home prices have risen even faster, to a median of $690,200 in Seattle and $1.2 million in San Francisco, according to Zillow, a Seattle-based real estate tech company located a short distance from Amazon's headquarters.
Many of the tech giants already maintain decent-sized operations away from the coasts. Cloud computing firm Salesforce, which will move into the tallest building in San Francisco by early next year, also has expanded in Indianapolis since it acquired a local company there in 2013.
The company says it now has 1,600 workers in Indianapolis and will hire an additional 800 by 2021. It's even launched a campaign to persuade its workers — even top talent — to move there from the Bay Area.
“Places like San Francisco, Santa Clara and Palo Alto, they are tapped out,” said Bob Stutz, the company's chief analytics officer. “Even for us — with the new tower in San Francisco — we really have space problems, because we are growing so fast.”
Mark Muro, director of policy at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, said more companies should view cities in the Midwest and the South as attractive because employees can find an affordable home there and the local community will probably be welcoming. There are also top-notch universities and enough good talent, he said.
For Salesforce, Stutz said cheap housing in Indianapolis has been a major recruiting tool. Other tech firms have also set up operations in the city recently.
“Having a great quality of life for people is better than putting everything into Silicon Valley,” he said. “We really believe Indianapolis will eventually become another hub.”
But industry-wide tech companies are increasingly keeping their top engineering talent close and locating lower-paid jobs, such as tech support, in secondary cities, research from employment website Indeed.com shows. The disparity only feeds the concerns of some observers that parts of the U.S. are being left behind by a digital economy that benefits from the same forces — automation and globalization — that have hammered workers in the manufacturing sector.
“Past practices and prejudices about what the flyover zone is have precluded some of that distribution,” Muro said. “Frankly, I am not sure big tech has much familiarity with the middle of the country and vice versa.”
Whether that is contributing to a national economic divide is open to debate.
Regional inequality has been getting worse for a long time, with the gap between rich and poor metros rising since the late 1970s, maintains Jed Kolko, chief economist with Indeed.com.
A recent report from the Economic Innovation Group said the nation's most distressed cities — judged by poverty, job growth and other factors — tend to be former industrial hubs in the Midwest and Northeast. The most prosperous cities tend to be tech hubs or fast-growing places in the Sun Belt with diverse economies.
There is an urban-rural divide as well, according to the group, with smaller counties 11 times more likely to be distressed than larger counties.
The situation can worsen as highly educated individuals move away from their hometowns in search of a good job.
“There is a downward spiral effect,” said Steve Glickman, executive director of the Economic Innovation Group and a senior economic advisor in the Obama administration.
The sagging fortunes of blue-collar workers has been credited with worsening the country's cultural and political divide and leading, along with white resentment, to the election of Donald Trump.
“It creates a huge divide in our political system, and I think you saw that in 2016,” Glickman said.

Steve Case, the co-founder of AOL, recognized that divide when he launched his “Rise of the Rest” bus tour in 2014. Case and his company, Revolution, invest in start-ups outside the traditional coastal tech hubs.
During the bus tours, Case holds competitions, where entrepreneurs pitch their new technologies in hopes of securing a $100,000 personal investment from him.
While I love 50m free, the 100m is crucial, the discipline that delivers hardware in the most exciting races of the Olympic Games–the 4×100 freestyle and medley relays.
Nathan Adrian has won gold in the last three Olympic Games. He has 32 international medals, 20 of them gold. He's been incredibly consistent, especially in the blue ribbon event, the 100 meter freestyle.
Focusing on 100m free in U.S. swimming history, how does Adrian compare to sprinting greats like Matt Biondi and Gary Hall Jr.? Biondi (11 Olympic medals) and Hall (10 Olympic medals) tops Nathan (8 Olympic medals) on medal count, but, in my opinion, Nathan's been more consistent in the 100m free. It's that third trip to the Olympic stage where Adrian has the edge, getting on the podium and playing a big role on the relays.
Is Adrian the most consistent 100-man in U.S. history? What do you think?
Is the comparison even fair? Biondi suffered from a lack of NGB financial support during his era.
Should Jason Lezak be on the list? He made the Olympic podium once in the 100m free, winning bronze, but he was a factor on relays across 2000, 04′, '08 and '12, and, of course, his '08 anchor is the greatest swim of all-time. Maybe Lezak is the most consistent 100-man in U.S. history.
I'm Team Adrian, but I think a lot readers will challenge my argument.
Lastly, Caeleb Dressel? Does anyone want to look into the crystal ball on this guy? Where's he going to be by 2024? I only ask for fun because I did not predict his 2017 Worlds performance.

Mumbai: Nearly 70 large accounts with exposure worth Rs 3.8 trillion will require resolution under the Reserve Bank's revised framework by September, warns a report.
These accounts are mainly from the power, engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) and telecom sectors.
The report also said state-run banks are estimated to report a pre-tax loss of Rs 41,900-1,01,600 crore in the current fiscal depending on the haircuts they may have to undertake on stressed assets undergoing resolution.
In FY18, PSBs reported a loss before tax of Rs 1.30 trillion.
"We estimate an additional Rs 3.8 trillion of exposure across 70 large accounts to require resolution by 1 September," rating agency Icra's head for financial sector ratings Anil Gupta said on Wednesday.
Of these, 34 accounts total 41,000 mw of power generation capacity with total debt of Rs 2 trillion. This accounts will require a resolution under the revised resolution framework.
Of the Rs 3.8-trillion exposure, the agency estimates that nearly 92 percent is already classified as NPAs by the lenders.
Gupta said with limited recovery witnessed in some of the earlier cases undergoing resolution except for accounts belonging to steel sector and a high share of power sector exposure in 70 large accounts; a significant uncertainty prevails on the haircuts banks may need to take upon resolution.
In a scenario of 60-65 percent provisioning requirements on accounts to be resolved and normal slippages of 3 percent, the credit provisions for PSBs are estimated at Rs 1.4-2 trillion, which in addition to losses on bond portfolios will translate in overall losses for PSBs during FY19, he said.
The report said with the ongoing resolution of stressed assets, gross NPAs and net NPAs for banking sector are likely to come down to 10 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively by March 2019, which otherwise could have been higher at 12.2 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively.
As of March 2018, gross NPAs and net NPAs were at 11.6 percent and 6.2 percent, respectively.
The report expects credit provisions for private sector banks to come down to Rs 22,500-33,300 crore in FY19 as against Rs 50,300 crore in FY18.
The report said state-run banks are estimated to report a pre-tax loss of Rs 41,900-1,01,600 crore in the current fiscal depending on the haircuts they may have to undertake on stressed assets undergoing resolution.
In FY18, PSBs reported a loss before tax of Rs 1.30 trillion.
"Cumulatively, the losses will surpass the budgeted capital infusion of Rs 1.55 trillion for PSBs by the government of during FY18 and FY19," the agency said.
Gupta said the government will have to front-load the capital infusion during the current year, but may also have to upsize the budgeted capital, if the PSBs are not able to raise capital from alternate sources.
PSBs may require capital of Rs 1.2-1.8 trillion in FY19, if they were to meet regulatory capital ratios including capital conservation buffers.

Los Angeles: The Golden State Warriors shrugged off the absence of Stephen Curry to edge past the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday as a depleted Boston Celtics crashed to defeat against the Chicago Bulls.
The injured Curry and Draymond Green were both missing from the Warriors line-up in Oakland but Kevin Durant stepped up with 28 points as the NBA champions claimed a 111-104 win at the Oracle Arena.
Klay Thompson also grabbed 24 points for the Warriors, who remain second in the Western Conference standings with a 22-6 record behind first place Houston.
The Warriors recorded their seventh straight victory after overcoming a virtuoso performance from Portland's Damian Lillard, who finished with 39 points.
The Rockets vanquished the New Orleans Pelicans 130-123 at the Toyota Center.
The Rockets had a late scoring spree from guards James Harden and Chris Paul to thank for the win, which saw them overturn a 13-point third quarter deficit to claim a 10th straight victory.
Harden scored 26 points -- 12 of them in the fourth quarter -- while also notching a career-high 17 assists.
Paul also left his scoring late, with 16 of 20 points in the fourth.
Harden later revealed he had urged Paul to raise the tempo in the fourth quarter.
"I told him to be aggressive. He was passive throughout the entire game," Harden said of Paul.
"I told him, 'Be aggressive, take your shots.' He made some big threes, got to the basket a couple times, and gave us some momentum offensively. And then defensively we got stops."
New Orleans were without talisman Anthony Davis, struggling with a left adductor strain. Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry was left impressed by Houston.
"You can see why they have the best record in the league," Gentry said of the Rockets. "I thought we did everything we had to do to try and put ourselves in a position to try to win it."
Mirotic, Portis, double-act
Elsewhere on Monday, Nikola Mirotic and Bobby Portis provided further proof that their violent altercation in October had been forgotten after teaming up to inspire the Chicago Bulls' victory over the Boston Celtics.
Mirotic and Portis came to blows before the season started in a clash that left Mirotic with multiple facial fractures and a concussion.
However the two Bulls players provided the bulk of the scoring -- Mirotic with 24 and Portis with 23 -- as the Bulls recorded a blowout 108-85 win over the Celtics, who were badly missing the injured Kyrie Irving and forward Marcus Morris.
The Bulls have not lost since Mirotic returned last Friday after recovering from the injuries sustained in his fight with Portis.
"Bobby and I, we are playing good, we are finding each other and we are bringing that energy that the team needs," Mirotic said.
Boston fell to 23-6 with the defeat but remain secure on top of the Eastern Conference table with Toronto (17-8) their nearest rivals.
"Sometimes, you get your butt kicked -- it's as simple as that," Celtics coach Brad Stevens said.
"Chicago dictated the whole game, they played harder than we did, they played with more presence than we did, they played more competitive than we did, they played with more authority than we did.
Meanwhile the Toronto Raptors missed the chance to close the gap on Boston in the Eastern Conference after being pipped 96-91 by the Clippers in Los Angeles.

CHICAGO -- Jimmy Butler has become so confident in his abilities that he can dominate the game even when he's not shooting well. That was the case again on Tuesday night, as Butler went 15-for-19 from the free throw line, scoring 19 points and dishing out 12 assists in the Chicago Bulls' 105-94 win over the Toronto Raptors.
Butler, who missed four of the past five games because of right heel pain, continues to show that biggest area of improvement in his game is the ability to get to the line any time he wants.
"When you're shooting 2-for-10 from the field I think you better find a way to get to the free throw line," he said after the game. "But you know, other than that, everybody has a different way of changing the game. Whether you're guarding, rebounding, passing, getting loose balls, taking charges, getting to the free throw line is the only way to win."

Tuesday's performance marked the eighth time this season Butler has attempted at least 15 free throws in a game, according to ESPN Stats & Information reseach. Butler ranks behind only Michael Jordan in accomplishing that feat most often during a season in Bulls history. His 12 assists also tied a career high.
"There are multiple ways to help win games," Butler said. "I'm hopefully not the best scorer, probably not the best passer either, but when you do a combination of all things that's basketball for you. I think these guys trust me with the ball in my hands. ... This ballclub had a lot of confidence in me to change the game in more ways than just going 10-for-10 from the field."
Butler's confidence, which has been praised by teammates and coaches all season, is what shines through on a night like this. His heel is still bothering him, he wasn't knocking down shots, but he kept finding ways to impact the game.
Despite how many times the Bulls tried to brush off the fact they have now knocked off the Raptors 11 times in a row, the players understand that they have a huge mental edge on a Toronto group that has no answers for the up-and-down Bulls. Butler gives this team a mental edge when he's on the floor and does that because he believes in his abilities at the highest level. The 27-year-old is buoyed by the belief that his game can lift his team even when he's not playing the way he wants.
"I thought Jimmy looked good in talking to him as he came over," Bulls head coach Fred Hoiberg said. "I asked him how he was feeling and he said, 'I feel great,' so he kept going in there. I'm sure he's going to be sore [Wednesday], but he's got a week off coming up after Thursday."
CHICAGO BULLS Check out the team site for more game coverage
TORONTO RAPTORS Check out the team site for more game coverage
That isn't entirely accurate given that Butler is expected to start for the Eastern Conference squad in Sunday's All-Star Game in New Orleans. Butler, who is proud of the fact he was voted as a starter by players, fans and media, shrugged off the suggestion he would skip the game because of the injury. The Bulls have to hope they bring the same intensity they did against the Raptors to a tough matchup against the Boston Celtics on Thursday, the final game before the All-Star break.
"As bad as you guys may write stories about what it is, we're still in seventh [in the East]," Bulls point guard Rajon Rondo said. "And there are a lot of home games left."
The Bulls have proven they can beat good teams and lose to bad ones, but any hope of making the playoffs rest solely on the health of Butler and his right heel. The Bulls were without Dwyane Wade (wrist), Paul Zipser (ankle) and Nikola Mirotic (back) on Tuesday and might be without all three until after the break, but it's Butler who makes this team go and it's Butler who must stay healthy in order for the group to make a final push down the stretch.
"There wasn't that much pain at all," Butler said. "Now it's all about just about getting a rhythm, getting back in shape. So hopefully we get to go up and down a little bit [Wednesday]."
Health care workers were wearing red on Friday to help shine a spotlight on heart disease in women.
The Misericordia Hospital was offering blood pressure tests and smoking cessation clinics as well as information on the disease — which is the number one killer in women.
Scroll down to take the heart disease quiz.
“One of the main things is how common it is,” cardiologist Dr. Sayra Khandekar said. “What people don't realize is heart disease kills more women than cancer, five times more women than breast cancer. One woman every 20 minutes will die of heart disease.
“One in every five women will die of heart disease.”
READ MORE: Heart and Stroke report finds heart disease in women is under-diagnosed, under-treated and under-researched
Heart disease is more common in women than previously thought and symptoms appear differently than they do in men.
“Everything we know about heart disease — how it develops, how we diagnose it, how we treat it — is based on studies that were done in men,” Khandekar explained. “Men and women are different.
“Up until the 1990s, women were actually not allowed to be in clinical trials because they were concerned about including women that were of reproductive age,” she said. “It was only in the 1990s and afterwards that Health Canada allowed women to participate in studies.”
Khandekar says more time and resources should be devoted to studying heart disease in women — how it manifests, how plaque develops in women's arteries, how the symptoms present.
“We know that women are less likely to have that clutching central chest pain that men do. They're more likely to have symptoms like shortness of breath, feeling fatigue, a sensation that something is not quite right, heartburn — things that you wouldn't necessarily think are your heart.”
WATCH: A new report suggests a bias in the Canadian health care system when it comes to women's heart health. The Heart and Stroke Foundation calls it a “glass ceiling.” Su-Ling Goh explains.
As part of the Misericordia's Wear Red Day, people could write the name of someone close to them affected by heart disease on a red heart and hang it in the hospital.
Staff hope Wear Red Day will bring awareness to this disease in women and hopefully, save lives.

“If you've noticed that you're not able to do what you could do a few months ago… if you don't have the energy to do that for some reason — you're getting short of breath, you just don't feel like you have the fuel to do what it is you need to do — there is much less harm in getting checked out and being told, ‘No, you're actually OK' rather than not getting checked out and then having problems with permanent heart damage later on,” Khandekar said.

She said women need to be comfortable having honest discussions with their family doctors about what symptoms they have and why they're concerned.
“The onus isn't just on the woman to say, ‘Hey, there's something wrong with me.' The onus is on the medical system, the health care professionals, medical education, and health research to really put more weight into understanding how to adequately treat women with heart disease.”

Shami in action More
​
What's the story?
It seems as though Indian skipper, Virat Kohli, is in awe of his prime pace bowler, Mohammed Shami, as the Jonagar-born 27-year-old took three wickets in the second innings – and five in the match – to help India to an emphatic victory.
Kohli's men absolutely razed the Sri Lankan batters as they couldn't muster even 200 runs in any of the two innings that they batted on in the third Test. When asked about what he thought of Shami, Kohli showered praises on him.
“I certainly rate him top three for sure because of his wicket-taking ability and the kind of impact he has on games. When he makes up his mind to come out and give it his 120%, then he can bowl like this - 145, 140 clicks on a regular basis and troubling the batsmen.
It is not just reckless bowling. So he is a quality bowler, he has all the ingredients of becoming a consistent world-class bowler, provided the fitness factor can be maintained and hopefully he is not hampered with any more injuries.”
In case you didn't know...
India played Sri Lanka in three Tests and won all of them in a comprehensive manner. While they won the first Test by 304 runs, they handed Sri Lanka embarrassing innings defeats in the next two Tests.
The details
And the Indian bowlers did a fabulous job at subduing the Lankans in their very own backyard, with Shami leading the pace attack with 10 wickets from three games.
Captain Kohli was adamant that Shami is a very valuable bowler for the team and that he is a joy to watch when he is in form before concluding that the 27-year-old is a very special bowler.
What's next?
India takes on the hosts in a 5-match ODI series that begins on the 20th of August at Dambulla. India are fully expected to continue their fine form and inflict further torment on a much-maligned Sri Lankan team.
Author's take
It seems absurd that the finalists of the 2011 World Cup are having to face such a plight at the hands of the nation that were not entirely known for their Test outings away from home under MS Dhoni. Sangakkara's fine form in England just makes it all the more befuddling as to why the former captain retired so early when he definitely had so much to give to the team.

Age is just a number, they say. But not when you are a Hindi film superstar who is expected to bring in huge numbers at the box office.
It is common knowledge that the three-letter word is a crucial deciding factor in the careers of female actors. As soon as a female actor crosses the 40-year mark, or even 30 in some instances, she is pigeonholed as a mother or an elder sister (just a small case in point: Tabu, 45, played older sister to Salman Khan, 51, in 2014's Jai Ho). However, the longevity of the three Khans bears testimony to the fact that age is seldom considered a barrier in the career of male actors (Shah Rukh, like Salman, is 51; Aamir Khan is 52).
Howver, age is gradually coming into play in the lives of the triumvirate. While they can still conveniently run around trees and play college goers (although that is questionable), the range of their roles is getting limited. They no longer have the same physical endurance to keep up with the changing demands of the Hindi film industry that require them to be on their toes all the time.
In order to portray characters, and not larger-than-life heroes, an actor often resorts to three tools (given the fact that body doubles are slowly becoming a thing of the past): prosthetics/make-up, VFX and drastic physical transformation.
However, with the age factor coming into play, it is becoming difficult for the three Khans to incorporate these into their respective approaches. In a recent interview with Film Companion, Salman Khan confessed that he could not do a Kabir Khan film owing to his medical condition.
"The script required me to play an old man and then different age groups. In that case, prosthetics would come into the picture. I have a breathing problem. There is 87 percent blockage in my nose so I cannot act comfortably with all the makeup on," said Salman, referring to his Trigeminal neuralgia disorder for which he underwent surgery back in 2011.
Salman also faced a difficult moment in Ali Abbas Zafar's sports drama from last year, Sultan. Zafar required him to sport a paunch for a crucial scene in the film.
"Ali has never gone to the gym. So he is probably not aware that it demands months of patience and hard work to gain weight and then lose all the kilos to play a professional wrestler. Aamir (Khan) did the same for Dangal but in my case, I had a very haywire shooting schedule. I was not shooting the film chronologically so I had to play an active wrestler for 15 days and then a retired one for 15 days," said Salman, in the same interview.
In another interview, exclusively to Firstpost, Salman addressed the ageing issue, " Post Sultan, I still have the lot of aches, pain, and ligament tears. Once I sit down, it's difficult to get about. In Tiger Zinda Hai, I am just shooting, jumping of buildings and running."
Aamir did not use prosthetics or VFX for his role as the older Mahavir Singh Phogat in Dangal, and was lauded for his drastic physical metamorphosis — from his regular weight, to 97 kg with a paunch, and then back to an athletic physique. However, some fitness experts including Ranveer Allahabadia, had alleged that Aamir used steroids for his 'Fat to Fit' transformation as an organic change is not feasible at his age at such a breakneck pace.
Though Aamir's physical trainer Rahul Bhatt refuted the allegations, the fact is that Aamir could risk such a transformation only because he chooses to do one film in two years and had time to invest in the process. It would not be possible in the case of — say, an Akshay Kumar — who churns out four films in a year.
Like Salman, Shah Rukh Khan has also voiced his concerns about being an ageing superstar, at his recent TED Talk in Vancouver. He admitted that it was the love from fans that drove him but he is aware of his physical limitations. He has undergone repeated surgeries (on his knees, shoulder, spine) which prove to be a hindrance in how he approaches his films.
In a recent interview, Shah Rukh mentioned how he cannot play a dwarf in Aanand L Rai's next the 'old school way' — as he cannot walk on his knees thanks to his prior injuries. That is why he is complementing prosthetics with VFX, for the part.
Age may be a factor, but the three Khans aren't ready to slow down just yet — and since they're still bringing in the box office numbers, clearly, the fans haven't had their fill of the superstars either. Meanwhile, they each continue to play to their strengths to make the most of their run as leading men in Hindi cinema. After all, had Aamir not turned his perfectionist approach to playing an overweight, old former wrestler in Dangal, he wouldn't have made what is today, the highest grossing film in the history of Indian cinema.
According to experts, esports will double its current audience to as many as 600 million people by 2020. The competitive gaming industry is already attracting sell-out tournament audiences in real life venues, as well as millions more watching online.
In fact, one of the most-watched esports competitions, the League of Legends World Championship, not only has a prize pool of around $5 million, but it also attracts more viewers than the NBA or the World Series. A massive 43 million unique viewers tuned in to watch the 2016 finals.
HOW DOES ESPORTS REACH THE MASSES?
The biggest change has come from the mainstream nature of esports, in comparison to the way gaming was viewed only a decade or so ago. Once seen as a more geeky activity, the feeling around competitive gaming and online games in general has really changed. It's become much more mainstream.
Firstly, the gender gap is now just an illusion, with reportedly 52% of gamers being female. As well as this, more than 1.2 billion people are playing games today, from Call of Duty to Candy Crush. Whether your game of choice is Agar.io or FIFA, gaming is no longer seen as something niche.
Another way that esports have taken off is with the help of streaming sites, bringing this kind of tournaments to crowds from all over the world, so that anyone with a browser can access them. Quick to follow, companies such as ESPN are helping to cover the tournaments and bring them to new audiences, and help grow the amount of people tuning in and getting involved.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR GAMBLING?
Esports has certainly made its mark in the gambling industry – this is evident by the number of websites that now offer esports betting apps. One thing that's relevant in terms of gambling and esports is the concept of skins. Simply put, skins are used in certain games such as Valve-developed games like CSGO, and real money is used to purchase them, shown as items in the games.
From 2013, this is how they have successfully operated, making money from in-game purchases. As the Valve API is accessible to anyone, this has meant that other gambling sites have created somewhat of an underground economy, and skins are the currency of choice, allowing users to wager using them. In 2016 alone, apparently nearly $200m was wagered in skins.
This practice has led to underage gambling as well as problems with regulations being enforced, so Valve themselves have publicly spoken out against this type of wagering. And as time moves on, we imagine that the legal system will close down as many of these sites as they can.
This should open the space for legal cash gambling, which is rising exponentially even without the avenue of skin gambling being closed.
Verdict report that in 2016, $198m was wagered on esports; expected to rise to nearly $1bn by 2020.
Given the amount of games which are available, and how this vastly exceeds traditional sports, this might even be an underestimation in terms of the potential of esports to the gambling industry.
The future is certainly exciting, it's just a question of whether the gambling industry can reach out and engage with the esports community in the correct way or not.
MULTAN : The business community of Southern Punjab called on the government to exploit the vast natural potential of solar resources for generation of maximum electricity.
They said that Pakistan is blessed with enormous solar potential and it can generate around three million megawatts of electricity from solar source.
Multan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) President Khawaja Jalaluddin Roomi said, "Focus on solar power is essential for energy security which will not only fulfil all our needs but we will be able to export it to other countries." He said the government spends about $12 billion annually on the import of crude oil of which 70pc oil is used for generation of power that costs Rs18 per unit. "Switching over to solar energy can help reduce electricity costs down to Rs8 to 6 per unit which can help millions of people in Pakistan not connected with the national grid," he pointed out.
Mr Roomi said that the cost of solar power would come down substantially; therefore it should be focused.
He informed that global usage of solar power has jumped from five GW to 227 GW during 2005-2010 while the cost of power generation has reduced from 76 dollars per KV in 1977 to three cents in 2014.
GUJRANWALA : Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Amir Jaan inaugurated polio vaccination campaign by administering anti-polio drops to children of nomadic families.
On the occasion, he informed that a total of 1,586 teams will administer anti-polio drops to 885,000 children of under five years age in the district. He appealed to the citizens to cooperate with the anti-polio teams so that the set target of the campaign could be achieved.
He also advised the officials to perform duty honesty and dedication, adding that no child the age of five should be left unvaccinated. He also urged Ulema to play their role in this regard.
Makerere University Students Resume Lectures Today
By Serestino Tusingwire
Makerere university students are expected to report for studies today with normal lectures set to resume immediately.
The university was closed for two months after President Museveni issued a directive on 1st November, 2016 to have the institution closed to guarantee the safety of persons and property.
The president's directive followed a sit down strike by lecturers over failure by the university to clear their incentives that had accumulated for eight months to a tune of Shs28billion.
However, on the 19th of December lecturers resolved to suspend their strike, with management setting the 2nd of January as the reporting date for students.
On 24th December, the president agreed to open the university to allow students complete their first semester.
Speaking to journalists last week, the vice chancellor Prof. John Ddumba Ssentamu said the university is functioning and lecturers are ready to commence teaching today.
He has urged students to clear their tuition as soon as possible to avoid missing exams.
According to the program issued by the university management, classes resume today the 2nd of January 2017, and by the 16th of this month students are expected to clear tuition.
However, the university guild president Roy Ssemboga said this is impossible since students and parents incurred unplanned cost due to the closure of the university.
He urged the management to let students sit for exams and they clear later.
Ssemboga also asked the management to play its role to ensure that the list of students graduating in February is released early enough to help students prepare well enough.
Exams will start on the 30th of January, while the graduation is slated to run from the 21st to 24th of February
Mumbai: Indian football team goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu said on Wednesday that his side have been placed in a tough group in next year's Asian Cup and the players will have to give their best to make an impact in the tournament.
"We can't be complacent (and) we need to work hard. If we don't put in our hard work and if are the best games don't come out, then it is difficult, because there are very good teams. Thailand, Bahrain are good teams and UAE being the home side will be a difficult side," Sandhu told reporters.
India are clubbed in Group A along with Thailand, Bahrain and UAE in the AFC Asian Cup to be held in January next year in the UAE.
"UAE and Thailand, they missed the World Cup (qualification) by small margins, so it's a difficult group. We need to be at our best, because if we are not we have to blame ourselves," the custodian added.
Asked specifically if India would be aiming to be third best team or in the first two, Sandhu said, "We need to aim to be the best, but we can't take things for granted. We need to go as underdogs and play one game at a time, try to perform (in) one game at a time.
"Against Thailand (in the first match), we need to give our best and then take it from there, because after that you know what you are capable of," he said.
India will be playing in the Intercontinental Cup starting 1 June against New Zealand, Kenya and Chinese Taipei and Sandhu described all the three opponents as tough.
"It is a very good chance for us to start building for Asian Cup. We are lucky to have good opponents coming to India and giving us games. So we need to use this opportunity, and make sure that we perform and learn from this experience, because New Zealand, Kenya and Chinese Taipei are tough teams," he said.
Asked which areas the team needs improvements, Sandhu said, "You can't point out one specific area and you need to work on everything. We have been decent defensively."
"Conceding fewer goals is our aim to help out the team. I have to maintain good communication with my defence partners and that's what I do. My main coordination is with the centre-backs, because if I control them and tell them, they control the others."
Sandhu also praised goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh, who played in the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup, terming the youngster a good prospect.
"Being the first-choice (goalkeeper) so far has been good for me. But I can't take my place for granted. And whoever the next one is, I hope he is better than me. I have high hopes from Dheeraj because he is a very good prospect and he can do a lot for this country," he signed off.

KIRKUK - Iraqi authorities began recounting votes on Tuesday from May's disputed parliamentary election, officials said, a step toward forming a new government after weeks of delays.
Counting started in the ethnically mixed northern oil-producing province of Kirkuk, the election commission said, and at least six other provinces were expected to follow suit in coming days.
Parliament ordered a full recount last month after a government report concluded there were widespread violations. As a result, political blocs began heated talks about the formation of the next government.
A panel of judges overseeing the recount later limited its scope, ruling that it would only cover suspect ballots flagged in formal complaints or official reports on fraud.
Overseas votes cast in Iran, Turkey, Britain, Lebanon, Jordan, the United States and Germany will also be recounted, the panel added.
Representatives from the United Nations and foreign embassies will attend the process, as will local and international observers.
One person was killed and 20 wounded in Kirkuk on Sunday when a suicide car bomb went off near a storage site housing ballot boxes. Police sources said the warehouse was not damaged.
The initial results in Kirkuk were disputed by the Turkmen and Arab communities of the region which is also inhabited by a large Kurdish population.
The election commission said last month that initial results from Kirkuk indicated a win for the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), a historic Kurdish party.
In October, Iraqi forces backed by Shi'ite militias dislodged Kurdish Peshmerga fighters who had seized Kirkuk in 2014, preventing its capture by Islamic State militants who had overrun Iraqi army positions in northern and western Iraq.
The Iraqi offensive was in response to a Sept. 25 referendum on Kurdish independence in which Kurds overwhelmingly voted for independence.
The referendum was held by the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government both in areas recognized by Baghdad as falling under its authority as well as other areas claimed by both the central government and the KRG that the latter seized in 2014, including Kirkuk.
The March for Science is an international movement that began in Washington DC and now has more than 480 marches organized in all 50 states (4 in Hawaii!) 44 different countries. The key aims of the march are to demonstrate support for science. Asking for evidence-based decision making and freedom for scientists to communicate their findings, and promote sustained and increased funding for scientific research and support for science education at all levels. We want to build a local community of advocates.
The march is for everyone who values knowledge and tools generated by discovery and innovation. Anyone that flips a switch to have light at night, has benefited from a visit to their doctor, or uses TVs, cell phones. Everyone who appreciates clean water, clear air. And of course the keiki and all the kids at heart that are just curious about the world, and who benefit from, and contribute to, the collective knowledge gained from our diverse experiences.
The meeting in Honolulu is this coming Saturday April 22 on Bachman Lawn at the University of Hawaii Manoa. The rally will begin at 3 and the march will start at 4 p.m. Other march events are being held on neighbor islands in Hilo, Hawai'i, Kauai and Maui.

A North Lincolnshire MP has revealed he received a "torrent" of anti-Semitic abuse from two people while out on a shopping trip.
Brigg and Goole MP Andrew Percy, who is a recent Jewish convert, said he was accosted by a man and a woman while shopping in Doncaster before Christmas.
Mr Percy previously alleged that he was targeted during the snap general election last summer, with two individuals said to have "screamed" at him for being "Israeli scum" and "Zionist scum" while he was out campaigning with staff.
The former minister has defended Israel's foreign policy in the past and is vice-chairman of the Conservative Friends of Israel.
While Humberside Police did not arrest anyone in relation to the incident that happened during the election campaign, Mr Percy used a speech in Parliament, in support of Holocaust Memorial Day which remembers the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis, to reveal he has since faced a second bout of abuse – allegedly from the same two people.
He told MPs: "Those same individuals found me again in a shopping centre in Doncaster on the Thursday before Christmas and again subjected me to a torrent of abuse.
"They ended up questioning why a Jew would want to be ordering food in KFC, and followed me to the exit asking me why I do not tell people that I am Jewish before elections.
"It started with anti-Israeli sentiment and descended very quickly into some significant anti-Semitic incidents."
Mr Percy praised both South Yorkshire and Humberside police forces, who he described as being "absolutely fantastic" in their investigations. No arrests have been made in connection with either incident.
The former history teacher said he thought antisemitism was creeping into UK politics and issued a warning to the Labour Party that it must do more to combat its rise.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been called on to do more to tackle antisemitism in the party.
While he said it only applied to a "minority" of Labour Party members, Mr Percy noted that some left-wing supporters had been suspended for claiming Judaism was "not a religion but a crime syndicate" and that "Jews financed the slave trade".
Thames Ambulance Service is 'not getting any better' say local MPs
He said: "We have to guard against those who seek to spread this new smear against antisemitism, in the strongest way we can."
Labour front bench spokeswoman, Yvonne Fovargue, said all MPs had a "duty" to support those "suffering from vilification".
She said: "It is our duty to call out, and to support others in calling out, antisemitism and hate speech wherever it is found."
A spokeswoman for South Yorkshire Police said: "On Thursday, December 21, it was reported a 40-year-old man had been racially abused by a man and woman whilst at a shopping centre in Doncaster.
"An investigation is currently ongoing into the incident and anyone with information is asked to report it via 101 quoting reference number 14/18017/17."
FIRST ALERT DAY FOR HEAT AND HUMIDITY from noon to 8PM. Highs today will reach the mid to low 90s and with humidity factored in it will feel as hot as 105°! This means frequent breaks are needed today if you are going to be outside. Most of the parades will wrap up before noon, but it will be a scorcher for your afternoon plans.
There will be some pop up storms this afternoon as well, which will provide us with a little bit of relief, but not enough to bet on them. All storms will wrap up by 8PM so fireworks displays should be okay tonight. There is a light at the end of the tunnel as comfy conditions are on the way by Friday.
As Dominica celebrates Oral Health Week, Health Minister, Dr. Kenneth Darroux is stressing preventative dental care saying it is important for all ages.
In an address in observance of the week, he said preventative dental care is important for all ages, especially young people and is the key to long-term oral health.
“It is therefore hoped that persons will become more involved and take responsibility for their oral health care,” he said. “Oral health continues to be a critical aspect of general health conditions around the world and because of its weight the global burden of disease, its associated cost and the potential for effective prevention, it has been given priority globally.”
He said poor oral health which causes pain or discomfort, disrupts the normal functioning of the body resulting in people being unable to function properly.
“Thus work output is reduced or is halted, completely due to an inability to function,” he stated.
Darroux said dental decay and gum disease are common among the children and adult population.
“Worldwide, 60 to 90 percent of school children and nearly 100 percent of adults have dental cavities which can be prevented by maintaining a constant level of fluoride in the cavity,” he stated.
Oral Week is being celebrated under the theme “Educating and Advocating for Optimum Oral Health.”
Listen to the minister's full speech below.
Singaporean athlete Joseph Schooling made history in Rio by earning his nation's first-ever Olympic gold medal. Claiming the top prize in the men's 100m butterfly event at the 2016 Games netted the 22-year-old a hefty $753,000 bonus for his efforts, the largest financial bonus for a gold medal in any nation.
The amateur athlete who competes for the University of Texas continues to cash in on his aquatic prowess, as his recent performances at the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games garnered him S$31,250 (~$22, 900 USD). At the event hosted at Kuala Lumpur, Schooling struck gold across 6 events, including 3 individual titles and 3 relays.
The Longhorn swimmer wasn't the only NCAA athlete to reap rewards for his SEA Games efforts. According to Today Online, the Quah siblings also scored big in Malaysia. Quah Zheng Wen, who competes for California, earned the same amount as Schooling, as he also collected 6 titles at the Games. Sister Quah Jing Wen, who is on the Texas A&M roster, also received a significant payday for her performances, taking home S$26,250 (~$19,000 USD).
Of note, the athletes are required to give 20% of their earnings back to their respective national sports associations for training and development.
New Delhi: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad said summer training camps organised by the Bajrang Dal and the Durga Vahini are completely legal, positive and development-oriented. Referring to recent media reports on arms training being given in camps organised by the saffron organisations, the VHP said these reports are "misleading propaganda" unleashed by a certain section.
"Some people are misleading the country by sensationalising it as some sort of weapons training programme. The truth is that one can see such physical exercise being carried out in many villages and towns across the country.
"It is not aimed at imparting in any way fear in the minds of people. This endeavour to make the society strong is completely legal, positive and development-oriented," Vinod Bansal, the VHP national spokesperson said in a statement.
These camps are being held as part of routine organisational activities in all states continuously for the last 28 years, Surendra Jain, Joint General Secretary, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, said.
The orgnisation also added that for the purpose of developing mental, intellectual as well as physical values, yoga, drills and target-practice are included in such camps.

But the hotel's amazing Water Bar is the undisputed star of the wharf, declared Sydney's best bar by a number of publications. Housed right within Ovolo, this bar displays an overwhelming balance between chic and casual, inviting you to lay back on plush ottomans and enjoy a good drink and the breathtaking atmosphere.
Once you have experienced the smooth and delicious treats of the Wet Bar, you might go out and explore Sydney's main attractions – including the Opera House. That would imply to distance yourselves from the hotel, which would be a mistake in my book; I would consider moving in indefinitely.

In October, Sylvester Stallone took to Instagram to announce that in addition to producing and acting in the sequel to 2015's critically acclaimed Creed, he would also be directing. Turns out, however, that that won't be the case. An exclusive from Variety reveals that “after talking it over with [star Michael B.] Jordan and the execs, they made the decision to find another director.” That director, it appears, is Steven Caple Jr., a young filmmaker you may know from IFC's The Land and as the screenwriter of Will Smith and JAY-Z's upcoming Emmett Till project.
Jordan, who is reprising his role as Adonis Creed, took to Twitter to announce his excitement:
Excited for Coogler to hand over the reins to Steven Caple, Jr. – our director for Creed 2! Can't wait to bring you guys the next chapter of our story … coming at you November 2018. 👊🏾👊🏾 #Creed2 — Michael B. Jordan (@michaelb4jordan) December 11, 2017
Caple will be directing a script from Stallone and Luke Cage showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker, and filming will commence in Philadelphia in March with Tessa Thompson also reprising her role as Bianca. There's also talk that the villainous Ivan Drago may also be returning.
“It's an honor to be a part of such an iconic franchise and to work with such great collaborators,” Caple tells Variety. “Mike, Sly, and Tessa are extraordinarily talented and bring something special to today's culture. I look forward to joining the family and continuing the precedent set by this franchise's alumni of incredible filmmakers.”

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) - Slovakia's prosecutor general asked Italian authorities on Monday to create a joint team with Slovakia to investigate the slayings of a journalist and his fiancee that have triggered a serious political crisis.
Jaromir Ciznar said in a statement that he expects such a team's investigation into the slayings of reporter Jan Kuciak and Martina Kusnirova would be faster, more sophisticated and more effective.
Before he was slain on Feb. 25, Kuciak was reporting on alleged Italian mafia ties to associates of then-Prime Minister Robert Fico and corruption scandals linked to Fico's leftist Smer Social Democracy party.
The Slovaks have previously said that the FBI, Britain's Scotland Yard, Europol and police forces from Italy and the Czech Republic were helping with the investigation. But the request Monday seemed to ask for greater involvement from Italian authorities, who presumably have more expertise than the Slovaks on Italian mafia organizations.
Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters rallied across Slovakia on Friday to demand an early election a day after Fico's government resigned over the slayings.
Fico's deputy prime minister and deputy chairman in his party, Peter Pellegrini, on Monday handed Slovak President Andrej Kiska a proposal for a new government. It is formed by the same three parties that were in the previous government - with the Most-Hid party representing ethnic Hungarians and the ultranationalist Slovak National Party.
The coalition has a majority in the 150-seat Parliament, holding 79 seats.
Protesters accusing Fico's government of corruption have demanded a thorough, independent investigation into the two slayings. In an apparent concession to them, Pellegrini on Monday proposed a candidate for interior minister, Jozef Balaz, who is not affiliated with any political party.

Ahmedabad: Low cabin pressure mid-air forced a Delhi-bound SpiceJet aircraft from Mumbai, carrying over 100 passengers, to land at the city airport on Wednesday morning under emergency conditions.
All the passengers onboard were safe, an airline spokesperson said. "SpiceJet Boeing 737 aircraft (VT-SZB) was operating flight SG 160 Mumbai-Delhi. Enroute, the aircraft had a (cabin) pressure problem," the SpiceJet spokesperson said.
Following the standard operating procedure, the crew diverted the aircraft to Ahmedabad, where it landed safely, he added. There were over 100 passengers onboard the plane, the spokesperson said.
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP)  Authorities say a man has been fatally shot by Tennessee law enforcement officers who were trying to arrest him on charges including theft and endangerment.
The Knox County Sheriff's Office says in a news release Tuesday that 32-year-old Brandon S. Lambert of Alcoa was shot about 9 p.m. Monday and taken to University of Tennessee Medical Center, where he died.
The release says Lambert resisted officers and rammed law enforcement vehicles with his own vehicle. It says two sheriff's officers and one from the U.S. Marshals Service fired at Lambert. No officers were injured. There was no word on whether Lambert was armed.
The sheriff's office officers are on administrative leave with pay while the case is investigated.

Lambert is white. The officers involved were not immediately identified.
The Latest on the sexual assault trial of Bill Cosby (all times local):
3:10 p.m.
The jury in Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial has reviewed Andrea Constand's testimony about the night she says the comedian drugged and violated her.
Jurors had portions of Constand's testimony read back to them Wednesday. Constand testified last week that Cosby gave her pills, helped her to a couch and groped her without her permission while she was passed out, unable to stop him.
The 79-year-old comedian faces three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault stemming from the encounter at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004.
The defense argues that Cosby and Constand were lovers sharing a consensual sexual encounter.
Jurors have deliberated some 21 hours since getting the case Monday.
United Nations: Overcoming the slowdown from demonetisation, the growth rate of India's economy is projected to accelerate from this year's 6.7 percent to 7.2 percent next year and 7.4 percent in 2019 making it again the world's fastest growing major economy, the UN said on Monday.
"Despite the slowdown observed in early 2017 and the lingering effects from the demonetization policy, the outlook for India remains largely positive, underpinned by robust private consumption and public investment as well as ongoing structural reforms," according to the World Economic Situation and Prospects 2018 report.
However, the 7.2 percent growth rate projected for India next year in the latest report is lower than the mid-year update's projection made by the UN in May of 7.9 percent.
China's economic growth for this year was 6.8 percent, according to the report, putting it slightly ahead of India. But the growth projections for China are 6.5 percent next year and 6.3 percent in 2019
Releasing the report, Under Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, Liu Zhenmin, said: "The upturn in global growth is a welcome sign of a healthier economy."
The report painted a rosier outlook for the world economy overall, saying "it has strengthened as lingering fragilities related to the global financial crisis subside" and recorded this year the "highest growth rate since 2011," even though it is only 3 percent. The report said that growth level is expected to continue over the next two years.
South and East Asia remain the world's most "dynamic regions" accounting for nearly half of global growth in 2017, with China alone contributing about one-third, the report said.
"Vigorous public investment in infrastructure has been critical" in counteracting negative developments.
The report warned that for India "the anaemic performance of private investment remains a key macroeconomic concern."
"Gross fixed capital formation as a share of GDP has declined from about 40 percent in 2010 to less than 30 percent in 2017," the report said. It added that there was "subdued credit growth, low capacity utilization in some industrial sectors and balance sheet problems in the banking and corporate sectors".
It also said that there was "some degree of uncertainty over the monetary policy stance in India." It added, "Subdued inflation, coupled with a good monsoon season, offers scope for additional monetary easing. However, if inflation accelerates faster than anticipated, the loosening cycle could end abruptly."
India's fiscal deficit has declined visibly, and it is expected to narrow further to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2018.
Liu also warned that the improved global economic growth "may come at an environmental cost".
"This calls for stronger efforts to delink economic growth and environmental degradation," he added.

After director general prisons told the State Human Rights Commission that no Kashmiri political prisoner has been subjected to human rights abuses in jails, the Joint Resistance Leadership has filed a rejoinder before the commission, asking it to inquire into beating and bullying of a prisoner from Pattan by Kathua Jail authorities.
Last November, the JRL comprising Syed Ali Geelani, Yaseen Malik and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq apprised the commission, through a petition, about hardships faced by Kashmiri prisoners in jails outside the Valley.
In response to the petition, the DGP wrote: “There is one medical officer, senior pharmacist, junior staff nurse and two nursing orderlies posted at district jail Kathua. If required, inmates are referred to district hospital Kathua, Medical College / Super-Specialty hospital Jammu.”
“The basic needs required by the jail inmates have been provided as per J&K jail manual. All the jail inmates have been lodged as per the category and class mentioned in the jail manual.”
After the separatist leadership's petition, SHRC member Jang Bahadur Singh Jamwal visited district jail Kathua and submitted before the commission that none of the jail inmates complained about jail authorities.
However, rights activist Ahsan Untoo filed a rejoinder on behalf of the JRL before the commission, saying: “Shortly after the member of the SHRC visited Kathua jail to inquire about the plight of prisoners, one of the jail inmates, Abdul Samad Inqalabi resident of Singhpora Pattan was beaten brutally and bullied by Kathua jail authorities, causing him serious injuries. This news was highlighted in local newspapers as well.”
“If required the victim can be presented before the commission for ascertaining and examining the facts.”
The JRL petition states that it is SHRC's responsibility to investigate into the plight of prisoners of Jammu and Kashmir at Tihar Jail and direct the authorities concerned to take appropriate measure for their wellbeing.
The jails inmates, the petition reads, are not being treated as per the UN Charter and the jail manual. The prisoners are often subjected to “harassment, torture and agony which is a gross violation of human rights”.
Many detainees, the petition said, are detained in jails situated more than 300 km away from homeland. The prisoners have to be kept in state jails, it said. The petition requested SHRC to direct authorities to shift Kashmiri prisoners at Kathua jail to nearby jails so that their families can meet them without “harassment and hindrance.”—GK
Re-Al Mitchell is the fastest quarterback in the state. When he takes off, you need a track sprinter to catch him. D.J. Uiagalelei, 6 feet 4, 240 pounds, might be the best sophomore quarterback in the state. One person alone can't tackle him and he throws a spiral so hard a finger can be broken by a receiver not looking.
Bellflower St. John Bosco finally has solved its dilemma about what to do with two big-time quarterbacks — use both.
Switching to a quarterback rotation system that Corona Centennial successfully used three years ago, St. John Bosco let its QBs do their thing in a 42-21 Trinity League victory over Orange Lutheran on Friday night at Orange Coast College.
Alternating series, Mitchell had touchdown runs of 27 and 37 yards. Uiagalelei had touchdown passes of six yards to Jude Wolfe,15 yards to Colby Bowman and 36 yards to Josh Delgado.
Together, they are one imposing duo.
“They handled it so great,” coach Jason Negro said of the decision to split playing time.
Mitchell, an Iowa State commit, quarterbacked St. John Bosco to the Southern Section Division 1 championship and state Open Division bowl victory last season. He started Friday but will have to get used to alternating because Uiagalelei is just too good to keep on the sideline.
“We have to be dynamic on offense,” Negro said.
And the Braves were, when penalties were not disrupting things. The offensive line was effective. Running back George Holani rushed for 135 yards in 19 carries and had a five-yard touchdown run.
St. John Bosco (5-1, 1-0), up 14-7 at halftime, opened a 28-7 lead late in the third quarter and seemed ready to go into cruise control. But Orange Lutheran (5-1, 0-1) took advantage of penalties and mistakes. After Kyle Ford caught a nine-yard touchdown pass, the Lancers recovered an onside kick.
Then pass interference and personal foul penalties set up a one-yard touchdown run by Ryan Hilinski with 7:16 left.
The Braves were feeling a little nervous, but Mitchell came to the rescue. He directed a quick scoring drive, racing 27 yards untouched for the touchdown.
Hilinski, who came in completing 75% of his passes, was 22 of 40 for 219 yards and ran for two scores. Ford caught five passes for 110 yards.
St. John Bosco was called for 170 yards in penalties, the most ever under Negro.
“I don't think it was sloppy,” Negro said. “It was bad officiating.”
St. John Bosco faces Santa Ana Mater Dei next Friday at El Camino College in a showdown of the Nos. 1 and 2 ranked teams in Southern California.
In other Trinity League openers, JSerra defeated Servite, 52-36, and No. 1 Mater Dei defeated Santa Margarita, 70-35.

A day after the Roseanne reboot was canceled over a racist tweet from its creator, President Trump criticized ABC for failing to address the "HORRIBLE statements" said about him.
"Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that 'ABC does not tolerate comments like those' made by Roseanne Barr," Trump tweeted Wednesday. "Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn't get the call?"
Trump's comments were the first time he weighed in on Roseanne Barr's tweet about former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett: "Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby."
Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that “ABC does not tolerate comments like those” made by Roseanne Barr. Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn't get the call? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2018
Iger, the CEO of ABC's parent company Disney, has previously been at odds with the president. He quit Trump's business advisory council when the president pulled out of the Paris climate agreement last year. He also called Trump's decision to end the Obama-era Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) "cruel and misguided."
For her part, Jarrett, an Iranian-born African-American, discussed the situation during a town hall on MSNBC Wednesday night, during which she said Iger called her to apologize.
"He said that he had zero tolerance for that sort of racist, bigoted comment and he wanted me to know before he made it public that he was canceling the show," she said.
Jarrett said she wanted this to become a teaching moment — and noted that Trump himself bears some responsibility for Barr's actions.
"The tone does start at the top, and we like to look up to our president and feel as though he reflects the values of our country," she said. "But I also think every individual citizen has a responsibility too, and it's up to all of us to push back. Our government is only going to be as good as we make it be."

The Transportation Security Administration had the busiest summer on record, screening more than 239 million passengers between Memorial Day and Labor Day, an increase of 9 million passengers over the same period last year.
The higher workload for TSA officers has prompted the union representing the screeners to demand that the federal government hire more front-line workers.
“The people in the chain of command forget why we were put here,” said Hydrick Thomas, president of the council that represents TSA screeners at the American Federation of Government Employees. “We were put here to protect.”
The airports were so busy this summer that the TSA said four summer days broke the TSA's top 10 list for busiest days in agency history: June 29, June 30, May 26 and July 21.
The record may not be surprising considering that airline industry officials have been touting an increase in air travel over the past few years, thanks to cheaper fares and strong consumer confidence.
A TSA spokeswoman said the agency can hire only as many screeners as are allowed under the annual budget approved by Congress. The most recent federal budget approved the full-time equivalent of 43,000 officers, which represents an increase of less than 1% over the previous year's budget.
Thomas said the turnover rate among TSA officers is so high that the agency can't hire new screeners fast enough to replace those who leave to take jobs with higher pay and better benefits.
“If they don't manage this agency and hire enough employees, they are going to have problems,” he said.

In addition to FAST symptoms, you might have weakness on one side of your body. It could be the entire side of your body, or it might only be in one arm, leg or portion of the face. Other symptoms include double vision, numbness or tingling. A striking feature of a stroke is that the onset is usually sudden.
Many people have heard the acronym FAST — face drooping, arm weakness and speech difficulty, which mean it's time to call 911. These symptoms are present in about 75 per cent of all strokes.
Imagine you're watching TV and suddenly you feel your right arm and leg go numb. You try to call for help but your speech is slurred — you think you're having a stroke. What would you do?
Stoke can leave you with physical problems including muscle weakness or paralysis, pain, vision problems, difficulty swallowing, challenges with language and speaking, and short-term memory and concentration deficits among other complications.
Every 10 minutes, a Canadian will experience a stroke. This disruption of blood flow to a part of the brain is the third-leading cause of death in Canada and the country's most common cause of adult disability.
You can play a critical role in helping ensure the best outcome when you or someone around you has a stroke. You're on the front lines of recognizing this illness. My colleagues in medicine depend on you to recognize the signs and call 911.
The sooner you get help, the better your outcomes will be. Someone who receives treatment an hour after their stroke is less likely to be left with functional deficits than someone who might not have been seen until three hours later.
For every hour that passes between the onset of a stroke and the beginning of treatment, research shows the brain loses as many neurons as it would in more than 3-1/2 years of normal aging. As each minute passes, the average person loses 1.9 million brain cells, so every moment matters.
There are two treatments available to help people who've had a stroke — what they have in common is the fact they both need to be administered within a specific time frame.
One is tPA, which stands for tissue plasminogen activator. This clot-busting drug needs to be administered within 4.5 hours of the onset of the stroke.
The other is called EVT or endovascular treatment, which requires the blockage be visible in a CT scan and accessible in one of the major arteries in the brain.
An EVT involves sending a wire all the way up the arteries through a person's groin to remove the clot that caused the stroke. With the help of specialized imaging, a doctor directs a wire through the arteries to pierce the clot and remove it through the groin. The prognosis from the EVT can be excellent, completely relieving any risk of functional deficit.
Although the window of opportunity for this intervention is growing, the greatest benefit of EVT is achieved when a person receives this treatment within six hours of the onset of their stroke.
Regional Stroke Centres, like those located at hospitals such as Toronto Western Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences, Trillium Health Partners and St. Michael's Hospital here in the GTA, perform this procedure around the clock. There are also Regional Stroke Centres in Sudbury, Thunder Bay, Barrie, Hamilton, Ottawa, Kingston and London. If someone is eligible, they might be transferred to one of these locations.
As a general internal medicine physician, I see how the passage of time can impact patient outcomes after a stroke. More often than we'd like, my colleagues and I see people who've waited to get help, or gone to an urgent care or walk-in clinic before coming in to the hospital. They might not have realized they were having a stroke or how serious their symptoms were. The problem is, this delays our ability to help tremendously.
This is why it's important to get the right help, right away. Sometimes going to the wrong place first can cost so much time that the person misses the window to receive medication.
If you think you or someone you know might be having a stroke, call 911. The paramedics will know where to take you to get the best treatment quickly. The bottom line is that we all need to think FAST and act fast when the symptoms strike.

IFC Films has promoted Mark Boxer to executive vice president of sales and distribution, and Lauren Schwartz to senior vice president of publicity and promotions.
Boxer, a longtime IFC Films executive, oversees theatrical, non-theatrical, and Canadian distribution of all IFC Films, as well as Sundance Selects and IFC Midnight distribution titles. Boxer strategized the distribution and release of a number of the company's biggest films, including the Oscar-winning “Boyhood” and Michael Winterbottom's “The Trip” series. Before joining IFC Films, Boxer covered Central and East Coast film distribution for Artisan Entertainment.
Schwartz has been responsible for creating and executing promotional campaigns for a broad range of films, such as the Academy Award-nominated “45 Years” with Charlotte Rampling and the Oscar-nominated “Finding Vivian Maier.” Prior to joining IFC Films, Schwartz was publicity director of Oscilloscope Laboratories, where she managed the publicity for all theatrical releases, including the Academy Award-nominated “The Messenger.”
“We're proud to acknowledge the hard work and expertise of Mark and Lauren with these well-deserved promotions,” IFC Film co-presidents Jonathan Sehring and Lisa Schwartz said in a statement. “They have been integral to establishing IFC Films' reputation as a curator of outstanding independent cinema and a trusted and experienced partner to emerging and established talent.”
IFC Films recently released “Personal Shopper” starring Kristen Stewart and directed by Olivier Assayas; “Wakefield” with Bryan Cranston; and boxing drama “Chuck,” about the real inspiration behind Rocky Balboa.
Dozens of people attended a rally in Fall River, N.S., on Wednesday in support of a proposed housing development in the area for seniors.
“Most of us are either having to move to the city, further up the county, or we end up in the graveyard. That's where we are,” said Sandra Carr, one of the event organizers.
There is a need for smaller, more affordable homes catering to seniors' needs in the area, she expanded.

Carr said she has been advocating for more housing for seniors in the area for more than a decade, and the current push is for a group of four-storey buildings next to Fall River Road proposed by Glenn Clark of GFC Management Ltd.

A prior version of the proposal was submitted the municipality in 2016 (PDF), according to Clark's representative David Harrison.
The 400 units would only be for seniors, and there is no plan to change that in the future, he said in a phone call.
Carr said the municipal government is taking too long to move the proposal forward, which prompted the rally.
“Sometimes it seems as though the wheels of government do turn very slow. This file has been active as long as I've been councillor here for the last two years, but I can tell you that we are making significant gains,” District 1 Coun. Steve Streatch said in an interview.
These types of proposals take time to process and potentially approve, and one of the first steps in this case was to install the central water system in the area, which is expected to be completed in the coming months, he said.
While there is support for the development, others are concerned about density and height.
Coun. @SteveStreatch says a public hearing on the matter is supposed to occur later this year. #HFX #FallRiver https://t.co/Sv5xhl4ZOb —

“The application that is in for the development of this facility requires certain amendments that regional council has to consider and weigh the facts on either side, and my understanding is that progress is being made between the developer and staff,” Streatch said.
A public hearing the matter is expected to occur in the early fall, he said.
“I'm pretty sure council will see quite a few seniors there. If we have to get a bus, we'll go let them know,” Carr said, adding that she might one day want to live in one of the buildings in question.
1. Josh Hart offered a toughness the Lakers need and Larry Nance Jr. has counseled him about it. Nance remembers what it's like to be a rookie trying to prove your value to a team, so he's the perfect person to advise Hart. "I'm constantly in his ear about just, 'Hey, as a rookie, play defense, defense, defense,'" Nance said. "That'll get you on the court and then you expand from there." That is what got Hart on the court Friday night, which was a bounce-back game for him. Hart responded to getting the start by scoring 15 points and grabbing 14 rebounds for his third double-double of the season.
EDMONTON - Bet they didn't see that coming — Edmonton police are warning the public about fraudsters posing as psychics and astrologers.
The department has been getting calls from people who say they were led to believe they'd been cursed with black magic or witchcraft.
In one investigation, an individual was persuaded to pay $100,000 in cash and gold to have “black magic removed from their life and to have access” to money.
Edmonton police say fraudsters often leave flyers on parked vehicles or use fake names and target vulnerable people, promising to fix their personal problems.
Investigators say if an astrologer or psychic promises to solve personal and financial problems, it's fraud.
The same goes if they request money up front for performing healing rituals; claim to be able to remove black magic or witchcraft; or present a plan requiring thousands of dollars in payments.

Coleman baseball sweeps Carson City-Crystal
CARSON CITY -- Coleman's baseball team won a high-scoring game and a low-scoring game to earn a Mid-State Activities Conference sweeps at Carson City-Crystal on Tuesday.
The Comets won the first game 10-9 and followed with a 2-0 victory in the nightcap to improve to 4-4 overall and 4-0 in the MSAC.
Carson Cotton had two hits, including a two-run single in the seventh inning to put Coleman ahead. Josh Hilliard had three hits and then recorded the final three outs to earn the save. Nick Lovejoy also had two hits for the Comets, while Spencer Pnacek battled through six innings to earn the win.
Hilliard followed up his save in the first game with a five-inning shutout in the nightcap, which was called due to darkness. Hilliard allowed two hits and struck out eight in the win.
Tayven Cottrell had two hits to lead the Coleman offense.
"Josh Hilliard pitched great tonight," Coleman coach Tom Pashak said. "He threw six scoreless innings against a talented Carson City team.
"Today was the best that we played so far this year. Our bats still haven't heated up but we pitched the ball well and played better defense."
Coleman returns to action on Thursday, hosting Vestaburg.
SIALKOT (APP): The Punjab government has chalked out a well-knitted plan for the promotion of olive crop in the province.
Official sources told APP on Wednesday that under the plan special attention will be paid on scientific cultivation of olive crop for attaining yielding results.
Sialkot, Narowal, Gujrat, Jhelum, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Attock, Chakwal and Khushab districts are the potential areas for olive cultivation. Olive orchard cultivation throughout these potential areas could produce much quantity of oil, which may certainly bring Pakistan's olive oil import share to zero.
The prevailing environment, minimum/maximum temperature, soil types, average rainfall and other related growth factors in Sialkot, Narowal, Gujrat, Jhelum, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Attock, Chakwal and Khushab areas are exactly according to olive cultivation requirements. The marginal lands could be utilized for olive cultivation without replacing the other crops and it will help in decreasing the import bill of the country, sources added.
Meanwhile, the agriculture department Punjab was conducting awareness and training programmes about olive cultivation techniques and producing value-added products. According to available information, the overall demand of olive oil is over 1.9 million tons, of which 1.3 million tons is being imported from various countries to meet the domestic needs.
As a medley of remix songs from Bollywood flicks — Baahubali, Sultan and Jodha Akbar — reaches its crescendo, a cavalcade of SUVs carrying Hardik Patel zooms into a field in the Siddhpur block of Patan district on Sunday evening. A well-groomed security guard in SPG style-suit guarding the young leader drops onto the ground as the vehicles swerve violently. But the cavalcade moves on. A few minutes later, Hardik appears on the dais in the midst of slogans that describe him as a "lion" or "shahanshah".
There is a touch of the surreal. And Hardik relishes every bit.
The meeting is well-attended. The venue is largely filled with Muslims who have a sizable population in Patan. The rally is called the 'Jan Vedna Rally' (rally against people's plight). Completely ignored by the Congress party, their conventional political refuge, Muslims have found a new hope in Hardik. "We are winning most of the seats in Patan," says a group of Muslims. Their logic is simple: "Unlike the past, this time Hindutva is not the dominant theme".
Ironically, the Jan Vedna rally begins with chants of "Om Shanti" and "Bharat Mata ki Jai". Although some of the speakers, cognisant of the large attendance of Muslims, emphasise Patel-Muslim unity, the pronounced Hindutva tone can hardly be missed. That is no surprise. Gujarat's political and social history shows that Patidars have had no particular affection for Muslims. If anything, they have been at the forefront of the religious divide in the state. It would be naïve to assume that Patidars will have become secularised overnight. The Muslims' perceived proximity to Patidars this time around in this part of Gujarat is tactical, guided by the hope of retrieving power from Narendra Modi after 16 straight years. And Hardik is their hope.
Veteran journalist and socialist thinker Prakash Shah draws an apt analogy of today's Gujarat with the political situation in the country in 1974. He calls this the 'Bobby moment' of politics in Gujarat. He relates a conversation with Jay Prakash Narayan to explain what he means. "JP asked me to describe the political scenario as I saw it. I told him it is the 'Bobby moment' of Indian politics. That was the time when new actors had emerged with a radically different theme. I told him that something similar was happening in politics and that a crop of new leaders was emerging to replace the older ones. Even JP could not remain untouched by the Bobby moment," he concludes.
The film Bobby was released in September 1973. In an era dominated by older, established actors such as Dharmendra (then 38) and Amitabh Bachchan (31), it starred Rishi Kapoor, 21, and Dimple Kapadia, 16, in lead roles. It was both a generational and genre shift, introducing teenage romance to Bollywood. It became a sensational hit and left a deep impact on Bollywood. Shah sees hope in the emergence of Hardik, Jignesh Mevani and Alpesh Thakor.
But he qualifies his optimism by saying, "I am not sure whether or not they will mature into seasoned leaders."
The manner in which Hardik has been moving around in Gujarat is indicative of his juvenile conduct backed by lumpenised forces. His cavalcade consists of the most expensive SUVs — impossible for a budding leader to hire. And he is brazen about displaying his newfound wealth, status and clout. A case in point was his almost (Donald) Trumpesque reaction to the sex-tape controversy.
That said, there is no doubt that Gujarat has been passing through a bizarre phase of electoral politics where one of two principal poles — the Congress — has set much store by the perceived charm of Hardik, Alpesh and Jignesh rather than on its own intrinsic strength. The Congress still retains a substantial support base but that is playing second fiddle to the supposed might of three young newcomers. Since the state has always seen a bipolar contest, caste, religious combinations and rural-urban divide are overly emphasised before the polls, forcing the Congress to play a diminished role.
By all indications, this is the silliest political experiment that the Congress has undertaken in recent years.
While driving along national and state highways, lanes and bylanes of urban and rural areas, one could easily sense the prevailing mood of disappointment with the BJP and its leadership over the high expectations of the voters. Yet, that does not seem to have turned into popular anger against the BJP in general and Modi in particular. Far from it, people still retain trust in Modi although they are increasingly fatigued by the BJP's state leadership, which is seen as a bunch of "arrogant leaders" not rooted to the ground.
But any keen observer of Gujarat politics will confirm that disaffection with the BJP has never had any correlation with popularity of Modi. In fact, in a series of elections right since 2002, Modi's individual charm has been sailing the BJP through elections. And it is highly unlikely that the situation has changed now. Across the state, this electoral battle is seen more than prestige for Modi than the BJP. Given Modi's own son-of-the-soil image having risen to the status of Prime Minister of India, the battle for his prestige has acquired a distinct feature of "Gujarati asmita" (Gujarati pride). This is very evident when one talks to the non-Patel and non-Muslim electorate that is still drawn to Modi.
Far removed from the reality, the Congress' experiments are quite bizarre. For instance, Rahul Gandhi's projection of a "janeu-dhari Hindu" (twice born Hindu of Brahmanical order) by his image-managers can hardly be a political project for secularising the voters. His overemphasis on Hindu identity only firms up that Hindutva that has permeated deep into Gujarat's society over the years.
Similarly notwithstanding Patidars' assertion, the historical fact remains that the Anamat Andolan (reservation movement) had its origin in violently opposing the reservation for OBCs, tribals and Dalits. And Patidars are perceived to be religiously more dogmatic than others as reflected in the Patidar movement that resulted in large-scale communal violence. Against such a historical backdrop, the Congress' move to sidestep its traditional support base to forge an intrinsically incompatible social alliance runs the risk of being politically counter-productive. The surreal politics in Gujarat may prove to be a 'Bobby moment' in terms of titillation of the senses for the masses.
But it is bound to end like an aberration sooner than later.
India's naval ships Shivalik, Jyoti and Kamorta are on a port visit to Freemantle, Australia from 13 to 17 June, 2017 to participate in AUSINDEX-17, which is a bilateral maritime exercise with the Australian navy. The aim of the exercise is to enhance inter-operability and cooperation between the two forces.
This would be the second edition of the exercise. The first one was conducted in Visakhapatnam and the Bay of Bengal in 2015. After the success of the exercise, both the sides decided to make it a biennial event.
"The visit of the Indian naval ships seeks to underscore India's peaceful presence and solidarity with friendly and harmonious countries towards ensuring good order in the maritime domain and to strengthen existing bonds between India and Australia," the Navy said in a statement.
The maritime exercises are in consonance with India's 'Act East' policy and seem to reaffirm Australia's commitment to the trilateral talks between Tokyo, New Delhi and Canberra.
During Australian prime minister Malcom Turnbull's visit to India earlier this year, both the countries committed to deepening the bilateral defence and security partnership. They also welcomed the dialogue among Australia, India and Japan. They agreed to invest in trilateral consultations with third countries to enhance regional and global peace and security. India had, on various previous occasions, made its intention of conducting joint naval war games with Japan and Australia clear.
In 2015, New Delhi hosted the first ever high level trilateral meeting among the three countries. Maritime security, freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and trilateral maritime cooperation in the Indian and Pacific Ocean was discussed by the participating countries. Australia's minister for defence marise Payne has also indicated towards hosting another trilateral meet in Canberra. This came after India withdrew from the quadrilateral – India, Japan, Australia and US - following a strong protest from Beijing in 2008. However, the US, Japan and India trilateral has gained momentum in recent years, with regular meetings and a variety of collective exercises, as this The Hindu article points out.
Australia withdrew from the quadrilateral alliance in 2008, citing concerns about China's reaction. Beijing issued demarches to New Delhi and Canberra and lodged a protest over their participation in the naval drills. The drills and the alliance was subsequently suspended as a precaution not to anger China. However, Canberra has now indicated that it is keen for a logistics support agreement with India and has also pitched for an observer status during this year's Malabar trilateral, as The Diplomatreported. The Malabar exercise will be conducted in the Bay of Bengal in July and Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force will also participate in the naval drill.
These initiatives by India and Australia can be seen as a a negative development for China. New Delhi and Canberra are wary of Beijing's infringement on maritime security and freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific region. These common concerns have strengthened the need for greater maritime cooperation between the two nations.
Australia is also a permanent member Indian Ocean Naval Symposium, which brings together the local navies of Indian Ocean region. By coming together, both the nations can prove to be a threat to China's dominance in the region.
Following India's concerns about China's One Belt One Road initiative, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed an Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC), with support from Japan. Australia, among other countries, also sent a representative for the consultation process. Beijing has been suspicious of the trilateral engagement and lodged protest over Japan's participation. It is expected to closely monitor the exercise.
However, when considering whether or not this maritime activity will worry China, it must be borne in mind that the navies of Australia and India are nowhere near as well-stocked as their Chinese equivalent.
Beijing is likely to worry only if the strategic quadrilateral — involving Australia, India, Japan and the US — as alluded to by Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe was to actually come to fruition. But with Donald Trump in the White House, that looks beyond even a remote possibility.

In a huge disappointment for the DX community and the members of the 3Y0Z Bouvet Island team, the DXpedition's leaders announced at 2000 UTC today (February 3) that a decision had been made to abort the DXpedition and head back to Chile.
“During the last 72 hours, we continued to experience the high winds, low clouds, fog and rough seas that have prevented helicopter operations since our arrival at Bouvet,” said an announcement on the 3Y0Z Bouvet Island website. “No improvement was predicted in the weather forecast for the next 4 days. Then, last night, an issue developed in one of the ship's engines. This morning, the captain of the vessel declared it unsafe to continue with our project and aborted the DXpedition. We are now on our long voyage back to Punta Arenas. As you might imagine, the team is deeply disappointed, but safe. There is already talk about rescheduling the DXpedition.”
Bouvet Island currently is the third most-wanted DXCC entity, behind Kosovo and North Korea. The 3Y0Z DXpedition, comprised of top operators with considerable DXpedition experience, has been in the planning stages for 2 years and had attracted contributions from clubs and individuals around the world.
A dependency of Norway, Bouvet is a subantarctic island in the South Atlantic. The last Bouvet activation was 3Y0E, during a scientific expedition over the winter of 2007-2008.
"We're about halfway through the rain season, so we've only got February and March, and they better be a miracle," said climatologist Bill Patzert. "If they're not, we just back-flipped into the drought again."
ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece is investigating threats against its foreign minister that authorities believe are linked to his attempts to resolve a long-standing name dispute with the neighbouring state of Macedonia.
A letter addressed to Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias and received on Thursday said there were “three bullets” for him.
“It was threats to him and his family,” Civil Protection Minister Nikos Toskas told ANT1 TV on Friday. Toskas said that sending threatening letters to those who have been trying to settle a problem in a honest manner was “dangerous”.
Kotzias had received other threatening letters and calls in recent weeks, a government official said.
Kotzias is leading talks to resolve the dispute over Macedonia's name, which has frustrated its ambitions to join NATO and the European Union since the 1990s, and said on Thursday that he would soon submit proposals.
Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia, has objected to its neighbour's name since the small Balkan state broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991.
Greece argues that the use of the name, along with contentious articles in Macedonia's constitution, imply territorial claims over Greek land.
Many Greeks feel passionately that there can be no deal including the term “Macedonia”, which for them is the name of the ancient kingdom ruled by Alexander the Great, and an integral part of their heritage.
Because of Greek objections, the Balkan state was admitted to the United Nations with the provisional name “The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia” in 1993, and this remains its official title in international organisations.
Hundreds of thousands turned out at a demonstration on Jan. 21 in Thessaloniki, capital of Greece's Macedonia region, to protest against any use of the name by the neighbouring state, and a rally is scheduled for central Athens on Sunday.
Kotzias, who was an academic before joining the leftist-led government in 2015, in a tweet accused long-time adversaries, in which he also included some unnamed media, of being “the moral instigators of these threats against my life”.
Last night, Thursday Night Football didn't disappoint with late game drama. Heading into the fourth quarter, the Patriots were leading 16-7, but the Buccaneers made a fierce comeback that fell about 19 yards short.
After the game, fans from both teams were optimistic about what they witnessed, especially about the Patriots' defense and the Buccaneers overall play. Let's take a look at what fans thought about last night's game.
Good win by the @Patriots last night. Defense looked better overall but theres still issues. Brady continues to prove why he's the ï¿½ï¿½! ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ â Cotey Belliveau (@cbelliveau16) October 6, 2017
At the spry age of 40, Tom Brady is already having a year to remember.

While Patriots' fans were satisfied with the improvement on defense, Buccaneers' fans left with optimism about the overall game.
#bucs #bucsvspats #Buccaneers Kudos to coach MIKE Smith and his defense. Kudos to Justin Evans nice 1st game against the best. You gave the Bucs a chance to WIN. â Frank Llende (@fllende) October 6, 2017
The Buccaneers' defense was ferocious last night, tallying three sacks, an interception and a fumble.
But this one Buccaneers fan, didn't take the loss so well.

Either way, there is a general consensus that one of the main stars of Thursday Night Football was in fact Tony Romo in the broadcast booth.

It has become a kind of July tradition: Counting the ways in which California's fire season is now more dangerous.
Every summer around this time, the red flags grow redder: the dry air, the triple-digit heat, the dying trees in the wilderness, the chaparral rattling in the foothills. Every summer around this time, some fiery apocalypse erupts somewhere in the state as if to drive home the message.
And yet every summer around this time, Californians respond the same way: Surrounded by fire hazards, we set off a bunch of fireworks.
Not to dampen patriotic enthusiasm as Independence Day approaches, but isn't it time this state brought its July 4 observances into the climate-changed 21st century?
Yes, fireworks are fun. Yes, some nonprofits benefit from their sale. Yes, fireworks companies are a lobbying force. And yes, we have come to associate the rocket's red glare with Independence Day.
But there are lots of ways to have fun and donate to nonprofits and make a living in the state Capitol. And fireworks make less and less sense as California grows more and more fire prone.
Even with this state's many fireworks regulations, each summer reminds anew that it makes no sense to celebrate with explosives in a place known for its outsized fire risk.
Napa and Sonoma counties, for example, just spent most of the weekend under a National Weather Service red flag warning. In Lake County, the Pawnee Fire has been burning for a week now. More than 40,000 acres of Yolo County are blazing. Survivors of the October wine country fires are asking themselves this week whether fireworks are worth the traumatic flashbacks.
Last week, Cal Fire Director Ken Pimott issued a statement reminding that about half the July 4 fires nationally are started by fireworks, and that the "safe and sane" fireworks sold legally in California can still be a hazard if they aren't used correctly.
Even the organized public fireworks displays put on by professionals aren't foolproof. Remember the 2015 Cal Expo mishap, when the Sacramento region's largest fireworks show ended with a misfired mortar, a shower of sparks and two brush fires?

Despite the comprehensive nature of the result, Bangladesh emerged with some credit for taking the one-off contest into the afternoon of the final day and Kohli said India would need to be more ruthless in future.
“Closing off games is very important. Especially in Test cricket you don't want to give oppositions any chance to get into the game and that's something we need to keep repeating,” Kohli told reporters. Kohli, second only to Australian skipper Steve Smith in the batting rankings, will go into the series in red-hot form after hitting his fourth double century since July. The Indian skipper said he had been making sure that he does “not get ahead of myself” and said the team's recent run was about more than just his batting. “I don't think it's because of me ... We are playing as a team and that's been the difference in this side,” he said. Monday's result had appeared in little doubt after Bangladesh had been set such a massive total in their second innings and the tourists began the final day on 103-3. Mahmudullah (64) shrugged off poor form to register his 13th Test 50 while young spinner Mehedi Hasan made a gutsy 61-ball 23 to delay the inevitable against the world's No. 1 Test side. But the match ended when Ashwin, who in his 45th Test had become the fastest bowler to claim 250 Test wickets on Sunday, trapped Taskin Ahmad lbw to finish with figures of four for 73. There was some drama after the umpire originally turned down his appeal but had to change his mind after the decision was reviewed by the Indian team. Ashwin also dismissed first innings centurion Mushfiqur Rahim (23) in the morning session to scupper Bangladesh's only real hope of saving the match, while Jadeja accounted for star batsman Shakib Al Hassan (22). Mahmudullah then put on fighting partnerships with their captain Rahim and Sabbir Rahman to resist the Indian attack on what still seemed to be a decent batting track. India had bowled out Bangladesh for 388 in their second innings and decided to build on their 299-run lead after not enforcing the follow-on. Ninth-ranked Bangladesh were always left playing catch-up after the hosts posted a mammoth 687-6 declared in their first innings. Rahim said he was “really proud” of his side and hoped that “we can learn from this”. “Our bowlers need to learn how to bowl in partnerships and that can create chances. But it gives us a lot of belief after playing the number one Test side,” he said. The result meant India maintained their unbeaten record against the minnows and now have seven wins and two draws in nine encounters. The Australia series begins on February 23, with the first Test in Pune followed by matches in Bengaluru, Ranchi and Dharamsala.
REGINA – Ed Gainey won't forget his most recent CFL performance. And neither will Jonathon Jennings.
Gainey was all smiles after he and his Saskatchewan Roughriders blasted the B.C. Lions 41-8 Sunday night at Mosaic Stadium.
Gainey was the ring leader of a dominant defensive showing from the Riders, who just six days previous were manhandled 30-15 by the Lions at BC Place. Gainey had four interceptions and a fumble recovery and the unit as a whole registered five picks and four sacks.
“I started off slow these first six games of the season and I expect a lot more out of myself,” Gainey said.
“These past two weeks I've been able to get my hands on some balls and wasn't able to bring them in. I had my son (10-month-old Grayson) coming in to town this week and I just had a feeling that I was going to be able to make some plays out there today. I didn't think it was going to be four, but they came and I took advantage of them.”
Gainey's four interceptions is a franchise record. It was a performance Riders head coach Chris Jones was waiting for and, perhaps, anticipating after a “very direct” conversation he had with his veteran defensive back earlier in the week.
“I told him, ‘You know, you're a good player, but you're not playing like a good player,'” Jones said of that talk.
The victory helped the Riders (3-4) keep pace with the competitive West Division, including the fourth-place Lions (5-3), who they trail by four points.

Jennings, understandably, didn't match his opponent's enthusiasm after throwing four picks.
“It was the toughest game of my career. It was the toughest game of my life, actually, Jennings said after his return to the starting lineup.
“I've never gone through something like that. It was tough. It seemed like I couldn't do much of anything. It seemed like everything was a struggle.”
Gainey's first two interceptions — both in the first quarter — led to points.
Jennings heaved a deep pass that Gainey snatched at the Saskatchewan 31-yard line. Four plays later, Kevin Glenn hooked up with Bakari Grant on a 35-yard touchdown pass and catch that gave the Riders an early 8-0 lead.
On the ensuing B.C. drive, Gainey again picked off Jennings and returned the ball 49 yards for another touchdown.
The Riders' defence forced a Lions punt on their next possession and Glenn, again, marched the Riders 90 yards for another touchdown. Cameron Marshall (one-yard run and a 29-yard reception) scored back-to-back majors to give the home team a 29-0 lead going into the half.
“We all know that we put a bad product on the field last week, so we wanted to come out here and make a statement,” said Riders defensive end Tobi Antigha, who had two sacks in the game.
“This just gives us confidence that we can compete and actually play very well against the Western teams. Going forward, this is the expectation. We don't want this to be just a one-game thing. We want this to be the standard, especially on defence — domination up front, domination in the secondary, domination at the linebacker position.”
Jennings missed the previous three games with a right (throwing) shoulder injury. His best drive on Sunday came on the opening possession in the second half when he pushed the Lions to the Saskatchewan five-yard line. However, his fourth inception snuffed that drive.
“I had some mistakes, some big mistakes that made it tough, but they were dropping deep and switching coverages, giving us man-to-man at times, and they got pressure at times, too,” Jennings said. “They made it tough and we didn't make any plays.
“It's only one game. It doesn't define us as a team. It doesn't define us as players going forward. I'm not going to let this define me.”
Jennings finished the night 14-of-30 for 195 yards and one touchdown — a 56-yard bomb to Chris Williams in the fourth quarter.
Glenn was 19-for-25 for 320 yards and three touchdowns. Marshall had a combined 104 yards total offence and two touchdowns.
The Riders will savour this victory during their bye week, while the Lions are to return home to take on the Calgary Stampeders (5-1-1) on Friday.
He co-wrote and directed the film “10th & Wolf,” which starred James Marsden, and picked up an Academy Award for co-writing the script for “Crash” (2004). This year Moresco wrote and directed the action-drama film “Bent,” which features actors Karl Urban, Andy Garcia and Sophia Vergara.
PEEL Track by Track, photo by Kyle Hampson
Track by Track is our recurring new music feature giving an artist the opportunity to dig into the details of every song on their latest offering.
There are plenty of scenes thriving in the streets of Chicago. Those looking for lyrical hip-hop or psychedelic indie rock alike can find gratification any night of the week in the city's various venues. Anyone seeking out a sweaty, riff-heavy party vibe in the 773 has likely come across PEEL, the area's latest rising punk act. The quartet first revealed themselves with 2016's Marlboro Country, but really came into their own with last year's Goes Bananas. Now, PEEL are back with a new EP that builds on their undeniably hooky blend of classic rock sounds and poppy punk thrills.
Entitled Never Not Dead, the five-track effort was recorded by Dave Vettraino at Chiago's Jamdek Studios before heading to Brooklyn for mixing and mastering by Bobby Lord. Opener “Wet Work” is the perfect intro for fans new and old, its pounding drums and fiery guitar licks driving a heavy '70s thrust underneath the gang screams of, “Fuck yeah!” Pete Mueller takes lead on the song, as he does on the punk-pop follow-up, “Give Up Your Ghost”, and the lamenting “Broken Down” . His fellow guitarist Kyle Hickey, meanwhile, delivers his crackling rock-a-billy vocals on tracks like the barn-burning “Teenage Rock & Roll Sinner” and the dark doo-wop of closer “High Til I Die”.
Never Not Dead will be self-released this Friday, April 27th. Ahead of the street date, you can stream the entire thing below.
For more insight into the EP, Mueller and Hickey have broken down the whole thing Track by Track.
“Wet Work”:
Pete Mueller: This is like a Gun Club song that got put through the Peeler. It grew out of a random riff we were jamming at our space. Love songs that don't suck are hard to write, and they're boring, so I usually write the opposite — just to keep myself interested long enough to finish writing it. Hence, a song about a hitman going around blowing people away. It keeps with the tradition of horrifying PEEL lyrical content.
“Give Up Your Ghost”:
PM: This song is about the afterlife. Take from it what you will.
“Teenage Rock & Roll Sinner”:
Kyle Hickey: Around 1930 Robert Leroy Johnson went to a rural Mississippi country crossroads at midnight to make a pact with the devil. In exchange for his soul the devil tuned Johnson's guitar played a little and handed it back. Johnson went on to father the blues. In 1951 Rock n roll was just a euphemism for the horizontal shuffle until Ohio Disc Jockey Moondog Alan Freed branded his eclectic gathering of rhythm and blues music featuring elements of sex, danger, deviance, quick kicks and cheap thrills exciting teenagers and outcasts everywhere. New York in 1974 bore the birth of what would become punk rock desperately reviving music from near paralysis. Last month I wrote this song on a napkin during lunch and we recorded it a week later.
“Broken Down”:
PM: This might be the most honest song I've ever written. I have no idea what it's about. Relationships? Did I write a song about relationships? Shit. Maybe I did. This is considered a “ballad” for us. So take out your hankies and throw up your lighters when we play it. There's at least one minor chord in it.
“High Til I Die”:
KH: It's a candy-coated doo-wop song about depression and addiction. We live in Chicago, it's cold and grey. You go bowling or you stay in bed and get high. The end!
The first season of The Handmaid's Tale ended with plenty of cliffhangers. Offred's fate is unclear, and Janine and Emily are prisoners in the Colonies. But in an interview with TV Guide, showrunner Bruce Miller gave fans a few Handmaid's Tale Season 2 spoilers about Alexis Bledel's Emily — spoilers are ahead for The Handmaid's Tale Season 2. Miller hinted to TV Guide that Emily won't die in the radioactive wasteland. It looks like the character will leave the Colonies in The Handmaid's Tale — so where will Bledel's character go from there? Despite everything she's been through, Emily's not giving up just yet.
Bledel's character, originally referred to as Ofglen, has a much bigger role in the Hulu series than in Margaret Atwood's novel. In Season 1, Ofglen, whose real given name is Emily, becomes Ofsteven after being punished and forced to change houses, because she once had a relationship with a woman. Emily is also subjected to female genital mutilation, since Gilead doesn't allow same-sex relationships. She eventually steals a car and runs over a member of the Eyes, which appears to be when she's sentenced to the Colonies after being caught.
It looks like the driving spree was far from the end of Emily's story, though. In his conversation with TV Guide, Miller spoke of the character's resilience and what fans can expect from Emily in the second season.
George Kraychyk/Hulu
Here's what Miller told the magazine about Emily's fate in the Colonies:
"I don't think your time in the Colonies can affect you anyway but poorly, knock down your confidence in other human beings... But for Emily, I think it really exposes some survival instincts in her that she didn't know were there. Her ability to survive, her ability to be cruel to other people who she thinks don't deserve any kindness. Also, her ability to live day-to-day and still have friendships and interactions and mark the passages of life and how even in a terrible situation she can do that."
Emily was one of the show's first members of the resistance to be shown on screen, so it makes sense that her story will be expanded in the show's second season. Plus, in season 2 of The Handmaid's Tale, viewers will get to see just what the torture of the Colonies really entails. In Atwood's novel, those who are sent there are referred to as "unwomen," with the implication that their lives are of little value to the rest of Gilead. The women are forced to clean toxic waste, and Miller didn't mince words when describing the Colonies during a PaleyFest panel on Sunday.
The showrunner's said the following description of the toxic location:
"The colonies are horrible. They're an extrapolation of how they think about women as disposable."
Miller also said at PaleyFest that he researched "everything from the Holocaust to gulags and prison labor camps in China." He wanted to see what people were like after experiencing these places, to authentically portray how Emily might feel after the experience.
The showrunner also hinted to TV Guide that Emily and Offred could reunite in the future. But we don't know how or when Emily leaves the Colonies, so that opens up plenty of questions about the show's future. Could Offred also be sent to the Colonies? Will Emily rejoin the society of Gilead, and cross paths with Offred as a handmaid once again? Could both of them escape to Canada, as Moira did?
There are plenty of questions fans will have ahead of the show's second season. But knowing that Emily does get to leave the Colonies offers at least a small bit of hope for the women's fate.
India is ranked 109th in mobile internet speeds and 76th for fixed broadband speed globally, which is a 15 percent increase, according to data from Ookla's November Speedtest Global Index.
"At the start of 2017, the average mobile download speed in India was 7.65 Mbps. Heading into the end of the year, average mobile download speed is 8.80 Mbps as of November. That's a 15 percent increase," a statement said here on Monday.
"While mobile speeds increased modestly, fixed broadband speeds increased dramatically. Average fixed broadband download speed in January was 12.12 Mbps. As of November, it's at 18.82 Mbps, a close to 50 percent jump," it added.
As of November, Norway ranks first in the world for mobile internet with an average download speed of 62.66 Mbps. Singapore takes the top spot for fixed broadband with a 153.85 Mbps average download.
"Both mobile and fixed broadband internet in India are getting faster, that's good news for all Indian consumers no matter which operator or plan they use to access the internet. India still has a long way to go to catch up with countries that have top speeds around the world, however, we at Ookla are highly optimistic about the capacity for growth that is available in the Indian market and looks forward to watching how the market grows in this coming new year," said Doug Suttles, Co-Founder and General Manager at Ookla.
Ookla analyses the performance of the internet in every country based on consumer-initiated tests taken by real people using Speedtest.
"Over 17 billion tests have been taken with Speedtest to date. From our observations in these markets, there are a handful of factors that consistently tend to drive advances in internet speeds and performance. These factors also apply to growth in India," the statement said.
It said the first and foremost factor is sufficient infrastructure. The strength and quality of networks is the baseline foundation required for faster speeds. Another key element in growth is competition. When operators compete to provide the fastest speeds and the best plans for consumers, they incentivise each other to offer progressively better options.
And a third factor in improving speeds is the consideration of new technologies that may boost network performance.
Just under the Interstate 5 bridge on the Washington side of the Columbia river, clouds of dust from debris rise above the former Red Lion Hotel Vancouver at the Quay. Two giant excavators are hard at work tearing down what remains of the local landmark.
The hotel itself has only been here since the 1970's, but almost everybody in town has a memory of it, including Abbi Russell, communications manager for the Port of Vancouver.
“I have a family member that has a business that used to have Christmas parties here. My husband and I looked at it when we were planning our wedding. My best friend waited tables here in high school,” said Russell as she snapped photos on the hotel's demolition day. “We all have some kind of connection.”
The city's waterfront is just a couple minutes from Esther Short Park and the heart of downtown Vancouver. But the two areas could not be more different. Large swaths of land along the water are still largely industrial or completely vacant. New plans to transform the space could fulfill a long-delayed dream to revitalize the waterfront. The city is hoping the new development will draw tourists and new residents to the growing southwest Washington region.
“It's going to be a destination both for tourists and businesses alike, as well as residents of the community,” said John McDonagh, the president and CEO of the Greater Vancouver Chamber of Commerce. “They're going to have access to the riverfront along there in a way that they haven't had in decades.”
The land slated for development is an area called Terminal 1, a piece of property that the Port has owned since 1926. The building was originally a warehouse that moved goods made in the Pacific Northwest. Everything from lumber and wood products to grains and prunes were exported from the docks and shipped across the country.
“What we had essentially as the front door to the state of Washington, to Clark County, and the city of Vancouver, was an industrial face,” said McDonagh.
McDonagh believes the waterfront makeover represents a shift toward a younger and cooler Vancouver. Just as Portland revitalized formerly industrial neighborhoods, like the South Waterfront and the Pearl District, Vancouver is hoping to capitalize on its prime real estate on the Columbia River.
Plans for the Port property call for a new hotel, and possibly a public market space. Down the road, the city of Vancouver has already broken ground on 32 acres of waterfront land. They're working with Gramor Development on the $1.5 billion project. New restaurants and bars, a waterfront pier, and more than 3,000 new residential units are in the works. McDonagh says all of this, combined with the recent renaissance downtown, is changing Vancouver's sense of place.
“Place gets defined by those restaurants with a cool vibe, or taprooms, or brewpubs. And I think Vancouver is aware of that,” he said. “And with the influx of young millennials looking for that place, I think the marketplace is responding.”
For decades, Vancouver lived in the shadow of its neighbor across the river, Portland.
“Vancouver as a community had an inferiority complex – 'Oh well, we're just little old Vancouver,'” said downtown resident Pat Jollata. “That's changing now.”
Jollata, a former Vancouver city councilwoman for two decades, says the city has grown a lot since she and her husband moved here in 1982. The downtown renaissance has brought hip restaurants and bars to her neighborhood. She thinks the new waterfront will only improve the city's identity and help attract people to the Washington side of the river.
“It's a great transition and people are really drawn to the water,” Jollata said. “And the younger people want to live in a downtown. There is a feeling of being where everything is going on.”
But she says, as a historian, it can sometimes be difficult to see familiar places like the Red Lion come down.
“You always hate to see things go away,” she said. “But I know that what's going to come will be better than what was there.”
Dennis Edwards, who joined the top Motown act the Temptations to take lead vocals on some of the group's most memorable latter-day hits such as “Just My Imagination,” died Friday in Chicago of undisclosed causes. He was 74.
In 1968, Edwards stepped in to replace founding lead singer David Ruffin in “the Temps.” While Ruffin had specialized largely in smoother romantic balladry, the gospel-trained Edwards sported a grittier style, and he left a distinctive mark on the unit's work as both lead vocalist and in the ensemble harmonies.
His arrival in the Temptations coincided with the increasingly expansive and experimental “psychedelic soul” productions helmed by Norman Whitfield, who also co-wrote many of their biggest chart hits, many of which featured pointed social or political content.
With Edwards, the retooled quintet struck gold with 1968's “Cloud Nine” (No. 6 pop, No. 2 R&B). That stylistic breakthrough was followed by such other dynamic Whitfield-produced numbers as 1969's “Runaway Child, Running Wild” (No. 6 pop, No. 1 R&B) and “I Can't Get Next to You” (No. 1 pop and R&B), 1970's “Psychedelic Shack” (No. 7 pop, No. 2 R&B) and “Ball of Confusion” (No. 3 pop, No. 2 R&B), 1971's “Just My Imagination” (No. 1 pop and R&B) and 1972's “Papa Was a Rollin' Stone.”

The act's last major hit was the No. 1 R&B single “Shakey Ground” in 1975.
Edwards essayed a solo career, and his 1984 Motown single “Don't Look Any Further,” a duet with Siedah Garrett, reached No. 2 on the R&B charts in 1984. But he remained best known as a member of the Temptations; after a split with the act in 1977, he returned for a short second tour of duty in 1987.
After a wrangle with founding member Otis Williams, he toured during the ‘90s under the rubric the Temptations Review featuring Dennis Edwards.
In 1989, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Temptations.
Edwards was born Feb. 3, 1943 in Fairfield, Ala. His father was a minister, and he grew up singing in the church. He moved with his family to Detroit in the early ‘50s.
As a teen, Edwards sang gospel, but, like Sam Cooke and many other prominent gospel performers, he turned to rhythm & blues. He briefly led his own group, Dennis Edwards and the Fireballs. In 1966, after a stint in the military, he joined Motown on retainer in a utility role, and worked briefly with the Contours.
David Ruffin's escalating drug problems and egomania created tension within the Temptations, and in 1968 Williams and Eddie Kendricks brought Edwards into the act, while Ruffin exited for a solo career.
Edwards' presence toughened the group's vocal sound, and his presence helped loft Whitfield's ingenious, densely produced records – which reflected the influence of Sly & the Family Stone and other rock-leaning soul acts of the day – to the pinnacle of both the pop and R&B charts.
His years of prominence with the group coincided with the Temps' biggest pop albums: “Cloud Nine” (No. 4, 1969), “Puzzle People” (No. 5, 1969), “Psychedelic Shack” (No. 9, 1970), “All Directions” (No. 2, 1972) and “Masterpiece” (No. 7, 1973). All of those titles hit No. 1 on the R&B albums charts.
Increasingly poor inter-group relations led Williams to fire Edwards, but, after a decade of solo work, he returned to the unit in 1987 after his replacement Ali Woodson's departure. A second termination came within a year. Edwards' plans to record with former Temps members Ruffin and Kendricks crashed after Ruffin's death from a drug overdose in 1991.
Edwards is survived by a daughter from his brief marriage to Ruth Pointer of the Pointer Sisters.
RAWALPINDI -Federal Areas held on to their nerves to beat KP by 25 runs in the Pakistan Cup One-Day 2017 nerve-wrecking encounter played here at Pindi Stadium on Monday.
M Sami late blitz almost snatched victory from Federal Areas, but his unbeaten 25-ball 42 were too less to carry the day. Ehsan Edil and Sohail Khan grabbed three wickets each conceding 54 and 64 runs respectively, as KP were all out for 326 in 49 overs. M Hafeez was named player of the match for his superb batting display.
Chasing a huge total, KP got off to the worst possible start as they lost their prolific opener Israrullah at the score of 14 while Iftikhar was sent packing at the total of 51. The outstanding fourth-wicket 94-run partnership between skipper M Rizwan and Imran Butt gave KP hope of chasing down almost impossible target, but later, both Rizwan and Imran got out when KP needed them badly.
Veteran Shoaib Malik then carried the hopes of highly unlikely victory with a superb 72 of 49 balls, smashing 7 boundaries and 2 sixes, but as he tried to improvise, he also lost his wicket. M Sami inflicted new lease of life in KP chase, as he hit quick-fire unbeaten 42 but those proved too less to land their team home, as KP kept on losing wickets at regular intervals and were all out in 49 overs. Imran Butt slammed 66 of 86 balls while skipper Rizwan hit 62.
Earlier, sparkling 123 runs by Test discarded M Hafeez was the highlight of the day for Federal Areas, as they posted massive 351-5 on the board in allotted overs. Federal Areas, who opted to bat first after Imad Wasim won the toss on a placid track, got off to the worst possible start as opener Sami Aslam was given out lbw in the third over of M Sami. After that, magnificent 174-run third-wicket stand between Abid Ali and M Hafeez laid the foundation of a massive 351 total. Abid was unlucky not to complete a deserving ton as he was out after scoring 87.
Hafeez was in full flow, it seemed he wanted to get rid of the tag of slow starter and he succeeded in doing so. He completed his ton in 97 balls and was finally got out after scoring 123 off 117 balls studded with 15 fours and 1 six. Haris Sohail also batted well and gathered 56.
Waqas Maqsood was the most successful KP bowler as he grabbed 3-68. Iftikhar Ahmed remained most expensive bowler as he conceded 87 runs in 9 overs. It was highly pathetic captaincy from Rizwan, who utilised 8 bowlers, as he was looking completely out of sorts. He used seven bowlers in the first 23 overs, which showed his inefficiency to lead the side packed with so many top stars.
Federal Areas decided to give rest to Zohaib Ahmed, who is one of the most successful all-rounder of modern era and the skipper, who just recently helped PTV to lift Patron's Trophy Grade-II title. When asked from a responsible person from Federal Areas, he gave a very childish reason saying, “We wanted to give him much-needed rest.”
Once again the crowd presence for such a high-profile event was quite disappointing. The PCB failed to properly advertise that's why Rawalpindi people, who are well-known to throng the stadiums in great numbers, couldn't come to witness the match. Instead of charging for tickets, tournament organising committee chairman Shakil Shaikh must announce free entry, which can pull handsome crowd. On the other hand, the security arrangements were quite satisfactory as compared to previous events, while the arrangements at media centre were also quite satisfactory.
The PCB media department must ensure accreditation cards should only be issued to relevant sports journalists, not on the basis of relations. PCB media head of the event Shakil Khan is very experienced and cooperative, so he should be handed over powers to deal with the situation. Keeping in mind hot weather, tournament organising committee should allow three water breaks rather than two, as players were clearly looking exhausted.
The match officials for the match were Zamir Hiader and Ghaffar Gazmi (umpires), Ahsan Raza (TV umpire), Ahmed Shahab (reserve umpire), Nadeem Arshad (match referee), Shakeel Khan and Umar Farooq (official scorers).

Mark Bigler announced he is stepping down as West high school's boys basketball coach Tuesday night.
Bigler has taught for the past 41 years and has been a head basketball coach for 37 of them.
He spent the last 14 seasons with West, leading them to a 15-7 record last year.
Before breakfast-cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post died in 1973, she willed her sprawling Palm Beach villa to the federal government for use as a winter White House.
She thought the lavish castle on the sand — built in the 1920s for $8 million and named Mar-a-Lago — would be a perfect escape for U.S. presidents and visiting world leaders.
But for years, no president showed any real interest. The estate stood vacant, its somewhat reluctant owner left to foot an annual maintenance bill estimated at $1 million. Efforts to return Mar-a-Lago to the Marjorie Merriweather Post Foundation were unsuccessful until 1980.
Donald Trump snagged the 100-plus-room resort five years later after some shrewd negotiating. And now, Post's vision has become a reality.
Days before his inauguration, Trump officially declared Mar-a-Lago his winter White House.
Trump has spent the last two weekends there, most recently hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The pair dined and golfed — and confronted the news that North Korea had tested another missile.
Fellow diners observed the two leaders consulting with aides in full public view. The White House denied reports that sensitive or classified information was being discussed.
Trump is reportedly planning to return to Mar-a-Lago this weekend.
He first laid eyes on the property while vacationing in Palm Beach in 1982. The estate featured a 75-foot-tall bell tower, a nine-hole golf course and a tunnel to the beach.
Almost immediately, Trump put in an offer for $15 million, which was promptly rejected, according to his book “The Art of the Deal.”
Over the next few years, offers from other buyers fell through. In 1985, Trump offered $5 million in cash plus $3 million for furnishings, he said. A month later, the deal was done.
In 1995, after a decade of using the estate as a private residence, Trump turned the estate into a private club — with an initiation fee of $100,000.
After Trump's election, the initiation fee doubled to a $200,000. Annual membership dues are $14,000, CNBC reported.
During his transition, Trump delighted in showing off the grounds to reporters as he met with potential administration officials there. At one point, with boxing promoter Don King by his side, he took questions from reporters at the estate's grand entrance.
Trump celebrated New Year's Eve there with hundreds of guests. The menu began with “Mr. Trump's Wedge Salad.”
Mar-a-Lago, which means “sea to lake” in Spanish, covers roughly 20 acres between the Atlantic Ocean and Lake Worth.
It opened in 1927 after four years of construction that involved three boatloads of stone imported from Italy, 36,000 Spanish tiles dating back to the fifteenth century and 2,200 square feet of marble from an old castle in Cuba.
“It must be driving the Secret Service crazy because it's got enormous grounds,” said Paul George, resident historian at HistoryMiami Museum, comparing the property with other presidential retreats. “It's not as cloistered or contained as a lot of other places.”
Trump isn't the first president drawn to the warmth and water in the Sunshine State. Here's a look at others who've retreated to Florida:
Harry Truman
After a difficult 18 months on the job, Truman came down with a cough he couldn't kick. His doctor suggested he travel somewhere warm to recover.
Truman ended up at a residence for naval officers in Key West and fell in love with Florida.
During his presidency, he spent 175 days — most in the fall and spring — in what's now known as the Little White House.
During that first trip in 1946, Truman's press secretary took reporters aboard a submarine for the first-ever underwater news conference, 20 miles south of Key West, 300 feet submerged.
Five other sitting and former presidents have sought respite in the building, including Dwight D. Eisenhower, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.
In 2001, the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan used the location for international peace talks.
John F. Kennedy
During his presidency, Kennedy often retreated to the Palm Beach home his father had bought for a bargain in 1933.
Covering two acres, the estate featured six bedrooms, a four-car garage and 200 feet of ocean frontage.
“He was down there a good bit, usually in the wintertime because the climate, of course, is so mild here,” said George, the historian.
Richard Nixon
Nixon bought two waterfront homes in Key Biscayne after winning the election in 1968. He'd been visiting the tiny island town since the 1950s, when it was being converted from a coconut plantation to a residential community, George said.
A third home on the compound belonged to his close friend, Bebe Rebozo.
Nixon is believed to have hatched the Watergate break-in plan — and its subsequent coverup — in Key Biscayne. As the scandal worsened, he spent more and more time in Florida.
“He really just wanted to get out of Washington; he was catching a lot of heat,” George said.
During one of those visits, Nixon secretly toured Mar-a-Lago with Rebozo. A month later, he resigned.

If the gun crowd is avoiding Dick's Sporting Goods because of its newly enacted corporate policies restricting some sales, it isn't showing in the bottom line.
First-quarter earnings and sales were higher, defying the predictions of gun rights advocates who said the company would lose significant business from its decision to ban sales of assault-style weapons and enacting a policy requiring gun buyers to be at least 21 years old. The company also hired a Washington, D.C., lobbyist to push for a federal assault weapons ban.
Dick's rankled the National Rifle Association.
The NRA's Institute for Legislative Action has been especially critical of Dick's moves, especially the hiring of the lobbyists.
"It's entirely possible that the chain realizes it has irrevocably damaged its image among the pro-freedom community, especially with those who take part in outdoor activities," it wrote on its website earlier this month. It went on to say "Dick's new lobbying venture is likely meant to fully embrace anti-gun advocacy at all levels and through whatever means necessary."
Based on the results, Dick's shares surged Wednesday, up 27% to $38.75 in afternoon trading.
Even Chief Executive Ed Stack was unsure in February how the new policies would affect sales, but warned that some buyers could avoid the store for outdoor and other equipment in the wake of its widely publicized action following the school shootings in Parkland, Florida.
In comments on an earnings conference call, Stack said benefits outweighed the drawbacks. Indeed, hunting sales declined at the stores, but other shoppers who are supporters of the policy have become customers.
"There's definitely been some benefits from people who have joined us because of the policy," Stack said.
Net income in the first quarter was up 3 percent on a 5 percent increase in sales, the company reported on Wednesday.
"Our strong first-quarter earnings reflect improved execution against our merchandising strategy, which results in higher merchandise margins," Stack said in a prepared release. "Product newness, strength in our private brands and a more refined assortment led to a much healthier business, with fewer promotions and cleaner inventory throughout the quarter."
The better results come even as others predicted Dick's, which started as a single store on Binghamton's East Side in 1948, would continue to suffer under pressure from online retailing behemoth Amazon.
The company said online sales increased by 24 percent in the first quarter as it recently realigned its online strategy, bringing the operation in-house after dispatching that segment to a third party for several years. In the first quarter, online sales accounted for 11 percent of overall sales, mainly in footwear and apparel, up from 9 percent a year ago.
First-quarter net income was $60.1 million, 59 cents a share, on sales of $1.9 billion, compared with net income of $58.2 million, 52 cents a share, on sales of $1.8 billion for the same period one year ago.
Same-store sales — sales at stores open for more than a year and a key measure of retailing health — fell by 2.5% compared to the same period one year ago.
The results topped Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 42 cents per share.
The company opened eight new stores in the first quarter, compared to not a single new store opening in the fourth quarter and 25 new stores in the first quarter of 2017. The Pittsburgh-based company now was 724 stores operating under the Dick's brand and 129 stores operating under the Field & Stream and Golf Galaxy brands, with total retail space of 42.1 million square feet.

THREE NEW members have been elected to Welshpool Town Council.
Last night at Welshpool Town Hall, Carol Robinson won the Gungrog Ward from Ben Gwalchmai by a majority of 60 votes.
In the Llanerchyddol ward, two out of four councillors were elected, and they are Alison Davies and Labour's Nicola Morris.
Powys County Council election officials said that polling had been “steady” during Thursday morning but had tailed off during the afternoon.
This means the Town Council has 12 Independent Councillors, two Liberal Democrats, Labour and Plaid Cymru both have one each.
GUNGROG ward
Carol Robinson (Independent) – 160
Ben Gwalchmain (Welsh Labour) – 100
LlANERCHYDDOL ward
Alison Davies (Independent) – 206
Nicola Morris (Welsh Labbour) – 197
Thomas Howl (Independent) – 124
Shantal Kay (Welsh Liberal Democrats) – 71
The community of Watts, still struggling more than a half-century after the notorious riots of 1965, needs a Los Angeles City Council representative who will focus on its particular needs. So does Harbor Gateway, the long-neglected shoestring strip of land that doesn't actually touch the harbor; and Harbor City, which is neither a city nor on the harbor, yet is also neither integrally South L.A. nor truly South Bay; and Wilmington, which really is on the harbor but for too long has been denied its fair share of the wealth that flows through it from the Port of L.A. to the rest of the nation.
Each of those communities needs a council member who will promote its particular interests. But they will never get one — not as long as the city herds all of those areas into a single, mammoth City Council district. That's the unfortunate consequence of having only 15 council seats for the entire sprawling city of Los Angeles. For more than 100 years, the representative of those neighborhoods has been elected chiefly by the people of the once-separate city of San Pedro, which sets an agenda that revolves around the port, the benefits it brings and the problems it causes.
Those geographical and political facts of life form the essential challenge of the 15th Council District, in which incumbent Joe Buscaino (of San Pedro) is charged with serving those other communities while knowing he will be either reelected or tossed out by the voters in his hometown.
Buscaino's performance has been adequate — no more and no less.
Other structural frustrations shape the job as well. Incumbents who learn the ropes hold all the cards at reelection time. They have such fundraising clout that the highest caliber would-be challengers seldom bother to run until the seat becomes vacant. That situation leaves some voters with uninspiring council representatives who are challenged only by under-qualified and inexperienced people who are even less likely to perform well.
This is very nearly the landscape of the March 7 election, in which Buscaino is being challenged by political newcomers Caney Arnold, a former Defense Department employee, and Noel Gould, a music industry executive.
Buscaino's performance has been adequate — no more and no less. He presides over important projects, such as the makeovers of Jordan Downs and the Port of Los Angeles and the reinvention of the old Ports o' Call in San Pedro. He focuses on the everyday concerns of Angelenos: potholes, broken sidewalks, untrimmed trees. He is learning what it takes to get his district's fair share from City Hall. He has brought some needed attention to Watts and Wilmington, and not merely his hometown of San Pedro.
He is vulnerable chiefly because of a housing project known as Sea Breeze in Harbor Gateway. Buscaino collected at least $94,700 in campaign money from donors who Time reporters found to be directly or indirectly linked to Samuel Leung, the project's developer. Some of the named donors said they knew nothing of the contributions. Despite neighborhood opposition, Buscaino supported a zoning change to accommodate the project — and in so doing became Exhibit A in the case against City Hall's inept (and perhaps corrupt) land use and development process.
Meanwhile, there is a crying need for new housing in Harbor Gateway and elsewhere around the city, and like it or not (and we don't like it), the only way to get it built without a citywide land-use and planning overhaul is to do hyper-local changes to the city's pathetically outdated zoning map. It is entirely plausible that Buscaino is a supporter of building badly needed housing and a mere nincompoop when it comes to scrutinizing his campaign donors. In any event, Buscaino is disappointing yet still the best choice among the three candidates.
In Arnold and Gould, Buscaino faces two people — savvy, successful in their careers, involved in their neighborhoods — who are a cut above the usual challenger. That alone doesn't qualify them for a seat on the council, however. Arnold says he wants to help build a grassroots movement in the Bernie Sanders mold, and there's nothing wrong with that — but it doesn't help voters understand how he would serve them better in City Hall. Gould describes himself as a tough deal-maker who could get better outcomes for the district, but like Arnold, he lacks the record of public problem-solving that Buscaino had when he first ran six years ago.

Post Malone is all about the children.
The “Rockstar” demonstrated his connection with the kids on YouTube's program Good Mythical Morning. For the segment, the hosts set up a game in which Malone updated the kiddie classic “Old MacDonald Had A Farm” in the style of Atlanta rap trio Migos.

“Quavo, Offset, Takeoff, I hope I do you justice,” Malone said as he walked over to a set featuring a baby doll in a crib. His revised version of “Old MacDonald” was set to the beat of “Bad and Boujee” and the results need to be seen to be believed.

(Reuters) - Gold was firm on Tuesday, having recovered from over a two-week low hit in the previous session, as traders waited to gauge the path of U.S. monetary policy for the rest of the year from the two-day Federal Reserve meeting that kicks off later in the day.

Spot gold was flat at $1,316.44 per ounce at 0353 GMT. In the previous session, it touched $1,307.51 an ounce, its lowest since March 1.
U.S. gold futures for April delivery dropped 0.1 percent to $1,316.10 per ounce.
“While the market has all but factored-in a rate hike, the focus will remain on the commentary and whether Fed Chair Jerome Powell hints at further rate hikes in 2018,” ANZ analysts said in a note.
Powell is expected to hike interest rates and signal three more increases this year at the Fed policy meeting.
Though a rate hike today has been factored into the current price, uncertainty remains as to how further tariffs in the United States will impact global trade, said Cameron Alexander, an analyst with Thomson Reuters-owned metals consultancy GFMS.
“This will likely escalate with a tit-for-tat response from China, which won't help.”
Prices for the yellow metal have not dipped below the $1,300 an-ounce level since the beginning of the year and have been trading in a $23 range since March 8.
A hike of more than 25 basis points would push prices lower, while a significant reaction from China and European countries on (U.S.) tariffs would drive prices higher, said Alexander.
Higher interest rates tend to boost the U.S. dollar and push bond yields up, pressuring gold prices by increasing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, while political and financial uncertainty push up safe-haven demand for the yellow metal.
Holdings at the SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, holdings rose 1.26 percent, their best one-day rise since Jan. 18, to 850.84 tonnes on Monday from 840.22 tonnes on Friday. [GOL/ETF]

Among other precious metals, silver gained 0.1 percent to $16.32 per ounce after matching Friday's three-month low in the previous session.
Platinum was nearly unchanged at $952.70 per ounce after hitting its lowest since Jan. 3 on Monday. Palladium declined 0.28 percent to $987.25 per ounce.
Hartlepool will fall silent this weekend as people gather once more to remember one of the town's darkest days.
The Bombardment of the Hartlepools commemoration will take place on Saturday on the Headland – exactly 103 years since German bombs rained down on the town during the First World War.
The annual Bombardment Remembrance Ceremony at Hartlepool Headland. Picture: TOM BANKS
People are invited to gather at Redheugh Gardens where the Headand's war memorial is situated for 8am.
At the same time, a parade will muster at the Heugh Gun Battery Museum nearby which defended the town from the German onslaught on the morning of December 16 in 1914.
A total of 130 people, including 37 children, were killed when German warships off the coast fired more than a thousand shells just after 8am,
More than 500 others were injured.
The annual ceremony is organised by the gun battery with support from the wider community.
Diane Stephens, manager of the Heugh Battery Museum, said: “There are so many families who still live in Hartlepool who were affected by the bombardment who either suffered injuries or they lost people.
“I think it is really important for those families to still have a focus annually to remember that.
“We are hoping that more of the local people will come along to the ceremony this year with it falling on a Saturday.”
The ceremony will feature a two-minute silence at 8.10am signalled by a 25 pounder gun salute from the gun battery.
The names of each of the 37 children who lost their lives will also be read out.
Members of the public will be invited to plant small wooden crosses bearing the names of the children.
Afterwards, everyone is invited to the museum for refreshments.
The service's timetable is as follows:
08.00 Parade to muster at the Heugh Battery Museum;
08.05 Parade to Redheugh Memorial Gardens;
08.10 Gun Salute from the Heugh Battery Museum followed by two minutes silence;
08.12 Welcome address by Ralph Keeton, Director Heugh Battery Museum;

What if this really is the end of Ronda Rousey's career?
Amanda Nunes beat Rousey at UFC 207, and it wasn't close. Nunes defended her title in 48 seconds, winning by TKO and hardly breaking a sweat before referee Herb Dean stepped in to rescue the former champion.
Editor's Picks Ronda Rousey lost her own way Ronda Rousey doesn't apologize for her ambitions, Ramona Shelburne writes. But when Rousey fell apart after losing to Holly Holm, she was in a state that even she had a hard time handling.
Rousey exits UFC 207 as she entered: quickly and quietly As Ronda Rousey navigates an uncertain future, her handling of defeat was more telling than any of her victories, after she shut out the media before and after her UFC 207 loss to Amanda Nunes.
Rousey battered, stopped in first round by Nunes Ronda Rousey's return to the Octagon was over almost as soon as it began Friday, as champion Amanda Nunes rocked her with repeated blows and earned a TKO victory just 48 seconds in at UFC 207. 2 Related
Rousey told Ramona Shelburne in a statement Saturday, "I need to take some time to reflect and think about the future." Dana White went on SportsCenter after the fight and expressed uncertainty over whether Rousey would fight again.
So what does that mean if she doesn't?
It means we've seen the last of Rousey's chilling, zoned-into-the-middle-distance death stare, power walking to the Octagon to Joan Jett's "Bad Reputation." It means for the final time we've seen her predictable yet unstoppable Harai Goshi judo throw. It also means we've seen her last armbar, a finish more synonymous with Rousey than any other strike or submission with any other fighter.
If this was the end of the road, the last time Rousey's hand was raised and a belt was slipped around her waist wasn't in her finale. It wasn't even in the fight before that. If this is it, she lost her last two bouts. Her last win came almost 17 months ago, at UFC 190, when Rousey folded Bethe Correia with a ruthless right hook.
Examining legacy is an annoying reflex of columnists in the immediacy of departure. But for an athlete of Rousey's stature with an impact like hers, the consideration is apt.

So how will Rousey be remembered? Thankfully for her, history has proven kind to pioneers.
Take Royce Gracie, for example. He's as a living legend, on the short list of the greatest fighters from the pre-Zuffa era. It's all but forgotten his reign didn't even last two years. Gracie went 2-2-3 in seven fights after winning a tournament at UFC 4. After a draw to Ken Shamrock in their infamous UFC 5 "superfight" and a five-year hiatus, the rest of the world caught up to his one-dimensional attack. But Gracie is so revered that even that previous sentence felt blasphemous to type.
Time won't remember Rousey's bloodied mouth and confused gaze in Melbourne at UFC 193, nor should it return to Friday night, when "The Lioness" stormed through Rousey with relentless flurries and fluid combinations. Nunes' 27-7 advantage in significant strikes, a margin that felt wider than it was, will be a footnote.
Instead, Rousey will forever be seen as a trailblazer.
She is single-handedly responsible for women competing at the highest level of MMA. Rousey had both the skill and marketability to shoulder an entire division, and UFC president Dana White knew it. That's what prompted his now infamous 180-degree turn on promoting female weight classes. In January 2011, White told TMZ that women would "never" fight in the UFC. Barely two years later at UFC 157, Rousey headlined a pay-per-view.
White called it the smartest decision he ever made, but it wasn't benevolence that prompted his change of heart. Rousey was a certified star, one of the biggest in the sport's history.
She had instantaneous celebrity and carried women's MMA into the mainstream. Rousey demolished a carousel of title challengers in seconds, not rounds. It didn't matter if it was on home soil in Southern California or against a Brazilian in Rio de Janeiro, arenas erupted at every stage of her fight weekend.

Rousey shattered MMA's glass ceiling and is ultimately responsible for moments like Paige VanZant being invited to compete on "Dancing With The Stars" and Nunes headlining UFC 200 in the promotion's biggest Las Vegas gate to date. Rousey is why we know how to spell UFC strawweight champion Joanna Jedrzejczyk's last name.
The opportunities for Rousey outside the Octagon are still lucrative. She has a standing demand as the badass woman in movies and commercials. If Rousey ever wants the spotlight again, in or out of the cage, it's there -- with all of its perks and its thorns.
Rousey has given mixed martial arts -- and not just the women's side -- more than enough to walk away or change course without explanation. She has paid her dues and earned that right.
How will Rousey be remembered? Maybe it doesn't matter.
Her impact is undeniable. And like Joan Jett famously sang, she doesn't give a damn about her reputation.
Jessica Chastain has become an outspoken advocate for gender equality in Hollywood, from pushing for the hiring of more women directors and crew, to seeking better representations of female characters on the big screen. Here, in an interview with Variety, the Oscar-nominated actress (“Zero Dark Thirty,” “The Help”) spoke candidly about how she negotiates her contracts to make sure her wages are on par with her male counterparts.
Jessica Chastain: I'm not taking jobs anymore where I'm getting paid a quarter of what the male co-star is being paid. I'm not allowing that in my life.
I remember watching Amy Pascal — it was after the Sony hack, and she was giving a talk somewhere. She said part of the reason women don't get paid equal to men is they don't ask for more; actresses need to stop being so grateful. That really hit me. At first, I was really pissed off. And then I thought, “She's touching on something here.” Women need to step forward and demand they're fairly compensated for their work.
You have a scale to measure it by, because the big agencies know what the male actors are getting paid. So when they're negotiating, they should feel empowered. They can come forward and say, “This is 2017. We're not doing this anymore.”
Marco Grob for Variety
What I do now, when I'm taking on a film, I always ask about the fairness of the pay. I ask what they're offering me in comparison to the guy. I don't care about how much I get paid; I'm in an industry where we're overcompensated for the work we do. But I don't want to be on a set where I'm doing the same work as someone else and they're getting five times what I'm getting.
In the past, what I used to do — this is terrible — a movie would come to me with an offer. They wouldn't want me to do my deal until they cast the male actor. They would wait and see what they had left over, even if they'd come to me first. And so I stopped doing that. Now, if someone comes to me and has an offer but wants to wait, I'm like, “Goodbye.” If you want me in your film, do a favored-nation clause. Don't determine my worth based on what's left over.
There was something huge that I recently turned down. For me, it wasn't about the money; it was an old-fashioned problem of the wage gap. I turned it down, and they didn't come back. I remember afterwards I was like, “What did I do? Maybe it was a mistake.” But it wasn't, because everyone in the studio system heard what I did. So what you're doing is creating a reputation: Don't bring Jessica something where she's not being fairly compensated compared to the male actor. Even though I lost that film, I've created a boundary. I drew a line in the sand.
The power of “no” means you're educating people in how to treat you.

PALMDALE, Calif. (AP)  Los Angeles County authorities say a man and a girl killed in a violent single-car crash in Palmdale were father and daughter.
The coroner's office says 54-year-old Manuel Paniagua and his 17-year-old daughter Vanessa died Sunday when they crashed at a high speed into a traffic signal pole.
Sheriff's Sgt. Oscar Martinez says investigators are trying to determine whether the car was involved in a street race at the time.
Martinez says another vehicle sped away.

He says the car hit the pole with such force that it "disintegrated." The two victims died at the scene.
World Cup 2018 standings remain the same after group stage and after the 1/8 finals

I have made an interesting ranking of the teams after the group stage of the Football World Cup in Russia 2018. The teams that continued with full points were 3 - Belgium, Uruguay and Croatia. La Celeste was the team that has not allowed any goals in the first round.
Top 8 teams after the group stage of the World Cup won their matches and got to the quarter-finals.
The draw for the second round amazingly didn't put any of the top 8 teams against each other. And more interesting - all of them made it to the next round!
Brazil was the only team that won their game in the pre-quarterfinals with more than 1 goal difference. France, Belgium, Uruguay and Sweden won 4-3, 3-2, 2-1 and 1-0 respectively. Penalties helped England, Russia and Croatia to get into the next round.
Standings after the second round of the World Cup in Russia 2018
Belgium continued to impress and to score 3 goals per match. Japan took all sympathies by the way they played. Their fans were on the news, as after the game they cleaned up their part of the stadium, leaving not single garbage on the stand.
From now on, on the top part of the scheme we have Belgium, Uruguay, Brazil and France conquering for a place in the final. Only one of these teams can reach to the final match of the World Cup this year. In 4 matches until now, no one of them have lost, so we can expect a really hard battle in the next two rounds.
The other finalist will be picked from England, Sweden, Russia and Croatia. The three lions are favourites this time, but we saw a really strong performance from Croatia. Sweden surprised many people, reaching the first place in a group with Mexico and Germany. And, of course, you can never underestimate the hosts of the tournament. Russia already won against one world champion in a match, that Spain made 1091 passes between their players.
The best is about to come. I will stand with my opinion that Belgium are favourites. But in the next matches, I am sure that we will see amazing performances. It's just that there's no more time to waste and everyone must play at 100%.
Live TV streaming service Sling TV is today rolling out an improved DVR feature, while also making the option to record TV shows available on more devices and channels. The DVR is one of the key selling points for Sling TV, given the increased competition in the live TV space from newcomers like YouTube TV, Hulu (which recently added live TV), and AT&T's DirecTV Now.
According to Sling, it responded to customer feedback requests by launching a handful of the most asked for DVR features, including the ability to protect recordings from deletion. While that has long since been a feature found on traditional hardware-based DVRs, cloud DVRs provided by streaming services have not offered the same option.
For example, Sony's PlayStation Vue service only saves shows for up to 28 days after they air, so there's no way to permanently keep a favorite movie or show around.
YouTube TV offers unlimited DVR storage, and saves shows for a healthy 9 months, but you may end up watching commercials for shows you DVR'd. (Once a DVR'd show becomes available on-demand, YouTube TV plays that copy instead – meaning you have to watch the ads.) DirecTV Now is still without a DVR option. Meanwhile, Hulu's DVR will save recordings indefinitely, but it will overwrite them if you need more space for new recordings.
Sling TV's $5-per-month 50 GB DVR doesn't have the same available storage space of others, we should note. By comparison, Hulu offers a 200 GB enhanced option (50 GB comes with the base package), while YouTube TV and Vue offer unlimited DVR storage. However, the ability to protect recordings from deletion give users more control over how their Sling DVR storage is to be used, and Sling's recordings never expire.
In addition, Sling is making it easier to record and find your DVR'd shows, it says. It will now let you record a show or series from its franchise screen, and it will group episodes from one series into a folder for better binge sessions. (This latter option is only on Roku at launch, but is rolling out to other platforms.)
Alongside the upgraded feature set, Sling's DVR is also now available on an expanded array of devices, including now Xbox One. In addition, the DVR works on Amazon Fire TVs and Fire tablets, Android mobile devices, Android TVs, Apple TVs, Roku streaming players and Roku TVs. Support for Windows 10, AirTV Player and iOS devices is expected in a matter of weeks.
The DVR feature now works on more channels, too, thanks to an agreement with Fox. That means you'll be able to record from Fox's local networks (where available), Fox Sports 1 (FS1), Nat Geo, and FX. But, similar to YouTube TV, if the show is available from Fox on-demand, you'll be switched over to watch that content instead.
The new DVR features are available on all devices supporting Cloud DVR, except for “DVR folders” – which, as noted, is first available on Roku.
WATCH LIVE | Pregnant Elk on Lookout Mountain Wednesday Morning
She doesn't have a name. She wasn't even known by anyone until Tuesday night beginning around 6 p.m. But now? This little pregnant elk all the way up on Lookout Mountain outside of Golden is an internet star.
No, really. We've got the numbers - more people on Facebook were watching her live than any other live video in the world! And it wasn't even close.
At its peak, the 9NEWS livestream of this little almost-mama elk laying down had 13,600 people at once on it. In all, 591,000 people at least stopped by to watch her for a few moments.
Nearly a million people were reached by the video (saw it pop up in their feeds).
Wow! What a night for a little cow elk from the Front Range!
Many, many viewers were worried for her, though. They said she looked uncomfortable and like it was taking too long to give birth.
Lauren Truitt with Colorado Parks and Wildlife got back to us to say it was, for sure, a cow elk giving birth.
Apart from that, it did look like the elk was struggling to give birth. Truitt reiterated to 9NEWS their policy of not interfering with wild animals.
If things end up going south for this little nearly-a-mama, Truitt wanted us to let everyone know that's just how nature works.
At last check, this little elk that could still haven't given birth - but we're going to check in on her again at first light. We aren't giving up!
We doubt she will either.

It's important to remember that despite moments like this making animals appear docile and almost tame, that this elk mama is a wild animal. At no point should anyone ever go up to an elk, nor should they try and get an elk to come up to them.
WATCH LIVE | Pregnant Elk on Lookout Mountain Wednesday Morning
The beauty in the livestream was just that: you could see - but not interact - the incredible world outside our homes and offices. But let's not imagine the elk would have liked it very much if almost a million people crowded around her atop the mountain to watch her give birth.

Facebook's auto-playing videos are about to get much more annoying.
If you're not a fan of Facebook's auto-playing videos, get ready to be annoyed. Starting today, videos will auto-play with the sound enabled by default. If you don't have your phone set on silent, every time you scroll past an auto-playing video, you'll now hear the audio associated with it.
Facebook says that it introduced the change after receiving "positive feedback" from a beta test conducted last year:
Videos in News Feed have previously played silently — you tap on a video to hear sound. As people watch more video on phones, they've come to expect sound when the volume on their device is turned on. After testing sound on in News Feed and hearing positive feedback, we're slowly bringing it to more people. With this update, sound fades in and out as you scroll through videos in News Feed, bringing those videos to life.
Although videos will now play with the sound enabled, you'll be able to turn it off via settings:
If your phone is set to silent, videos will not play with sound. If you never want videos to play with sound, you can disable this feature by switching off "Videos in News Feed Start With Sound" in Settings. We'll also be showing in-product messages to tell people about the new sound on experience and controls.
You can now minimize a video and scroll through your News Feed, with the video continuing to play in the corner of your screen. Facebook is also making changes to the way vertical videos look on Android and iOS, including larger previews. Finally, Facebook's video app will make its debut on Amazon Fire TV, Samsung's smart TVs, and Apple TV.
British police are now investigating six claims of alleged sexual assault or assault by Academy Award-winning actor Kevin Spacey.

British police are investigating six claims of sexual assault or assault by Academy Award-winning actor Kevin Spacey, three more than previously disclosed.
British media reported earlier this year that London's Metropolitan Police force was investigating allegations against the former “House of Cards” star.
Police in Britain don't name suspects until they are charged. Asked about Spacey, the force did not identify him by name but said Wednesday that detectives were investigating allegations of sexual assault alleged to have taken place in London's Westminster borough in 1996 and the western England city of Gloucester in 2013.
The force says three other complaints of sexual assault and one of assault by the same suspect have been made.
Spacey was artistic director of London's Old Vic theatre for 11 years until 2015.

Tesla Semi Enlarge Photo
Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch wants its beer delivery process to be just a smidge more green. The company announced on Friday that it placed a pre-order for 40 Tesla Semis and proclaimed it's one of the largest orders to date. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has hinted that the trucks will start from as low as $150,000.
Anheuser-Busch's order is part of the company's wide-reaching efforts to reduce its operational carbon footprint by 30 percent by 2025. The company noted its carbon-footprint goal equals about 500,000 fewer cars on the road to emit pollutants. Indeed, the Tesla Semi fits the bill with a promised 500-mile range and with a gross weight of 80,000 pounds. During its reveal, CEO Elon Musk also said operators can charge the battery to 400 miles of range in as little as 30 minutes.
All of those attributes make the Tesla Semi quite attractive to distribution companies like Anheuser-Busch, especially for long-distance travel. Rival truckmakers have revealed similar semi trucks, though 200 miles of range has been the norm.
The brewer is no stranger to technology and future-forward approaches to transportation. Last year, an Otto self-driving semi truck delivered 51,744 cans of Budweiser beer on a 132-mile stretch of Colorado highway. Uber purchased Otto ahead of the self-driving truck's maiden voyage. Anheuser-Busch said it continues to work with Uber to test self-driving technologies and also named Nikola as another technological partner. The company and Nikola hope to bring hydrogen-powered trucks into the delivery fleet in the near future as well.
Tesla previously named 2019 for its Semi's production date, but the company rarely meets its self-imposed deadlines. The good news for Tesla, though, is it has read the market very well; there are certainly customers yearning for an all-electric semi truck.

Mumbai: Bollywood ace director Karan Johar who will soon be coming up with his directorial venture ‘Student of the Year 2' said that he believe there are happy accidents in life.
He said he does not believe in venturing into space thinking that his work would end up setting a benchmark.
“I really believe there are happy accidents in life… Things just turn out the way they do, you kind of looking back wonder that may be pioneers maybe we set a trend,” he said
Karan told on the sidelines of the ongoing fashion show, “Maybe we impacted the work in some way. But it's not something you start off with thinking because if you do that I don't think you live up to it.”
The director, who is considered a fashion icon, says his walk on the ramp seemed like a '10-minute party' to him.
While talking to the media, he went on to say: “It's very flattering to be a showstopper, I hope people like it as I would hate to be an insipid inspiration for anyone. The clothes were flamboyant and extravagant.”
“I think men should never shy away from shining (bling). I think it's their way of expressing their soul. They should not feel that wearing plain clothes is the only way forward,” the director adds.
Karan also lauded ‘Padmaavat' star Ranveer Singh for his sense of style and christened him the ‘brand ambassador of edgy fashion'.
“When there's Ranveer Singh in the industry, whatever you do people will accept it. He has really raised the bar in men's fashion quite high. I applaud and adore him for it. He has become the brand ambassador of edgy fashion.”
One person is dead following a collision between a transport truck and a vehicle on Highway 401 in Toronto.
The crash happened on the westbound lanes at Martin Grove just before the morning rush hour.
All westbound lanes have been closed for the investigation.
Giant Food Stores and Martin's Food Markets are making it easy for customers to reduce their carbon footprint by launching a reduced emissions program at all 98 of its fuel stations in partnership with GreenPrint.
Giant/Martin's fuel customers don't have to change their habits or sign up for anything. When customers fill-up, GreenPrint will neutralize up to 30 percent of their emissions by investing in certified carbon offset projects such as creating local greenscapes or tree plantings.
“We believe it is our responsibility to make a positive difference in the environment because it is the right thing to do, and we think the GreenPrint model is innovative, and frankly, pretty cool,” said Manuel Haro, Giant/Martin's VP, strategy. “We see this as a game-changing program where we can directly address climate change as it is harmful to the local food system. Our ultimate goal is to be part of the solution that allows us to feed and bring families together for many years to come.”
Beginning May 15, for every gallon of gasoline a customer pumps at Giant/Martin's, GreenPrint will mobilize a network of local volunteers who will proportionally conduct tree planting and other carbon reduction projects to offset the emissions that are released. To ensure integrity of the program, GreenPrint will provide real-time audited reporting showing details on carbon emissions, offsets purchased and retired, and project investments.
“Let's face it. Climate change is adversely impacting communities and agriculture here in the U.S. and worldwide,” said Pete Davis, founder and CEO of GreenPrint. “This is an exciting example of a recognized leader in the grocery industry investing in a program that will create a lasting impact in the environment for years to come, and we commend Giant/Martin's on their bold commitment to do so.”
In addition, Giant/Martin's and GreenPrint will partner with the Arbor Day Foundation to plant 100,000 trees this year in the Mid-Atlantic area to kick off the program. Giant and GreenPrint officials will gather on May 15 at 1:00 p.m. at the Giant Enola store and fuel site location at 4510 Marketplace Way to celebrate the launch.

Michael Cohen, the longtime lawyer of President Donald Trump, arrives at the U.S. Courthouse in New York to attend a hearing to limit prosecutors' review of documents seized from his home and office.
Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY NETWORK
A federal judge set a deadline of June 15 for attorneys representing President Trump and his personal lawyer Michael Cohen to assert claims that materials seized from Cohen's offices and residences should not be turned over to prosecutors.
Of the more than 1 million seized pieces of information reviewed by a court-appointed official, only 252 were classified as privileged communication between attorney and client, meaning they would not be turned over to prosecutors investigating Cohen's business activities.
The federal investigation includes Cohen's payment of $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels to remain silent about her alleged affair with Trump.
The president, who acknowledged reimbursing Cohen for the hush-money settlement struck on the eve of the 2016 presidential election, denied having an affair with Daniels.
In a report to U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood, court-appointed special master Barbara Jones said she was readying the transfer of 1,025,363 pieces of information seized from three Cohen phones to the government.
Wood said at the hearing Wednesday that she had to balance the needs of lawyers for Cohen and Trump with the needs of criminal prosecutors.
Cohen did not speak during the hour-long hearing in Manhattan. His lawyers said they are about a third of the way through materials turned over from the government. Federal agents raided Cohen's home and office April 9 as part of a criminal fraud investigation.

Wednesday's hearing was another chapter in the clash over attorney-client privilege waged by Cohen, Trump and the president's real estate company, the Trump Organization.
Their attorneys, citing privileged communication with their clients, asserted that prosecutors should not be able to view materials seized in raids on Cohen's home, hotel room and offices.

When campaigning for the Gujarat Assembly election had just begun, the BJP's central theme for discussion in the run-up to the polls was very clearly vikas (development). There are enough examples to substantiate this fact.
On 7 October, Modi laid the foundation stone of a four-lane cable-stayed bridge between Okha and Beyt Dwarka and said it was a link between the old and new Dwarka. On the same day, the prime minister also presided over the ceremony for a greenfield airport in Chotila to be developed by the Airports Authority of India by 2021. The airport at Hirasar, which measured 2,534 acres, will be developed at a cost of Rs 1,405 crores.
Modi also inaugurated IIT-Gandhinagar's new campus and talked about how the country cannot afford to have a 'digital divide' and called for bridging this gap to ensure social equality.
On 22 October, Modi inaugurated the first phase of the Rs 615-crore 'roll on roll off' (Ro-ro) ferry service between Ghogha in Saurashtra and Dahej in south Gujarat.
Because the Congress has been in the Opposition in Gujarat since 1995, its theme for the polls was centred around opposing Narendra Modi, BJP and the Gujarat government. The party hoped to leverage the Patidar agitation for quota, farmer distress, and the impact of demonetisation and Goods and Services Tax (GST) in the state.
The kind of mudslinging seen in the later half of campaigning for the Gujarat polls, however, shows how the poll rhetoric in the state has changed over time, especially for BJP, which has moved from "development" to a more communal theme, and is following this up with relentless, scathing attacks on the Congress.
As this IANS article points out, the BJP shouldn't normally have any worries about election results in Gujarat. It is Narendra Modi's home state and the party has been in power there for more than two decades.
But the BJP has surely noticed that its 'vikas' narrative in Gujarat has become weak because the people themselves are not too happy about the development in the state. In fact, the party's Saurashtra region spokesperson Raju Dhruv himself admitted to PTI that many projects which the saffron party had promised are still incomplete.
This is probably why the BJP has resorted to the anti-Congress plank. Like the time its national spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao tweeted that Rahul Gandhi has "teamed up with (Asaduddin) Owaisis, (Zafaryab) Jilanis" to oppose the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya, before calling the Congress vice-president a "Babar bhakt".
In fact, Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself has called Congress' process of electing its party president 'Aurangzeb Raj' during an election rally in Valsad.
Not unexpectedly, BJP is flashing its old trump card, communalism, to boost its morale and rally its supporters. Hence, the posters about the battle being between RAM — (Vijay) Rupani, Amit Shah and Modi — and HAJ — Hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakor and Jignesh Mewani.
However, Congress is not far behind.
The party's online magazine Yuva Desh had tweeted out a meme mocking Modi's past as a tea-seller. Perhaps the most harmful remark by the Congress came when Mani Shankar Aiyar called the prime minister a "neech aadmi" (despicable person), but apologised later when Rahul Gandhi tweeted that the Congress party does not endorse such language and expected Aiyar to apologise. The damage was already done, however, with Modi making this a caste issue by claiming that Aiyar was referring to his caste as 'neech'.
And if there was a RAM-HAJ poster by the BJP, there was another one supporting Congress appealing Muslims to vote for Congress to make Ahmed Patel the "wazir-e-aalam" of Gujarat.

Camera technology has advanced tremendously over the last decade or two, as more and more filmmakers have stretched the limits of digital cinematography. And now, with the advent of 4K televisions and Blu-rays, we can experience that pristine image quality like never before.
But while most new releases are now coming to 4K Blu-ray, not all films are worth the increased price. One that is, however, is Red Sparrow, a dramatic spy thriller directed by Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) and starring Jennifer Lawrence, that was released to little fanfare earlier this year. The film is now available on 4K Blu-ray, and I've given the disc an extensive look to see if it gives enough bang for buck to make the purchase worth it.
Saif Ali Khan on Go Goa Gone 2: I'll return as Boris in sequel but on a different mission this time
The 2013 Raj and DK-directed film Go Goa Gone was first of its kind in India. Starring Saif Ali Khan, Kunal Kemmu and Vir Das, the film was touted as India's first zom-com or zombie comedy. In 2017, there were reports that the makers are also planning to make a sequel to the film which struck a chord with the audience for its eccentric subject.
According to a report by DNA, Khan has now confirmed the sequel and said he will be reprising his role from the 2013 film. "We are doing Go Go Gone 2. It's an exciting idea and I've really liked it. I will return as Boris in the sequel. But this time, I'll be on a different mission. The other characters played by Kunal Kemmu and Vir Das will also be a part of it."
Talking about the premise of the film, Khan adds, "Raj and DK have found an interesting premise for the second installment, which is in sync with the first part. They are currently writing the script. We start filming next January."
The DNA report also states that there will be another supporting actor as well as a heroine — who will be Boris' aid — in the Goa Goa Gone sequel. While the final casting is yet to be declared, the makers are eyeing an A-list actress to essay the heroine's part.

Like all of you, I couldn't be more excited to see Avengers: Infinity War. As a huge fan of what the Russo Brothers did on Captain America: Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War, my expectations for Infinity War are probably a bit too lofty, but if anyone can pull this colossal movie off it's directors Joe and Anthony Russo, screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and Kevin Feige with his amazing producing team at Marvel Studios.
With the movie set to world premiere tonight in Hollywood, Marvel and Disney held a massive press junket over the weekend with the stars and filmmakers here in Los Angeles. Since no one has seen the movie yet, doing the interviews was a bit unusual, so when I sat down with Joe and Anthony Russo yesterday, I used my time to ask questions I knew they could answer.
During the interview, I the Russo Brothers talked about how they gave the cast fake scripts to try and prevent spoilers from getting out, if the script changed a lot during the development process, what it was like shooting the film using only IMAX cameras, which MCU actor ruined the most takes from laughing, deleted scenes, which MCU actor always wants another take, future projects, if they'd consider making another Marvel movie, juggling the various tones and character interpretations from the previous movies, and so much more.
Check out what they had to say in the player above and below is exactly what we talked about. Avengers: Infinity War stars Josh Brolin, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Chadwick Boseman, Jeremy Renner, Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Don Cheadle, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Tom Holland, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Rudd, and Tom Hiddleston.
Finally, if you missed what the Russo brothers told me yesterday about how Avengers 4 will be longer than Infinity War and how many post-credits scenes Avengers: Infinity War has clicked here to check it out.
Russo Brothers:
How have they been doing all these interviews without saying anything?
Joe talks about how they gave the cast fake scripts.
How did the script change during the development process?
How much did they want to punch the wall when they heard about Fox and Marvel possibly merging with all the characters that could have been in the movie?
Was Infinity War the hardest film they've made at Marvel?
What was it like shooting the entire film in IMAX?
How many VFX shots do they have in the film?
How many IMAX cameras did they have on set when shooting the films?
Which MCU actor ruined the most takes from laughing?
Which movie that they made at Marvel changed the most from script to screen?
How many minutes of Infinity War deleted scenes do they have for the Blu-ray?
Would they do an extended cut?
Which actor in the MCU always wants another take?

LIEGE, Belgium/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Islamic State claimed responsibility on Wednesday for an attack the previous day in the Belgian city of Liege in which two policewomen and a bystander were killed, but provided no proof.
The militant group said in an online statement that a "soldier of the caliphate" had carried out what Belgian police called a terrorist attack. It has previously claimed similar "lone wolf" acts thought to be Islamist-inspired, often without providing evidence.
Belgian authorities meanwhile faced questions over why the attacker, a prison inmate who was suspected of links to radical Islamists in jail, was let out for a day. He was shot dead by police at a school near the scene.
Interior Minister Jan Jambon said authorities were still examining the motives of Benjamin Herman, a 31-year-old Belgian drug dealer who had been in jail for years but was let out for two days on Monday to prepare for an eventual release in 2020.
Herman had shouted "Allahu Akbar", the Muslim affirmation of faith, during his attack and he had had contact with Islamist radicals in jail in 2016 and early 2017.
He also appeared to have followed online exhortations from Islamic State to stab police officers and use their service weapons to shoot others, prosecutors said.
A cleaning woman at the school who found herself "nose to face with the killer" told public broadcaster RTBF that he spared her because she was Muslim.
While he briefly held her hostage, he told her he wanted the police to "writhe; I want to make them stew".
Justice Minister Koen Geens told RTBF radio he was having pangs of conscience over whether the man should have been allowed the furlough.
Still reeling from the attack, residents of Belgium's third biggest city lay flowers and candles at the scene of the shooting on Wednesday, and officials held a moment of silence.
"We had all of the little ones from the high school who were evacuated," said an emotional nursery school teacher, Joelle Chalon. "I walk this way to work every day."
Authorities praised the quick-wittedness of the cafe owner outside whose bar Herman had killed the two policewomen, aged 54 and 44. By the time the killer, wielding two police pistols, came in looking for more victims, the cafe proprietor had got all of his customers into hiding.
Jambon described Herman as a psychologically unstable man who might have been on drugs, pointing to his murder of an acquaintance 50 km (30 miles) away on Monday night.
"There are signs he was radicalised in prison but is it that radicalisation which drove him to commit these acts?" Jambon said, adding that although Herman was flagged up in security reports in 2016 and early 2017, he had been a fringe figure.
JAIL TO JIHAD?
In and out of jail for a variety of crimes since 2003, Herman may have found a path to violence that has heightened concerns that Europe's prisons are incubators for jihadism.
It was the 14th time since his detention that he was granted temporary leave, Geens said. "Everyone in Belgium is asking the same question: how is it possible that someone convicted of such serious acts was allowed to leave prisons?" Deputy Prime Minister Alexander de Croo was quoted as saying.
The national crisis centre, on high alert since a Brussels-based Islamic State cell helped kill 130 people in Paris in 2015, did not raise its alert level, indicating no follow-up attacks were expected.
"I think it was just one individual who completely snapped," said Pieter Van Ostaeyen, a specialist on jihadism. "I don't think it was an organised attack."
Convicts have been behind several Islamist militant attacks in Europe. In Belgium, around 450 prisoners are deemed radical, including 46 that are seen as a threat of radicalising others, according to lawmaker George Dallemagne, who sits on several Belgian parliamentary security committees.
"We have a tragic experience in Belgium, with people entering prison as petty criminals and leaving as terrorists," he told Reuters.

BAHAWALNAGAR-The district police arrested 18,904 outlaws and recovered illegal arms and a huge quantity of liquor and drugs from them during operations conducted over the past 15 months.
According to a police spokesman, dozens of outlaws belonging to 26 different gangs were busted and booty worth Rs20 million was recovered from them. He said that 369 outlaws were arrested from brothels, adding that 13 hardened dacoits of different inter-district gangs were eliminated during shootouts. They were wanted by the police in several cases of heinous crimes. The police also arrested 3,512 proclaimed offenders (POs) and 1,055 court absconders and put them behind bars. Similarly, 2,084 drug-peddlers and 1,892 pilferers of canal water were also arrested in different raids.
Police also recovered illegal arms and drugs including 18 Kalashnikovs, 415kg of hashish, 55,223 bottles of liquor, 35 distilleries, 4kg of heroin and 6kg of opium from them.
The police spokesman said that the crime ratio has been diminished to a remarkable extent due to effective steps of police against the outlaws under the command of DPO Liaqat Ali Malik.
He said that the DPO has equipped the district police with modern equipment. Mr Liaqat has also set up a modern command and control centre at the DPO office to enhance the police capacity to arrest outlaws, he added.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  Authorities have identified a woman who died after falling from a cliff in San Francisco.
The San Francisco medical examiner identified her Friday as 36-year-old Arezoo Yusufi, of Tracy.

Roseanne Barr's self-defense continued through Wednesday afternoon, with the disgraced comic insisting that she's not racist and has been smeared.
One day after ABC abruptly canceled the revival of her hit show “Roseanne” over racist comments she made about former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett, it seems Barr is gearing up for a fight as she eyes her next move.
“I'm not a racist, I never was & I never will be,” she tweeted Wednesday. “One stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights 4 all minorities, against networks, studios, at the expense of my nervous system/family/wealth will NEVER b taken from me.”
Running back Justin Davis played the last four seasons in the Coliseum, but the first preseason game against the Dallas Cowboys felt different, at times surreal, for the Rams rookie and former USC standout.
On Sunday, a day after the Rams defeated the Cowboys 13-10, Rams coach Sean McVay said Davis stood out.
“This is a guy who's shown up in practice,” McVay said. “But I thought Justin Davis showed his explosion.”
Davis rushed for a team-high 70 yards in nine carries, including a 32-yard run. But he also fumbled — twice — in two of his first three carries.
After the game, Davis said he learned quickly that it was “definitely not college” and that players were “a whole lot bigger” and smarter.
“I made a couple mistakes here and there,” Davis said. “But all that matters is how I bounce back and how I can eliminate those mistakes in the future.”
Despite the fumbles, McVay liked what he saw.
“What impressed me the most about Justin was his ability to respond,” McVay said. “A lot of guys, you can let that affect you, but I didn't sense that those two plays affected him, he came out and created some explosive runs after that, did a good job competing in protection.”
Davis joined the Rams as an undrafted free agent. It was a puzzling choice given the depth at running back with starter Todd Gurley and the acquisition of Lance Dunbar, who played five seasons with the Cowboys, and backups Malcolm Brown and Aaron Green.
But Dunbar was sidelined for most offseason workouts and has not participated in training camp drills because of a knee injury.
And Davis found himself inserted into Saturday's game behind Gurley and Brown.
A roster spot, once deemed a long shot, now seems within reach.
“The job is still up for grabs,” Davis said, adding, “I never turn down a challenge and I love to compete.”

More shakeups in the world of the Justice League. After Joss Whedon was announced to be taking over after director Zack Snyder stepped down for personal reasons following a family tragedy, it seems that some of Snyder's collaborators on the film are seeing a changeup as well. Junkie XL (a.k.a. Antonius Holkenborg), who had been working on the Justice League soundtrack (and also collaborated with Snyder on Batman v Superman), is now moving on to Tomb Raider (also a Warners production) according to THR. He will be replaced by Danny Elfman, who collaborated with Whedon on The Avengers: Age of Ultron, where he similarly came in late to the project to add to the music already composed by Tyler Bates.
Elfman's most well-known scores are typically lush, atmospheric, and uplifting, which may portend a sea-change for how Justice League was initially conceived (at least, following in the pattern of the early days of the DCEU versus the good will that Wonder Woman recently brought to it). Warner Bros has seemed for awhile to want a lighter tone for the movie, and there have been innumerable rumors and reports of reshoots and additions. Switching from Snyder to Whedon suggests a massive change in tone as well, and adding in Elfman (especially because of his recent work on Age of Ultron) feels like Justice League is literally taking pages from Marvel's book.
However, Elfman has a long history with DC, too — he composed scores for Batman and Batman Returns, and more recently composed the theme music for the animated series Justice League Action. The bottom line is, really, that he has a ton of credits to his name, is a legend of the field, and will surely bring something both familiar and unique to Justice League‘s score.
Still, it does make one wonder what all of this will add up to, and what the movie might have looked like before these changeups. Are you worried by these adjustments, or think they're a step in the right direction for Warner Bros' DC fare? And does this seem to suggest a complete overhaul for the DECU?
We'll update you with more as we know it. In the meantime, check out some of our recent Justice League coverage:
Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri is no stranger kicking in blizzards. The 22-year veteran has made a name for himself nailing clutch field goals, sometimes in bad conditions, like the snowy 2001 divisional playoffs Raiders vs. Patriots game.
However, according to a writer for CBS Sports, his 43-yard miss in yesterday's Colts-Bills game could cost him dearly.
Kicking in a blizzard could cost Adam Vinatieri a $500,000 incentive. He needs to hit at least 90% of his field goals this season to get it. He was at 95.7% before the Buffalo game. He's now at 88%. â Joel Corry (@corryjoel) December 11, 2017
The irony is that, just minutes earlier, Vinatieri made a 43-yard extra point which got the game to overtime.
A typical extra point is 33 yards, but Vinatieri's attempt was pushed back due to an offensive pass interference penalty. So, even though it was in a snowstorm, and over 40 yards, it didn't count toward his field goal incentives.
Don't feel too bad for Vinatieri though, he's reportedly earned over $40 million in salary over his career and he's closing in on the becoming the NFL's all-time leading scorer. Plus, he still has three games to get his FG percentage back above 90% -- two at Lucas Oil Stadium, which has a roof, and one at M&T Bank Stadium, which doesn't.
Not like it matters, rain, sleet, or snow, Vinatieri is -- and has been -- one of the most reliable kickers in the NFL.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hopes that Italy might avoid a potentially damaging general election lifted European markets on Wednesday, bringing Italian bond yields off multi-year highs and dampening some of the recent buying interest for German and U.S. government bonds.
World stocks gained 0.38 percent, and European shares made tentative gains after falling almost 4 percent in the past five days. Wall Street opened higher.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 199.21 points, or 0.82 percent, to 24,560.66, the S&P 500 gained 25.37 points, or 0.94 percent, to 2,715.23 and the Nasdaq Composite added 60.50 points, or 0.82 percent, to 7,457.09.
The recovery was partly driven by news that Italy's two anti-establishment parties were renewing efforts to form a government, rather than force the country to the polls for the second time this year.
Another positive was a smooth auction of Italian debt that raised 5.57 billion euros, easing concerns about Rome's ability to finance itself.
"(The auction) clearly indicates that investors still have faith in the Italian economy, if not the government," said Seema Shah, global investment strategist at Principal Global Investors. But she warned that political uncertainty would remain elevated.
Japan's biggest private life insurance firm, Nippon Life, which holds some 4.8 trillion yen ($44 billion) worth of euro zone bonds, said it had no plans for now to buy or sell its Italian debt holdings.
Milan-listed equities snapped a five-day losing streak and bounced almost 2 percent while short-dated Italian bond yields - a sensitive gauge of political risk - fell more than half a percent from half-decade highs.
They had suffered their worst day in nearly 26 years on Tuesday. Ten-year Italian yields slipped 0.18 percentage points.
The risk for investors is that eurosceptic political parties are further boosted, with any election viewed as a de facto referendum on Italy's euro membership. The events have evoked memories of the 2011-2012 euro debt crisis, with potentially huge implications for the single currency.
The risks had sent investors scurrying for safer German and U.S. government bonds as well as currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc, at the expense of the euro.
That safe-haven trend receded on Wednesday, with the euro bouncing nearly one percent versus the dollar and recouping all its Tuesday losses, which had taken it down to 10-month lows . It also rose against the Swiss franc and yen respectively.
"The political problems in Italy heighten the risk of a systematic problem within the euro zone and within the euro zone financial system, but that is still a risk rather than a probability," said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
The improved mood encouraged investors to sell U.S. and German bonds, reversing some of the 0.15-0.20 percentage point yield rises seen on Tuesday. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 19/32 in price to yield 2.835 percent, from 2.768 percent late on Tuesday. The German bund benchmark last fell 19/32 in price to yield 0.337 percent.
Most investors remain cautious though, with Goldman Sachs cutting its forecast for the euro's exchange rate against the dollar due to Italian political developments. It said it now expected the euro to trade at $1.25 in 12 months' time versus its previous $1.30 prediction.
With brewing trade conflicts, world growth is another concern. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development warned in its latest report that a trade war was threatening the growth outlook.
That is likely to weigh especially hard on the developing world - emerging equities were down more than one percent to 5-1/2 month lows while Shanghai shares dropped 1.4 percent.
Emerging markets are also suffering from the dollar's surge since mid-April, with Indonesia raising interest rates for the second time in two weeks to support the rupiah currency.
"Italian politics mask the underlying growing risks of a U.S.-China trade war," ING Bank analysts told clients.

I'm worn out by the Charlottesville business, and depressed that some readers are calling for speech bans. We won't discuss that in this thread (there are other posts where you can do that). Instead, let's learn how an IMAX projector works. I've been to a few IMAX movies, the first being “Flying” or “Flight” (can't remember the name [a reader below says it's “To Fly”]) at the Smithsonian. They're stunning, and until I saw this video I had no idea that a.) they involve real film stock (70 mm) and b.) they're bloody COMPLICATED! I found this fascinating and offer it as an afternoon respite:

One group of Florida conservatives is urging prosecutors to not seek the death penalty in capital cases.
A State Supreme Court ruling that said previous death sentences are unconstitutional will send hundreds of death row cases back to the courts for resentencing.
When that happens, the group Florida Conservatives Concerned about the Death Penalty hopes prosecutors seek life without parole, not death.
Members of the group argue the death penalty process is too costly and there's the possibility for errors. “You only get one shot with the death penalty. Once it's been executed, there's no going back,” said Brian Empric, Former Vice Chair of the Florida Federation of Young Republicans.
“The death penalty process is far too costly, cumbersome, and error-prone to continue,” said James Purdy, 7th Judicial Circuit Public Defender. “Given that Florida has wrongly convicted and eventually released more people from their death row than any other state, the stakes are far too high.”
Orange-Osceola County State Attorney Aramis Ayala clashed with Governor Rick Scott over the death penalty earlier this year. Ayala announced her office would not seek that sentence in any case, prompting Scott to reassign death penalty eligible cases to other state attorneys
Ayala then sued the Governor and the two will argue the case before the Supreme Court later this month.
Florida joins ten other states that have similar conservative groups advocating against the death penalty.
“A growing number of conservative Floridians have concluded that the death penalty violates our core conservative tenets of valuing life, fiscal responsibility, and limited government,” said Marc Hyden, the National Coordinator of Conservatives Concerned About the Death Penalty.
VANDALS smashed a number of windows at an independent cinema in a Yorkshire village overnight.
A total of eight windows in the front doors at the Rex Cinema on Coronation Street, Elland, near Halifax, were broken in the incident.
The damage was discovered this morning (Mon Jan 2) and happened sometime after the cinema closed at 11pm last night.
Cinema owner Charles Morris said: "We could have done with a better start to the year, but worse things happen at sea."
In October, a window was was smashed at the cinema and a charity box was stolen.
The Galaxy appear likely to start the Major League Soccer season without two of their most important players as forward Gyasi Zardes and right back Robbie Rogers continue to rehab stubborn injuries less than three weeks before the team's March 4 opener.
Zardes, 25, underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee after being injured while training with the U.S. national team last month. Zardes hasn't played in an MLS game since suffering a broken bone in his right foot in August and there is no timetable for his return.
Jack McBean, 22, started both of the team's two preseason exhibitions in Zardes' place.
Rogers' situation might be more serious. The Galaxy defender has struggled with ankle problems the past two years, undergoing off-season surgery for bone spurs in fall 2015 before missing five weeks last summer after arthroscopic ankle surgery.
Rogers, 29, also hasn't trained with the first team in several weeks and was replaced in the two preseason games by Rafael Garcia, a 28-year-old midfielder with just seven career MLS starts. After trading A.J. DeLaGarza to Houston last month, the Galaxy are particularly thin on the back line with the two backup defenders listed on the team's 23-man roster having combined for 10 MLS starts.
Asked Tuesday about the fitness of the two players, a Galaxy spokesman offered few details, saying that Rogers “has been receiving treatment … for an ankle injury” while Zardes “is progressing” and “should be back to training soon.”

Dogs and cats at risk, director says
Quinn Welsch
editor@thewestsidejournal.com
All animals in the West Baton Rouge Animal Shelter were reported to be in danger of euthanasia last week after all kennels were filled to capacity.
Most animals that end up in the shelter are former pets that are surrendered, according to West Baton Rouge Animal Control Director Richard Summers. The shelter usually sees an influx of the former pets during the summer months when children are out of school.
But the large increase in animals in the shelter during fall is uncommon. Summers does not know why there have been so many animals coming into the shelter lately.
“I can't put my finger on it. Normally you have a season,” he said. “This year it seems like the season has been all year long.”
The shelter managed to open a few of its 12 kennels earlier this week, but Summers expects the shelter will be right back at capacity by Friday, he said.
The shelter makes good use of social media, often posting photos of dogs and cats up for adoption on its Facebook page, but it's not enough, Summers said.
He has considered expanding the facility, but it would require hiring additional staff. Additionally, the shelter regularly lacks volunteers.
Summers stressed that pet owners spay and neuter their cats and dogs to prevent the number of stray and unwanted animals in the parish.
Apple said Monday that it would buy leading song recognition app Shazam in a fresh bid to secure an edge in the intensifying battle of streaming services.
Apple, whose streaming service has rapidly grown but still has only half the paid subscribers of Spotify, said that Shazam has consistently been one of the most popular items on its App Store.
The two companies did not disclose financial terms. The technology news sites Recode and TechCrunch, quoting unnamed sources, both put the deal at around $400 million.
The market signaled its approval, with Apple share prices jumping 2.0 percent, well outpacing the 0.2 percent rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

“Apple Music and Shazam are a natural fit, sharing a passion for music discovery and delivering great music experiences to our users,” Apple said in a statement.
London-based Shazam said in a separate statement: “We can't imagine a better home for Shazam to enable us to continue innovating and delivering magic for our users.”
Shazam, which was founded in 1999 in the early age of online music, has offered a solution to a longtime agony of listeners — putting a name to elusive songs. With a click, the app identifies tracks playing on the radio, at parties or as background music.
WATCH: Spotify, Warner close to license deal
But Shazam has struggled to find a way to make money off its technology, even as it said that it had reached one billion downloads on smartphones last year.
Shazam only recently announced it had become profitable, thanks to advertising and steering traffic to other sites such as Spotify and Apple Music.
The technology is also no longer quite as novel, with Shazam facing rivals such as SoundHound and with smartphones capable of ever more advanced recognition functions.
Mark Mulligan, who writes a popular blog on the music industry, described Shazam as “cool tech without a business model” and said Apple was a rare player that could bring out the app's value.
Facing tough competition
The world's most valuable publicly traded company, Apple earns most of its revenue from iPhones but has also found it vital to be seen on the cutting edge culturally.
Apple, which revolutionized online music a generation earlier with iTunes, in 2015 launched Apple Music as the market turns to streaming, which offers unlimited on-demand listening.
Apple said in September that the service had more than 30 million subscribers — a quick rise, but still trailing Spotify.

Spotify — which has emphasized a barebone, user-friendly interface instead of unique features — said it had 60 million paying users as of July and 80 million more on its free tier.
And with streaming experiencing rapid growth, competition has become even fiercer.

Retail giant Amazon seized on its vast consumer reach as it launched its own streaming service last year.
YouTube, the video-sharing behemoth owned by Apple's rival Google, also has its own music streaming platform and recent reports said it was looking to launch a new paid subscription package next year.
Tech battle turns to services
Shazam has already proven it can be woven into another service. A year ago, it formed a partnership with SnapChat, the youth-driven social media platform whose videos evaporate, with users able to “snap” to friends the music they discover around them on Shazam.
Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said the Shazam sale “underlines the fact that the battle of the technology companies is firmly moving beyond hardware and into services.”

“This is a good move for Apple that helps to consolidate its already strong position in music content. It won't be the last takeover of a tech firm by these big giants,” he said.
Apple has already invested in buying big-name music brands, in 2014 paying an eye-popping $3 billion for Beats Electronics, the headphones, speaker and streaming brand of rapper Dr. Dre.
Soon afterward, it bought Semetric, a British company that tracks music consumption on behalf of labels and artists.

What does it mean to be a genius? For the second time, National Geographic's anthology series introduces the idea of genius as one inextricably tied to that of being a womanizer — a position that, in the wake of “Time's Up” and “Me Too” doesn't sit particularly well. There are other, general sins Genius commits, like staying strictly to the rote beats of a traditional biopic, or the same unfortunate accents and stilted dialogue that also plagued its Albert Einstein-focused season. But what stands out the most in this new chapter, which chronicles the life of prolific Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, is a legacy of using and discarding women in the service of artistic passions. It's all summed up by an unfortunate scene where, as Picasso paints Guernica, he laughs joyously after provoking two of his much younger mistresses to physically fight in his studio. At this point, the series could well be called “Great Womanizers of the 20th Century.”
Some might argue that at least Genius: Picasso refrains from deifying the painter, played as a young man by Alex Rich and an older one by Antonio Banderas. But the series is obviously going to be sympathetic to its gifted subject. Picasso was an extraordinary painter, one who was also never satisfied unless he was creating and innovating and breaking the rules of art. The years of Picasso's young adulthood, in the early 1900s, are some of the most creatively interesting times in the modern era, where things were moving very fast as a new century dawned and progressive ideas were taking flight. Picasso, living in Paris at the time, was flanked by a number of other exceptional artistic minds, and his development and changes as an artist are genuinely interesting. But every time the series shifts from that timeline to the 1940s (much in the same way it did with Einstein), that momentum is lost.
Where it ends up is with an old man who is still catered to by a revolving door of young muses. Both Einstein and Picasso were men with voracious sexual appetites that existed alongside their intellectual or artistic pursuits, but they expressed those desires through emotional manipulation and a — perhaps unwitting — abuse of power (though Picasso seems pretty well aware of the power his celebrity affords him). “Artists must have no rules, no restrictions,” Picasso tells his latest conquest, Françoise Gilot (Clémence Poésy), a young French painter. But it's also an eye-rolling indulgence from a man who was blessed by money and the kindness of strangers wherever he turned. Picasso's genius opened doors (and legs) for him wherever he went for almost his entire life, but — as of the first four episodes given to critics — there's no examination of how this is an extraordinary and unusual privilege, one that he arrogantly came to expect.
Picasso's story, like Einstein's, is actually at its most interesting when it focuses on the women who bolstered, inspired, tended to, and challenged him. Samantha Colley's role as the French photographer Dora Maar is again a scene-stealer, just like Colley's role as Einstein's lover Mileva Marić was in the first season (Colley is one of several cast members who returned for this new installment). Maar is a fascinating figure, as is Gilot, both of whom had to fight against the expectations of the era — and their families — to become artists. And then, they are reduced to fighting against each other for Picasso's attentions, a man given every opportunity and encouragement since birth. The man is a genius, absolutely! But as a dramatic narrative, Pablo's story is less compelling than the women he sought to surround himself with.
As the two Picassos, both Rich and Banderas are suitably charming, and do their best with the uneven material. The miniseries moves at an odd pace, often rushing through important moments (like the death of Picasso's sister, an event that fueled much of his early work), and telling instead of showing character traits in a way that ends up flattening the story. Picasso claims to truly love his buttoned-up mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter (Poppy Delevingne), but she barely has a role here, and there's never a speck of warmth or affection between them to sell the truth of that statement. After awhile, the story makes the women interchangeable, falling into a predictable pattern: Picasso falls for someone's beauty, he seduces them, uses them as a muse, and discards them. Sometimes they go crazy, sometimes he fathers a child along the way, but the series flippantly wonders, who can be bogged down by such details? He's an artist! Picasso's life is a focus without ever being an examination.
In fairness there are some things to like about the series, like its lovely locations and costuming, and a suitably paint-filled title sequence. Occasionally Genius will even show how Picasso might have visually translated the world around him into his works, but it's really just a tease. The series misses so many opportunities by shying away from anything that might lead to more dynamic storytelling or truly illuminating the lives of its subjects. It's a show about an artist without rules, yet it limits itself by playing it safe.

WINNIPEG – A Manitoba man hit the jackpot after winning $1 million on a lottery ticket.
Kristopher Eisbrenner won the cool million from the Set For Life scratch ticket.
He told the Western Canadian Lottery Corporation he couldn't believe his eyes when he realized he won.
“I was in such disbelief, I just started laughing,” he said. “I told my wife, and she started laughing and crying at the same time.”
The Altona man won the game's top prize and had the choice between $1,000 a week over 25 years or a $1 million payment.
The winning ticket was bought at the Altona Co-op Gas Bar.
Eisbrenner is the 12th lottery prize winner of $1 million or more paid in 2016 in the province.
Dragon Ball FighterZ has been a wildly popular game, but it's also resurfaced some old discussions among the fighting game community—namely, numpad notation.
The method for transcribing long strings of combos has varied over the years, thanks to different games having different inputs. Street Fighter has punch and kick buttons, while other games like FighterZ have general light, medium, and heavy buttons. Some games, like Injustice, even just rely on numbers to convey which button should come next.
It all comes together to form a pseudo-language that fighting game players can use to convey combos. For an easy one, here's one way of writing how to throw a hadoken as Ryu in Street Fighter: qcf.P. This translates to, “quarter-circle forward, then any punch.” Bam! Fireball.
GIF
While the letter versions are used in many games, numpad notation is a different method of transcribing these moves, using the numpad of a keyboard to represent the motion of the joystick. Instead of “qcf” for quarter-circle forward, now it's “236.” The stick goes down to 2, across to 3, up to 6. Add a punch, and Ryu's still tossing hadokens.

GIF
Many anime-style fighting games have been using this variant of notation for years, but the spreading popularity of FighterZ in particular has exacerbated the issue of whether to use English alphabetical letters or numpad notation.
Each case makes a compelling side. Numpad notation is universal, and has an easy-to-follow visual; letters, on the other hand, make it easier to speak aloud (in English) and work better with games that already use numbers to refer to their button inputs, like Injustice and Tekken.

Me personally? I'm a fan of numpad. It just reads clearer in my head, I don't need to look up definitions of certain abbreviations, and it looks neater in writing. As some have pointed out, it's also international! For commentary though, it's understandable why some long-time fighting game commentators are hesitant to switch.
The talk rages on, but one net-positive are the jokes to come out of it.

The Walking Dead has said goodbye to plenty of significant characters over its eight-season run, but it may be about to suffer its biggest loss yet: former sheriff's deputy and survivor leader Rick Grimes. Andrew Lincoln, who plays the central character in AMC's long-running, zombie apocalypse drama, will leave during the upcoming Season 9, according to news reports. Collider first reported the story Tuesday and Entertainment Weekly and The Wrap later reported the news, citing anonymous sources.

AMC would not comment on the reports. Collider says Lincoln could leave as early as six episodes into the new season. The Walking Dead traditionally opens each season in October, with eight episodes in the fall and eight in the spring. In a 2015 USA TODAY interview during Season 5, Lincoln said he wasn't ready to leave, but that the show could continue without him.

The departure of Lincoln's Rick would be momentous in terms of the character's prominence in the show and also his longevity. With the death of Rick's son, Carl (Chandler Riggs), in Season 8 — itself a traumatic event for the series — only Rick, Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) and Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride) remain from Season 1. The battle between Rick's survivors and the Saviors, led by Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), has been the major story of the two most recent seasons, but it was resolved in April's Season 8 finale. Over time, Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan), the pregnant widow of Glenn Rhee, has increased her standing as a survivor leader. The future of Cohan, who first appeared on the show in Season 2, was up in the air for a time but she told Entertainment Weekly at CinemaCon in April that she will return for Season 9. She also has an upcoming ABC series, Whiskey Cavalier. Another popular character, Morgan Jones (Lennie James), left The Walking Dead after Season 8, moving to sister series Fear the Walking Dead in the first character crossover between the two shows.
On the weekend of May 19, three movies dominated the box office. There was Deadpool 2, taking the top spot; right underneath was Avengers: Infinity War, another superhero movie to which audiences swarmed. And in third place, there was a movie that looked nothing like its peers: Book Club, a relatively low-budget comedy about four female friends in their 60s and 70s. If the movie's success (Forbes reports that since its debut, it's made more than three times its cost) surprises you, it shouldn't. Movies about older women can and do make money — because audiences, especially millennial women, love nothing more than seeing a group of over-60 ladies live their best lives on-screen.
Yet movies like Book Club are actually made pretty rarely. In 2017, a study by USC's Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism found that of the 25 Best Picture Oscar nominees from 2014, 2015, and 2016, less than 12 percent of 1,256 speaking roles were given to actors 60 years of age or older — and that's only a small sample of the movies Hollywood releases each year. For women, things are especially bad. From the massive age gaps between male and female leads (see: 46-year-old Will Smith opposite 25-year-old Margot Robbie in Focus, or 61-year-old Liam Neeson co-starring alongside 29-year-old Olivia Wilde in Third Person) to the general lack of leading roles available for women over 40 (after that age, men get a whopping 80 percent of leading roles available, according to a 2016 Clemson study) Hollywood has a long history of determining an actor's worth by the number of years she has left before turning 40.
Sony Pictures Classics
And unfortunately, that apparent ageism has led to a dearth of movies featuring older women. USC Annenberg's 2016 study found that women over 40 made up just 21.4 percent of female roles in film, compared to a whopping 78.6 percent for men. While men like George Clooney (57), Brad Pitt (54), Denzel Washington (63), Tom Hanks (61), Robert De Niro (74), and Colin Firth (57) continue to take over movie screens each year, nearly all their female peers — minus one or two particularly popular ones (see: Helen Mirren, Meryl Streep) — get left behind. As Tina Fey said in her 2014 Oscars monologue, “Meryl Streep is so brilliant in August: Osage County — proving that there are still great parts in Hollywood for Meryl Streeps over 60.”
With the industry so often hesitating to cast movies with over-40 female actors, it can seem like those women simply don't exist on-screen. So a movie like Book Club is a really freakin' big deal. The film, about longtime friends bonding over their monthly reading group, features not just one, but four older women. Mary Steenburgen is 65; Jane Fonda is 80; Diane Keaton and Candice Bergen are both 72. And what's even better is that these women are interesting. They're smart, and funny, and confident, and sexy. They may have gotten past some earlier, more trivial struggles, but they don't have every aspect of their lives figured out just because they're of a certain age; when they need some advice or a shoulder to lean on, they gather their friends, pour some wine, and share stories about marriage and aging and kids and careers. In other words: they're actual human beings, just like all the over-40 men we get to see on-screen all the time, and that means a lot to female audiences.
Paramount Pictures
"There's something profoundly healing and about seeing women of a certain age living their damn best lives," explains Sage, a 35-year-old Bustle editor. "Most Hollywood movies would like to pretend that they don't even exist, let alone still have firsts and passions and all of that good stuff."
Adds freelance writer Amanda, 32: "I love seeing older women embrace their own worth and potential on-screen because I believe it is (or at least should be) reflective of the reality of now. Aging isn't a curse, as so many other stories might try to tell us. We can embrace our growth and maturity and look forward to the same kind of success and satisfaction in our later years as men do."
Book Club isn't the only recent piece of pop culture to feature women over 60 in complex, multi-faceted starring roles; there's the acclaimed Netflix show Grace & Frankie, starring Fonda and 78-year-old Lily Tomlin, as well as movies like Grandma (with Tomlin), Elle (with 65-year-old Isabelle Huppert), and Philomena (with 83-year-old Judi Dench). But unlike a TV show or an indie film, Book Club is a major studio release, getting seen by millions of people and raking in serious money. And so, its central message — that not only can these women star in a movie, but they can be just as bold and funny and complicated as their male peers — matters enormously, especially to younger viewers looking to these women as inspiration.
"There's a lot of stress these days about getting older — whether it's worrying you're not going to find someone, that you won't be able to have kids, that you aren't saving enough for retirement — so watching women who made it past all those hurdles is a breath of fresh air," says Martha, 26, a Bustle Editor. "It's reassuring and relaxing that one day I'm not going to care about all the minute things that I probably shouldn't even be caring about now. Some day, it's all going to be OK, carefree, fun, and come with a lot of day glasses of wine, and I will 100 percent take that version of my possible future."
Adds Danita, a 28-year-old social media manager: "There's a lot of power that comes with being an older woman — you have the freedom to be who you are, partly because everyone has stopped paying attention to you, but mostly because you don't give a damn anymore in the best possible way."
It's not that movies like Book Club portray older adulthood as problem-free. There's a running joke in the movie in which Diane Keaton's 67-year-old character (also named Diane) is constantly told by her two adult children that she's doing things wrong for a woman her age. Living alone and taking care of the house? Too dangerous — she could slip and fall. Going on dates and talking about sex? Not OK — she's a grandmother and widow, for God's sake. In her children's eyes, the time for caring about things like romance and travel and have long passed, and so in that regard, Diane's life isn't easy. But as an older woman who's had decades to figure out her priorities and develop thick skin, Diane approaches challenges with an ease and confidence that many millennial women long to one day share.
It's true that at every point of life, women are told what they should look like, and act like, and even think like, and problems don't just go away at a certain age. But in movies like Book Club, the women get to defy the "norm" for ladies their age, leading lives that are as full and happy — if not more so — than those of their younger selves and men across the globe.
Norway's King has told the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge he hopes the UK and his nation can maintain their close ties when Britain leaves the European Union.
Speaking at an Oslo dinner staged in honour of William and Kate, King Harald also paid an affectionate tribute to the visiting British royals describing them as “family” and praising the way their carried out their duties and support the Queen.
William also celebrated the relationship between the UK and the Nordic nation in his address at the royal palace dinner saying: “Norway has been, and will continue to be, enormously important to Britain both as a friend and a partner.”
The Norwegian sovereign processed into the banquet arm in arm with the pregnant duchess, who wore an Alexander McQueen dress, and their close gesture was mirrored by his wife Queen Sonja and William who walked behind them.
Harald spoke first and described how the UK the number one study destination for Norwegians who return with a positive impression of their time away, strengthening bilateral ties between the two countries.
He said:”I hope we will be able to maintain our close and extensive co-operation when the United Kingdom withdraws from the European Union.
“Dear William, dear Kate, I admire the way you carry out your duties and the way you support he majesty Queen Elizabeth. The Queen and I know from our own experience how valuable it is to work together with the younger generation and how important it is to support one another on this rather unusual profession of ours.”

Thanks for all your help with this, folnevar!
Going back to PCGameSupply's homepage and clicking the banner about the $10 PSN code for $8 worked for me, and yes- if you try to add more than one of these codes to your cart, you'll get an error message telling you that you can only buy one.
Also, thanks for letting me know about Green Man Gaming! I just purchased $150 in PSN credit from them for $138.
Finally, .Beowulf must be right- I thought the wallet limit on PSN was still $150, but I just put in my $20 code from PCGameSupply, then the three $50 codes from Green Man Gaming one at a time, and now my wallet has $170 in it!

Category growth, testing methodology and distribution strategies were just a few of the topics bubbling inside the Long Beach Convention Center over the weekend at the fourth annual KombuchaKon.
Prior to the program of speakers, this year's convention began with a closed meeting of KBI's 130 member companies to address the current state of the industry and to chart the trade group's progress on pressing issues within the category.
Key issues, according to KBI co-founders Alex McGory and Hannah Crum, include lobbying Congress to introduce legislation that would protect kombucha from being categorized alongside other alcoholic beverages. They also said the organization was working on a verification program that would include a label that would provide detailed information on acids and other nutrients in kombucha.
“It's about creating confidence in the product, for consumers, retailers, regulators, or anyone,” McGory said.
Moving into product sales, the convention's first speaker, Bobbi Leahy, an analyst from market research group SPINS, explored category growth.explored notable statistics and trends in kombucha in detail. She described the 32 percent growth rate for kombucha as “through the roof”:greater than any beverage category outside of refrigerated RTD coffee and juice-sweetened sodas. She also described a growing cohort of brands: in the natural retail channel, even while established brands like GT's and KeVita still dominate, Leahy noted that the 16 new brands that launched last year accounted for 2.7 percent of the growth in the category.
GT's also continues to be a leader in the Multi Outlet channel, but Leahy noted that the brand lost 5.7 percent share of the category, while brands such as Humm, Health-Ade and Clearly Kombucha were on the rise.
Leahy's analysis also named the most popular flavors of the drink: ginger and berry are top in both shares and dollar growth, but pepper, cinnamon and mint varieties are emerging as viable options as well.
Later that afternoon, attorney Justin Prochnow of Greenberg Traurig led a discussion of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) revised Nutrition Facts label requirements and how it would affect kombucha brewers. “There is risk from so many different areas,” he warned, noting that plaintiff lawyers are constantly looking to seize on label errors or unsubstantiated claims and turn them into class action lawsuits. In terms of the FDA's new label regulations, he explained how changes in regulatory definitions of terms like serving size, recommended daily intake (RDI) and daily recommended value (DRV) could affect the ability of producers to make nutrient content claims.
Of particular, ongoing interest to kombucha brewers, is how the FDA addresses the issue of added sugar and fermentation. Prochnow said that when the new nutritional regulations are fully in effect in two years, the FDA will require any sugar added during fermentation to be reflected on the product label. However, if a company believes there is a significant difference in sugars added at the beginning of fermentation and that are found in the final product, it can be reflected on the label as long as the company can produce documentation verifying their process.
The convention's second day kicked off with a panel discussion on effective tactics for scaling up kombucha production. Ramon Canek, chief product officer for Health-Ade, encouraged brewers to “do your homework” before investing in equipment and machinery, and to consider how those investments fit into their company's long-term growth strategy. Eric Plantenburg of Humm Kombucha urged brands to take a unified stance, to communicate with and learn from other companies working in the category and to highlight kombucha as a “movement” rather than focusing only on themselves when meeting with retailers.
Dr. Matt Ball, representing Australian brand Wild Kombucha, talked about best practices and procedures when setting up an in-house testing lab. He weighed the costs and benefits of various alcohol testing methods, noting that gas chromatography, while effective, is a pricey investment that requires lots of upkeep and still needs external validation. Ball's strongest recommendation was for companies to keep thorough documentation of all testing.
In his talk on distribution tips and tricks, Shane Dickman of Colorado-based High Country Kombucha encouraged brands to stick up for themselves and to be deliberate and selective when entering into a distribution partnership. Examining the pros and cons of self-distribution, DSD, direct retailer warehouse delivery and grocery distribution, he shared lessons from his own successes and challenges in the business.
Closing out the convention, Christine Perich delivered the keynote address focused on the lessons learned from ther 16 years serving in various roles, including CEO, of New Belgium Brewing Company prior to her recent appointment as CEO at cold-pressed juice company WTRMLN WTR. While pressing the importance of brands developing a core mission of philosophy to drive their decision making, she also said that company management should not be inflexible in its leadership style. Before wrapping up the proceedings, Perich praised KBI for taking collective ownership of the kombucha category and compared the convention atmosphere to the excitement she said she felt in the early days of the craft beer movement.
Private and non-profit child care operators in Nova Scotia say it remains to be seen how they will ultimately be affected by the ongoing rollout of universal pre-primary for four-year-olds across the province.
Lisa Davies, of the Non-Profit Directors Association, says the biggest challenge across the sector remains recruiting and retaining enough trained early childhood educators.
READ: Nova Scotia dramatically expands pre-primary program for four-year-olds
Davies says it's been an ongoing problem in Nova Scotia that is now more acute with the introduction of pre-primary.
Pam Streeter, of the Private Licensed Administrators Association, says pre-primary has been introduced in under serviced and rural areas and the real test for private operators will come when the program is rolled out fully in larger urban areas.
WATCH: Worries mount for private, non-profit childcare centres ahead of pre-primary rollout
Education Department officials say 110 early childhood educators were hired to work in 54 classes in 45 schools when the program was launched last September.
The department says an additional 700 will be needed by the time pre-primary is fully implemented in 2020.
Joint Investigation Team (JIT) of the Supreme Court in Panama Papers case has summoned Prime Minister Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif to appear before it on June 15 (today). According to the reports, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has taken a welcome decision to appear before the JIT for questioning. This decision has been taken despite the fact that already his two sons Hussain Nawaz and Hassan Nawaz have appeared before the JIT a number of times and grilled and questioned for fours together on each appearance. This is quite a respectful gesture on the part of the sitting prime minister for the superior judiciary of the country.
This belies the quite negative and hostile propaganda by the opposition that the prime minister and his family members have no regard and respect for the superior judiciary of the country. As for reports that the JIT has extended its probe to Shehbaz Sharif family and to near and distant relatives of Sharif family are concerned, it is for the Special Bench of the Supreme Court supervising the JIT working whether this is within the given framework of the JIT or not. One better not comment on this in any manner.
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has taken the important decision after consulting close aides and is in the process of being briefed by his team of lawyers. There are no indications as to whether prime minister will be accompanied by his aides/lawyers when he appears before the JIT or for that matter whether he is going to ask for permission of the JIT in this regard. Irrespective of the outcome, the appearance of the sitting prime minister before the JIT for questioning is certainly going to set a good and welcome tradition in more than one way. This should be duly appreciated and welcomed by all including the opposition in all fairness, please.

This weekend I called one of our Iowa legislators, Norlin Mommsen, and told him my concerns for the proposed changes to Chapter 20. I told him he needed to vote "no" to these changes and that if he didn't, I would remember it at election time. I have since found out that apparently, in his opinion, this was threatening to him. First of all, when I tried to call him I didn't get through or even have an opportunity to leave a message. Then this morning I was finally able to leave a quick message. I said, “I am Mary Jo Petersen and I would like you to give me a call back to talk about the changes to Chapter 20. Please vote no. If you don't, I will remember at the election.”
Gandhinagar: Nana Patole, who recently resigned from Lok Sabha and the BJP, on Monday shared the stage with Congress president-elect, Rahul Gandhi at an election rally in Gandhinagar and fulminated against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, claiming he "abused" senior MPs who had once gone to meet him.
Addressing the rally, Patole said he decided to part ways with the BJP because Modi failed to address the issues of farmers and went back on his promise to implement the Swaminathan Commission recommendations.
The former MP from Maharashtra's Bhandara-Gondia constituency also alleged that Modi snubbed him and abused elderly MPs who once went to meet him at his residence.
"It has been more than three years since the Modi government has been at the Centre. Modiji had assured that he will implement the Swaminathan Commission recommendations, but the first thing he did was to file an affidavit in the Supreme Court saying he will not accept the recommendations, which amounts to the betrayal of farmers," Patole said.
There has been a rise in incidents of farmer suicide, he alleged.
"Once Modiji called a meeting of MPs from different states at his residence before the winter session of Parliament. When some elderly MPs rose to ask him questions, he abused them and asked them to sit down. He also shouted at me when I asked him about a separate ministry for OBCs," he claimed.
Patole accused Modi of playing the OBC card for political gains. He alleged the prime minister was playing with the future of children of OBC, SC and ST categories by stopping their scholarships.
Patole, who had defeated NCP stalwart Praful Patel in the last Lok Sabha poll, claimed note ban was the biggest instance of "corruption."
BEREA, Ohio >> His head is swimming with new terms, plays and formations. Hes got endless film to watch, notes to take and theres a playbook nearly as thick as any finance text he carried around at Notre Dame.
But fresh out of college, DeShone Kizers treating his job as an NFL quarterback as if hes back on campus.
I like to consider this like a calculus class, the Browns rookie said. You miss one day of a calculus class, youre set back for the whole semester.
So far, Kizers got an A.
The second-round draft pick has been making steady progress, so much in fact that he took snaps Tuesday and Wednesday with Clevelands starting offense at the teams mandatory minicamp. Kizer may still be behind on the depth chart, but he appears to be closing the gap on veterans Brock Osweiler and Cody Kessler in a quarterback competition that will heat up next month in training camp.
Advertisement
Everything has been a learning experience for Kizer, starting with comments he made on draft day that his plans were to play as quickly as possible and not to sit around and watch from the sideline.
Some of that confidence has been knocked out of Kizer by Browns coach Hue Jackson, who made it clear to his QB from the outset that the first thing he needed to practice was patience.
He laid it right to me, Kizer said, and he said Look, this is not about you playing right away, this is not about a timetable on when youre going to play, its about you just learning as much as you possibly can and becoming a better quarterback. And thats been my mindset since the day he said that.
The first time I stepped into this building as a Cleveland Brown, those were the messages that were passed across to me, and Ill continue to believe that until they tell me otherwise.
Although Kizer has been behind center more with the No. 1 offense than at any time previously, Jackson said nothing has changed with the Browns quarterback rotation. The order remains: Kessler, Osweiler and Kizer.
But this is Cleveland, where the line is always moving.
The Browns shuffle through quarterbacks quicker than any other team, starting 26 since 1999 and three last season.
Jackson is in no rush to name his starter, but would like to have one in place by the exhibition opener. At this point, he doesnt think Kizers ready to compete for the starting job.
Not yet, he said. I just think there is a lot of work to do and a lot of growing to do.
Osweiler, who came to Cleveland in a trade as a throw-in following one miserable season as Houstons starter, told reporters hes only aware of the Browns sordid history at the position because you guys talk about it all the time.
The 26-year-old finally feels comfortable in his new surroundings and his excitement about an opportunity to revive his career comes across as genuine. Osweiler feels as if he has changed some opinions about him during Clevelands offseason workouts and hes determined to make bigger strides.
I want to be the starter of this team and Im working every single day to put myself in a position to earn that starting job, he said.
But my focus isnt anywhere as far as whos getting what reps, my sole focus is what can I do today to be a better player and have a good practice and make my teammates better.
Kessler is the incumbent, but his grip on the No. 1 spot is anything but firm.
He made eight starts as a rookie last season, when he was thrust into the starting lineup earlier than expected because of injuries. Kessler hardened his body thanks to a diligent workout program and strict diet, and hes expected to open training camp next month atop the depth chart.
There are no guarantees hell stay there.
Its obviously coach Jacksons decision, he said. For me, wherever I am, whether its the first time, second time, third time, you go in there and compete. You continue to make plays. It really is important. There are always guys rotating. For me, its the same mentality Ive had the whole time. Im going to make the most of my opportunities, learn from the film and continue to grow and improve.
 NOTES: Kizer signed his four-year rookie contract, which is worth nearly $5 million and includes a $1.7 million signing bonus. ... Rookie DB Jabrill Peppers took the first kickoff returns during the afternoon workout, which was pushed inside by thunderstorms. Peppers and TE David Njoku are the only two of 10 draft picks still unsigned.

Construction Officials Caution That Infrastructure, Other Construction Projects Will Increase if New “Buy America” Provisions, Punitive Tariffs or Limitations on Canadian Lumber Are Put in Place
The cost of materials and services used in construction rose markedly faster than the price of completed buildings, according to a new analysis of federal producer price data released today by the Associated General Contractors of America. Association officials cautioned that potential restrictions on the use of imported construction materials threaten to drive up the price of infrastructure, buildings and new homes and apartments.
“Steep price hikes have hit a wide range of key materials used in construction in the past few months, and contractors have received numerous letters from vendors announcing large additional increases in the next month or two,” said Ken Simonson, the association's chief economist. “For the most part, contractors cannot pass these costs along on projects already underway, and the data show they are not yet able to price new buildings at a level that reflects their rising materials, services, and labor costs.”
From January 2016 to January 2017, there was a 3.1 percent rise in the producer price index for inputs to construction industries—the government's broadest measure of the cost of goods, energy and services that go into all types of construction, ranging from highways and other infrastructure to schools, private buildings, apartments and houses. Another government report showed that averagely hourly earnings for all workers in construction climbed 3.2 percent over the same period, Simonson noted. Meanwhile, the price index for new nonresidential buildings – what contractors charge for their work – increased just 1.4 percent.
Among the major contributors to the rise in construction materials costs over the past year were increases in the cost of copper and brass mill shapes (19.9 percent), steel mill products (11.4 percent) and lumber and plywood (3.7 percent). In addition, diesel fuel, which contractors use directly and also pay for through surcharges on the thousands of deliveries to construction sites, jumped by 34.8 percent.
We've put together this handy guide to cover “rent vs. lease vs. buy” questions. Included are three decision trees along with a recap of pros and cons of each option. How to Choose Between Rent vs. Buy. Download it now!
Association officials cited three types of proposals that threaten to drive construction costs even higher: an expansion of restrictive “Buy America” provisions for construction materials to a wider variety of federally funded infrastructure projects; punitive tariffs on imported steel used in many types of buildings; and limitations on Canadian lumber that is commonly used in residential projects.
“If the President and Congress are serious about rebuilding the nation's aging infrastructure, the last thing they should do is put in place measures that will needlessly increase the cost of building these projects,” said Stephen E. Sandherr, the association's chief executive officer. “The best way to rebuild the domestic market for manufacturing key construction materials is to put in place long-term infrastructure funding mechanisms that will reassure manufacturers that there will be steady demand for their products.”

Following Roseanne Barr's misguided attempt to blame Ambien for her racist comments towards former President Obama aide Valerie Jarrett, “Full Frontal With Samantha Bee” has made an (fake) ad promoting the new side effects of the medication.
The narrator says, “Until you know how Ambien will affect you, you shouldn't drive in urban areas, operate heavy machinery, or visit a Starbucks.” The parody states that if you're already racist, Ambien could make the problem worse.
It isn't for everybody however; the video warns users not to take it if they've ever wondered why there isn't a white history month, used the phrase ‘I'm not racist but,' or if they've tweeted racist things to their boss in the past.
Those under the influence of a nationalist ideology should be cautious when using Ambien, as the drug may make the condition worse. The commercial lists a number of extremely common side effects, including “clutching your purse as a person of color walks by” and “threatening to call ICE.”
It advises potential users to talk to their doctors about Ambien, as calls to the police to warn them about “that man who's just standing there alone” may increase during use. The video ends with the tagline “A great night's sleep and a convenient excuse are just one little pill away.”

DETROIT >> Taijuan Walker pitched five sharp innings in his return from the disabled list, and the Arizona Diamondbacks won their fourth straight game, 2-1 over the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday night.
PHOTOS: For a gallery from the game, click here.
Walker (5-3) allowed a run and six hits in his first appearance since May 19. He had been out because of a blister on his right index finger.
The Diamondbacks scored two runs in the first inning, and that turned out to be all they needed. Walker was lifted after 82 pitches, but Randall Delgado pitched three scoreless innings of relief. Fernando Rodney struck out the side in the ninth for his 18th save in 21 chances.

Jordan Zimmermann (5-5) allowed two runs and six hits in eight innings.
Arizona is 9-1 in interleague play this season. The lone defeat was at home May 10 against Detroit.
The Diamondbacks took the lead right away against Zimmermann. Gregor Blanco led off the game with a single to left that got past Justin Upton for an error. Blanco went all the way to third on the play and scored on David Peraltas sacrifice fly. Brandon Drury added an RBI single, but Upton redeemed himself by throwing Chris Owings out at the plate.
Detroit was hitless until the third, when Ian Kinsler managed a two-out double and scored on Alex Avilas single.
Walker struck out six and walked one, and Zimmermann was impressive as well. After Chris Hermanns single to start the second, Arizona didnt have another baserunner until the seventh.
It was the third straight quality start for Zimmermann and the first time this year he had gone more than six innings. He struck out six without a walk and lowered his ERA to 5.35.
TRAINERS ROOM
 Diamondbacks: After a one-out walk to Avila in the first, Walker committed an obvious balk when he began his motion to the plate but didnt release the ball. It looked awkward, but he was able to continue and there was no sign of an injury.

Word coming out of weekend talks is that new Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe is intent on retaining the outline of the controversial Mining Charter championed by his predecessor. Would this be a concession to practicality – Mantashe has said he wants the job done within three months – or evidence that it will be business as usual at the Department of Mineral Resources? The jury's still out. Meanwhile, questions are being asked as to why community activists and the AMCU were missing from the most recent negotiations. By REBECCA DAVIS.
“We cannot throw the Mining Charter out with the dirty water,” National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) General Secretary David Sipunzi told Daily Maverick on Monday.
“The Chamber [of Mines] may have some differences, but we cannot start from scratch. We have to deal with areas of dissatisfaction.”
This sentiment appears to be shared by new Minister of Mineral Resources Gwede Mantashe.
Closed-door talks between government, industry and labour this weekend produced reports that the new mining minister wants to retain the basic elements of the charter, which in the past has been rejected unequivocally by the mining industry for its onerous transformation requirements.
The DA's Shadow Minister of Mineral Resources, James Lorimer, said in a statement on Monday:
“At industry stakeholder talks over the weekend, (Mantashe) indicated that the widely criticised Mining Charter 3 will be the basis of negotiation of a new charter with industry.”
Contacted for comment by Daily Maverick, the Chamber of Mines was staying tight-lipped at this stage about the details of negotiations.
“The fact that actual engagement is taking place is a good thing,” the chamber's head of public affairs and transformation Tebello Chabana said.
But Chabana added, in an apparent reference to ongoing disagreements:
“We were not expecting the process to be easy.”
Mantashe – a former leader of NUM – is set to brief media on Tuesday on the progress of the weekend talks and his “immediate plans and priorities concerning the department and the mining industry”.
It is already known that one of Mantashe's central concerns is the finalisation of the Mining Charter in good time. In February, Mantashe said that he wanted discussions done and dusted within three months – a time frame which reportedly surprised industry, given the extent of previous conflict on the matter.
Three months was also considered overly ambitious because of the new requirements compelling the government and industry to ensure that the voices of mining-affected communities are heard in such discussions.
In February, the North Gauteng High Court ruled that mining-affected communities had to be involved in negotiations over the Mining Charter.
Yet on Monday, community mining activist Elton Thobejane confirmed to Daily Maverick that his group – the Mining and Environmental Justice Community Network South Africa – had once again been excluded from the weekend talks.
“We were not aware of [the talks], and only heard about them through the media,” Thobejane said.
“The department is starting on the wrong foot, given the directive issued by the high court. We should be part of the process from the word go.”
Thobejane said that the exclusion of community voices was doubly disappointing, given initial indications from President Cyril Ramaphosa that government was recommitted to community consultation.
After the February high court ruling, the Presidency stated that “government will ensure that this matter [insufficient consultation] is corrected in engagement on the Mining Charter going forward”.
Daily Maverick asked the Department of Mineral Resources why mining-affected communities had not been included in the weekend talks, in apparent contravention of the court order, but had not received comment by deadline.
Thobejane said that the mining community networks would be writing to the department through their lawyers to express their disappointment.
The mining activists were not the only group absent from the weekend discussions. Also missing was the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), the breakaway faction of NUM.
AMCU president Joseph Mathunjwa did not respond to Daily Maverick's request for comment on Monday.
Other media alleged that AMCU had not been invited, and suggested that a contributing factor could be Mathunjwa's historically fractious relationship with Mantashe as a result of the minister's past with NUM.
NUM's Sipunzi, however, said that the union was “concerned” that AMCU had not been part of the consultation, but claimed that Mathunjwa had indeed been invited to the table.
“We believe the invitation is still open,” he said.
It remains to be seen what update Mantashe will provide on the talks on Tuesday, but it is clear that much contestation remains. The Chamber of Mines' objections to the Mining Charter, after all, led to a complete breakdown of communications between industry and government under Mantashe's predecessor Mosebenzi Zwane.
The mining community networks, meanwhile, have voiced opposition to the third iteration of the Mining Charter on the basis that it does not go far enough in ensuring that the transformative benefits of mining are felt by the communities around mine.
But stakeholders – at least those invited to the table last weekend – are still putting a brave face on the potential for renewal under a Mantashe-governed Department of Mineral Resources.
The Chamber of Mines' Chabana told Daily Maverick that there “absolutely” was reason to believe that the chamber would be able to work better with Mantashe than his mining minister predecessor.
Asked whether there was any evidence of a policy shift from the department thus far, however, Chabana replied:
“These are early days in the process.”
NUM's perspective, meanwhile, is business-like.
“We have an industry to run,” Sipunzi says.
“We need to get this industry to work.” DM

Live on Raw next Monday night, Roman Reigns will make an announcement concerning his involvement in this year's SummerSlam, which will emanate from Brooklyn, N.Y.'s Barclays Center on Sunday, Aug. 20.
Although Reigns was unsuccessful in earning the right to challenge Brock Lesnar for the Universal Championship at the WWE Great Balls of Fire pay-per-view — that honor went to Samoa Joe at WWE Extreme Rules — The Big Dog remains focused on ruling over and defending his “yard” on Team Red. No matter what it entails, Reigns' proclamation will surely change the landscape of WWE's annual summer spectacular.
Don't miss Reigns' SummerSlam announcement next Monday night on Raw, live at 8/7 C on the USA Network.
Claire Foy's Lisbeth Salander act in The Girl In The Spider's Web will make 'Wonder Woman look like Powerpuff Girl'
Los Angeles: Sony Pictures Entertainment rolled out intense new footage from The Girl in the Spider's Web at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, with The Crown star Claire Foy in the role of Lisbeth Salander who, chairman Tom Rothman said, makes "Wonder Woman look like a Powerpuff Girl."
"The thing I think makes this special and truly, truly compelling is that you can't describe her," Foy said.
Director Fede Alvarez, who was behind the horror hit Don't Breathe, said that there is an audience demand for "good-quality filmmaking."
"I believe in movies that provoke. Movies you cannot ignore. Movies that hit the cultural conversation. I'm confident this movie will hit all fronts," Alvarez said of The Girl in the Spider's Web.
Rothman also said that a Jumanji sequel, with Dwayne Johnson, will be coming in December 2019.
"Don't rush to give all those screens to Star Wars again," Rothman said.
The Johnson-led reboot, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle became a massive hit in the early part of the year, making over $956 million worldwide.
The CinemaCon convention features massive presentations from each of the major studios, in addition to a few of the smaller ones, like Amazon, with sizzle reels and stars to wow the theater owners with what's coming up and why theaters should be excited about the fresh movies on the horizon.

Money isn't everything -- but it's a long way ahead of what comes next. -- Sir Edmond Stockdale
New Delhi: The Central Board of Secondary Education will conduct a re-test of Class 12 economics paper on Wednesday, nearly a month after it was leaked triggering widespread outrage and confusion among students across India.
After reports of the leak surfaced on 28 March, the CBSE announced it will re-conduct the examination on 25 April.
Then, there were also reports of the CBSE's Class 10 mathematics paper being leaked, but the board decided against a re-test of the Class 10 paper, saying the examination was "largely an internal segment" of the school education system.
"The candidates will appear (for the exam) from the same allotted centres using the same admit card," a board official said on Tuesday.
For conducting the re-test of the economics paper, the board had said "Class 12 exams are a gateway to higher education and various professional competitive exams which have limited seats... Therefore, giving undue advantage to a handful of beneficiaries of the alleged leak of the economics paper would not be in larger interest of the students."
Earlier this month, the CBSE had said it found no impact of the Class 10 mathematics paper leak after an assessment.
The reports of leak of the CBSE papers had caused disappointment among students across the country last month.
In Delhi, students held protests, accusing the CBSE of negligence and demanded immediate action against the guilty. Investigators made arrests in several parts of the country in connection with the case, including in Jharkhand and Himachal Pradesh.
They claimed to have arrested the main conspirators behind the leak from Una town in Himachal Pradesh. The three people were staffers at a school in the town.
The Class 12 economics paper was leaked on 23 March - three days before the scheduled date, according to Delhi Police.
The leak was exposed after an envelop containing four images of the hand-written economics paper was delivered to the CBSE Headquarters in Delhi on the evening of the scheduled date of examination - 26 March.
Following the leak reports, on 2 April CBSE tried a "leak-proof" system of "encrypted" question papers, which delayed the exam as a few centres in Delhi were unable to follow the printing of encrypted papers, e-mailed to them, at the school itself.
The HRD ministry then set up a committee to examine the process by which the CBSE conducts examinations. The seven-member panel, headed by former HRD secretary Vinay Sheel Oberoi, will suggest measures to make the process "secure and fool-proof" using technology. The committee has to submit its report by May 31 to the Human Resource Development Ministry.

Single-payer backer
Editor: The Republican-controlled Senate is trying to pass a health care bill that would take away affordable health insurance from 23 million Americans, like myself, and would remove the individual mandate — similar to automobile insurance — that helps make insurance more affordable for everyone.
It's worth noting that Republicans want to keep protections under the Affordable Care Act — “Obamacare” — for themselves while giving the public worse coverage or no coverage.
President Trump is trying to destroy the Affordable Care Act by denying subsidies that Obamacare put into place. In response, insurance companies are pulling out of markets, making health insurance unavailable in parts of some states.
My Republican members of Congress, Sen. Pat Toomey and U.S. Rep. Tom Marino, have refused to hold town hall meetings to listen to our concerns. We have been ignored when attempting to visit their regional offices and their staffs offer no substantive information regarding their positions on this important issue. Marino voted for the terrible House version of the American Health Care Act.
The Senate is trying to quietly rush through a similar bill while most of the country is distracted by the investigations into Russia's interference in the election.
Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, in contrast, has held town hall meetings and his staff is able and willing to discuss this issue and elaborate on his views.
No matter how careful we are, we can still be affected by an illness or accident. We should not have to worry about losing our homes if we become injured or ill. We need a single-payer health care system similar to Medicare. Why should our taxes pay for members of Congress to have good health care when they would deny it to their constituents?

Assure funding
Editor: Many Pennsylvanians trust their beloved pets to the care of their veterinarian because they know veterinarians provide compassionate care for companion animals. However, few Pennsylvanians are aware of the role veterinarians play in protecting the food supply.
The University of Pennsylvania Veterinary School, the state's only school of veterinary medicine, has received funding from Pennsylvania until the most recent state budget proposal. The funding Penn Vet receives is critical to protecting both public health and Pennsylvania's food supply. Consider:
■ Penn Vet has both the personnel and facilities to fight re-emerging threats, such as rabies. There is no other facility in the state with the diagnostics capable of a timely rabies assessment, as well as the ability to pursue other diagnostics in the event of a negative result.
■ Penn Vet's swine center collects data on where swine viruses occur, helping farmers and truckers see where disease occurs to prevent its spread. The program maintains a map covering 1.29 million hogs in the state and has resulted in a 30 percent reduction in the number of pigs in the program with viruses.
■ During the last budget impasse, Penn Vet conducted 70,000 tests for avian influenza without payment while the disease caused billions in agricultural losses in the Midwest.
■ Penn Vet's role in developing an egg quality assurance program in Pennsylvania results in 99.99 percent of Pennsylvania eggs making it to market without salmonella.
Let's take the steps to ensure Pennsylvania has a safe food supply by restoring funding for Penn Vet.

Hacking widespread
Editor: Apparently, in the 2016 election, Bloomberg News reports this week that “Russian hackers managed to breach voter databases and software systems in 39 states.”
None of the news reports talk about what the Russians did when they broke into these systems, other than to use the words “efforts to meddle or tamper” with our election.
If the Russians got into these systems the assumption arises that they did something even if we don't know what they did. Many news reports seem do downplay the impact as if the hacking didn't actually change any results.
I have a hard time believing that they didn't flip the election and that in reality, America didn't choose our leaders, the Russians did. Whatever happened in 2016 can hardly be called an election.

Accentuate positive
Editor: There is a line from Mark Antony's speech in William Shakespeare's play “Julius Caesar” that goes like this:
“The evil that man does lives after him. The good is oft interred with the bones.”
So, let it be with today's society. Do the new media report too many shootings, stabbings and murders or does it glorify such atrocities? It makes people wonder why so many of these incidents are reported almost daily nowadays. Where is the good news being reported? Is it in the fine print at the bottom of a page where people can just about read it?
Or is this due to the mental health system not being able to identify people who might be capable of doing such evil deeds before it is too late to stop them? If that's the case, it is time the mental health profession starts re-examining its methodology of
evaluating people more closely with the proper questions and procedures that will bring out possible ulterior motives in them before it happens and start them in a treatment program that will help them realize the consequences of their actions.
Whether this will be the answer remains to be seen. Unless the media stops headlining evil actions, the good deeds will indeed be buried away from the rest
of us who need to know that good things are happening in our world today.

Serbia maintains good, stable relations with Norway, Serbian Deputy PM and Serbian FM Ivica Dacic said Tuesday, noting Norway was an important partner of Serbia and that bilateral economic cooperation should be boosted.
Speaking at a press conference after meeting with Norwegian FM Borge Brende, Serbian FM Dacic announced he would pay an official visit to Norway in April to discuss further strengthening of cooperation with the friendly country.
Foreign ministers of Serbia and Norway are to look into greater investment in Serbia, visiting Norway's foreign minister Borge Brende said here Tuesday.
At a joint press conference after his meeting with Norwegian Foreign Minister Borge Brende in Belgrade, Dacic announced he would travel to Norway in April, where he would discuss “further strengthening of cooperation with this friendly country.”
Dacic said Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic and he informed their guest about the strategic goal of Serbia – membership in the EU – as well as the desire for Serbia to be “an exporter of stability in the region, while open issues should be solved through dialogue, without any unilateral moves.”
Norway, said Dacic, is an important partner of Serbia, while Norway, according to its officials, sees Serbia as its “partner plus” in the region.
Serbia will support Norway's desire to become a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, he said, noting that regardless of the fact this issue will be on the agenda in 2020, “Serbia mist think long term.”
Noting that Norway is one of the largest bilateral donors to Serbia, Dacic said that this country has in the past 15 years supported Serbia with more than 250 million euros worth of various humanitarian and development projects, reforms in various sectors, and helped repair the damage caused by the 2014 floods, and with the migrant crisis.
Dacic said that the volume of trade with Norway is low compared to the opportunities and amounted to “50, 60 million euros” last year – “but can be much better.”
There are various areas for Norwegian investments in Serbia, Dacic said, adding, “we are interested in Norway's experience.”
Brende told reporters that his country has “a strong partnership” with Serbia, supports its path towards the EU, and wants Serbia wants to be an exporter of stability in the region, given the “fragility and sensitivity,” especially when it comes to Bosnia-Herzegovina.
“A responsible leadership in Serbia is important in this sense,” said the Norwegian minister.
According to him, recent years have seen more and more investment from Norway, while the intention is to increase this further. Further strengthening of cooperation and increasing investments by Norwegian companies in Serbia will be discussed during Dacic's visit, he said.
Noting that he visited Serbia for the first time during the floods, Brende said his country is “a friend of Serbia who has helped it.”

Jeremy Lin has dreadlocks now. Pretty cool, huh?
Well, some people don't think so. But that's OK with Lin. The one-time Laker and current member of the Brooklyn Nets thinks everybody is entitled to their own opinions.
That's exactly what Lin told one such critic, former NBA star Kenyon Martin — that and lots of other really nice stuff in response to the first of two videos Martin posted Wednesday on the topic of Lin's hair.
In the first video, Martin stated, “Do I need to remind this damn boy that his last name Lin?” and “All right bro, we get it. You wanna be black.”
Lin responded in the comment section of Martin's post:
"Hey man, its all good. You definitely don't have to like my hair and definitely entitled to your opinion. Actually i legit grateful you sharin it tbh. At the end of the day, i appreciate that i have dreads and you have Chinese tattoos bc I think its a sign of respect. And i think as minorities, the more that we appreciate each others cultures, the more we influence mainstream society. Thanks for everything you did for the nets and hoops ... had your poster up on my wall growin up."
Later that day, Martin posted his second video, in which he said Lin can wear his hair any way he likes.
“That man grown. That man can rock whatever hairstyle he wanna rock. That don't mean I have to like it or agree with it,” Martin said. “Second of all, I'm grown. I can say whatever I wanna say about whatever I wanna say about. It ain't about race, it ain't about none of that. Like, grow up people. It was a joke. But I don't like it, I don't agree with it, so it is what it is.”
Following the Nets' 107-88 preseason win over Miami on Thursday, Lin was still in a gracious mood about the Martin situation.
“At the end of the day … we need to spend a little more time thinking about what it'd be like to be somebody else,” Lin told the New York Post. “He said what he said but I'm not really that offended. If that's how he thinks, that's how he thinks. But my job is to be gracious, loving and if I can just share with him a little of my side I think the next time maybe he'll have a different viewpoint.”
Lin has worn a variety hairstyles during his seven-year NBA career. This is how he looked during the 2014-15 season with the Lakers:

The following season he played for the Charlotte Hornets and looked like this:

Sometimes he has gone with the braided look:

And now, he's got dreads, a look Lin said he put a lot of thought into.
“A recent conversation I had with Savannah Hart, a Nets staff member who's African-American, really resonated with me,” Lin wrote in a post this week for the Players' Tribune. “I told her about my thought process — how I was really unsure about getting dreads because I was worried I'd be appropriating black culture. She said that if it wasn't my intention to be dismissive of another culture, then maybe it could be an opportunity to learn about that culture.”
Later in the article, he wrote:
“Over the course of the last few years and all these hairstyles, I've learned that there's a difference between ‘not caring what other people think' and actually trying to walk around for a while in another person's shoes. The conversations I had weren't always very comfortable, and at times I know I didn't say the right things. But I'm glad I had them — because I know as an Asian-American how rare it is for people to ask me about my heritage beyond a surface level.
“It's easy to take things that we enjoy from other cultures — that's one of the coolest things about a melting-pot society like ours. But I think we have to be careful that taking doesn't become all we do. With all the division, political turmoil and senseless violence in our society right now, we need to talk to each other more than ever.”

With his infant daughter's condition improving following heart surgery, Craig Kimbrel rejoined the Boston Red Sox on Monday, threw live batting practice and declared he will be ready for Opening Day next week.
"There's no denying it's been the toughest thing we've ever been through," Kimbrel said in a news conference at the team's spring training facility. "In the last week, her recovery has been unbelievable, and she's showing great signs."
Kimbrel's daughter, Lydia Joy, was born in November with a heart condition. Three weeks ago, the All-Star closer left the Red Sox with the team's permission to be with Lydia for the second of three surgeries at Boston Children's Hospital. While he was away, teammates wore red T-shirts with the slogan #LydiaStrong as a show of support for the Kimbrels.
Lydia is expected to be released from the hospital within a few weeks, according to Kimbrel. The third surgery won't take place until she's 3 or 4 years old to "straighten up her anatomy so she can grow as a normal child," he said.
In an emotional news conference, Kimbrel expressed his gratitude to the medical staff at Boston Children's Hospital, in addition to the Red Sox for allowing him to leave camp. Kimbrel, a free agent after this season, also noted that he feels fortunate to have access to the medical care in Boston.
"My wife and I talk about it all the time," he said. "We're very strong in our faith. We believe that everything in life happens for a reason, even if we don't understand it at the time."
Although Kimbrel spent most of the past few weeks at the hospital, he was able to steal a few hours each day to work out and throw, usually at nearby Babson College. A few days ago, he threw live batting practice, after Babson coach Matt Noone arranged for hitters to stand in.
"My family comes first and then baseball comes," Kimbrel said. "Stepping away for a few hours was definitely a release. It did help to get in the weight room. It did help to throw the ball. But that's not going to take away the emotions we went through in the hospital.
"She's in a good, comfortable place for me to be down here. If she wasn't, I wouldn't be here."
New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to address about 20 rallies in Karnataka to boost the BJP's campaign in a state where his party is locked in a keen fight with the Congress.
Party sources said Modi, BJP's biggest crowd-puller, is likely to kick off a series of rallies in the southern state from 1 May.
Though he had address public meetings in the state earlier, he has not hit the campaign trail since the Election Commission announced the assembly election schedule on 27 March. The election is scheduled for May 12 and the counting of votes will take place on 15 May.
The BJP sources said a final programme of Modi's election tour is still being finalised and he is expected to address anywhere between 15-20 rallies.
The saffron party is making all-out efforts to oust the Siddaramaiah dispensation from power in the only big state where the Congress governs.
Opinion polls have so far forecast a close fight between the two parties and the BJP believes that Modi's whirlwind campaign in the final days before the polls can tilt the scale in its favour.
Its president Amit Shah has been frequenting the state for months, holding rallies, meeting religious heads, addressing community events and toning up organisational machinery in the run-up to the election.

Locals have stepped up their fight to "save" an Aldershot pub after it was announced it is up for sale.
Concerned it could be sold off for housing, Royal Staff regulars have launched their "Save Our Staff" campaign and petition, calling on Fuller's to ensure it remains operating as a pub.
The Mount Pleasant Road watering hole has been listed on a commercial property website – as has the La Fontaine pub, just a few yards up the road.
Save Our Staff campaigners are "dismayed" that Fuller's has "backtracked" on previous promises to the Campaign For Real Ale (CAMRA) it was committed to the pub.
“We have seen our local transformed in recent years,” campaigners said. “The Royal Staff is a vibrant, friendly, warm and safe establishment valued by people from across the local community.
"In short, this little part of Aldershot is a genuine social asset."
They continued: “We are not prepared to stand by and watch Fuller's destroy this hard work and 150 years of Aldershot's history for no good reason, as we believe the pub to be viable.
"As such we wish to announce that we have established a campaign group called ‘Save our Staff' which is aiming to persuade Fuller's to change its mind.”
Although there's no suggestion that the pub will close if sold, a worried North Town resident previously told Get Hampshire she was concerned that The Royal Staff would face the same fate as the former Beehive pub, in the High Street, which has been converted into bedsits without planning permission.
Save Our Staff campaigners added: “If Fuller's won't change its mind then we request that it sells up as a going concern and not for yet another shoddy pub conversion to poor quality housing.
"We have endured too many examples of this as a town, damaging both the perception and appearance of Aldershot.
“Further, if this gem of a pub is sold as something other than a going concern, this act of social sabotage would show Fuller's to be nothing more than anti-community.”
150 years of history
CAMRA, Aldershot Civic Society and Aldershot History Society have banded together and submitted an Asset of Community Value application to Rushmoor Borough Council.
If successful, campaigners could block the sale of the pub for up to six months to make a bid and raise funds to buy the "asset".
A spokesman for the Surrey Hampshire Borders branch of CAMRA said: “The Royal Staff has been serving the people of Aldershot and providing employment for around 150 years.
"We will do all we can to ensure that The Royal Staff can continue to serve the local community for another 150 years.”
The Save Our Staff campaign now has its own Facebook page, on which Councillor David Bell, who sits on the planning committee, said: “Rushmoor now has a policy to save public houses.
"This now makes it very difficult to simply close a public house for development. If a pub is operating as a profitable concern and has public support then it's future should be secure.”
Commenting on the sale of The Royal Staff, a spokesperson for Fuller, Smith & Turner, said: “Fuller's has nearly 200 tenanted pubs and over the coming months, we will be looking to help our tenants to open, develop and promote pubs that deliver the distinctive experience, including freshly cooked food, customers expect when they see the Fuller's name.
"As part of that plan, there are a number of sites, including The Royal Staff, Aldershot, that have been earmarked for sale.”
The petition can be signed in the pub. The campaign Facebook page is @saveourstaff.
Raghavendra Rathore might not be a regular on fashion week schedules, but his presence on the scene is nonetheless felt by way of his quiet dedication to his craft. Known for his refined, minimalistic take on tailoring, a Rathore bandhgala is instantly recognisable in a crowd. Channeling his expertise in another direction, for a while now, Rathore has been working on a special project—the launch of the Gurukul School of Design in Jaipur India.
Designed to endow students with a mature sense of vision, business acumen and better communication, Rathore has brought in the best international and Indian educators on board to create a wholesome curriculum for the school. Vogue spoke to the designer about the importance of design education for someone seeking a career in fashion.
What made you want to start a design school in India?
It was a natural progression, a full circle back to the classroom. Though it was very much a conscious decision I had taken years ago, the time has presented itself now. While studying at Parsons, New York, back in 1994, I worked shifts after school to support myself. That phase and experience somewhere engrained in me an appetite to possibly one day provide a similar opportunity to budding talent back home one day. On a more personal front, I received help from someone who simply told me that the biggest payback would be if I one day could also do a similar thing for someone. The stepping stone was establishing the Raghavendra Rathore Foundation, that works with a cross-section of society under arts, crafts and design, and I think Gurukul School of Design is a formalisation of all these thought processes and experiences, amalgamated into a structure that will allow individuals to become successful entrepreneurs and keep this cycle moving.
How important is it to have a fashion education if you want to be a fashion designer?
To me, education has always been a little more than just the formal dissemination of information. Especially in design, what one learns in the field is so much more than can be taught—design and aesthetic must be felt and experienced to be understood. I also strongly endorse the school of thought which is multi-dimensional—for example if one trains to be a fashion designer, they should also be taught the ropes of commerce, brand building and finance—an all-encompassing education is important.
With established institutions like NIFT, NID and Pearl Academy offering exemplary programs and placement opportunities, what does The Gurukul School of Design offer that sets its students apart from the rest?
Many design schools today teach design only from the art and pattern point of view, in other words, students focus on one and only one aspect. The Gurukul School of Design is an all-pervasive, 360-degree approach to the design industry. It's to create an ecosystem, something that is interconnected with a lot of other organisations and inclusive. Once out of school, students tend to run into potholes where holistic solutions and multitasking comes into question. We want to create visionaries and entrepreneurs, not one-track professionals.
How is the GSD program designed to help students learn the practicalities of design?
From a very strong foundation that deals not only with fashion but with the design world, to a comprehensive curriculum that looks into multiple aspects over and above the sphere of fashion, practicality is something we focus on from the word go.
What does design education in India lack? How are you trying to fill that gap?
While design education in India is well-equipped, I personally feel it lacks two important factors. The first being, searching for and bringing out the best in students. We have no dearth of talent in the country, it is a matter of the right guidance and exposure, which in today's day is not a bonus but an essential. The second would be discipline. To process a design, one needs to be very disciplined; from being certain about the design structure right up to marketing and selling the final outcome, there needs to be a clear process in place. The traditional Indian teaching methods were built on the foundation of discipline, and at Gurukul School of Design, we aim at reviving the basics, in order to excel.
How is the design mentorship program structured?
The design mentorship program primarily teaches students how to think in real time, and come to real solutions. How to style and build a brand, coupled with the basic understanding of how to make a design successful and what would lead to its failure. This will be incorporated at Gurukul School of Design through collaborations with industry giants who can mentor the students and help them develop these basics from the beginning, as the inputs provided will in themselves be from a cauldron of immense years of experience and design leadership in their respective fields.
How is the entrepreneurial mentorship program structured?
The entrepreneurial mentorship program will teach students how to market their ideas, work in tandem with manufacturers, managing the brand and profit making, verbal and presentation skills and idea conceptualising and communication.
What do aspiring students need to know about breaking into the fashion industry?
Apart from the fashion industry knowledge that they imbibe and the on-ground experience they earn, students inherently need to have a keen sense of what works and what doesn't. In a world of brand and slogan overdose, future designers not only need to comprehend the business of design but understand their customers. From personal experience, staying close to my brand and inhabiting the classic space with the bandhgala, can at times be questionable—but the solution lies in maintaining the equation, but at the same time customising it for the customer in the right proportion.
This article is part of our Careers in Fashion series which will get fashion enthusiasts advice, guidance and inspiration from the biggest names in the fashion industry
A sweeping new statement by the Justice Department calls religious freedom a “fundamental right of paramount importance,” placing the Trump administration squarely on the side of religious conservatives in America's culture wars.
The statement by Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions, with a long legal analysis by the department's lawyers, is intended to be guidance to the rest of the federal government on how to decide conflicts involving declarations of religious belief – for example, the recent case involving a baker who refused to make a cake for a gay couple's wedding. The Justice Department already has intervened in that case on the side of the baker.
The statement released Friday makes clear that, in Sessions' view, the benefit of the doubt should go to the person declaring a religious belief over those claiming illegal discrimination.
“Except in the narrowest circumstances, no one should be forced to choose between living out his or her faith and complying with federal law,” the statement reads.
Justice Department officials say the analysis was produced to follow up on President Trump's executive order on religious freedom in May, and they say it sets no new policies and isn't directly related to any pending legal dispute.
But the impact of the new stance became clear Friday when the administration said it would allow more employers to cite religious objections to opt out of providing no-cost birth control to women ucovered by company healthcare plans.
It expanded a religious exemption that previously applied to houses of worship, religiously affiliated nonprofit groups and closely held private companies.
“Our freedom as citizens has always been inextricably linked with our religious freedom as a people," Sessions said. "It has protected both the freedom to worship and the freedom not to believe."
In his May order, Trump instructed the IRS to avoid prosecuting churches for engaging in politics -- a law that was rarely enforced.
The new order was drafted after consultation with a broad spectrum of religious and civil rights groups, the Justice Department said.
Many of the current conflicts in the religious sphere concern civil rights for lesbians, gays and transgender people -- for instance, whether religious organizations can refuse to employ people because of their sexual identification. Federal law says that is permitted, the memo says.
Sessions, a deeply conservative former senator from Alabama, has already rolled back other gay-friendly policies.
Earlier this week he issued a memo that reverses an Obama-era policy that found that transgender people are entitled to protection against discrimination in the workplace. Sessions said the civil rights law does not mention questions of gender identity, so the legal protections don't apply.
The proposal also would remove the presumption now in the Volcker Rule that any stocks, derivatives or other investments purchased by banks that they hold for less than 60 days are proprietary trades. A bank also would be presumed to be in compliance if its daily net gains or losses from trades are less than $25 million over the previous 90 days.
The Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC) will begin its online application process for Provincial Civil Services (prelims) Examinations 2018 from 6 July, according to several media reports.
The test will be conducted on 19 August to fill 831 vacancies.
The Times of India reported a record number of 119 Sub-Divisional Magistrates and around 100 Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSPs) would be recruited in 2018 through the “Combined State Upper Subordinate Exams-2108”.
The aspirants can apply through the UPPSC's official portal: uppsc.up.nic.in
Last day for depositing the application fee is 2 August and the submission date of forms is 6 August.
According to India Today, an additional subject ‘medical' was introduced as part of the main stage by the commission.
One-third of the total marks would be deducted for every wrong question from preliminary stage of exams.
Trinidad and Tobago National Under-15 head coach Russell Latapy pointed to experience and tactical awareness, as two areas in which his charges must improve after they started their CONCACAF Under-15 Championship campaign today with a 4-0 loss to Costa Rica in Bradenton, Florida, USA.
The young Soca Warriors conceded two soft goals in the first half as miscommunication between goalkeeper Jahiem Wickham and his defence gifted Manfred Ugalde the opener in the 14th minute. And Wickham misjudged a cross from Costa Rica captain Jose Tello, which he palmed into his own goal for the second item in the 40th minute.
A close range finish by Giancarlo Castro and a penalty by Dereck Valentin—in the 44th and 59th minutes respectively—rounded off the score summary.
But, despite the scoreline, Latapy said his troops gave a decent account of themselves.
“I thought that the better team eventually won the game [but] we had a couple opportunities, especially one in the first minute, which we should have probably scored,” Latapy told the TTFA Media, “and the game would have been a different one if we were playing from the front. The difference in the both teams wasn't quality but instead tactical awareness.
“You can tell the Costa Rican players were playing at a high level and they were able to manage the game better at different stages. We are a team that is getting to that point, which is where matches like these will serve us well going forward.”
Trinidad and Tobago play again tomorrow when they face Canada while their final Group B match is against the United States on Wednesday. United States edged Canada 1-0 today.
Before the tournament, Latapy said he was very happy with the ability of his squad and today's loss did not change his mind.
“In terms of technical ability, we were right there [and] if you looked at the game, you would't think it was a 4-0 scoreline,” said Latapy. “But a lack of playing at that level affected us… Most importantly for the players is that it's a great experience and a fantastic learning curve.
“I am hoping that our players can see the difference between the two teams is that [Costa Rica] were a bit better tactically and played their positions better whereby we were still getting into a bit more individual play and holding the ball in the wrong [areas].”
Despite the daunting group, Latapy still believes the Under-15s can qualify for the knockout stage of the competition.
“We need to win the two games to get through to the knockout stages but we are going to go for it,” said the former Trinidad and Tobago football icon. “I was fairly happy with some of the things I saw. We are a much better team than we were earlier in the year but we still need the experience of playing international games in which this here is part of the process.”
Trinidad and Tobago (starting team): 1.Jahiem Wickham (GK); 2.Randy Antoine, 5.Cephas St Rose, 16.Marc Wharfe, 3.Darian Bradshaw; 13.Zachary Welch, 9.Ezekiel Kesar (captain); 7.Jean-Heim Mc Fee, 10.Josiah Edwards, 11.Jaiye Sheppard; 17.Justin Araujo-Wilson.
Substitutes: 18.Kernel La Fon (GK), 4.Antonio Chee Ting, 12.Rhowen Stewart-Williams, 6.Jabari Lee, 15.Adriel George, 8.Josiah Allen, 14.Aamal Julien.
Mahanati, upcoming biopic on legendary south Indian actress Savitri, to now reportedly release on 9 May
The upcoming biographical feature Mahanati, based on the life of legendary south Indian actress Savitri is indeed one of the most-awaited films in South India. Owing to the iconic stature of Savitri, along with the array of stars featuring in the film, Mahanati also becomes an important film in its own merit. While initially it was scheduled for a 30 March release, it has now been postponed to 9 May, suggest reports.
According to a report by The News Minute, the makers of the film have said that Mahanati is also high on special effects and the work is still in progress. Hence, it will not be possible on their part to wind up everything and get the film released in March. 9 May is what the makers have now reportedly settled for the official date of release of the film.
The film boasts of a stellar cast that includes the likes of Keerthy Suresh (who plays the titular role of Savitri), Samantha Akkineni, Shalini Pandey, Vijay Deverakonda, Prakash Raj and Dulquer Salmaan (plays Gemini Ganesan). It was also reported recently that Naga Chaitanya Akkineni is the latest addition to the film's cast; he will essay the role of his late grandfather Akkineni Nageswara Rao. There were also an inkling that Jr NTR might also feature in the film, portraying the role of his grandfather and former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao (NTR Sr).
The director of the film, Nag Ashwin, had spoken to Firstpost and had reportedly alluded to a delay in the film's release. He said, "We were supposed to come this month end. But the VFX process is taking more time than expected and we don't want to rush and compromise on the output. Therefore, this month looks quite tight.”
Mahanati is slated to release in Tamil as Nadigaiyar Thilagam and in Telugu as Mahanati.

When Anushka Sharma left Mumbai earlier this week with her family, rumours were rising if the star was headed to Italy for a roka ceremony with her longtime boyfriend Virat Kohli. Famously tight-lipped about their relationship, the duo succeeded in keeping things under wraps until news finally got out a few hours ago that the two, in fact, got married in Italy earlier today, information that has been confirmed by a source close to the actor.
Little more is known about the wedding ceremony itself other than the fact that it took place at Borgo Finocchieto, a luxury venue in Tuscany, Italy. The size of the wedding party is said to be limited only to close family members, but the couple is rumoured to also have a reception planned in Mumbai on December 21. The near-elopement from paparazzi coupled with the romantic Tuscan sun already has the makings of the perfect setting for an intimate celebrity wedding.
Given that couturier Sabyasachi Mukherjee paid a visit to the Sharma residence recently, we can assume that the actor's choice for her wedding points in the direction of his label. Between twinning on red carpets and busting moves at weddings, fans shipping the duo will finally have closure after this announcement.
30 Seconds to Mars recently stopped by the Ellen show to perform their new quasi religious/protest song “Walk On Water”, and it was really, really fucking awkward. The song is already an odd mashup of religious imagery and political references about having your fist up in the line of fire and which informs us that “the times are changing,” and for some reason, the Leto boys thought it a grand idea to perform the first half on the song sitting in the midst Ellen's audience.
After a shot showing an empty stage (Gasp—but where is the band!?!?!) the camera then does a dramatic, swooping 180-degree turn to reveal the band is, in fact, sitting in the audience (Gasp! But how?!?) amongst the housewives. From there, things digress quickly. The choir in attendance awkwardly sings along, positioned behind a group of audience members who are sitting on the stage—which, again, has zero band members on it—and, for some reason, Ellen is standing awkwardly in the choir's midst, also singing. Befitting the song's lyrical content, Jared Leto rocks both a massive beard and a poncho like the guru of some LSD soaked religious cult that lives in the parking lot of a Phish show. When the musician/actor sings lines referring to the political left and right, he literally looks to the left and right of him at ladies who seem to be experiencing a mixture of erotic pleasure and befuddlement at being so close to LSD Jesus they can touch the hem of His poncho. Ellen—famous for dancing—does not really dance, and instead does her best “white person standing in place but also kinda moving to the music with my arms awkwardly at my sides” moves. The audience and band dramatically stand up and then sit once more in unison a couple of times—really, the whole thing is a pretentious, Suicide Squad level mess that is frankly hard to watch. Behold:
“Walk On Water” is 30 Seconds to Mars' first new music since their album Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams dropped four years ago, and the band has announced the record will be accompanied by a documentary about the band directed by frontman Narcissus—er, Leto—that will feature leftover footage shot by fans for “Walk On Water's” video. Leto also recently announced plans to play the late Hugh Hefner in a biopic from Brett Ranter, another couple of men who think/thought they walk on water.
Riley Ferguson threw for 431 yards and seven touchdowns, four of them to his favorite target Anthony Miller, to lead Memphis to a 70-31 victory over Connecticut on Friday night.
Ferguson, who played just three quarters, completed 34 of 48 passes and the Tigers put up 711 yards of total offense.
The seven touchdown by Ferguson tied Paxton Lynch's school and conference record. Ferguson was 26 of 37 for 325 yards and five touchdowns in the first half alone.
Miller had 15 receptions for 224 yards for Memphis (4-1, 1-1 American Athletic Conference). His four TD catches also tied a conference record.
Ferguson and Miller connected on scores from 17, 8 and 40 yards in the first half, and the Tigers went into the break ahead 35-24. Memphis scored the first 28 points of the second half, highlighted by a 32-yard catch from Miller over a defender in the back of the end zone.
Bryant Shirreffs threw for 310 yards for UConn (1-4, 0-3) and the Huskies got 114 yards rushing and two touchdowns from Arkeel Newsome.
Doroland Dorceus had 22 carries for 122 yards for Memphis. His two rushing touchdowns and all but 23 of his yards came in the second half.
Georgia lands top prospect
Highly touted high school quarterback Justin Fields has picked Georgia. Fields is from Harrison High School in Kennesaw, Ga., and announced at a pep rally at the school Friday his nonbinding verbal commitment to the Bulldogs.
According to 247Sports' composite rankings of the major recruiting analysts, Fields is the No. 1 overall player in the country. Fields adds intrigue to No. 5 Georgia's quarterback situation. Five-star recruit Jacob Eason started last year as a freshman, but freshman Jake Fromm took over when Eason got hurt this season and has played well. All three could be on the roster by spring.
Etc.
Iowa State QB Jacob Park is taking a leave of absence for undisclosed medical reasons, the school said. He has thrown for 1,181 yards, nine touchdowns and five interceptions this season. … Mississippi said it's replacing Rebel the Bear as its mascot with the Landshark. ...
Georgia junior linebacker Natrez Patrick could face a four-game suspension after his second arrest on marijuana charges in three years. Patrick is tied for third on the team with 17 tackles. ... Freshman reserves Zaire Webb and Anthony White Jr. were dismissed from Washington State's team after they were arrested for allegedly stealing from a store.
New York:The New Yorker magazine said on Monday that it had fired Ryan Lizza, the star reporter known for an interview that led to White House aide Anthony Scaramucci's termination, over what it called "improper sexual conduct."
The prestigious magazine offered no details on the allegations against Lizza, 43, the latest media figure to face consequences amid a wave of harassment allegations surfacing in recent weeks.
"The New Yorker recently learned that Ryan Lizza engaged in what we believe was improper sexual conduct," the magazine said in a statement. "We have reviewed the matter and, as a result, have severed ties with Lizza. Due to a request for privacy, we are not commenting further."
In a statement to US media, Lizza said the firing was made "hastily and without a full investigation of the relevant facts," which he said involved a woman he was dating. "I am dismayed that The New Yorker has decided to characterise a respectful relationship with a woman I dated as somehow inappropriate," Lizza was quoted as saying.
"The New Yorker was unable to cite any company policy that was violated."
The law firm representing Lizza's accuser — who wishes to remain anonymous -- issued a statement of its own, pushing back at his version of events and saying that "in no way did Mr Lizza's misconduct constitute a 'respectful relationship' as he has now tried to characterise it."
"Our client reported Mr Lizza's actions to ensure that he would be held accountable and in the hope that by coming forward she would help other potential victims," the statement added.
CNN, where Lizza has been a contributor, said the writer would not appear on the news channel "while we look into this matter."
Earlier in 2017, Lizza's report from an interview with Scaramucci ended the brief White House career of the longtime Wall Street banker. The article stemmed from an expletive-laden interview with the former hedge fund manager who lasted just 10 days in the White House.
A 23-year-old man who was "out for blood" when he attempted to detonate what he believed was an explosives-laden van outside an Oklahoma bank in a plot similar to the deadly 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building is expected to be formally charged Monday, authorities said.
During a meeting with undercover FBI agents in June, Jerry Drake Varnell of Sayre, Oklahoma, said he held "III% ideology" and wanted "to start the next revolution," a reference to the "Three Percenters" patriot movement — begun in 2008, galvanized by President Barack Obama's election — and that has rallied against gun control efforts and pledges resistance to the federal government over the infringement of constitutional rights.
What's in season: One of the oldest beans to come out of the New World, lima beans have a buttery, almost meaty texture with a plump, kidney-like shape. The beans, named after Lima, Peru, range from large, pale green Fordhook to vivid burgundy-and-white Christmas, and are generally in season through the fall months, until the first frosts hit. Most beans are sold in their pods, and while the results are well worth the work, some farmers thankfully sell the beans already shucked.
Succotash and more: 12 great recipes for lima beans >>
What to cook: Blanch the beans before tossing with salads, or think about adding them to cold-weather staples such as minestrone or other stews. Lima beans make a great side, sautéed and tossed with fresh herbs, gently simmered with heavy cream and cheese, or slowly baked with bacon and tomatoes. And the beans are one of the classic components in succotash, a Southern favorite that can combine limas and corn with sweet bell peppers and okra.
What's on the horizon: There are a number of varieties of persimmons, but the vibrant orange fruit can neatly be divided into two families: tomato-shaped Fuyus and acorn-shaped Hachiyas. The fruit, available from fall through the winter months, are showing up now.

Junior four-star wing Patrick McCaffery, ranked No. 30 overall in the ESPN 60, made a verbal commitment to the Iowa Hawkeyes, where his father, Fran McCaffery, is the head coach. As a sophomore, Patrick was a big part of a state championship team at Iowa City West High School. Here's a look at what he'll bring to the Hawkeyes after he graduates in 2019.
ANKARA, Turkey – Turkey's prime minister on Tuesday called on the opposition to respect the result of a referendum that will give sweeping new powers to the office of the president.
Binali Yildirim made the call during an address to legislators from his ruling party, as the country's main opposition party prepared to apply to the country's highest electoral board to seek an annulation of Sunday's vote which gave President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan‘s “yes” camp a narrow win.
The Republican People's Party, or CHP, called for the vote on the referendum to be annulled citing a series of irregularities, particularly an electoral board decision to accept ballots that didn't bear official stamps, as required by Turkish law.

Monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, who also listed numerous irregularities, said the move undermined important election safeguards, drawing a harsh rebuke from Erdoğan.
“Efforts to cast a shadow on the result of the vote by spreading rumours of fraud are futile and in vain,” Yildirim said. “The will of the people was freely reflected into the ballot boxes and this business is over. Everyone and all sections – and the main opposition party in particular- must show respect. It is wrong to speak after the people have spoken.”
The vote allows Erdoğan, who has ruled Turkey first as prime minister and now as president since 2003, to fulfil his long-held ambition for a presidency with executive powers.

The referendum approves 18 constitutional amendments that allow the president to appoint ministers, senior government officials and to hold sway over who sits in Turkey's highest judicial body, as well as to issue decrees and declare states of emergency.
The new system takes effect at the next election, currently slated for November 2019. Other changes are to be implemented sooner, including scrapping a requirement that the president not be a member of any political party. This would allow Erdoğan to rejoin the governing AK Party he co-founded, or to lead it.

On Tuesday, Yildirim said Erdoğan would be invited to join the party as soon as the official results are declared.
“We will invite our founding chairman to our party and we will feel a huge elation to see him among us,” he said.
Meanwhile, OSCE monitors were seen entering the Supreme Electoral Board headquarters. Tana de Zulueta, head of the observer mission, told reporters that the group had paid a courtesy call and held a “cordial” meeting with board members.

Asked to comment about Erdoğan's rebuke, de Zulueta said: “I don't have an opinion, we are invited by the Turkish authorities to observe. We share our report and we completed our mandate.”
In Istanbul, hundreds of “no” supporters demonstrated in the streets on Monday, chanting “thief, murderer, Erdoğan” and banging pots and pans.
President Donald Trump, meanwhile, ignored the concerns about voting irregularities and congratulated Erdoğan on his referendum victory. The two leaders also discussed Turkey's support of the U.S. response to a Syrian chemical weapon attack and efforts to counter the Islamic State group, according to the White House statement on their phone call Monday.
A historic downtown Halifax wall was peppered with graffiti over the weekend with chalk writing that boasted a message of white supremacy.
The scrawled words outraged passersby like Kelsey Butt.
“We had been driving down Brunswick [Street] and one passenger noticed it said ‘praise KKK' on the wall,” Butt said.
The messages were spread across the entirety of the Brunswick Street wall, according to Butt, who tried contacting the city and Parks Canada to have the words removed.
“There were some messages about the Proud Boys, like ‘God Bless the Proud Boys.' Just like the alt-right movement, free speech was a big thing on the [graffiti],” Butt said.
The Proud Boys are a white nationalist men's movement.
Five members of the group interrupted an Indigenous ceremony on Canada Day in Halifax.
The men were also members of the Canadian Armed Forces. Their actions were condemned by military officials and were recently the subject of a military investigation.
WATCH: The interruption of an Indigenous protest by Canadian Armed Forces members representing the “Proud Boys” organization has many wondering who the “Proud Boys” are and what their presence means in Canada. Dave Squires has more on that story.
Halifax Regional Police say the graffiti incident was filed by an officer.
“The writings [chalk messages] were logged by a patrol member that was walking by. She logged a call and requested our Forensic Identification Unit come and document the writings,” said Const. Dianne Penfound with the Halifax Regional Police.
Penfound said the patrol member logged the incident on Friday night and the incident is being investigated.
The messages were still visible on the wall by Sunday, prompting Butt to contact the city and Parks Canada to report the graffiti.
Both organizations confirmed to Global News that the complaints were made.

The city sent members of Transportation and Public Works to wash off the chalk messages.
“I'm happy it's off the wall, but I think it's important that people know [racism] does exist here and you can't turn a blind eye to it,” Butt said.
Penfound says its important for these incidents to be reported to police as soon as they're noticed.
“We would ask that people call as soon as possible because we want to be able to document what is there, and in this case I believe the writings were in chalk, so time is of the essence,” she said.

Thousands of men are sweating right now, wondering if they got away with it or "is she going to report me?" I don't want to sound like I am siding with these men but just as bullying is not new so has this behavior existed in men for years.
What about this song: “Your lips tell me no but there's yes, yes in your eyes"? We cannot blame everything on men; sometimes we women play a small role.
There is a reason for all human behavior and a solution to every problem; we just need to ask why. The why might vary from man to man but the missing ingredient will end up being a lack of self-worth and feelings of insecurity.
Why is my favorite word. When you get to the why of any situation, you can solve it. Understanding the reason behind any problem you can come up with a solution.
Writer Emily Esfahani Smith says there's an emptiness gnawing at people and this is not a lack of happiness but a lack of having meaning in our lives.
Martin Seligman, a renowned psychologist, says meaning comes from belonging to and serving something beyond yourself and from developing the best within you. We need encouragement to find that something that will give us meaning to our lives.
OTHER COLUMNS BY ELIZABETH SCHADRACK
Meaning comes in many forms.
Volunteering or learning to do just about anything will bring meaning to your life. Caring for an animal brings meaning to many people. Nothing is more meaningful than being a parent, raising a child you can be proud of. Remember Bill Russell's comment: "There is no such thing as other people's children."
We need to ask ourselves: "Who am I?" "Who do I want to be?" "What is my problem?" Could it be that Dale Wimbrow felt the need to write "The Guy in the Glass" in 1934 to solve this problem then?
“When you get what you want in your struggle for self
And the world makes you king for a day,
Just go to the mirror and look at yourself,
And see what that man has to say.
For it isn't your father or mother or wife
Whose judgment upon you must pass,
The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life
Is the one staring back from the glass.
Some people might think you're a straight-shooting' chum
And call you a wonderful guy,
But the man in the glass says you're only a bum,
If you can't look him straight in the eye.
He's the fellow to please, never mind all the rest,
For he's with you clear up to the end.
And you've passed your most dangerous, difficult test
If the guy in the glass is your friend.
You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years,
And get pats on the back as you pass.
But your final reward will be heartaches and tears
If you've cheated the man in the glass.”
Deepak Chopra recommends we ask ourselves, “Is this decision I am about to make going to bring happiness to me and those around me?"
If not, don't do it.
My message to husbands and fathers would be, don't do or say anything that would destroy your marriage or your image in the eyes of your family.

PHILADELPHIA -- A federal judge in Philadelphia heard arguments Wednesday in the NFL's request for a special investigator to look into what the league says are fraudulent claims in a $1 billion concussion settlement.
The league last month cited an independent study that it said found that more than 400 claims had been recommended for denial based on evidence of fraud by attorneys, doctors and former players.
Plaintiffs' lawyers contend the league is not awarding settlement funds fast enough, and at least two attorneys Wednesday said the investigator is unnecessary.
The league said attempts to scam the system are responsible for delays.
The NFL has asked that the investigator be granted subpoena power and the ability to compel testimony to determine whether more punitive actions are necessary upon fraud findings.
Feb 2 (Reuters) - Prices of germanium extended their rally in recent weeks, touching fresh multi-year peaks, after major refiner Teck Resources declared partial force majeure and amid persistent concerns about Chinese supply, traders in Europe and U.S. said.
Prices of germanium, which is used in the semiconductor industry, rose in mid-December to their highest since November 2015 due to declining supplies from the world's top supplier China and rising demand from industrial users.
Another form of the element, germanium dioxide GERM-DIOX-LON, was trading in Europe at $1,130 per kg, having nearly doubled since January 2017, when an oversupplied market pushed prices to 11-year lows.
Germanium dioxide, used in specialty glass for wide-angle camera lenses, has surged more than 22 percent in two weeks.
Teck Resources said on Thursday it had declared partial force majeure on sales of germanium from its refinery in Trail, British Columbia, due to equipment issues related to an operating disruption at one of the fuming furnaces this month.
Germanium dioxide supplies were hit particularly hard since Teck is a key supplier, listing on its website three types of germanium dioxide among the grades it supplies.
Teck, which says it is one of the world's largest integrated germanium producers, did not give a timeline for lifting the force majeure.
“I have been through two other cycles where new demand brought prices higher ... This is the first time lack of supply is causing higher prices,” a U.S. based trader said.
“End-users coming back to buy for the first quarter are hit with sticker-shock when they hear the new prices. But, in reality there is nothing on the market to buy,” the trader said.
Traders in the United States and Europe also attributed rising prices to an uptick in demand from manufacturers of military equipment and optic fibres.
Prices of germanium in Europe GERM-LON, standing at $1,550 per kg, have more than doubled since January 2017 and have gained 7 percent in the past two weeks.
Germanium metal is used as a semiconductor in transistors and other electronic devices, in optic fibre networks and in infrared night vision systems for military use.
A recent report from Jane‘s, released by IHS Markit, said global defence spending will grow for the fifth consecutive year in 2018, reaching $1.67 trillion and overtaking the previous post-Cold War record of $1.63 trillion seen in 2010.
China produced more than 70 percent of the 155,000 tonnes of total refined germanium production in 2016, U.S. Geological Survey data showed.
Germanium prices hit a record high $2,000 per kg in 2014, but prices crashed after China's Fanya Metal Exchange was closed in 2015. The offloading of Fanya's germanium stocks started the trend of lower prices, which started to reverse in January 2017.

ABC's reboot of “Roseanne” was one of the most expensive programs for advertisers last season. Had the show continued, it might have grown even more costly – for the network airing it.
ABC's decision to cancel the program in the wake of an offensive tweet from its star comes as the network is, like CBS, Fox, NBC and the rest, in the midst of early “upfront” talks with advertisers. On May 15, at a presentation held to unveil its fall schedule to Madison Avenue, ABC couldn't stop talking about “Roseanne.” “If anyone came to play a drinking game for how many times we mention ‘Roseanne,' you're welcome,” said Ben Sherwood, president of the Disney/ABC Television Group, in front of an audience of dozens of media buyers and blue-chip advertisers.
Keeping the show on the schedule, however, could have generated the wrong type of chatter at a time when ABC is competing for its share of the $8.69 billion to $9.55 billion Madison Avenue lavished on primetime broadcast TV last year. In an era when consumers have become more polarized by politics and cultural issues, advertisers have grown skittish about aligning their commercials with controversy. Fox News Channel recently grappled with the fallout from an advertiser defection from its 10 p.m. program, “The Ingraham Angle,” for example, after host Laura Ingraham took a swipe at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student David Hogg, one of the students who have spoken out about gun control prominently since a February 14th shooting incident at that Parkland, Florida, school left 17 people dead.
“The great appeal of the show was to brands targeting middle America,” noted Ira Berger, who supervises ad buying on broadcast and cable for The Richards Group, an independent Dallas ad agency. He says he expects the cancellation “to hurt ABC to a degree.” Another media buying executive noted that ratings for “Roseanne” had begun to drop after the reboot's first few episodes. Viewership for the finale in particular was not impressive, this buyer said. “Once that tweet went out, ABC had not choice,” said the executive. “The impact to the network depends on what they put in there.”
“Roseanne” had recently commanded serious ad coin. Last year, advertisers were paying an average of $176,411 for a 30-second ad in the series, according to Variety's annual survey of primetime ad prices – ,making the program TV's highest priced rookie comedy. Among new programs, only ABC's revival of “American Idol” was pricier. In April, “Roseanne” was TV's fourth most-expensive comedy, according to Standard Media Index, a tracker of ad costs and spending, and ABC's priciest sitcom. Advertisers in April were paying an average of $167,159. The series generated $45 million in the most recent TV season, according to Kantar Media.
This wouldn't mark the first time a network changed the plans it unveiled to Madison Avenue. Indeed, ABC has over the years pulled some massive switcheroos. In July of 2010, about a month after wrapping upfront sales, ABC announced its then-entertainment chief, Steve McPherson, was leaving – meaning that the executive who built the programming lineup advertisers bought was no longer overseeing it. And in May of 2003, just days after trotting cast members of “The Practice” before an audience of advertisers, ABC announced it would retool the show – and jettison stalwarts of the drama such as Dylan McDermott and Lara Flynn Boyle.

Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina prevailed in a rematch of the Wimbledon semifinals as they easily defeated the experienced veteran pairing of Anna-Lena Gronefeld and Kveta Peschke in the final, storming to their second consecutive Rogers Cup title having triumphed in two different cities, Montreal and now Toronto.
Makarova/Vesnina whitewashes their opponents
The Russian pairing made the perfect start to the match as they managed to expose the loopholes in the baseline game of the German-Czech pairing, and was bossing the net as they broke serve in the opening game with some aggressive play. With some powerful serves by Vesnina, the Wimbledon champions easily consolidated their break for a 2-0 lead.

Gronefeld looked shaky on her serve as the veteran pairing started to commit numerous unforced errors, allowing their higher-ranked opponents to lead by a double break. Once again, they held their serves without a hitch as Makarova was very solid in her serving, with Vesnina able to put away the follow-up shots.
Gronefeld and Peschke were twice a point away from getting on the scoreboard in the fifth game but unforced errors once again proved to be costly as Makarova and Vesnina continued to stroll through the first set, opening up a huge 5-0 lead to be just a game away from winning the set. Serving for the bagel, Vesnina showed no signs of nerves despite being the one serving as Makarova produced a clinical net game to hold serve to love, sealing the incredible bagel in just a mere 21 minutes.

Makarova/Vesnina clinches the win
The nightmare start for Gronefeld and Peschke continued in the second set as an on-court coaching session did not help, with Makarova and Vesnina still being composed and sharp in their play. The Russian pairing broke serve in the opening game, before winning a ninth consecutive point in their service games to consolidate the break.
Regaining some confidence, Gronefeld and Peschke finally got themselves onto the scoreboard with a narrow hold of service as they lessened the deficit to just one game, in hope of a miraculous comeback as they gained some momentum. From there, the Olympics champion did not play as well as they did in the first set, and almost gave their opponents the golden opportunity to break straight back in the sixth game as they were forced to seal the game on a deciding point.

However, it was the WTA Finals champion themselves who earned three break points in the next game but failed to convert any of them as they allowed the German-Czech pairing to come back from the brink and keep themselves in the hunt for the trophy. Unexpectedly, Gronefeld and Peschke stepped up the level of their play as they won a seventh straight point to break back out of nowhere, leveling the scores all of a sudden.
Nevertheless, with some inspired net play from Makarova, the Russians regained their lead and earned the golden opportunity to serve out the win. Overcoming some wobbles, Makarova and Vesnina clinched their 10th consecutive win as they successfully served out the win, claiming the dominant win in just 62 minutes.

Makarova and Vesnina very pleased with their win
“We played very good today, and they're tough opponents, so we came in with all of our focus and energy. We wanted to play aggressively and it worked out, but they started to play better in the second set, pushing us to a lot of deciding points. We're so happy to win here for a second time.” Makarova mentioned in an interview with WTA Insider, and she sounded very delighted with the triumph in Toronto. Winning 10 straight matches and losing just a mere four games in their two previous finals, it has truly been an incredible feat for the Russians.
Vesnina added, “We were really focusing on our game, but we didn't expect it to be 6-0, 2-0 again, because they're a really solid team. Kveta was No.1 in doubles, winning a Grand Slam, and Anna-Lena is really solid in doubles, as well. It was very important to keep our level up on all those deciding points. We're really happy and proud with the way we handled the pressure and the way we played this week in Toronto.” The pairing was visibly pleased with their performance, having not lost a set in their path to the title.

Speaking about their triumphs in both Montreal and Toronto, Makarova proclaimed that winning in two different cities were very tough, especially with the different conditions and the different stadiums. The Russian repeatedly mentioned that she enjoys coming back to the Rogers Cup, and she would definitely love this tournament especially after winning the doubles title twice.
Both pairings would now proceed to the Western and Southern Open in hope for yet another great run.
Oscars 2018: With Get Out bagging multiple nominations, has the Academy stopped overlooking the horror genre?
With the bevy of Oscar nominations that Jordan Peele's Get Out has notched up, the horror genre might finally get its moment in the sun.
Peele's directorial debut joins the league of a handful of great horror films (depending on how fluid your definition of ‘horror' is), such as Alfred Hitchcock's Suspicion, Spellbound, Psycho, George Cukor's Gaslight, William Friedkin's The Exorcist and M Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense that got a Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards.
If you Get Out manages to win the award, it would be only the second in the genre to win after Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs. Irrespective, Peele's sensational ‘social horror' is already being counted amongst classics such as Rosemary's Baby and Invasion of the Body Snatchers that got under the skin without attempting to be scary.
Horror is perhaps the one genre that has been long ignored by the Academy Awards. One of the reasons for this could be that since its early days, the genre had been associated with talents that were best recognized as the second rung. Of course, one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, Alfred Hitchcock's mainstay was the horror/thriller genre and while he was much respected by audiences and critics, he never won the so-called prestigious awards. Hitchcock's scorn can be gauged from his acceptance speech when he was conferred with the Irving G Thalberg Memorial Award at the 40th Academy Awards in 1967. Bob Hope introduced the master of suspense, Robert Wise waxed eloquent about Hitch's cinematic achievements but when presented the award, all that Hitchcock said was a terse ‘Thank you.'
Peele is bound to make history if he wins any of the three awards – Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay – he is in the running for. Peele is just the fifth African-American filmmaker to get a Best Director nomination and the third person after Warren Beatty and James L Brooks to get these three nominations with his debut. Beatty and Brooks' directorial debuts Heaven Can Wait and Terms of Endearment respectively got them the same nominations. While Beatty went empty handed, Brooks won all three in 1984.
In addition to making a cool $245 million on a budget of just $45 million, Get Out has managed to capture the imagination of viewers across the world. In some ways, the film where a black photographer, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), accompanies his white girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams), to her parents' country home and a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he could never have imagined, has also come to be seen as a great social commentary tool. Dealing with racism in a way that has rarely been depicted, Get Out found its inspiration in The Stepford Wives (1975) but Peele traded the 1970s' satirical take for a much deeper, and at times funny but also scary, and thought-provoking interpretation. In his review of the film, The Guardian's Lanre Bakare noted what Get Out did so well was to show how, however unintentionally, the good people can make life so hard and uncomfortable for black people and exposed “a liberal ignorance and hubris that has been allowed to fester.”
More than anything else, Get Out's story-telling elements have also revealed a great new device for future filmmakers to use the horror genre as a relevant social commentary tool. Peele has already mentioned that he has four more films planned over the next decade that deal with similar ‘social demons.'
A few decades ago, comedy or satire would have been the go-to themes to make a strong statement. But the era that we live in has perhaps changed that. Nothing shocks us anymore and yet everything evokes a passionate response. Be it the rape of an eight-month-old baby girl in India or the child sex abuse scandal in Rotherham, South Yorkshire where the sexual exploitation of hundreds of young white girls by Asian grooming gangs went on under the noses of authorities for decades from the late 1980s until the 2010s, or the unimaginable and the unending horror of Yazidi women who were raped by the believers of the Islamic State in Northern Iraq or the shooting of African-American teenagers in the United States; we respond but somewhere move on to the ‘next' thing. It is here that the audacity of mixing horror with social realities allows a subtlety to not only make a great statement but also let it play in one's mind long after the film is over, something that Get Out manages to do well.
Even in an Indian context, satire has been slowly replaced in popular films that comment on the times. In the mid-1980s, a Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron, with its bizarre narrative, would perhaps be the most poignant statement on what was happening around. Considering the bleak reality of the period, which say, was highlighted by an Aakrosh or an Ardh Satya, but the eccentricity of Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron stood out and more so with the passage of time. Now, it is a Manorama Six Feet Under or a Shanghai that convey the same emotion better. Is the efficacy of a serious comment on a social evil of sorts better with horror (NH 8) as opposed to comedy (2 States)?
For one, horror allows you to do what you feel like more easily or without any logic as opposed to comedy or drama. No matter what the reality of the social comment or observation, horror makes it comfortable enough depicted in a Get Out (in a way, at least) to talk about things one would usually shy away from.

ANKARA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Turkey will introduce incentives and tax cuts in manufacturing and export industries, research and development, innovation and design to boost economic activity and increase savings, the finance minister said.
Incentives presented to parliament on Friday included tax cuts for new employment and new machinery equipment purchases for companies, as well as reduced consumption tax on purchases of new cars by people whose vehicles are more than 16 years old.
“The measures we are taking are introducing comprehensive and strong incentive mechanisms to boost employment, economic activity and savings,” Finance Minister Naci Agbal was quoted as saying in the bill seen by Reuters.
Total automobile sales in 2018 are expected to be between 925,000 and 975,000, it also said. More than a third of the total 22.2 million cars in Turkey are older than 16 years, sector analysts say.
Turkey's first nuclear power plant Akkuyu, being built by Russia's Rosatom, will also benefit from the incentives, Agbal said. The second nuclear plant Sinop, to be constructed by a Japanese consortium, will also be included. (Reporting by Nevzat Devranoglu; Writing by Ece Toksabay; Editing by Dominic Evans)
CARACAS/LIMA (Reuters) - After months of attacking Venezuela's unpopular President Nicolas Maduro, Latin America came out strongly against U.S. threats of military action against the crisis-hit nation. U.S. President Donald Trump's surprise comments on Friday may bring the beleaguered Maduro some respite in the region, just as Venezuela was on verge of becoming a pariah over its recent installation of a legislative superbody, widely condemned as a power grab by the ruling Socialists.
Following Trump's assertion that military intervention in Venezuela was an option, Maduro's critics are caught between backing the idea of a foreign invasion of Venezuela or supporting a president they call a dictator.
The sudden escalation of Washington's response to Venezuela's crisis preceded U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's trip to the region beginning Sunday. He is set to visit Colombia, Argentina, Chile, and Panama.
Trump did not specify what type of options he had in mind. Venezuela's Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino on Friday disparaged Trump's warning as "craziness" and Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said on Saturday Venezuela rejected "hostile" threats, calling on Latin America to unite against Washington. "We want to express gratitude for all the expressions ofsolidarity and rejection of the use of force from governments around the world, including Latin America," said Arreaza, in a short speech on Saturday. "Some of these countries have recently taken positions absolutely contrary to our sovereignty and independence but still have rejected the declarations of the U.S. president." It was one of Maduro's fiercest critics, Peru, that led the charge in criticizing Trump's threat, saying it was against United Nations principles. Mexico and Colombia joined in with statements of their own.
Regional alliance Mercosur added that it rejected the use of force against Venezuela, despite having indefinitely suspended the country last week amid international condemnation of Maduro's new, all-powerful "constituent Assembly". After four months of deadly protests against his government, Maduro says the assembly is Venezuela's only hope of obtaining peace by locking in the socialist policies of his mentor and predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez. Critics say the assembly is a bald maneuver by Maduro to cling to power as his popularity slumps under the weight of the country's economic crisis.
Peru expelled Venezuela's ambassador in Lima on Friday, but that did not stop it from criticizing Trump's threat. "All foreign or domestic threats to resort to force undermine the goal of reinstating democratic governance in Venezuela, as well as the principles enshrined in the U.N. charter," said Peru's Foreign Minister Ricardo Luna. Peru under President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski had taken the toughest stance yet toward Venezuela's socialist government, and has openly called Maduro a "dictator".

RESCHEDULED ELECTION
The new legislative superbody, which made waves last weekend by firing a dissident chief prosecutor, took new action on Saturday on the country's election timetable. It unanimously passed a resolution to move the country's Dec. 10 governors' election up to October.
Assembly members said the decision was made in part because the election had been delayed due to "opposition-led violence." More than 120 people have died in unrest and anti-government protests since April.
The National Electoral Council (CNE) was asked by the assembly to set the exact date for the governors' election.
Venezuela is undergoing a crisis in which millions are suffering from food and medicine shortages and high inflation.
The ruling Socialist Party has for years accused the United States of plotting an invasion as a way of controlling its oil reserves, the world's largest, through a military intervention similar to the Iraq war. Previous U.S. administrations had brushed this off as politicized rhetoric meant to distract from Venezuela's domestic problems. Under former President Barack Obama, the State Department in 2015 made quiet diplomatic overtures that led to several high-level meetings. The effort ultimately foundered as Maduro hardened his stance against opposition critics. Venezuela's Information Minister Vladimir Villegas on Saturday tweeted a picture of the Statue of Liberty holding a machine gun instead of a torch, and a link to an article describing, "A Chronology of U.S. 'Military Options' in Latam and the Caribbean."
Ursula HYZY - The haunting silhouette of "Battleship Island" rises up from the sea, an abandoned testament to what was once the most densely populated city on earth.
Thousands of men, women and children lived and worked on the island, harvesting undersea coal mines that powered Japan's rapid industrial rise from the late 19th century.
But over the years, it made less and less economic sense and in 1974 operator Mitsubishi Mining abandoned the site, just off the coast of Nagasaki.
Known in Japanese as Gunkanjima, it was the villain's lair in the 2012 Bond film Skyfall and won UNESCO heritage status three years later, in 2015. But not everyone is happy about the attention being given to the sea-wall encircled island, a popular tourist destination whose shape resembles a naval destroyer.
The former city's crumbling concrete walls, smashed windows and rusty iron support bars harbour a dark secret - Chinese and Korean workers were once forced to work here, slaves to their colonial master Japan.
"Gunkanjima is an evil place," said Zhang Shan, vice president of the Chinese Forced Labour Association. "(UNESCO status) was a desecration and a shock for the victims."
It holds different memories for people like Minoru Kinoshita, 63, who was born on the island. "I've come here often and every time I see that my hometown is falling into an increasing state of decay," he said.
Until the age of 13, the 6.3 hectare (16 acre) island - packed with a school, swimming pool, open-air market, a hospital, small prison, and rooftop vegetable gardens - was the only home that Kinoshita had ever known.
Kinoshita, whose father was the local movie theatre projectionist, remembers a magical place for kids, a dense labyrinth of buildings perfects for playing hide and seek.
Inside, four or more people lived together in tiny tatami-mat rooms. Residents boarded up windows when violent typhoons lashed the island.
Battleship Island's population peaked at nearly 5,300 around 1960. It was an offshore version of Europe's once-booming mining towns. And like its overseas counterparts, the work was anything but pleasant. The mines operated 24 hours a day in rolling eight-hour shifts.
Up to 1,000 metres below sea level, men toiled in cramped and stifling spaces where they had to defecate into small holes that they dug themselves.
"The air was thick with humidity. It was sticky and the coal dust mixed with our sweat so we were black from head to toe," said Tomoji Kobata, a 79-year-old who worked on the island for about a year and a half during the early sixties.
More than 200 workers died in accidents over the years. Others suffered from silicosis, a work-related lung disease. Some were not there by choice.
Japan brutally occupied the Korean peninsula and parts of China at different times in the first half of the 20th century, and sometimes used their workers as slave labour in the years leading up to and during World War II.
The Chinese forced labour association protested to UNESCO over the heritage status, but got no reply, Zhang said.
Reliable figures on the number of forced labourers are hard to come by. Mitsubishi Materials, a descendant of the original operator, has said it is going to place a memorial at some of its former mining sites to honour forced labourers.
The company has awarded nine former Chinese labourers forced to work at other locations about 100,000 yuan ($14,500) each. A couple of other settlements are underway.
In 2015, Tokyo said it would take steps to ensure visitors understand that many Koreans and others were brought to the island and forced to work under "very harsh conditions".
Tourist brochures mention their plight, and guides remind visitors that it was not only Japanese who toiled below ground and sometimes died.
Former resident Kinoshita hopes UNESCO status will mean more funds to restore the dilapidated buildings, and keep alive memories of the day in 1966 when his family bid the island a final farewell.
"When we got on the boat to leave, I saw my friends waving a banner with my name on it," he remembered. "There was also a message: 'Never forget our island!'"

ISLAMABAD, Dec 11 (APP):Minister of State for Information, Broadcasting, National History and Literary Heritage has said that during the last 35 years the scourge of terrorism had damaged Pakistani Culture, Heritage and Film Industry like a termite.
She was addressing the inaugural ceremony of the seven-day Iranian film festival here today jointly organized by the Pakistan Council of the Arts and the Cultural Wing of the Iranian Embassy.
Marriyum observed that during the last four and half years the government through an effective strategy, in line with the vision of the former prime minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, had broken the back of the terrorists and incidents of terrorism had been considerably reduced.
She said that the armed forces of Pakistan and the people had rendered unparalleled sacrifices to quell terrorism and the journey was still on and the people now had to achieve success in the war of perception. The minister said that due to the peaceful conditions international sports, festivals and other international activities had been revived. She said that the visit of international cricket and football teams was a ranting testimony of peaceful conditions in the country.
She informed the audience that the former Prime Minister had announced a package of concessions for the revival of the film Industry adding that films could play an effective role in projecting positive identity and image of the country at the international level. The minister said that the establishment of a Film Directorate was also being contemplated.
She said that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting was making strenuous efforts to revive the film industry and the package that the former prime minister announced for the revival of the film industry included many concessions and tax rebates on the production of films. The minister proposed that a similar festival of Pakistani movies should also be held in Iran.
The minister observed that during the sixties and seventies Pakistan had a thriving film industry but the scourge of terrorism had almost destroyed the culture, heritage and film industry of the country.
She thanked the Iranian government for holding the film festival and also directed DG PNCA to dedicate at least two days for the students of the colleges and universities of the twin cities whenever such cultural activities or film festivals of the friendly countries were held at the PNCA so that the youth who constituted 65% of the population could also know about their culture. The minister observed that the Iranian film Industry had become a popular and Oscar winning entity in a very short span of time. The Iranian films were depicting glimpses of the culture of the country and its family values, she added.
The Iranian ambassador to Pakistan Mehdi Hunermand speaking on the occasion said that holding of the Iranian film festival in Pakistan was an honour for Iran and the promotion of the Iranian films was tantamount to preservation of the Iranian culture and values. He said that Iran was keen to promote and strengthen its cultural ties with Pakistan and the Iranian film festival would promote understanding of the Iranian culture.
DG PNCA Jamal Shah informed the audience that the Iranian film festival would continue for seven days and during the first two days Iranian films would be screened at the PNCA. He said that Iran was among the important film making countries of the world and pointed out that the central theme of the Iranian movies pertained to protecting the society against use of drugs, corruption and social evils.
He said that those movies were having a very positive impact on the Iranian society. Director and producer of Pakistani films Ijaz Gul said that the screening of Iranian film in Pakistan was a welcome step as it would make the cultural exchanges between the two countries more effective.
The minister of state along with the Iranian ambassador inaugurated the film festival by lighting candles and cutting a cake.
Despite both teams' predictions that play would feature tighter checking in response to the wide-open and sometimes sloppy play in Game 1, the early action Wednesday featured several scoring chances. Vegas cashed one in at 7:58 with a snipe by James Neal from the left circle. It was an extraordinary shot but he had benefited from a bit of luck before that, when defenseman Dmitry Orlov tried to bat down a pass that had been flipped ahead to Neal but instead knocked it right to the Vegas winger. Former Duck Luca Sbisa and Colin Miller got the assists on Neal's fifth postseason goal.
Manchester: Jose Mourinho is using illustrious predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson as inspiration to turn the balance in power from Premier League champions-elect Manchester City to his Manchester United side next season.
For the first time on Friday, Mourinho all but conceded this season's title to Pep Guardiola's side after United's loss at Tottenham in midweek allowed City to open up a 15-point gap at the top.
City are well on course to set a new record for a title-winning points margin - currently held by Ferguson's United team in 1999/2000 that won the league by 18 points - and have left Mourinho confessing that his side is simply playing to be "first of the last" over the remainder of the season.
But Mourinho, who won three Premier League titles in two spells as Chelsea manager, has enjoyed a successful start to 2018 himself, stealing Alexis Sanchez away from City after he left Arsenal and also extending his own contract to 2020.
"I always remember when Sir Alex said in 2005-06 when we won the second title with Chelsea, 'we need to improve a lot because they have raised the bar to such a level. They won two titles in a row,'" said Mourinho.
"The second title was easier than the first and then the biggest manager in the Premier League said Man United needed to improve a lot. That was the click for the improvement of the team."
And Mourinho wants United's improvement to begin with the visit of Huddersfield on Saturday as the Red Devils seek to bounce back and ensure a top-four finish.
"In 06-07 Man United won the title back. It has to be like that. That is why every match until the end of the season is an important match for us.
"It is not just about the points and finishing in the top four, which is important. Try to finish second. Try to play the best we can and improve the players individually the best we can and be the best possible team at the end of the season.
"Then we must try to start next season in a good way like we did this season, but try to be consistent and try not to lose points like we did this season in some matches where we shouldn't."
No problem with Pogba
Meanwhile, Mourinho has played down any suggestion that he was unhappy with his club's record signing Paul Pogba during the midweek defeat at Tottenham, with the United manager substituting the French international after barely an hour.
The coach was also seen in animated discussion with his star, although Mourinho insisted Pogba's removal was purely a tactical decision.
"In the second-half I decided to make a change and bring (Marouane) Fellaini with different qualities than him, to try to be stronger in midfield with Fellaini and (Nemanja) Matic because I wanted Alexis to play as a second striker with (Romelu) Lukaku.
"It was just a tactical decision but I lost Fellaini too after a few minutes.
"Paul is a young player, below 25, of course, he has some things to improve. But it is not Paul, it is every player. Every player has a chance to improve until the end of his career, especially the ones below 26, 27. They always have areas to improve."
Fellaini's injury at Wembley could not have come at a worrying time for the Belgian international, who is out of contract with United this summer and has stalled on signing a new contract at Old Trafford.
"I told him yesterday, sign the contract and shut up," joked Mourinho.
"I told him, don't gamble too much. Sign the contract before you know the extent of the injury."
Mourinho has yet to reveal the full extent of Fellaini's injury although the United manager expects him to be absent for weeks.
I can guarantee two things if you go to watch Fat Friends the musical.
One, you'll never be able to look at a Flake quite the same again.
And two, you will really fancy a massive bag of fish and chips on the way home.
Which is handy, because the newest musical on the block is playing the Opera House at Blackpool Winter Gardens and I counted nine salt and vinegar-based establishments on my five minute walk from car to theatre.
Kay Mellor's Fat Friends has stormed into Lancashire's liveliest seaside resort, a perfect fit for it's brash, heart-warming, no-nonsense northern humour which puts two fingers up to the stuffier musicals where stars must be five foot nine and a size eight.
Based on the TV series of the same name, Kay Mellor's only appearance is the mobile phone announcement before curtain up but the cast is largely drawn from the north and this run is a homecoming for its star turn, the roof-raising talent of reality show turned musical darling Jodie Prenger.
The Blackpool lass, educated at Elmslie Girls' School and Blackpool and the Fylde College before stardom struck, was able to inject her enigmatic personality and quite astonishing voice into a role which clearly means a lot to her personally and particularly poignant in her home town, tweeting her nerves before the show.
She battled the same issues on TV show 'The Biggest Loser' as her character does here. As Kelly, she is under pressure to fit into the wedding dress she loves, but does the self-proclaimed diet-hater really have to conform to be the same as everyone else?
She shines on stage alongside her sharp-tongued and skinny sister Joanne (Rachael Wooding) and her nice but dim fiance Kevin who loves her just as she is, played by Andrew Flintoff.
Yes, you heard right, all eyes were turned on a most unusual casting, Preston-born cricket all-rounder Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff, who not only was acting but singing including a solo in the show, which features music by Nick Lloyd-Webber (Andrew's son).
Fat Friends
Although I was holding my breath for the most Freddie's solo turn, he actually managed remarkably well and most certainly can act and sing, getting some of the loudest applause of the night though he did not look entirely comfortable and I don't blame him.
It must be terrifying to sing on a stage in context of the formidable Jodi, Sam Bailey (playing Jodie's weight-loss champion mum Betty) not to mention the pop princess Natasha Hamilton of Atomic Kitten fame.
But where Freddie lacks experience in performance finesse he more than make up for in charm. His performance is both likeable and funny and warmth emanates toward him from the audience.
Natasha plays the formidable and slightly barmy 'Super Slimmer' boss Julia Fleshman who fixates on Jodie's weight loss journey as a way to fame and fortune, taking few prisoners on the way.
Undoubtedly her performance is one of the strongest in the show with her slick Scouse humour and gritty singing voice - she certainly knows how to dominate a stage.
Natalie Anderson as the weight obsessed but skinny Lauren , leader of the local slimming branch and desperate for love, is also compelling with her storyline and her care for everyone else.
But this was, more than anything, a riotous, ensemble, performance which hits its target market perfectly in the cockles of the heart with a side order of delicious fried fun and a collection of huge personalities for pudding.
You'll leave smiling.

The ambassador said that vast coastlines in the northern and southern parts of Iran, production of fishery products, processing and re-export of the aqua products and joint venture project for manufacturing special equipment to grow fish and conduct related research are among grounds for bilateral cooperation.
Sandberg evaluated his past visit to Iran (October) as ‘positive' and said Iran has great capacities in the field.
He talked about experiences and knowledge of Norway concerning advanced technologies in the field of caged fish culture and welcomed bilateral cooperation in the field.
Sandberg referred to extension of financial credit by the Norwegian credit institutes as an appropriate opportunity for fishery companies of Norway to implement joint venture projects with Iranian companies.
Transfer of technology in the fields of fisheries and aqua culture is among other areas of interest by Norway to cooperate with Iran.

An adult daycare is set to open in Montreal's east end. Far from being a place aimed at weekend fun, it's targeting corporate clients. Global's Billy Shields reports.
Should swimming lessons be part of the school curriculum?
That's the question being raised after two apparent drownings in the London area over the weekend.
According to the Lifesaving Society, teaching children how to swim is among the best ways to prevent drownings.

On Monday, a 13-year-old girl was pulled from the water at a campground in Perth County. She was resuscitated and rushed to hospital in life-threatening condition.
OPP said the teenager, identified as Ebony Kay of West Perth, succumbed to her injuries Tuesday.
“The first thing you should do [if you see someone unresponsive or in distress] is got help. Call 911 [or have someone else do it] and get an emergency response team there to help you deal with that person who's in trouble,” said Barbara Byers, public education director at the Lifesaving Society.
Next, if the person is struggling in the water, Byers says to grab a flotation device, like a pool noodle, ring buoy, or even a cooler lid that you can extend to the person who is struggling.
“The person who's struggling and panicking for dear life can develop this sort of superhuman strength,” she said.
“You don't want to go right out and get really close to them because they could throw their arms around you and use you as a means to get out of the water.”
If you can't swim or are not a strong swimmer do not try to help because you could put yourself in a life-threatening situation, added Byers.
Once the person is out of the water, if they're not breathing Byers says it's crucial to start CPR.
“Doing nothing and watching and waiting for emergency response to come isn't going to be any more successful at keeping that person alive.”
“If you know some of the rudimentary measures of CPR, you should give it a try. You're giving that person a chance to get the response that will hopefully bring them back,” she said.

In the second weekend incident, a 57-year-old man was pronounced dead in hospital after being found unresponsive at a campground north of Woodstock Monday.
He's been identified as Andre Bourgeois of Kitchener. It's unclear if he died due to drowning or some other medical issue.
“Swimming alone is a key risk factor, especially with older adults,” said Byers.
“[Our studies show] 69 per cent of people who drown over the age of 50 were alone.”
Whether you're swimming or boating, Byers says it's important to have a buddy so that if you get into a difficult situation they can help you right away.
“Every second counts [when someone is struggling to breathe].”
One of the biggest concerns she has when the weather gets hot is for toddlers.
“We always say ‘keep your children in arms reach. Keep your eyes on them. Stay close to them,' but we all have this problem where we get distracted by other people and things and now we're even more distracted by our phones,” said Byers.
“Put your phone down. Put your phone away. Drowning is silent and it can happen very, very quickly.”
You may think you have a good view of your child, but Byers says you won't see the transition from a child happily swimming to getting into difficulty.
“Put that phone away. You can't watch them and be on your smartphone at the same time,” she said.
A 13-hour standoff between Seattle police and an off-duty King County sheriff's deputy ended Wednesday afternoon in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. Police took the suspect into custody around 3 p.m.
Police say it started as a domestic violence assault call Wednesday morning. The suspect barricaded since 1:30 a.m. and has been talking with law enforcement throughout the standoff.
The deputy refused to exit an apartment near the intersection of Belmont Avenue East and East Pine Street. Police believed the suspect was armed.
The victim was able to get out safely.

Some neighbors were told to evacuate and others were told to shelter in place.
The deputy has been with King County Sheriff's Office for two and a half years. He has been on paid administrative leave since March for an ongoing investigation.
Seattle Police will do a criminal investigation of the incident first, and the Sheriff's Office will do an internal investigation afterward.

LONDON (Reuters) - Ravi Ashwin and Cheteshwar Pujara will play English county cricket this year ahead of India's tour next summer, India's chairman of selectors MSK Prasad said on Monday.
Spinner Ashwin, who has not previously played in England, has been cleared by the BCCI to play for Worcestershire while batsman Cheteshwar Pujara is expected to return to Nottinghamshire.
"Cheteshwar Pujara and R Ashwin will be playing county cricket. Ashwin is part of other formats too, so it is a blessing in disguise for both of them because we will have a full-fledged tour of five Tests in England next year," Prasad said in Pallekele.

By Andrew Both
CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Hideki Matsuyama announced on Monday that he has been married since January and is now a father, news which caught Japanese media and fans by surprise.
Though numerous Japanese reporters follow Matsuyama every second of the day that he spends on a golf course, the world number two was able to keep his nuptials and fatherhood under wraps for months.
He said in a statement his child, a girl, was born in July, but did not reveal details of the identity of his wife.
Matsuyama announced the news only hours after falling short in his quest to become the first Japanese man to win a major championship.
Leading with nine holes to play at the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow on Sunday, he had three consecutive bogeys on the back nine and finished equal fifth behind winner Justin Thomas.
Matsuyama, 25, is one of the most popular sports figures in Japan.

Top Five Features of Tata Nexon HyprDrive Self-Shift Gears
Tata Motors recently introduced the AMT variant of their latest compact SUV, the Nexon HyprDrive Self-Shift Gears. Bookings for the vehicle are now open at Tata Motors dealerships across the country at Rs 11,000. The AMT variant is available in both diesel and petrol options; powered by the 1.5-litre Revotorq and 1.2-litre Revotron engines respectively.
Improved styling
The ivory accents on the exterior of the car has been replaced with a Sonic Silver theme. This new theme extends to the roof as well, giving the car an appealing dual-tone paint job. The dual-tone roof is available only in the XZ+ and XZA+ variants for select colours. The new Nexon is available in Etna Orange, Vermont Red, Moroccan Blue, Seattle Silver, Glasgow Grey, and Calgary White.
Wearable PEPS key
If you are prone to misplacing or forgetting your car keys, Nexon's PEPS key might be just the right thing for you. This key can be worn as a wrist band, and just like a regular key can be used to unlock and start the car.
New AMT
Tata have used AMT (Automated Manual Transmission) instead of a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) or an automatic transmission to make clutch-pedal-less cars more accessible. In an AMT, the operation of the clutch is done automatically with the help of sensors and actuators. They also provide the same fuel-efficiency as a manual car.
The new six-speed gearbox comes equipped with useful features for the city, like the “creep” function. It enables the car to move in traffic without using the accelerator pedal. The “adaptive gear” function remembers the driver's throttle-usage pattern and adjusts itself accordingly in each driving mode.
Driving modes
The Nexon offers a choice of three driving modes; City, Eco, and Sport. In City mode, the car delivers a well-balanced output; the right mix of performance and fuel-efficiency. In Eco mode, the Nexon's priority is improved fuel economy, which comes at the cost of performance. Sport mode is the one to choose if you wish to extract maximum performance from the car.
Manual Tip-tronic transmission and Smart Hill Assist
Along with the convenience of an automatic, you can also enjoy the thrill of a clutch-pedal-less automated manual gearbox. The Smart Hill Assist feature prevents the car from rolling backwards while it is on an incline.
We drove the car to a hill station near Pune. Pick up the May issue of Car India magazine for the first drive review. The car is slated for launch in May and is expected to be priced at Rs 70,000 (ex-showroom) more than the current model. The top-end diesel manual variant is priced at Rs 9.89 lakh (ex-showroom).

Canadians wounded in the horrific Las Vegas mass shooting can apply for Nevada's victims of crime program to help pay for costly medical bills up to $35,000, but that limit could be increased Global News has learned.
The program which offers assistance to anyone who is “a victim of violent crime in Nevada, involving physical injury, threat of physical injury or death.”
A spokesperson for The Nevada Department of Administration, which administers the program, confirmed that Canadians could also apply to help pay for medical bills, mental health counselling, wage or income loss and funeral expenses.
“Anyone who was present at the time of the shooting can apply for assistance,” said Mary Woods, a public information officer for the Nevada Department of Administration, in a statement. “Typically the funding from the Victims of Crime Program goes directly to a facility to reimburse for care or services. However, there are instances where individuals will get reimbursed directly.”

Woods said that while the program is usually capped at $35,000 that number could potentially increase given the severity of the shooting which killed 58 people, including four Canadians, and injured hundreds more.
“Should we get to that point, there are mechanisms in place to potentially increase the funding limit,” Woods said, adding her agency is also committed to “working with providers from Canada to ensure counselling bills get paid.”

Some Canadians who suffered gunshot wounds that required major surgery faced potentially staggering medical bills after the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.
Hudson Mack, whose 21-year-old son Sheldon didn't buy travel health insurance before crossing the border, said the medical bills could be “catastrophic.”
“It's a lesson to Canadians to not cross the border without coverage,” Mack told the Canadian Press.
Joseph Lambourne, whose wife was shot in the stomach, was concerned about the costs of care and getting her home to Manitoba.
“She can only take about three steps,” he told Global News from the Valley Hospital Medical Center on Thursday. “It's going to be a long road to recovery.”
Woods said they have already received nearly 500 applications. She said that anyone apply for the funding should reference “Route 91” or “Las Vegas mass shooting” in addition to indicating their physical or emotional injuries.

The Canadian government has a program that provides financial assistance for Canadians victimized abroad but has a limit of $10,000 and doesn't cover lost wages.
In the wake of the shooting, dozens of crowdfunding campaigns have been created to help victims. One campaign started by Clark County Commission Chair Steve Sisolak, a Democrat running for governor, has raised more than $9 million of its $15-million goal.
Online crowdfunding pages at GoFundMe have been created to help the families of three Canadians killed in the mass shooting, including Calla Medig, Jessica Klymchuk, Tara Roe, Jordan McIldoon. Campaigns have also been created to help Braden Matejka, Sheldon Mack and Ryan Sarrazin who were injured.
Will McAleer, president of the Travel Health Insurance Association of Canada, says the tragedy underscores the importance of having a travel insurance policy. He said when surgeries, rehabilitation, and air transport are taken into account, violent injuries from gunshots can cost US$300,000 or higher.
“Travellers are enjoying their vacations and then something like this happens,” McAleer said. “And whether it's New York, Edmonton, whether it's Orlando, or London, it's becoming all too common an occurrence.”

Beijing: The Doka La standoff happened due to "lack of mutual trust" between India and China, and they need to work together to create favourable conditions and gradually settle the boundary issue, a top Chinese diplomat said on Tuesday, ahead of this week's informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Indian and Chinese troops had been locked in a stand-off for over two months last year in the Doka La area near Sikkim before "disengaging" on 28 August. The area of the standoff is also claimed by Bhutan.
"The boundary incident that happened (at Doka La) last year someway reflected lack of mutual trust between the two countries," Vice-Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou told the media when asked about the Doka La standoff.
Asked whether the Doka La standoff and the boundary issue will figure in the talks between prime minister Modi and president Xi, Kong said the two leaders decided to hold informal summit "because both the countries attach great importance to each other in external strategy, not because of the boundary question that still remained unresolved, that we need to talk about it during the informal summit".
India-China boundary dispute spans to 3,488-km along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Both sides have held 20 rounds of talks between the special representatives to resolve it.
"Of course, the boundary question is important. Both sides need to work together to create favourable conditions and gradually settle it. Proper settlement of boundary question will help deepen cooperation and deepen mutual understanding and trust between the two countries," Kong said.
He said both China and India need to make even greater efforts to deepen their mutual trust.
"At the informal summit, the two leaders will have heart-to-heart discussions on the issues of overarching, long-term and strategic importance to bilateral relations. In terms of some specific differences or sensitive issues, the two sides will stay in touch with each other through relevant channels. In the process of deepening mutual trust, they will gradually find a way to try to settle them," he said.
Pink is battling the flu ahead of her Super Bowl performance.
The 38-year-old singer is set to sing the American national anthem, which will be televised live before the game kicks off, on Sunday (04.02.18) at the U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis but is struggling to recover from the flu.
Pink blamed her children, Willow, six and Jameson, 13 months, for making her sick.
She shared a picture of herself rehearsing on Instagram and wrote: "Trying to practice the flu away. I've been waiting to sing this song since 1991 when I saw my idol, Whitney Houston, own this song. And now, my chance has finally come. And it just so happens that this chance comes when I have two small Petri dish kids who literally cough INTO MY MOUTH and rub their snot on my cheek. You can't write this stuff I swear!
"And here we are. I've arrived at another one of my dreams which is slowly becoming a sort of nightmare. I will tell you, this is one of the biggest honors of my life, singing this song in front of my family, my military family, my dad and brother and step mama and family and the world. And the EAGLES!?!?! I promise I will do my best, as I always do. As far as the gremlins that got me into this mess, you can cough at me for the rest of your lives. If it's a contest, babies, you win. #spreadthelove #spreadthegerms #pleasegivememyvoiceback #ificansingimgonnakillit (sic)."
The national anthem has previously been sung at the Super Bowl by the likes of Lady Gaga, Idina Menzel, Alicia Keys, Billy Joel, Diana Ross, Neil Diamond, Whitney Houston, Luther Vandross, Cher, Faith Hill, Mariah Carey, BeyoncÃ© and Christina Aguilera.
TAMPA, Fla. – Two people are recovering after a shooting at Green Gators Bar and Grill in Tampa.

The head of Oregon's Office of Emergency Management is apologizing after his agency sent a vague wireless emergency alert without "specific information we had meant to send" about Salem's contaminated drinking water advisory.
"This was a failure on our part," Andrew Phelps, director of the emergency agency, said in a video posted to social media.
Phelps said the integrated public alert and warning system "inadvertently defaulted to a generic message." He said agency officials rushed to give updates on social media and manually override the generic message, pushing another alert with information on the water advisory.

Salem city officials on Tuesday released a do-not-drink advisory after low levels of toxins were discovered in city drinking water from the North Santiam River.
The advisory is for children younger than 6 years old and vulnerable populations, including dialysis patients and those with compromised immune systems. Officials say there is no danger for healthy adults drinking the water, which is also used in other towns, including Stayton and Turner.
Q&A: 11 questions answered on Salem's water warning
Bottled water: State, city officials won't supply water as Salem contamination alert drags on
Advisory: Salem drinking water contaminated, children shouldn't drink tap water
The advisory set off a run on bottled water a local grocery stores, and city officials remain unsure when the warning will be lifted.
In an interview Wednesday with the Statesman Journal, Phelps said Tuesday marked the first time ever the state had used its wireless emergency alert system.
"As soon as we saw it on our own phones, yeah, we knew pretty quickly that it did not work the way we had expected it to work," he said.
Phelps said a senior IT staff member trained on the emergency alert system typed in the message with approval from an executive duty officer, he said.
For the alert, the city of Salem had adapted language from the Oregon Health Authority.
Marion County did not send the alert because it doesn't have that ability, so the Marion Area Multi-Agency Emergency Telecommunications Dispatch Center in Woodburn was asked to send it, said Jolene Kelley, spokeswoman for Marion County.
However, a technical issue stopped the dispatch center from being able to send it, so the Office of Emergency Management was contacted as a backup, Kelley said.
"Generally these messages ... get sent out at the local level or if it's a weather issue, they get sent out by the National Weather Service," Phelps said. "So, this was the first time we've ever initiated a wireless emergency alert. Usually it's something that the locals handle."
Phelps said no testing options exist for the wireless alerts, though the television and radio alert system is tested weekly. He said officials are trained on the emergency alert system via Federal Emergency Management Agency trainings posted online.
Oregon's Office of Emergency Management Director Andrew Phelps apologizes in a video posted on the agency's Facebook page.
OEM
Phelps said the wireless alert went to phones within the area served by the affected water system, while another alert went to television and radio broadcasters that serve the affected area.
"We are conducting a forensic analysis of the steps we took to send this message and to ensure our procedures are written and practiced in a way that will prevent confusing messages from being sent ... in the future," Phelps said.
The Office of Emergency Management said in an earlier statement Tuesday: "This was a technology issue which OEM is currently working to learn how and why it happened."
Policy expert Jim Moore pointed to similarities between Oregon's blunder and an incident earlier this year when an emergency alert in Hawaii warned of a ballistic missile strike that sparked massive panic.
"Just like Hawaii and the missile alert, there is work to do," said Moore, director of the Tom McCall Center for Policy Innovation at Pacific University.
"Whether this was software, human error, or confused communications, the first message just created a mild form of panic. It is the job of OEM's communications to actually communicate to the public, not confuse it," Moore said.
Still, Moore said, clearer communications in the past have spurred other problems, such as an incident in the 1980s where a tsunami warning for areas along the coast drew spectators from the Willamette Valley wanting to see the event.
"This points out the problem," Moore said. "It is not just the quality of communication from OEM, it is the listeners' abilities to act appropriately on that information that will determine how people deal with the 'big one,' out there somewhere off the coast."

Governor Kim Reynolds is signing a bill into law this afternoon that's designed to eventually cut Iowans' income taxes by about $400 million a year.
“Generational tax reform — I'm really excited about that,” Reynolds said during an interview with Radio Iowa this morning.
The bill would cut individual income taxes by an average of 10 percent in 2019. In 2020 and beyond, the tax reductions outlined in the law will only take effect if state tax collections grow by at least four percent each year.
“I talked about in the Condition of the State that we have an obligation to pass on the savings from the federal tax reform,” Reynolds said. “Because of our tie to federal deductability, the fact of the matter is if we hadn't done anything, Iowans were going to see their taxes go up.”
Iowans have had the ability to take a state income tax deduction equal to the amount of federal income taxes they paid. So when federal taxes are lowered, Iowans wind up paying more in state income taxes if lawmakers don't make adjustments. The bill Reynolds and her Republican colleagues in the legislature crafted would eventually get rid of that deduction, as it makes Iowa's income tax rates appear higher than they are when compared to other states.
Reynolds unveiled the framework she wanted to see in a tax plan in early February, but it wasn't until May 5 that Reynolds and Republican lawmakers settled on a compromise plan.
“It's a process,” Reynolds said this morning, praising key legislative leaders like House Speaker Linda Upmeyer and Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver by name. “…They stayed at the table. We walked through it. We talked about areas where we had common ground and everybody had to give a little bit and everybody did, but everybody, I think, was very happy with the end result.”
In late February, Senate Republicans proposed nearly a billion dollars in income tax cuts for individuals and corporations. Republicans in the House countered in March with what they called a “more prudent” plan that was closely aligned with the governor's framework. In the end, elements like cutting Iowa's corporate income tax rate are included, but do not take effect for two years and only if the state's economy is growing.
“We were able to bring the House and Senate together and pass historic tax reform,” Reynolds told Radio Iowa this morning.
Reynolds is holding an event at a business in Hiawatha to formally sign the tax bill into law at 2:15 this afternoon.
Democrats say the plan provides a tax windfall the wealthy and special interests, while a third of Iowans get no tax relief or may wind up paying more, since the law imposes sales taxes on Netflix, mobile phone apps and other “e-commerce.”
Democrat Dave Jacoby, a state representative from Coralville, called it a “tax scam that will make the state's budget crisis even worse.”
London: The trial to prove a prima facie case of fraud against fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya
resumed in London on Monday to determine if he can be extradited to India to face charges over his erstwhile Kingfisher Airlines.
The 61-year-old will be back in the dock at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London for day four of the hearing when his defence led by barrister Clare Montgomery, is set to depose two further witnesses in its attempt to prove that the airline's alleged default of around Rs 9,000 crore worth of bank loans was the result of business failure rather than "dishonest" and "fraudulent" activity by its owner.
Meanwhile, it has emerged that the businessman is also facing a parallel litigation in the Queen's Bench Division of the commercial court in England's High Court of Justice brought by a consortium of Indian banks to freeze his global assets.
The State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Corporation Bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co Pvt Ltd are listed as
applicants of that claim against Mallya and related concerns named as Ladywalk LLP, Rose Capital Ventures Ltd and Orange India Holdings.
Lawyers for Mallya have been granted an extension to respond to that case due to his ongoing extradition trial, expected to conclude on Thursday.
Margaret Sweeney, from the accounts team of Force India Mallya's Formula 1 racing team, and legal expert Martin Lau are set to be deposed by his defence team at the extradition hearing on Monday.
Judge Emma Arbuthnot will hear the case over some "interruptions" as Uber's appeal against the cancellation of its operating license in London is expected to open in the same court.
Last week, the defence claimed that a consortium of Indian banks led by State Bank of India (SBI) had rejected an offer by the liquor baron in early 2016 to pay back nearly 80 percent of the principle loan amount owed to them. While deposing a banking expert last week, Mallya's counsel Montgomery questioned whether her client's offer to pay back around Rs 4,400 crores of the principle debt amount
on 6 April, 2016 should have been "dismissed out of hand" just a day later by the banks.
Paul Rex,who was described as a banker by profession who served as an independent expert in the field for over 20 years, said that banks tend to partially provision for loans unpaid over a long period and such an offer would have helped avoid "further loss".
"A commercial bank would assess such an offer against other routes of repayment. If that offer is higher than could be expected from other sources, it would be an attractive option for banks to consider," he said, adding that state-owned banks in particular tend to be more susceptible to "political pressure".
However, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) arguing on behalf of the Indian government countered that assertion in its cross-examination, indicating that the reason such a repayment offer would have been rejected was that the banks knew Mallya had the means to pay back the entire amount due.
There are plenty of reasons why even a state bank may take a view to reject such an offer, such as if it comes from a "dishonest" person who is known to have "plenty of money to repay" the entire amount if he wants to, CPS barrister Mark Summers stated during his cross-examination.
He also made a reference to the "debtor" (Mallya) throwing a birthday party costing around 2 million pounds as a factor which could have influenced the banks' decision to reject the offer.
The cross-examination of Rex was left incomplete at the end of the third day of the trial last Thursday, to be taken up again on Tuesday afternoon.
In his cross-examination, Summers had highlighted a particular "washing machine activity" picked up by the government of India that involved sums amounting to around 10-15 million pounds being funnelled between UB Group companies to wrongly claim obligations of equity infusions into struggling Kingfisher Airlines were being met.
Indian government sources have described its case, being presented by the CPS, as "very strong".
Mallya's legal team had claimed earlier in the trial that the case against him was "politically motivated" and that it was being used as an opportunity to make "political capital" by the ruling BJP as well as Congress and Shiv Sena.
The prosecution's case rests on "three chapters of dishonesty" by Mallya misrepresentations to various banks to acquire loans, the misuse of the loans, and his conduct after the banks recalled the loans.
Mallya, who has been based in the UK since March 2016, was arrested by Scotland Yard on an extradition warrant in April this year and has been out on bail on a bond worth 650,000 pounds.
If the judge rules in favour of extradition at the end of the trial, the UK home secretary must order Mallya's extradition within two months.
However, the case can go through a series of appeals in higher UK courts before arriving at a conclusion.
ISLAMABAD, Dec 11 (APP):Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Monday said that the government considered Roosevelt Hotel in New York as an important historical building owned by the state and that its divestment was not an option.
He further stated that apart from being a valuable property, the hotel also carried cultural significance for Pakistan.
The Prime Minister expressed these views while chairing a meeting regarding the affairs related to Roosevelt Hotel here at
the PM Office.
Secretary Aviation Division briefed the meeting in detail about the financial condition of the hotel and the reducing scale of
return on investment.
The Prime Minister directed the Aviation Division to submit a business plan for improving the income stream of the
Roosevelt Hotel by either alternative or mixed use development.
The meeting was attended by Advisor to PM on Aviation, Sardar Mehtab Ahmed Khan and other senior officials.

REUTERS/Aly Song/FilesBrent crude futures were up $1.20, or nearly 2 percent, at $64.60 by 12:22 p.m. EST (1722 GMT). U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $57.87 a barrel, 51 cents or 0.9 percent above their last settlement. The difference between the two benchmarks was the largest since late October, as Brent rallied after the shutdown of the pipeline that carries the largest grade of North Sea crude oil. The pipeline, which can carry 450,000 barrels per day of Forties crude from the North Sea to the Kinneil processing terminal in Scotland, has been operating at reduced capacity for about four days before the shutdown. “It is a supply concern not only because the pipeline transports a significant portion of North Sea crude oil output, but also because it may take weeks before the issue is resolved,” said Abhishek Kumar, Senior Energy Analyst at Interfax Energy's Global Gas Analytics in London The market had expected the pipeline to return to service quickly and was surprised by the extended shutdown, said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. “It's a significant amount of crude oil in a market that has been the tightest for crude oil,” Kilduff said. Earlier in the session, both benchmarks popped higher after an explosion rocked New York's Port Authority Bus Terminal, one of the city's busiest commuter hubs. Investors tend to head for hard-asset commodity markets like gold and silver during high-risk events, and oil can also attract investment, Kilduff said. Brent and WTI have gained well over a third from 2017 lows, drawing support from a cut in production by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a group of non-OPEC producers, including Russia, which has been in place since the start of the year. During the weekend, Kuwait's oil minister suggested that an exit from the supply-cut agreement would be studied before June. The United Arab Emirates' energy minister said on Monday that OPEC plans to announce in June an exit strategy from the cuts, though he added it did not mean the pact would end by then. Gains from the cuts could also be undermined by rising output from the United States, which is not participating in the deal to withhold production. The number of rigs drilling for new oil output in the United States last week rose by two to 751, the highest since September, energy services company Baker Hughes said on Friday. “The largest concern for investors currently remains the rise in the U.S. rig count,” said Shane Chanel, equities and derivatives adviser at ASR Wealth Advisers. A higher rig count points to a further rise in U.S. crude production, which is already up more than 15 percent since mid-2016 at 9.71 million barrels per day. That is the highest since the early 1970s, and close to the output levels of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.

No. 2 seed Wozniacki upset by Makarova at Wimbledon (0:45)
LONDON -- Caroline Wozniacki has made another early exit from Wimbledon.
Editor's Picks Federer eases into 3rd round at Wimbledon Roger Federer dominated on his serve to cruise past Lukas Lacko in straight sets in a second-round match at Wimbledon.
The Australian Open champion lost 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 to Ekaterina Makarova of Russia in a second-round match after being bothered by a swarm of flying insects in the second set.
Wozniacki has never been past the round of 16 at Wimbledon, and this is the fourth time in seven years she has lost in the first or second round.
The second-seeded Dane saved four match points at 5-3 in the final set before breaking back to level the match. But she was broken again in the last game.
Organizers used bug spray after Wozniacki complained to the chair umpire about the insects.
She is the fifth of the top eight women seeds to lose before the third round.
Serena Williams continued her Wimbledon return by moving into the third round with an emphatic 6-1, 6-4 win over Viktoriya Tomova.
The seven-time champion lost just five of 32 points on her first serve as she took a little over an hour to triumph against her 135th-ranked opponent.
Williams was unable to defend her 2016 Wimbledon title last year because she was pregnant.
Despite her ranking having fallen to 181, Williams is seeded 25th this year.
The 36-year-old American next faces German Tatjana Maria or Kristina Mladenovic of France.
Five-time Wimbledon champion Venus Williams once again dropped the opening set, and once again dominated the rest of the way to win.
The No. 9 seed, at 38 the oldest woman in the draw, came back to beat 141st-ranked qualifier Alexandra Dulgheru of Romania 4-6, 6-0, 6-1 to reach the third round.
Williams got broken in the first game and did not recover in the opening set, in which she made 12 unforced errors, twice as many as Dulgheru. Nine of those were errant forehands.
But the American, the runner-up at Wimbledon a year ago, then won seven games in a row.
In the first round, Williams started by ceding a tiebreaker against 58th-ranked Johanna Larsson before taking 12 of the last 15 games.
Karolina Pliskova advanced to the third round for the first time with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Victoria Azarenka.
Seventh-seeded Pliskova didn't face a break point as she cruised through a meeting of the two former No.1-ranked players on Centre Court.
It was the sixth time in seven main draw appearances at Wimbledon that 2016 U.S. Open runner-up Pliskova had advanced to the second round, but she had previously failed to go any further.
Two-time Australian Open champion Azarenka was vulnerable on her second serve throughout, winning just seven of 18 points on it.
Pliskova will next face 29th-seeded Mihaela Buzarnescu, after the Romanian defeated British wildcard Katie Swan 6-0, 6-3.

For all of the pre-draft smokescreening, there's little advantage to publicly discussing draft intentions this time of year.
That is, Marvin Lewis opined Tuesday, unless the organization is picking first.
Much has changed since Lewis' Bengals -- at the head coach's behest -- signed USC Heisman Trophy winner Carson Palmer before the start of the 2003 NFL Draft.
If the Browns have privately decided on USC's Sam Darnold as the top pick in this year's draft, they aren't willing to surrender the potential for last-minute leverage, much less the potential for last-minute drama.
Reporting from team headquarters, NFL Network's Omar Ruiz told Good Morning Football that Oklahoma's Baker Mayfield has emerged as a dark horse candidate to be Cleveland's top selection.
Assuming general manager John Dorsey is willing to consider godfather offers from desperate teams obsessing over a holy grail, it's not in his best interest to narrow his options at No. 1 overall.
Citing a source involved in team discussions, NFL Network's Steve Wyche echoed Ruiz's report, insisting Mayfield's name is "absolutely" on the Browns' radar. The reigning Heisman winner does have support in the war room, Wyche added, particularly from personnel consultant Scot McCloughan, formerly the Redskins general manager.
Does Mayfield have a legitimate chance to go No. 1?
"We still don't know," Wyche emphasized on NFL Up to the Minute, "but we cannot rule that out."
For what it's worth, Mayfield comes with Joe Namath's exuberant stamp of approval.
Around The NFL is tracking all of the latest buzz for the 83rd NFL draft, which starts Thursday at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Check back each day for updated nuggets as we pass along whispers from around the league. Here's what we're hearing Tuesday:
1. If the Browns draft an early-round cornerback, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported, they will look to trade Jamar Taylor, who signed a contract extension late in the 2016 season.
In other hot-stove news, per Rapoport, the Giants are shopping scapegoated former first-round pick Ereck Flowers.
Buoyed by non-stop trade speculation, this year's draft is drawing hype as perhaps the most intriguing of all time:
They are debating on @gmfb if this is the most intriguing @NFLDraft ever. It does feel like that. One GM predicted more trades in the first round than ever before, thanks mostly to the varying QB evaluations. Thursday should be nuts. â Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) April 24, 2018
2. Don't be surprised if three centers go off the board in the first round. NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah recently acknowledged going back to the tape for a deeper study of Arkansas' Frank Ragnow, whose stock in rising in NFL war rooms.
"He seems to be a lock to go in the first round," Rapoport added on NFL Up to the Minute, "which is something if you told me two weeks ago I never would have believed it."
Iowa's James Daniels (No. 17) and Ragnow (No. 19) are both ranked high on NFL Network draft analyst Mike Mayock's list of the top 100 prospects in the 2018 draft. Ohio State's Billy Price, who suffered a partially torn pectoral at the scouting combine, comes in at No. 45.
3. Another player on the rise is Georgia linebacker Roquan Smith, whom Rapoport believes might have the most unanimously approved game film in the draft. Smith is the name Jeremiah keeps hearing "over and over again" for the Colts at No. 6.
"I'm to the point now if they stay and don't pick Roquan Smith, I'd be surprised," Jeremiah stated on the draft-preview edition of the Move the Sticks Podcast.
4. One of Smith's college teammates, on the other hand, might be sliding down a few boards. According to The Ringer's Michael Lombardi, formerly Bill Belichick's right-hand personnel man, some teams have docked Georgia running back Sony Michel for undisclosed medical reasons. Michel is ranked No. 32 on Mayock's list, a sign that his stock is still holding strong in light of the most recent medical reports.
5. After watching the Broncos draft Paxton Lynch two years ago, Pro Bowl cornerback Chris Harris wants nothing to do with a quarterback at No. 5 overall this time around.
"We're trying to win now, man," Harris said Tuesday, via NFL Network's James Palmer. "We don't have time to wait."
Harris went on to cite Penn State's Saquon Barkley, NC State's Bradley Chubb and Notre Dame's Quenton Nelson as preferred draft targets.
6. John Elway can afford to target the best player available, a luxury not available to his counterpart in Florham Park. The Jets have canceled Top-30 meetings with non-quarterbacks, Rapoport reported, because they simply aren't going in any direction outside of the sport's most important position with the draft's No. 3 pick.
7. If conventional wisdom is holding course with Gang Green, the same can't be said for the Cowboys. One day after NFL Network's Jane Slater cautioned against the assumption that Dallas will draft a first-round receiver, owner Jerry Jones made it clear that Dez Bryant can't be replaced by any receiver available this year.
"We probably won't have what we would call a pure X receiver to take the place of Dez," Jones explained. "Even if we draft one that is an X receiver, he's not going to, as a rookie, come in here and give us that type of performance. You got to presume that. And so we certainly know that we've got a chance to pick a player, but not necessarily in the first round or even the second round, that will have an opportunity [to get] in the mix."
8. Marty Hurney has returned to the Panthers' GM chair to oversee his first draft since selecting eight first-round Pro Bowlers in a span of 10 years, starting with Julius Peppers in 2002. For all of that success, though, Hurney is still haunted by the future first-round picks surrendered in trades for draft busts Jeff Otah and Everette Brown.
"I can tell you right now, you can consider next year's first safe," a smiling Hurney quipped Tuesday. "I don't think we're going to be trading next year's first."
9. The Bills and Cardinals are among the organizations interested in trading up to the No. 5 of No. 6 range, Rapoport reported Monday. Which teams, conversely, are looking to move down in the first round? Rapoport shifted gears Tuesday, listing the Lions, Titans and Seahawks as candidates to trade down.
10. How disparate are the opinions on this year's draft class? Executive vice president Stephen Jones revealed Tuesday that the Cowboys have roughly 17 players rated as first-round prospects. This comes hours after 49ers general manager John Lynch put his war room's total at 30 first-round grades.
11. AT&T Stadium was designed to be showcased as a grand spectacle, the shining jewel in the NFL's entertainment crown. It comes as no surprise, then, that the Cowboys are expecting the largest crowd in NFL draft history this weekend, per Slater. The festivities will not only include a 20,000-seat theater, but also a massive NFL Fan Experience venue equivalent to 26 football fields.
Hat-trick hero Jack Marriott thanked his Peterborough United team-mates for the chance to grab the post-match headlines from a 4-1 League One win at Bristol Rovers on Saturday (August 12).
The first Football League treble of the 22 year-old's career helped Posh into second place in the early-season League One table.

The striker, who signed for a reported £450k from League Two Luton in the summer, scored early in both halves before completing his hat-trick in the last minute. Steven Taylor scored the other Posh goal.
“It's a pretty good feeling claiming my first Football League hat-trick,” Marriott stated. “The match ball will be mounted and framed and put on display at home.
“But I owe the rest of the lads everything. They put the goals on a plate for me. The first goal quietened a loud crowd down and the second one rocked their team back.
“The third goal came from a cross from Andrew Hughes and it proved we are a team that will run from the first minute to the last no matter what the score is. Andrew had actually predicted before the game I would score a hat-trick.
Jon Taylor celebrates a goal for his hat-trick against Posh against Blackpool in May, 2016.
“The team were unbelievable from start to finish. It was a great performance at a place which can be difficult for an away team. I missed another good chance in the first-half, but I wasn't thinking about that when the other chances came.
“I've loved every minute at this club from the moment I walked through the door.
“The chairman and manager have confidence in me and my own confidence is through the roof now.
“Maybe losing to Barnet last week was a kick we needed. We will now take some good form and into another tough match this weekend.
“We're playing well going forward and I'm getting on well with Junior (Morias) and Marcus (Maddison). The best thing is none of us are in for themselves. we want to help each other.”
Posh host Rotherham United next Saturday (August 19).
The last Posh hat-trick was scored by Jon Taylor, who is now at Rotherham, against Blackpool at the ABAX Stadium on the final day of the 2015-16 season.

Although Trump once again spoke extensively about expanding the federal death penalty for drug dealers, his administration released a three-page list of proposals before his speech that ruled out any change to existing federal law, suggesting instead that the Justice Department would take a more aggressive stance toward those offenders already eligible to be put to death based on other capital offenses, such as drug-related murders.
HOUSTON -- Houston Texans head coach Bill O'Brien has said Tom Savage is the team's No. 1 quarterback, and on Wednesday, star wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins said Savage has "earned" that role.
Savage will compete with rookie Deshaun Watson during training camp to open the season as the Texans' starter under center, but O'Brien has made it clear that Savage has the advantage right now.
"I like his leadership," Hopkins said. "From last year, when he wasn't playing on the field, he was still showing the guys, telling us what we should do, helping us out like he was the starting quarterback. Now that he's in that role, it's no surprise to anybody on this field that he deserves that role. He has earned it, not just from playing, but from the chemistry he has built in the locker room with everybody."

The bond between Savage and his wide receivers is one Hopkins has mentioned multiple times this offseason, citing the importance of not only getting the reps on the field but spending time together off the field as well, calling it a "huge key" this offseason. Hopkins said he thinks that relationship "makes a big difference."
"The teams you see winning championships are teams that are close, not just on the field but off the field," Hopkins said. "You look at teams that won championships and you look at the players, and you can tell they're not just teammates, they're friends as well."
The Texans' passing game struggled last season with Brock Osweiler and Savage under center, tying for 30th in the NFL in receiving touchdowns. Hopkins, who had a breakout season in 2015, had a drop in production last season, catching 78 passes for 954 yards and four touchdowns.
After nine weeks of the offseason program, Hopkins says he has noticed a difference in the O'Brien-led offense.
"[It's got a] very good feel," Hopkins said. "I've been in this offense for going on four years now. Having [new assistant coach] Wes Welker out here that's a recently removed wide receiver, it helps out a lot to have a guy that knows this offense better than anybody. To be here every day working with us, it makes a big difference."
In addition to providing more confidentiality for the juveniles, the new Court Services facility will also add more security for people who work in court services. (Source: WSFA 12 News)
Construction on Houston County's new Juvenile Courtroom and Court Services facility is complete, and both buildings are set to open soon.
Both will be housed in the basement of the Houston County Courthouse. Right now, the Court Services office is located on Foster Street. The Chief Juvenile Probation Officer says this location doesn't provide the confidentiality the new space will.
“We have big windows out there and people can be nosy,” said Jeff Ozbun. “Here, it's much more confidential and that's the number one goal of the juvenile court services.”
Juvenile Court proceedings in Alabama are supposed to be confidential, but in Houston County they typically happen on the 3rd floor of the courthouse, and there's no confidential waiting area.
“With all the other things that go on in the courthouse – it's a very busy courthouse – it's just not a good place for the confidential factor,” said Lori Ingram, Houston County District Judge.
In addition to providing more confidentiality for the juveniles, it will also add more security for people who work in court services.
“In the courthouse we have the deputies and the metal detectors. There we have no security. Anyone could walk up off the street and come in,” said Ozbun.
Ozbun says Court Services averages 50 to 60 petitions a month and around 1,200 moves through the court system a year, so the new facility also provides more functional space to operate.
The official move is set for June 5 and they expect to be fully operational by June 6.
During the move, the Juvenile Services phone line will still be available in case of an emergency.

Former President Obama called at least one Republican lawmaker after the shooting at a congressional baseball practice Wednesday, contacting Sen. Jeff Flake (R- Ariz.) to send “best wishes and prayers to those injured,” the senator said
Flake, who maintained good relations with Obama during his presidency, rode Air Force One with Obama back home to Arizona for a service after Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was shot in 2011.
The former president wanted to let Rep. Steve Scalise, who was injured in the attack, and other Republican members of Congress “know he's thinking about this,” Flake said.
VANCOUVER, Wash. – County officials say the Clark County Jail is in desperate need of an upgrade.
The jail was built for a much smaller population, so overcrowding is causing a safety issue not just for inmates, but for law enforcement and the surrounding community. Capacity for the jail is about 450 people and the jail averages about 750 inmates every day.
"Something has to change,” said Clark County Council Chair Marc Boldt.
The foundation and walls of the building do not need upgrades, but the layout needs to change to give the jail more space.
"The inmates are in the jail, in the pods, and the inmates kind of control what's going on, so it's not a good fix. You can't have as many people in,” Boldt explained.
To give you an idea of how packed it is, the inmate pods were built for about 10 people, and on average, the pods hold 25 to 30 people, according to Boldt.
"Rotate cots, really there's no storage anywhere, it's very tight areas. It just doesn't work at all,” Boldt said.
The inmate intake area does not work either. Boldt said it is too small for the number of people going through it, which means law enforcement officers end up waiting in the parking lot, sometimes up to an hour, before they can book someone.
That time spent waiting is time officers could be responding to other calls in the community.
Boldt said this summer, with the jail over capacity, they will have to release people they otherwise would not.
"Until we get this remodeled, the real low level offenses that we would've placed in our jail, we're just going to book and release, which is a real safety issue,” Boldt said.
The county is currently looking at several different remodel options that could cost anywhere from $180 million to $300 million. To fund the project, the county would put a measure on the ballot to increase property taxes. The new jail would also require more staff, which the county said would be paid for with sales tax money. Officials hope to have a plan to present to the voters by spring of 2019.
In addition to upgrading the jail, Clark County is also looking for ways to decrease the number of people in and out of the jail. They are working to create more diversion programs that would address both mental health and substance abuse issues.

New Delhi: The IBBI has notified revised norms for insolvency resolution process paving the way for home buyers to seek relief as financial creditors, putting in place clear timelines to be followed by resolution professionals and permitting withdrawal of insolvency applications subject to certain conditions.
In a significant move, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) has mandated that a resolution professional should determine whether a corporate debtor had indulged in fraudulent transactions within a specified time period during the resolution process.
The IBBI (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations have been amended following the government coming out with an ordinance amending the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in June.
With the amended norms, there is more clarity on procedural requirements for various classes of creditors, including home buyers.
"Wherever the corporate debtor has classes of creditors having at least ten creditors in the class, the interim resolution professional shall offer a choice of three insolvency professionals... to act as the authorised representative of creditors in each class.
"... The insolvency professional, who is the choice of the highest number of creditors in the class, shall be appointed as the authorised representative of the creditors of the respective class," an official release said on Wednesday.
In instances where the interest rate has not been agreed upon between the parties, the voting share of such a creditor would be in proportion to the financial debt that includes an annual eight percent interest rate. This assumes significance, especially for home buyers, as it provides clarity on the calculation of total financial debt.
A resolution professional would now be required to form an opinion whether the corporate debtor was involved in preferential, undervalued, extortionate or fraudulent transactions as well as make a determination of any such activity within a specified time period, as per the release.
Besides, the revised regulations have put in place a clear roadmap to be followed by the resolution professionals.
Now, they have to publish an invitation for Expression of Interest by the 75th day from the insolvency commencement date and the resolution professionals have to publish a provisional list of prospective applicants within 10 days from the EoI submission deadline.
"The resolution professional shall issue the information memorandum, the evaluation matrix and the request for resolution plans (RFRP), within five days of issue of the provisional list to the prospective resolution applicants and allow at least 30 days for submission of resolution plans," the release said.
Further, the resolution plan should demonstrate that it addresses the cause of default and that the applicant has the capability to implement the plan, among other factors.
An application seeking withdrawal of insolvency proceedings would be accepted under this law if the same has been approved by the Committee of Creditors (CoC) concerned with 90 percent voting share. Once the CoC nod is in place, then the resolution professional has to submit the application to the adjudicating authority on behalf of the applicant within three days of such an approval.
"A meeting of the CoC shall be called by giving not less than five days' notice in writing to every participant.
"The CoC may, however, reduce the notice period from five days to such other period of not less than forty-eight hours where there is an authorised representative and to twenty-four hours in all other cases," the release said.
The revised norms also come against the backdrop of instances where they have been issues related to resolution professionals and entities involved.

ISS: 2nd (among Goalies)
In 2016, the Mississauga Steelheads drafted Jacob Ingham in the second round and 26th overall in the OHL Priority Selection. Ingham, at the time, was playing for the Barrie Colts Minor Midget AAA team and had joined the OJHL's Orangeville Flyers for a couple games during the 2015-16 season.
But in 2016-17, Ingham jumped right into the mix with the Steelheads, playing 31 games for them during the regular season and collecting a 17-6-3 record with a 2.69 goals against average and .907 save percentage. While he used his rookie year to turn heads in Mississauga and around the OHL and amongst NHL scouts, his sophomore year didn't play out quite as well.
RELATED: THW's 2018 Draft Guide
He finished 16-22-2 in 43 regular season games. His goals against average skyrocketed to 3.65, while his save percentage plummeted to .880. Opponents started finding holes in his game and his positioning just wasn't as sound as it had been in his rookie season.
He has a number of areas that he will need to bounce back in – including his ability to find pucks in front and the quickness of his glove hand, but he's the type of player that can develop in the right situation. While his 2017-18 season may have bumped him down the ranks slightly, don't expect it to hurt his overall chances when it comes to – one day – cracking an NHL roster.

Jacob Ingham – NHL Draft Projection
With a plethora of options when it comes to positional players in this year's NHL Draft, the goaltenders will likely fall a bit on draft day. For Ingham, that could mean that he might have to wait until the third or fourth round to hear his named called. That said, it'll depend on how the dominos fall and how many teams are looking to draft goaltenders.
Quotables
“Ingham entered the season as one of the top draft prospects among goalies and has found a way to maintain his standing despite showing critical technical flaws in his net awareness and glove-hand positioning. The good news is that Ingham's coverage of the lower-half of the net is outstanding, and his flexibility and range of motion allow him to stop second and third chances, specifically if there's a radical directional change. The width of his butterfly flare looks appealing, and Ingham's feet appear to be planted and set when squaring himself to the shooter. Unfortunately, his glove hand is not quick enough for it to be positioned as low as he keeps it, especially when couched low and deep inside the crease.” – Dobber Prospects
“Something happened to the technique we saw a season ago. The opposition was able to exploit differences in his game. Where he had previously played big in his crease, he was being beaten up high. While he is very athletic, his post-to-post movement seemed to have changed and he would get caught “cheating” off the short side post. Ingham's ability to fight through traffic also appeared to take a step back. He had trouble finding the puck in battles out front and that would leave the bottom of the cage exposed as he tried to fight for sight of the puck….Ingham is very athletic. He gets out to the top of the paint quickly. His post-to-post movement is also very quick. He has shown an ability to control his rebounds. His glove hand could use some improvement. With Ingham, it will come down to coaching. He has an excellent work ethic and there is no doubt he will put in all the work required. It will come down to working on and tweaking his technique.” – Dominic Tiano/OHL Writers

At the beginning of the 2017-18 season, Ingham was considered one of the better goaltending prospects. However, he showed a number of weaknesses over the past year which could make it even harder for him to land a spot in the NHL within the next five years. That said, he is willing to learn and put the work in which could be beneficial in the right hands. If nothing else, he should make for a good glorified backup one day.

While he didn't do much to add to his career achievements this past season, Ingham did turn heads in 2016-17 when he was named to the OHL's First All-Rookie Team. He was also a part of the silver-medal-winning Canadian team at the U17 World Hockey Championship that year – playing five games and posting a 2.15 goals against average and .927 save percentage.

Confidence is continuing to increase that Alabama will see some kind of varying impacts from Nate in time for the weekend. Here is a breakdown of what you need to know over the next couple of days with the latest forecast information.
As of 10 am Friday, the conditions within Tropical Storm Nate have changed slightly. Sustained wind speeds have increased from 45 mph to 50 mph, with gusts even higher (especially on the eastern side). This system is still located in the northwestern Caribbean Sea, but it is starting to pick up the pace a bit; earlier, it was traveling N/NW at around 14 mph, but now it has increased its speed in the same direction to over 21 mph. TS Nate will continue to move in that same direction until it starts to take a more northerly path late Saturday into Sunday.
What else has changed a bit from previous updates is the track. Per the most recent update from the National Hurricane Center, Nate will likely be in extreme southern portions of the Gulf of Mexico as early as Friday night, then the system will approach the northern Gulf coast by Saturday and move closer inland by Saturday night and Sunday morning. The center line and the cone of uncertainty have shifted toward the east slightly; the cone now includes all central and south Alabama with the addition of the Wiregrass and part of the Florida Panhandle that were previously excluded.
Despite yet another sunny and quiet day ahead, our concern is ramping up that this weekend could feature significant effects from what is currently Tropical Storm Nate. Models are starting to gel on the eventual track. It's the intensity that still remains a question mark at this stage. Regardless, our weekend weather will take a sharp turn as rain and wind pick up late Saturday and into Sunday.
The most important information from this new update is the addition of a new Hurricane Warning. This warning is in effect from as far west as the Grand Isle in Louisiana to as far east as the Alabama/Florida border. A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected somewhere within the highlighted red shading below:
Per the NHC, a warning is typically issued 36 hours before the first anticipated occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds. These strong winds are expected to impact the region nearest to the coastline by Saturday night.

NATE RIGHT NOW: Tropical Storm Nate remains largely disorganized this morning with most of its convection located on the southern side of the surface circulation. This is likely due, in part, to still some shear that is the strongest north of the cyclone. Nate spent part of the night still over land but is now over the open water of the NW Caribbean. It will spend much of the day today over warm waters before clipping the Yucatan Peninsula.
Friday is a big day for Nate. Much of his future as a possible hurricane will hinge on how much strengthening occurs in the next 12-24 hours. Models have advertised shear slackening more than it has. This shear will need to relax further in order for Nate to start to gain steam. I remain cautiously optimistic that this less-than-ideal shear environment could help mitigate this strengthening today, allowing only gradual growth. Should shear relax further, Nate could strengthen rapidly. This would be cause for concern as a stronger Nate entering the Gulf tomorrow would mean greater impacts along the coast. A weaker Nate entering the Gulf could prevent the system from attaining hurricane status. And we'd all prefer to deal with Tropical Storm Nate versus Hurricane Nate.
WHERE IS IT GOING? Models have come into tight agreement on an initial landfall across SE Louisiana with perhaps another somewhere along the coast of Mississippi/SW Alabama early Sunday.
This tight clustering adds welcomed confidence in the general track. It's the intensity that remains unknown, and this element will obviously have critical implications on local weather. This track takes the center of Nate near or just west of Mobile, which is a rough setup for Mobile Bay putting the area within the onshore flow and creating storm surge/flooding concerns. Nate will then track NE into west Alabama (based on current guidance) while weakening.
The environment in the Gulf is borderline favorable for perhaps a slow, gradual strengthening. At a minimum, Nate maintains whatever it enters the Gulf as. But it's certainly not an explosive environment where Nate blows up into a monster. As such the greatest odds are Nate makes landfall as a strong Tropical Storm or weak Hurricane. Max sustained winds in the 60-90 mph ballpark seem fair. That's a range they will feature a wide spread in impacts, however. More damage/outages with higher winds...so this element needs to be buttoned up.
ALABAMA IMPACTS: Mobile Bay takes the first hit with storm surge and wind issues accompanying heavy squalls. As Nate tracks inland, it's fairly compact structure will move fairly quickly northeast. East of the center, tropical feeder bands will pose a spin-up tornado threat across the entire viewing area after midnight Saturday night and through the day Sunday as the storm pushes through. The core of the storm will produce tropical storm force sustained winds, but squalls east of the center will produce gusts of similar caliber at times
Areas along and west of I-65 experience the highest wind speeds as they are closest to the center track of Nate. Winds could gust in the 45-60 mph range if we take the current NHC official forecast at face value. Winds in that range would be sufficient for some downed trees and power outages. But it's important not to get too caught up in these initial numbers as intensity/track fluctuations can dramatically alter them. Nate appears to be fairly quick-hitting, so flooding doesn't appear to be a major concern. Rainfall totals in the 2-4"+ range are possible along and west of I-65.
East of I-65, winds and rainfall totals are slightly lower. But the spin-up tornado threat is the same for the entire viewing area.
In the best case scenario, Nate remains a Tropical Storm and tracks west of Alabama. We get gusty bands of heavy rain with isolated tornadoes, but widespread damage and power outages are avoided. We don't avoid impacts. But we avoid significant impacts. The worst case would be a stronger hurricane tracking closer toward Mobile. More wind, more surge, more problems. The eventual solution likely lies somewhere in between. But we must prepare for the latter as failing to do so could be dangerous.
TIMING: We experience no problems today with continued sunshine and highs into the upper 80s. Initial bands will pivot northward later Saturday and into Saturday night. The greatest effects will come through Sunday, both morning into evening as the core of Nate lifts northward into the area. Those with outdoor plans Sunday are out of luck. The beach will be a dangerous place Saturday and into Sunday. We anticipate most of the effects to be gone by Monday morning as Nate rapidly pulls northeastward. Lingering showers and breezy conditions are still expected, but nothing damaging.
CALL TO ACTION: I would anticipate additional Tropical Storm Watches be issued inland in time. Tropical storm force winds will be possible, if not likely, for much of the viewing area into Sunday. This will include the threat of tornadoes for our ENTIRE VIEWING AREA. You will need to treat this as you would any severe weather event. Have multiple reliable ways of hearing Warnings (weather radio is a great option) and have them ready to roll starting Saturday night.
As is the case in any landfalling tropical system, small fluctuations make a big difference. Expect changes. Expect to have to react quickly to those changes. We're in a mode where it is prudent to plan for the worst case scenario, even if that scenario is a long shot. Can't be caught off guard. We'll keep you updated as additional data becomes available.

AT&T's lead attorney, Daniel Petrocelli, took aim Monday at thousands of pages of emails from AT&T employees that the Justice Department wants to submit as evidence of potential competitive harms of the deal. Petrocelli argued that the government was asserting too broad a view of what is considered a business record. As an example, he cited 18 documents produced by a lower level AT&T employee whom Petrocelli described as "one young man who just came out of business school."
U.S. stocks fell sharply on Friday after a stronger-than-expected jobs report sent interest rates higher.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 665.75 points to close at 25,520.96, capping off the index's sixth-largest points decline ever. The 30-stock index also fell below 26,000. Friday also marked the first time since June 2016 that the Dow fell at least 500 points.
The S&P 500 fell 2.1 percent and finished at 2,762.13, with energy as the worst-performing sector. The Nasdaq composite plunged 1.96 percent to 7,240.95 as a decline in Apple and Alphabet offset a strong gain in Amazon shares.
The Dow posted its worst day since June 2016. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq had their biggest one-day fall since September 2016 and August 2017, respectively.
“The key for the market today is rising interest rates,” said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “The old adage is: ‘Bull markets don't die of old age, they are killed by higher interest rates.' That looms large.”
The U.S. economy added 200,000 jobs in January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists polled by Reuters expected growth of 180,000. Wages, meanwhile, rose 2.9 percent on an annualized basis.
The report sent interest rates higher. The benchmark 10-year yield rose to 2.85 percent on the back of the report, hitting a four-year high. Investors have been jittery about the recent rise in interest rates, worrying they may be rising too fast.
On Friday, the 30-year yield rose its highest level since March.
A Federal High Court sitting in Kaduna State has adjourned the two consolidated suits involving 92 members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria to March 1 for continuation of hearing.
The case, which is before Hon. Justice David Shiri Wyoms was adjourned following the application of the Director of Public Prosecution of Kaduna State, Dari Bayero who informed the Court that he had logistic challenges bringing his witnesses to Court for the continuation of the hearing of the case.
Responding to the motion for the adjournment, counsel to the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), Barrister Festus Okoye noted that the state had over a month to put their house in order but failed to do so.
He added that the accused persons have been in prison custody for 14 months awaiting trial.
Okoye also informed the Court that he will not object to the adjournment of the case based on the undertaking by the Director of Public prosecution to produce all the military officers mentioned as witnesses in the case before the court at the next adjourned date.
In his ruling the Hon. Justice David Wyoms adjourned the case to March 1 and thus directed the state to produce all the eight named witnesses who are army officers at the next adjourned date.
The members of the IMN in prison custody are standing trial for culpable homicide, rioting, unlawful assembly and other offences.
Just yesterday, the Islamic group accused the Federal Government of “deliberately and silently” killing its leader, Ibraheem El-ZakZaky.‎

Search engine optimization, or SEO, is increasingly important for anyone who wants their website to be noticed. If your site doesn't show up near the top of the first page of internet search results, you are going to miss out on a lot of visitors. This article will give you some tips on how you can improve your site's search ranking.
When trying to increase in search engine rankings, you should ensure that your Meta and title HTML tags are different on every page of your website. The more varying terms you have on different pages, the more search directories will store your pages and list them separately. A bigger web presence means a bigger web business.
Searchable words are an important part of search engine optimization. Web crawling bots look for the keywords that a user enters into the search engine. You can help users find your page, by including those keywords in your website. Write advice columns on your site that include those words and people will read your advice, adding credibility to your sit. This will, in turn, bring your page rank up higher.
To know where you stand with your particular niche market, you should check on your page rank at least once a week. By checking your rank, you will find out varying information about how competitors are finding you and you will also realize what you need to do in order to shoot up in the rankings. Your goal should be a page rank of 1.
Use a keyword tool, such as Google Ads, to find out what keywords users are searching with to find sites like yours. The tool gives you approximations on the number or searches conducted with any given keyword. This will help you to fine tune your specific key word phrases. Doing so helps to drive the most traffic toward your site.
Maximize the use of photos and images on your website to enhance your search engine optimization. Give each visual a short interesting caption containing your important keywords. One way that search engines rank images is by the text that surrounds them, so make sure that this information is rich in keywords, including any titles or headings you may use.
Grab any information your competitors give you and use it to your advantage. Sometimes, competing websites will give you exact information about their targeted keywords. There are two common ways to find this information. One is to look in the META tag of the site's homepage. Additionally, on some pages with articles, some or all of the keywords will be in bold.
Boost your website's SEO by visiting ".edu" domains and creating backlinks on their blogs and forums. Also search for .edu sites in need of sponsorship. Search engines favor .edu websites and sites with numerous backlinks. Make sure that the comments you leave on these websites are relevant and not a hard sell for your company or product.
Test your third party resources before you use them, and ask others who have, how they performed. You do not want to find yourself relying on a search optimizing tool that is completely inaccurate or faulty. Ask around, try them out, and make the best choice for what you need.
You might think that linking to a huge number of other websites will increase the popularity of your site and is a great way to get improved search engine optimization, but remember the quality of the sites you link to is very important. If you link to poor quality sites, it can actually hurt the popularity ranking of your site.
When setting up your site, it is important to add text links on the multiple pages. When using image maps, links for images, or drop down menus, it is important to add text links because the spiders need them to have something to follow. This is important when it comes to the way you rank on the search engine results page.
Overdoing it with the keywords on your site could get you labeled as a spammer. If you become labeled as a spammer, your site will be overlooked by search engine spiders. They are specifically programmed to ignore the sites that try to stuff as many keywords as possible onto it.
It's common for search engine spiders to look for new content, so when you're regularly adding new posts through a blog, you're giving the spiders a reason to visit your site. Well-written articles will often be shared. After an article is shared, it starts to bring in higher levels of traffic.
Putting your website in a prime place to be found is what search engine optimization is all about. The article you have just read gave you multiple tips on how to make this happen for you. Applying these simple tricks will get your website noticed in no time, so increase your traffic today!
SGI Canada and the Canadian Red Cross in Saskatchewan have partnered to help people who have been impacted by disasters in the province.
“SGI Canada is proud to support our communities and the Red Cross, and help in times of need,” Minister Responsible for SGI Joe Hargrave said in a statement.

“The Red Cross really focuses on the first 72-hours of a natural disaster and having a flood clean-up kit is very vital and in cases where there are floods, it allows people to proceed immediately with the clean-up,” said Jan Radwanski, the outreach coordinator, disaster management for the Canadian Red Cross.
“SGI's partnership with the Red Cross here gives people hope right away, we get the call and we can get these kits out in a relatively short period of time.”
Radwanski presented a cheque to SGI Canada on May 30 for $35,000 to be used towards the partnership, with $25,000 for flood clean-up kits, assistance for families with long-term recovery needs and ongoing Red Cross emergency preparedness and awareness efforts.
“These fundings are going towards the purchase of 200 kits and also going toward the purchase of family assistance. With regards to Red Cross, we provide clothing and food assistance if they're unable to return to the house as well, or accommodation,” Radwanski said.

An additional $10,000 will be provided for equipment and necessities.
Radwanski said the funding is very important as it gives the Canadian Red Cross an opportunity to very quickly reach out to people that are calling for assistance.
“With flooding, it's very traumatic for a family or individual to go through that and when a clean-up kit arrives, from my personal experience, it allows them to get to where they can focus on recovery and not dwell that the event has happened and gives them some hope to get that house or apartment clean right away,” Radwanski said.
“When these disasters happen, [people] don't really know what to do next, so [the kits] really get them to focus on the contents of the kit and making sure that they're safe, that they have gloves on, a mask if needed – and then the cleaning solution allows them to tackle once the water recedes and prevent mould growth and just get things cleaned up in a hurry and allows them to move forth with other activities around that household,” he added.
SGI Canada is also providing an opportunity for the Red Cross to access a list of SGI volunteers to help with disaster efforts under the Red Cross Ready When the Time Comes program.
READ MORE: Saskatchewan residents recall helping in the aftermath of Fort McMurray fire
The volunteer work may include helping with set-up and take-down at evacuation shelters, handing out supplies, assisting with outings and field trips for evacuees, helping entertain the kids in shelters among others that will be identified by the Red Cross.
“We all know that when a disaster hits, quick action is key and it's all hands on deck,” said Cindy Fuchs, vice-president of Canadian Red Cross Saskatchewan. “So being able to provide people with clean-up kits immediately, and quickly schedule SGI volunteers, means we can be more responsive when people need help the most. SGI Canada is one of the first companies to enter a partnership for disaster recovery, providing both financial and volunteer recovery support for families affected by disasters.”

The government said clean-up kits were provided to 15 families who were impacted by wildfires on the Standing Buffalo First Nation near Fort Qu'Appelle earlier this month. The kits were used in clean-up efforts for evacuated homes that survived the fires but were impacted by the smoke.
“In a case in Moose Jaw last night, there was a hail storm in the north part of the city and it did result in some drainage being blocked and some families did suffer some basement flooding, so they would call us and we would then proceed with an analysis of the situation, and it looks like possibly later today we will be getting some flood kits out to Moose Jaw if the call comes,” Radwanski said.
A logistics team who is familiar with the contents of the kit handles the distribution of the kits, according to Radwanski, who added that the kits are user-friendly and include instructions on how to use everything inside.
“We are grateful for the opportunity to give back to our communities by working with an established, trusted and respected disaster response organization like the Red Cross,” Hargrave said.
SGI Canada is the trade name of the property and casualty insurance division of SGI and offers products in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario. Products are sold through a network of independent insurance brokers.
Last week's primary election in Maryland yielded a mixed bag of surprises and expected results, including for the numerous Jewish candidates.
Thanks to a 2016 referendum imposing term limits in Montgomery County, the races there saw a spike in candidates.
The packed and hotly contested Montgomery County executive nomination race is still a toss-up between businessman David Blair and Council Member Marc Elrich (D-At Large). Elrich, who is Jewish, still has a slim lead over Blair in the Democratic race. The race should be decided by next week and the nominee will face Republican Robin Ficker in November.
Elrich and Blair topped a field of six, including former Rockville Mayor Rose Krasnow, Council Member Roger Berliner (D-District 1) and Council Member George Leventhal (D-At Large). All three are Jewish. The final candidate in the running was Del. Bill Frick (D-District 16).
The Democratic nominations for four Montgomery County Council at-large seats were largely up for grabs with only one incumbent, Hans Reimer, running. Reimer led the 33-candidate field, followed by Will Jawando, Evan Glass and Gabe Albornoz. Glass is Jewish.
The Montgomery County Council District 1 Democratic nominee will once again be Jewish, with Andrew Friedson getting the nod after Berliner left the seat for a bid for county executive. The four other districts retained their incumbents, including District 3's Sidney Katz, who is Jewish and narrowly fought off a primary challenger.
Congressional races
Maryland Congressional District 6 also drew a wide pool of Democratic candidates after Rep. John Delaney left the seat to run for president. Businessman David Trone won the Democratic nomination. Trone, who is not Jewish, belongs to Temple Beth Ami in Rockville with his family. He beat out, among others, state Del. Aruna Miller (D-District 15), who came in second; Dr. Nadia Hashimi, who came in third, and state Sen. Roger Manno (D-District 10), who came in fourth. Manno is Jewish.
Trone will face Republican Amie Hoeber in the November general election. Hoeber, who is Jewish, handily beat her three Republican challengers.
In District 8, Rep. Jamie Raskin, who is Jewish, trounced two primary challengers for the Democratic nomination and will face Republican John Walsh in November.
Maryland State Assembly
In the Democratic primary races for seats in the Maryland State Assembly, two incumbents lost their seats. Dels. Marice Morales (D-District 19) and Shane Robinson (D-District 39) did not make the cut. Robinson finished fourth to Lesley Lopez, Gabriel Acevero and Del. Kirill Reznick, who is Jewish.
Meanwhile, the contentious race for the open state Senate seat left behind in District 18 by Sen. Richard Madaleno — who unsuccessfully ran to become the Democratic nominee for governor — between Democratic Del. Jeff Waldstreicher and Dana Beyer, who are both Jewish, ended in Waldstreicher's favor. He faces no Republican opponent in November.
In District 16 Dels. Marc Korman and Ariana Kelly, both Jewish, topped the Democratic primary list. At press time, a third seat was still a toss-up between Samir Paul and Sara Love.
The results of remaining Democratic races were largely unsurprising, with incumbents leading their races. A number of Jews were winners in these races. In District 14, Del. Anne Kaiser won her primary bid for reelection, along with her fellow incumbents. Sen. Brian Feldman, who is Jewish, topped his primary in District 15. Sen. Cheryl Kagan in District 17 ran unopposed in her primary. Jared Solomon was nominated for one of two empty seats in District 18. In District 19, Del. Ben Kramer ran unopposed for state Senate.

Paris: Novak Djokovic pleaded with fans and media not to obsess about his injury problems which have sparked a 12-year low in his ranking, hitting back that "people are starving to death...so let's keep things in perspective".
Former World No 1 Djokovic won the last of his 12 majors at the 2016 French Open when he became just the eighth man to claim a career Grand Slam.
But he is currently down at 22 in the world, his lowest ranking since 2006 when he was just 19 and was still two and half years from his first major at the 2008 Australian Open.
An elbow injury forced him out of Wimbledon last year and sidelined him for the rest of 2017.
Since his return in January, he has undergone surgery but is still to see a renaissance in his game.
"It's all a personal perspective. It can be really tough and it can be really easy," said the 31-year-old after a 7-6 (1), 6-4, 6-4 win over Spanish qualifier Jaume Munar on Wednesday which gave him a spot in the Roland Garros third round for the 13th time.
"To sit here and talk about how tough it is and you have people starving to death, there is no point in talking about that.
"As an athlete, I have to face these challenges, I will call them, and if I overcome them or not, it's just a matter of work, luck at times, and circumstances that I'm in.
"I don't like to talk any more about what is tough, what is not tough. I mean, life is great."
Djokovic was far from his best on Wednesday against Munar, the World No 155 who has trained at the Rafael Nadal Academy in Spain.
The Serb fired 39 winners but 33 unforced errors and was broken three times before setting up a clash with Spain's 13th seed Roberto Bautista Agut.
But despite his comments about the world's less fortunate which brought comparisons to Boris Becker's famous 'I lost a tennis match. Nobody died' reaction to losing at Wimbledon in 1987, Djokovic just cannot shake off the doubters.
He was a last-16 loser at the Australian Open where he is a six-time champion and was then beaten first up at Indian Wells and Miami.
On clay, he fell in the second round in Barcelona and Madrid, reached the third round at Monte Carlo before a confidence-boosting charge to the Rome semi-finals where it took Nadal to stop him.
That, however, came too late to boost his seeding in Paris where he is number 20, his lowest since the 2006 US Open.
But Djokovic, who was the first player to break the $100 million prize money barrier, said he was happy to keep adapting to the changes in his life — both on and off the court.
"I don't want to be the same person and player that I was two, three, four years ago. I have a different life.
"I'm a father of two children, and it's a lot of different things that I prioritize in life. It's not only about tennis, which has been the case before."
The water in Lake Delhi in Delaware County is back at the level it was before the dam broke seven years ago.
Water started flowing over the spillway last year after rebuilding it. It took six years and 16 million dollars to build the new dam and spillway after flood water broke through the old dam in July of 2010.
The lake was open last year, but now the water is at the level it used to be before the dam breach.
Steve Leonard the president of the Lake Delhi governing board says the area is growing quickly now.
"The amount of money being spent remodeling projects new homes new businesses you name it new boat sales it's off the charts," Leonard said.
On Tuesday many were out boating, tubing, jet skiing and swimming in the lake.
The laid back and friendly atmosphere is what keeps one family coming back every summer, even when there was much less water.
"My mom and dad met down here the summer of '69 I met my husband down here in the summer of 1999 eventually we got married and are now raising our kids down here in the summer," Emily Dougherty said.
The governing board along with the county and the state have been working to revitalize the areas along the lake like putting in docks and restrooms. A new BBQ restaurant is also going in near the water.
Leonard says the goal is to attract more and more people to that lake so that it continues to grow.
The similarities between Juergen Klopp and Eusebio Di Francesco go far beyond their facial hair, designer glasses, and quirky humour.
In terms of tactics, passion, mentality and their route taken in coaching, the managers of Liverpool and Roma appear to be cut from the same cloth, creating a fascinating subplot ahead of the meeting of their teams in the Champions League semifinals.
The respect between them was evident as they spoke on Monday on the eve of the first leg at Anfield, a match that counts as the biggest in Di Francesco's managerial career and the most significant in Klopp's 2 1/2 years at Anfield.
"I am very happy but also concerned to play against a team coached by such a good manager," Di Francesco said, "but I believe my philosophy is quite similar."
That would be the high press, the high energy, the expected use of a 4-3-3 formation with the wingers drifting inside, the full backs overlapping, and the lone striker dropping off.
Manchester City and Barcelona couldn't handle the intensity of Liverpool and Roma, respectively, in a triumph for the underdogs in the quarterfinals. A week after City was overwhelmed in a 3-0 first-leg loss at Anfield, Barça was blown away by the same scoreline in a historic night at the Stadio Olimpico.
"I do understand probably a lot of people would have thought this semi-final would be Barcelona vs. Manchester City," Klopp said, "but it is not because it is football. Roma made it possible and us, as well. Maybe our situations are similar."
Both teams know their place in modern-day European soccer. Neither can stop their best players from leaving — Mohamed Salah left Roma to join Liverpool in the offseason, Philippe Coutinho left Liverpool to join Barcelona in January just as Luis Suarez did in 2014 — so they are constantly fighting against the odds.
Klopp and Di Francesco didn't take the easy route in coaching, either, starting at a relatively low base.
Klopp's first coaching role was at Mainz in the German second tier, Di Francesco's was with Virtus Lanciano in the Italian third tier.
While Klopp got Mainz promoted and then enjoyed success at his next club Borussia Dortmund, where he won the Bundesliga and reached the Champions League final in 2013, Di Francesco had posts at Pescara and Lecce before making his mark at Sassuolo and guiding the club into Serie A. He even got the team into the Europa League before joining Roma in 2017.
"Klopp has already proved his worth — he has won a number of titles — and I have great ambitions, too," said Di Francesco, who, at age 48, is two years younger than Klopp. "I will nurture this ambition to reach the final."
Di Francesco insisted Roma would not take a step back at Anfield, instead, going toe to toe with Liverpool and its devastating front three of Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino.
Klopp has the same mentality when Liverpool plays the heavyweights of the English Premier League, and he has a strong record in those games.
"We have continued believing in ourselves, and Roma is the same," Klopp said. "They changed manager — at least we didn't have to do that — but he is doing a brilliant job and so they have all my respect. If anyone thinks we two are underdogs, who cares?"

Actress Amber Heard was quickly condemned on social media after she shared a warning about ICE checkpoints that many deemed to be "racist."
"Just heard there's an ICE checkpoint in Hollywood, a few blocks from where I live," Heard tweeted Tuesday morning. "Everyone better give their housekeepers, nannies, and landscapers a ride home tonight ..."
Heard, 32, later deleted the tweet, but not before she was widely criticized on social media for seemingly stereotyping the jobs held by Hispanic people.
"Why did you delete your initial tweet? Is that all they are to you?" wrote one Twitter user named Don Carlo. "Out of touch much?"
The Tampa Bay Lightning begin their 25th season in franchise history Friday against the Florida Panthers, less than six months removed from falling one point short of a playoff berth.
Expectations were sky high heading into last season, with many in the hockey world picking the Lightning as a favorite to win the Stanley Cup. They'd made back-to-back Eastern Conference Final appearances the previous two seasons, including a trip to the 2015 Stanley Cup Final. General manager Steve Yzerman had kept the team together the previous summer against seemingly insurmountable odds. Steven Stamkos, Victor Hedman, Nikita Kucherov and Andrei Vasilevskiy were franchise cornerstones among those that inked new deals or contract extensions in the summer.
Falling Short of Expectations
Shortly after the puck dropped on the 2016-17 season though, things just didn't feel quite right with the Lightning.
There was the uncertainty of Ben Bishop's future with the club and the emergence of the defense as a weakness for the club in its then-current state. There was also a seemingly endless string of injuries to key players, including Stamkos just 17 games into the season. Further compounding issues was the fact that the team looked out of sync a lot of nights — playing from behind often and a sloppy team game defensively — a far cry from how they'd played in recent seasons.
Despite the disappointing finish to the season, there were some bright spots for the Lightning. Vasilevskiy took over the No. 1 goaltending role after Bishop was traded to the Los Angeles Kings ahead of the NHL Trade Deadline. Yzerman was able to unload some big salaries before the offseason to free up cap space for the summer. The Lightning also got a look at many prospects in the NHL for the first time.
But perhaps most importantly heading into this season, the Lightning got the longest summer of rest they have had since missing the playoffs in the 2013-14 season.
As the Lightning prepare to play the Panthers to start the 2017-18 season, let's look at three big questions they face moving forward.
Can Steven Stamkos Stay Healthy?
Since April 1, 2016, Stamkos has played in 18 games — the lone playoff contest came in Game 7 of the 2016 Eastern Conference Final and another 17 games last season.
It's fair to say that when it comes to injuries, Stamkos has simply been unlucky the past four seasons. But if there's anyone that can bounce back strong from a torn lateral meniscus in their right knee, it's Stamkos.
In 2013-14, he broke his right tibia after crashing into a goal post just 17 games into the season. He would go on to play in just 37 contests that year. After playing an 82-game season in 2014-15 — one in which he tallied 43 goals and 72 points — he helped the Lightning to the Stanley Cup Final.
Late in the 2015-16 regular season, he suffered a blood clot injury and had his uppermost right rib removed as part of the treatment. He returned for Game 7 of the ECF but the Lightning were eliminated from playoff contention. Further adding to things was the speculation running rampant in the league about whether or not the Lightning could re-sign their captain to a long-term extension as he approached free agency.
But on June 29, 2016, Stamkos inked an eight-year, $68 million deal to stay with the Lightning. One by one, other pieces fell into place for the Lightning, with Hedman and Vasilevskiy signing contract extensions just days later and Kucherov taking a three-year bridge deal to return to the club.
Stamkos returned in 2016-17 on a mission, playing arguably the best hockey of his career and tallying 20 points in 17 games. After tearing the lateral meniscus in his right knee in what was an otherwise innocent looking play, he was lost for the season. When Stamkos went down before the 2016 playoffs, the team's depth picked up the slack. But things were a little different last season. The Lightning suffered a string of injuries to other key players and never seemed to get into a groove — despite a solid stable of prospects who stepped up in increased roles during the playoff push.
If the preseason is any indication, Stamkos is ready to roll. He was held goalless but tallied five assists in four games. But most important of all, was the instant chemistry he had after being reunited with Kucherov and the fact that Stamkos had his legs so early in his return.
For the Lightning to be at their best, they need Stamkos in the lineup night in and night out. It keeps other players slotted in their respective places in the lineup and adds another scoring threat for opposing teams to defend against. He's also a player whose presence is priceless in the locker room.
Will Mikhail Sergachev Play Out the Season in the NHL?
Ever since Sergachev was acquired from the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for rising star Jonathan Drouin, the question was whether or not he would start the season in a Lightning uniform.
The 19-year-old blueliner immediately bolstered the franchise's depth on defense but it was unknown whether it would be at the NHL level or not, at least in the present. From the start of training camp, Sergachev made a strong case to begin the season at the game's highest level.
He showed poise and confidence in six games of action in the preseason. But besides playing beyond his years, he also chipped in a goal and two assists — leading all defensemen in scoring — impressive in itself, despite the fact that it was only preseason.
The important consideration with Sergachev is that Yzerman and head coach Jon Cooper will want to bring him along carefully. He's a top flight prospect playing a tough position and the Lightning gave up an offensive force in Drouin to land him.
Because of his age, Sergachev is ineligible to be assigned to the Syracuse Crunch in the American Hockey League. This means that if he isn't playing in the NHL, he will be back in the Ontario Hockey League with the Windsor Spitfires. Yzerman and Cooper will have to weigh the pros and cons of keeping him in Tampa Bay long-term this season.
Playing in the NHL means he will have valuable professional experience, but it will depend on where he slots into the lineup. Right now, he has the opportunity to be a top-4 defenseman and learn from the likes of Hedman and Anton Stralman. If he heads back to juniors, he will be playing against kids again and it may not be what he needs to continue to push his progression as a player.
But if he stays in the NHL, how long will he be there this season? Only time will tell — particularly his performance in his first nine games — but the Lightning will keep entry-level contract and future free agency rules in mind as they make their decision.

Will Tyler Johnson Return to Form?
Johnson has been an important part of the Lightning over the past four seasons. But as he begins the first season of his new seven-year, $35 million contract, you have to wonder if this is the year he returns to form.
In his first two full regular seasons in the NHL, Johnson averaged nearly 80 games and added almost 27 goals and 35 assists. In 30 postseason contests, he totaled 14 goals and 11 assists, and was arguably the team's best player en route to the 2015 Stanley Cup Final.
But the deep playoff run took its toll on Johnson. He battled a lingering wrist injury during the 2015-16 season and despite a strong performance in the playoffs (17 points in 17 games), this past season was a challenge.
Johnson played well at times during the 2016-17 season — and always gave his world-class effort — but it seemed like he was a player who couldn't find his long-term groove, for one reason or another.
In the past two seasons, Johnson has been limited to an average of nearly 68 games and tallied almost 17 goals and 25 assists per year.
With a brand-new contract and a long summer to get healthy, it will be crucial for Johnson to return to form and do it out of the gate.
Meeting Expectations
The Lightning start with a fresh slate Friday and will look to build upon the learning experience that came last season. It brings the same high expectations, as many are picking the Lightning as a favorite out of the Eastern Conference.
There are a lot of positive things working in the team's favor to open the 2017-18 season.
Over the summer, Yzerman was able to re-sign Johnson and Ondrej Palat, while also adding veteran depth in free agency with the additions of Chris Kunitz and Dan Girardi. Penalty-killing specialist Ryan Callahan returns from a hip injury and feels healthy. Yanni Gourde, who was one of the team's most effective players at the end of last season, has earned himself a spot on the roster. Brayden Point will begin his sophomore campaign after being an important piece of the team as a rookie. Vasilevskiy also starts his first full season as the clear-cut No. 1 goaltender.
But will the team's improved defense be enough and can a long summer be the missing ingredient for battling injuries and playing consistently throughout the season?
The answer to these questions and more will become clearer starting Friday.
The thousands of demonstrators have left Charlottesville, Va. The bronze statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, around which the protests were focused, remained standing. A memorial service was being planned for the woman who was killed, and many of the 19 people injured remained in the hospital.
And as the city began to recover from the violence of this past weekend, both sides declared victory.
To the white supremacists who gathered from across the country, the havoc in the Virginia college town and the international attention it earned them marked a win. To the counter-protesters, widespread acknowledgment of the threat posed by racism — evident in television images of Nazi symbols and other blatant bigotry — was proof they had prevailed.
It remains unclear what will happen to the racist movement that has been energized by the election of President Trump and was laid out for all to see in Charlottesville. But one thing seems certain: The fighting is not over. Both sides are gearing up for more.
White nationalists and pro-Cofederate groups quickly announced rallies and speaking events in Virginia, Texas and beyond, gaining throngs of online supporters while the people who live in those places are already taking to the streets to warn them to stay away.
In Kentucky and Maryland, city officials promised to swiftly tear down Confederate monuments after years of debates, drawing cheers from supporters but also galvanizing the white supremacists and fanning fears of more protests and more violence.
“These conflicts are growing, not diminishing,” said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extreme at Cal State San Bernardino. “A wedge has been turned into a battering ram by emboldened white nationalists.”

Hours after the Charlottesville rally on Saturday, where bodies flew as a man plowed a car into a crowd on a downtown street, Texas resident Preston Wiginton announced a “White Lives Matter” rally in College Station in September. He said he wanted to carry on the campaign launched by those in Virginia.
“Today Charlottesville tomorrow Texas A&M," said a news release issued by Wiginton, who has been identified as a white supremacist by civil rights groups. He vowed to fight "the liberal agenda of white guilt and white genocide.”
On Monday, the university canceled the rally, citing safety concerns. The event had been advertised as featuring Richard Spencer, a prominent white nationalist who promoted the Charlottesville rally.
Wiginton said he would sue, and white nationalists across the U.S. defended his cause.
The University of Florida said the same day that it was considering a request from Spencer to give a talk on campus on Sept. 12. Spencer has also said he will to return Charlottesville.
While white nationalists fought for speaking engagements, monuments came down.
Residents of Gainesville, Fla., wiped away tears of joy on Monday as workers used jackhammers to remove a Confederate statue nicknamed “Old Joe” that stood in front of a county building. The removal was scheduled last month, and the statue now sits in a private cemetery after the United Daughters of the Confederacy, a group made up of women who trace their ancestry to Southern Civil War figures, volunteered to take it.
The same day, demonstrators in Durham, N.C., cheered as they used a lasso to topple a 15-foot statue of a Confederate soldier and started kicking its head.
“No cops, no KKK, no fascist USA!” and “We are the revolution!” they chanted.
The statue of stood since 1924 with a dedication to “the boys who wore the gray.”
In Atlanta, protesters spray-painted a statue of a Confederate soldier and broke off a piece. Dozens of people gathered in Nashville and hundreds more in San Antonio to protest local monuments.
The gatherings followed formal announcements in at least five cities that monuments would be taken down.
On Sunday, Baltimore City Councilman Brandon Scott, who is black and a Democrat, took to Twitter to call for the “immediate destruction” of all four Confederate monuments in the city.
“Everywhere in this country, we have to remove these monuments and melt them down so nobody can ever idolize them again and wreck this havoc,” he said in an interview.
After Scott's tweet went viral, Democratic Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh lent her support to removing the monuments, including those of Gens. Lee and Thomas. J. “Stonewall” Jackson.
In Lexington, Ky., the mayor shared a similar view.
“These moral moments require everyone to take a stand,” said Jim Gray, a Democrat, who tweeted Saturday that he would move to tear down two Confederate statues from the grounds of a 19th century courthouse, an idea city officials first broached two years ago.
“There is no time to wait for tomorrow because tomorrow never comes,” Gray said in an interview.
But other groups were ready to fight.
“If the American people don't speak up, the majority of these monuments will be gone,” said Kirk Lyons, an attorney at the Southern Legal Resource Center, a North Carolina-based pro-Confederate group. Lyons said his group is ready to file lawsuits against monument removals.
“Confederate monuments are just a speed bump for these people. They will go after Confederates first.… It's about Thomas Jefferson, George Washington next,” said Lyons, who said he was “a Christian attorney of Southern ancestry” and rejected the label “white supremacist.”
Lyons said he was considering driving to Richmond, Va., to join a rally next month in support of a Robert E. Lee statue on downtown's Monument Avenue. A Confederate heritage group is still seeking a permit to hold the event.
A city commission is studying what to do with statues on the historic street popular with tourists — such as adding more historical context on the Civil War or placing monuments nearby paying tribute to black figures.
Mayor Levar Stoney, who has rejected the idea of removing statues, spoke to reporters Monday about the controversy after a groundbreaking ceremony for the American Civil War Museum. He said he wanted the city to acknowledge “the complete truth” about its history as the Confederate capital.
“At the end of the day, those statues are offensive to me, very offensive to me,” said Stoney, who is black. “But you know what I'm going to focus my time on? Destroying vestiges of Jim Crow where they live in our city — public housing, public education, you name it.”

QUETTA : At least four security personnel and two civilians were injured in a blast in Quetta's Western Bypass area on Monday, police sources said.
The Frontier Corps (FC) personnel were on a routine patrol when their vehicle was targeted through a bomb planted on the roadside.
The blast left the vehicle partially damaged. According to police, the landmine exploded as a convoy of FC personnel arrived at firing range located on the Western bypass.
Those injured were identified as Naik Latif, Naib Subedar Shafi, Sepy Saif-ur-Rehman, Sepoy Qasim, Hawaldar Awal-ur-Rehman and Raza-ur-Rehman .
They were immediately shifted to Bolan Medical Complex (BMC) where one of them is reportedly in critical condition.
There has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast.
In November last year, three FC officials were killed and seven others were injured in a roadside improvised explosive device (IED) blast which occurred near their vehicle in Peshawar's Bashirabad area.
The number of attacks in the country has fallen around 70 per cent, due to a combination of the military offensive against Taliban bases along the Afghan border and government initiatives to tackle militancy, but attacks on security and civilian targets continue to occur occasionally.
Paris: Andy Murray hailed unheralded British compatriot Cameron Norrie as "amazing" on Friday as Davis Cup underdogs delivered a series of body blows to the established powers of men's tennis.
Murray was the architect of Britain's Davis Cup title triumph in 2015 but injury ruled him out of the trip to Marbella to face Spain, playing in their clay court comfort zone.
But World No 114 Norrie, making his debut in the competition, stunned Spain's 23rd-ranked Roberto Bautista Agut 4-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 to pull Britain level at 1-1 in the World Group tie after World No 21 Albert Ramos-Vinolas had seen off Liam Broady 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (6).
"That's one of the most amazing wins/results/upsets I've seen in a long time on a tennis court.. Well done to cam norrie and all the team.. Broady was excellent," tweeted Murray, recovering at home from hip surgery.
Spain, the five-time Davis Cup winners, were expected to cruise through the tie even without injured World No 1 Rafael Nadal.
But 22-year-old Corrie, who had never before competed on European red clay, was undaunted by facing a player who had not lost a Davis Cup match since 2014.
"It is 100 percent the best day of my career," said Corrie. "I backed myself physically and mentally against the guy. I wanted to work him as hard as I could."
Spain's Davis Cup skipper, Sergi Bruguera, in charge for the first time, hailed Corrie.
"He played unbelievably," the former two-time French Open champion told daviscup.com.
Defending champions France were also level with the Netherlands in Albertville, but only after a shock in the first rubber when World No 369 Thiemo de Bakker downed the 25h-ranked Adrian Mannarino 7-6 (4), 6-3, 6-3.
Mannarino was a late call-up after first choices Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Lucas Pouille pulled out injured.
"I don't fear the French. I have beaten them before and I knew that I had the weapons to defeat them again," said De Bakker.
Fortunately for France, the experienced Richard Gasquet levelled the tie by seeing off Robin Haase 6-4, 7-6 (3), 3-6, 7-5 despite suffering from blisters.
In Brisbane, Australia and Germany were also 1-1 but World No 5 Alexander Zverev survived a huge scare before seeing off the 139th-ranked Alex de Minaur 7-5, 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (4).
Nick Kyrgios pulled the hosts level seeing off Jan-Lennard Struff 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 on the back of 21 aces.
Croatia, missing Australian Open runner-up and World No 3 Marin Cilic, are 1-1 at home to Canada in Osijek.
Borna Coric claimed a 3-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 victory over 85th-ranked Vasek Pospisil before fellow 'NextGen' star Dennis Shapovalov, ranked 48 eased to a 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 win over Viktor Galovic, the world 181.
For 18-year-old Shapovalov, it was a less dramatic first-round tie compared to 12 months ago when he was defaulted for accidentally hitting the chair umpire with a ball in the home tie against Britain.
Japan, without talisman Kei Nishikori, are 1-1 with Italy in Morioka.
Fabio Fognini, the world 22, saw off 100-ranked Taro Daniel 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 before Yuichi Sugita levelled by beating Andreas Seppi 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (1).
Elsewhere Friday, Belgium, the 2017 runners-up, opened a 2-0 lead over Hungary who are bidding to reach the quarter-finals for the first time.
In Astana, Kazakhstan are also 2-0 to the good against 2014 champions Switzerland who are without Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka.
Record 32-time champions the United States were 1-0 up on Serbia, playing without the injured Novak Djokovic, in Nis after Sam Querrey, ranked at 12, battled past World No 88 Laslo Djere (6/7 (4), 6-2, 7-5, 6-4).
Less than a month in to the new administration, President Trump's national security advisor, Gen. Michael Flynn, has resigned after reports that he misled his White House colleagues, including Vice President Mike Pence, about conversations he'd had with Russia's ambassador to Washington.
In those conversations, Flynn may have discussed sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed on Russia to punish Moscow for its interference in the U.S. election. Those conversations could have violated the Logan Act, which prevents unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign governments in relation to "disputes or controversies." The law, however, which was enacted in the 1790s, has never been used to prosecute anyone.
Here's the timeline of events leading up to Flynn's resignation:
In the Wake of Charlottesville, Lauren Jauregui & Zendaya Urge Young People to Be Vocal
We should all take a page out of Lauren and Zendaya's book.
This past weekend, actress Zendaya spoke out against the incited violence and hate we've recently been witnessing in Charlottesville, Virginia after winning the Teen Choice Award for Choice Summer Movie Actress.
Exactly what needs to be said when you have an amazing opportunity. We love you @Zendaya #TeenChoice, Thank you. pic.twitter.com/VtvK9X6fUH — mariana xx | #AUG25 (@trustnorminah) August 14, 2017
"Right now I want to talk to all of the young people in the audience," she told the crowd at Sunday's awards ceremony. "I need you to be educated I need you to listen. I need you to pay attention." She continued:
"I need you to go ahead and understand that you have a voice, and it is okay to use it when you see something bad happen. You are the future leaders of the world. You are the future presidents, the future senators. You guys are the ones that are going to make this world better. You are the future. So take that very, very seriously all right?"
Sharing her sentiments was Fifth Harmony's Lauren Jauregui, a fellow award winner during the night's festivities.
"In light of recent events, for all those young ones at home, no matter who you are or where you are from, you are beautiful and important. Keep spreading love and positivity," said Jauregui during her acceptance speech.
The mutual grief of recent tragic events, and call to arms against white supremacy was echoed by other celebrities and public figures during the award show's duration. Hopefully these messages are inspiring people further to not sit quietly, but instead stand against the amount of hate and violence that we have seen develop under the Trump administration.
(Adds comment from PwC Brazil, paragraph 3)
By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Investors are now seeking approval for $3 billion of settlements arising from the corruption scandal that enveloped Brazil's state-controlled oil company, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, including a new $50 million settlement with its auditor.
The new settlement, with PricewaterhouseCoopers' (PwC) Brazilian subsidiary, was disclosed in Manhattan federal court on Thursday night. Lawyers for the investors, led by the law firm Pomerantz in New York, plan to seek up to $285 million in fees, according to the filings.
“We were keen to put this protracted legal matter behind us, and a settlement was the best way to achieve this,” said Márcia Avruch, a spokeswoman for PwC Brazil.
The settlements and attorneys' fees must be approved by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff.
Petrobras said on Jan. 3 that it would pay $2.95 billion to settle a class action lawsuit by investors who said their shares lost value as a result of a sprawling corruption probe in Brazil focusing on the company.
If approved, the deal would represent the largest-ever settlement payout to investors in the United States by a foreign entity, according to a statement from Pomerantz on Friday. Though smaller than many analysts expected, it is among the largest investor class action settlements in U.S. history.
Petrobras has denied wrongdoing and has maintained it was a victim of misconduct by former executives. The company said in a court filing Thursday that it reserves the right to recover money from former executives and others accused of corruption who were not part of the settlement.
For the last four years, Brazil has been rocked by the so-called Car Wash investigation into kickbacks paid by contractors to executives of state-run companies and politicians in return for public projects.
The settlement put an end to “extremely high uncertainty” about the company's potential liability, JPMorgan said in a Jan. 3 client note, adding that it had expected a figure in excess of $5 billion. Analysts at Brazilian bank BTG Pactual said the market had expected a settlement of $5 billion to $10 billion.
Petrobras Chief Executive Pedro Parente said on Jan. 16 that the company would not consider additional shareholder settlements in other countries unless forced to by law. (Reporting By Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and David Gregorio)
KARACHI - Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) Chairman Mustafa Kamal on Friday expressed disappointment with the performance of K-Electric and state owned distribution companies as per performance evolution report for 2015-16 released by National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). He said that we are concerned at the poor performance of K-Electric and state owned power distribution companies (discos), the combined losses of Rs 132 billion were incurred by national exchequer, out of which Rs 83 billion is due to K-Electric alone in 2015-16. Ironically enough, it‘s all adding up to the already huge circular debt which is a huge burden on our economy and every Pakistani citizen.
Kamal emphasised that we would like to remind Karachiites that in its financial results for 2016 issues to the PSX, KE declared profits of Rs 32.75 billion with 15.6 per cent growth in profit. The company‘s earnings per share (EPS) also increased to 1.19 rupees per share as compared to 1.03 rupees in 2015. Besides the T&D issues there are a series of violations and misdemeanours cited in the report against all DISCOs including K-Electric.
PSP chairman stressed that party gives top importance to the Energy sector and in its manifesto has clearly spelled the importance of Transmission & Distribution network and how we end up losing 25 per cent through inefficient T&D networks. The gaps pointed out by Nepra have to be taken seriously by all DISCOs including K-Electric as it directly relates to people and economy both.
Kamal said that PSP is concerned about the average customers and feels that somewhere he is being short-circuited and made to bear the losses by way of increased tariff rates.

U.S. President Donald Trump is renewing his attack on the “fake news media” amid the widening controversy surrounding the ouster of his national security adviser and talk of Congress investigations of purported Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election last year.
READ MORE: Trump's people were in constant contact with Russians during campaign, reports claim
Trump posted a pre-dawn message on his verified Twitter account Wednesday complaining, “The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred.” He continued, “This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign.”
Story continues below This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017
On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that members of Trump's campaign team talked with Russian intelligence in the year leading up to the U.S. presidential election. According to the report, Trump's associates were repeatedly in contact with intelligence and government officials from Russia around the same time that Trump was openly praising President Vladimir Putin on the campaign trail.
CNN also confirmed the Times report on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, Trump also tweeted, “@MSNBC and @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!”
Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017
The latest tweet follows a pattern of social media messages that Trump has sent, chastising news organizations both during his campaign for the White House and in the more than three weeks since his inauguration.

With the WWE Royal Rumble 2017 match coming up in several weeks from now, speculation over who will be in the match as far as surprise superstars entering has been a hot topic. Among the names being tossed around are several NXT superstars, and of course former legends of the ring from WWE or even TNA. Many fans are looking towards a potential appearance from former NXT champion Samoa Joe, the “Perfect 10” Tye Dillinger, or even former WWE stars Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. So what are the chances that these superstars will actually make their way down to the ring as part of the 30-man field? In a recent report here at The Inquisitr, the WWE Rumors for Finn Balor returning at the Royal Rumble were discussed. Balor has been out of action ever since SummerSlam when he defeated Seth Rollins for the new WWE Universal Championship. Despite Balor saying he probably won't be back to the ring until WrestleMania, it has still kept his odds for winning the Rumble high at various sports books. Balor is among the favorites at Paddy Power, listed with 5 to 1 odds. He trails Braun Strowman (4 to 1), Chris Jericho (3 to 1), and The Undertaker (2 to 1). Samoa Joe is among favorites to possibly appear in the Royal Rumble 2017 match. [Image by WWE] While Balor may not be able to return to the ring in several weeks to win the match, there may be several other NXT stars who make their debut at a major WWE pay-per-view. As reported today by WWE Leaks, there are betting odds for superstars who might participate in the Royal Rumble match. That means they would simply make an “in-ring appearance,” but not necessarily win it. Paddy Power lists nine superstars for this category, with NXT star Tye Dillinger leading all the favorites at 3 to 10 odds. He's followed on the list by Samoa Joe at 4 to 7, and then Kurt Angle at 5 to 6 odds. There's been a lot of speculation that Tye Dillinger makes sense to enter the Rumble at the No. 10 spot, which fits with his “Perfect 10” gimmick. There are a lot of fans who would love to see Samoa Joe mix it up in the ring and then transition to the main roster, and Kurt Angle's music hitting the speakers would probably give diehard fans goosebumps while sending the arena into a frenzy. However, the way it currently looks, Angle may be a few months away from a WWE return. As Forbes recently reported from the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, Angle is planning a return to WWE around WrestleMania 33. For whatever this is worth, and keep in mind this wouldn't be the first time this has been said, but Kurt Angle has told promoters he's doing no more indie dates except one match with Alberto and another with Cody Rhodes, and then going to WWE in April. Keep in mind his people have claimed that for some time and WWE sources have denied it. The interesting aspect with Angle is he seems like he could fit well with a team like American Alpha. In prior years with WWE, Angle was aligned with “The World's Greatest Tag Team” which consisted of Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas. It would certainly make things interesting if both Angle and Benjamin returned to the Rumble, but it seems highly unlikely. Dillinger and Joe make way more sense from an availability standpoint. Could Kurt Angle make a surprise return to WWE for January's Royal Rumble? [Image by WWE] If those three rumored entrants aren't enough, there are several other interesting names listed. Shelton Benjamin is right behind Angle on the list. Also included are “The Heartbreak Kid” Shawn Michaels, both Jeff and Matt Hardy, Rey Mysterio, and the guy who inspires chants at pretty much any live WWE event: CM Punk. It's probably with good reason that Punk appears as the biggest underdog on the betting odds to actually make an appearance. In addition, Michaels, Mysterio, and The Hardy Boys seem like longshots, but the rest of the names certainly have some potential for getting into the ring in a few weeks during the big match. WWE fans, of the rumored entrants for the Royal Rumble, which ones would you like to see the most? Who do you think is most likely to appear out of the mentioned superstars? [Featured Image by WWE]

Logitech's keyboards have long been my keyboards of choice, thanks to their versatility and focus on good design. But the new Craft keyboard may be my favorite Logitech keyboard of all time – and possibly my favorite keyboard, period. The Craft is being billed as creative tool thanks to the integration of a control dial with custom functions depending on which application you're using, but it's also just a top-notch typist tool for anyone who values good craftsmanship in one of the devices they probably use more than almost any other in their daily computing work.
The Craft is a premium-priced keyboard, at least for most people, at $200. It's true that real keyboard aficionados, especially those who place a high value on mechanical switches and customizability, will likely spend more, but for Logitech's primary demographic, $200 is a lot so spend even on this essential accessory. But the Craft is a good way to spend that money if you're at all interested in typing comfortably, and having a range of convenient features that really can improve your overall computing experience in subtle but significant ways.
Craft's signature feature is the ‘Creative Input Dial,' which as mentioned can customize its function based on what application you're using. When you have the Logitech Options software installed, it'll detect which application is active by default and switch its function automatically. Plus, there's even a transition between a clicky, graduated turning action for things like volume control, and an analog, smooth turn for adjusting things like exposure in photos, and it makes a big, positive difference in terms of user experience.
147A4316 147A4313 147A4312 147A4311 View Slideshow Previous Next Exit
But the dial is not likely to be a major driver in terms of convincing most people the Craft is worth the price to upgrade from their current keyboard. Luckily, the gadget offers a lot more besides that does warrant a look in terms of upgrade consideration. For instance, it's got a great, heavy weight that helps it sit firmly on your desk no matter how furiously you type. Plus, there's Logitech easy switch functionality built in, so you can connect it to up to three devices at once (using either Logitech's Unifying Receiver or Bluetooth) and switch between them with the press of a single button.
The keyboard also features a dedicated number pad, full-size arrow keys, and ambient backlighting. It charges its internal battery via USB C, which is great if you're already using a MacBook or other modern computer that charges the same way, and it features dual-purpose keys for Command and Start to switch seamlessly between PC and Mac use.
Craft's typing experience might be the best reason to upgrade, however – its keys are slightly concave, giving you great resting and key stroke experiences, and the travel depth feels just right, with more give than the standard Apple wireless keyboard. The finish on the key surfaces is also very pleasing in a way that's hard to describe: They're matte and feel like they're slightly grippy, and while it may seem like a small thing, if you're typing for many hours per day (like, say, if you're a blogger) it definitely adds up.
Logitech has done a terrific job with the Craft in terms of look, feel and add-on features, in short, and it's easily my favorite keyboard at the moment. At $200, it's probably not for everyone, but it's also well-positioned to be a premium keyboard option for the average consumer looking to treat themselves without going totally overboard into the world of hardcore keyboard fanaticism.
Apple Inc on Monday confirmed it had reached a deal to acquire Shazam Entertainment Ltd, the U.K.-based app that lets users identify songs by pointing a smartphone at the audio source.
Apple did not give a price for the acquisition. Technology news website TechCrunch reported the deal on Friday with a price of as much as $400 million, far short of the most recent $1 billion valuation for privately held Shazam.
Apple said Shazam would be a “natural fit” with its Apple Music streaming service and it would help users discover new songs. Apple Music has 27 million users and competes against Spotify Ltd, which has 60 million users. Apple said Shazam's team would be joining the Cupertino company.
In a statement, Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said Shazam “is used by hundreds of millions of people around the world, across multiple platforms. ... We have exciting plans in store, and we look forward to combining with Shazam upon approval of today's agreement.”
Apple did not elaborate on its plans, but the company will not be able to make any major changes to Shazam until it secures regulatory approval. Shazam is also available on Android-based devices, but Apple did not say whether it would keep the Android version available. Shazam ended support for a version of its software that runs on Microsoft Corp's Windows PCs earlier this year.

‘Khooti Rahi Bur Thalay' means “the donkey remained under the tree.” the first time I heard this Punjabi proverb was in a meeting of Karkunan Tehreek-e-Pakistan, this was a group of old boys of the Pakistan Movement led by Nawab Zulfiqar Mamdot, my father Nazir A. Malik was elected as the Secretary General of the group. In one of the meetings a disgruntled, outspoken worker called ‘Muhammad Hussain Bombas' of Ichara narrated his experience on the eve of independence on August 14, 1947.
The title of ‘Bombas' was bestowed upon him as he was given the task of disrupting anti Pakistan rallies of Jamaat-e-Islami whose headquarter was in Ichra, Lahore. Most freedom workers are always tainted as disruptionists and traitors. Hero of one cause is usually the terrorist of the other. The thana in Ichra kept a close watch on his activities and was often summoned there. On the day of independence, he broke loose and surrounded the ‘Den of colonial control'. The SHO was in shock and scared so he apologized for his brutal behaviour in the past and promised to serve in the future. On that day ‘Bombas' slept a happy, free man. The freedom proved to be short lived. Early morning on August 15, 1947 there was a knock on his door. On opening he found the same Thanedar in uniform who had come to get ‘Bombas' by repeating the words that nothing had changed “Khooti Rahi Bur Thalay”. Within twenty four hours it was all over. Till today our heroes are projected as zeros while zeros are propagated as heroes.
Only four countries (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka) have continued with the colonial system of governance that they inherited. In the USA all files were burnt, a new constitution to preserve freedom was enacted. Singapore followed the same course. Recently in 1989 when China took control of Hong Kong, while Chris Patton the last governor was driven to the airport his mansion was converted into a Colonial Museum. No Chinese every got to rule from there. China won its freedom two years after the partition of the sub-continent yet it progressed by leap and bounds and is the second largest economy of the world today.
In seventy years some lessons should have been learnt. While we claim to be a constitutional democracy, there has been only one free and fair election. Political leadership has been imposed on us with disastrous consequences. After ten manipulated ballots since 1977, another electoral contest is being planned for 2018.
More than anything else, Pakistan needs another credible election to move the status-quo from under the tree where it has been stuck for over seven decades. On his own merit Imran Khan can emerge victorious he does not need support of the establishment. On the other hand PML(N) will have to face the ballot without the support of the ‘Patwaris' and ‘Thana' the very bane of its strength. It is in the interest of democracy that political battles are fought on political battle grounds with no outside interference as he has been the case in the past.
As long as the “seasonal birds” remain in the political arena, free and fair election will remain a big challenge. A split mandate is being projected. Political parties can change the outcome by organising their efforts instead of relying on external crutches. The ballot has to be made credible to be acceptable to all the contestants. After a free and fair election the mandate must be respected and the winning party allowed to govern in the best interests of the masses.
Yes indeed there should be respect for the vote but more importantly for the voter for whom the show is organised. Democracy is strengthened through participation not exclusion. People stand by their leaders if they truly represent them and fight for their cause, individual interests are short lived both for the voter and the voted. In the end it is ideology which keeps the donkey moving. In the USA the two mainstream political parties use animal symbols. Democrats use the symbol of donkey while the Republicans use the elephant. While the donkey is a beast of burden which serves the common man, the Republicans on the other hand believe in growth/wealth accumulation which is then expected to result in a trickle-down effect.
Unfortunately our donkey refuses to move, first the elections are manipulated then the contestants fight it out while governance suffers. Minar-e-Pakistan represents history of Pakistan. Jinnah stood here in 1940 to demand a separate homeland for the Muslims of India. In 1946, his party won the elections and earned the right to lead. In 1971, ZAB stood here as an elected leader. On April 29, 2018 Kaptaan used the same venue to announce his ‘Naya Pakistan'.

Lahore - The main I-Day ceremony in Islamabad was to be held at Parliament premises but it had to be arranged at the Convention Centre this time too because of inclement weather, according to a BBC report.
When President Mamnoon was delivering his speech yesterday, there was a noise created by buzzing of the children and flapping of the plastic flags they were hoisting.
Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa took notice of it and told a security staff to make them quiet. That man conveyed the order to another security guy who waved to the children and then put his finger on lips. The gesture worked and the noise began to subside.
When Prime Minister Khaqan Abbasi came in there, he went straight to his seat. But, the president, the senate chairman and national assembly speaker shook hands with the high command of the armed forces and other dignitaries sitting in front two rows, before taking their seats.
All the attendants stood in their seats and clapped for the Chinese deputy premier when he returned after delivering his speech, but only a few people gave a standing ovation to President Mamnoon Hussain.

Quentin Tarantino says Brad Pitt-Leo DiCaprio have 'most exciting star dynamic' since Robert Redford-Paul Newman
Los Angeles: Sony Pictures Entertainment Chairman Tom Rothman assured theater owners Monday that his studio is dedicated to appealing to a range of audiences — from global franchises such as Spider-Man and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series to family films, action pics, comedies and even Quentin Tarantino's Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.
Both Tarantino and DiCaprio surprised the audience of exhibitors with their appearance at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, but unlike most of the films Sony would hype Monday with new footage and celebrities, they had nothing to show. They haven't shot a frame yet.
"It's hard to speak about a film that we haven't done yet," DiCaprio said on stage.
The "hush-hush" film will take place in Hollywood in 1969 at the "height of the counter-culture explosion," the famed director said.
"This is probably the closest to Pulp Fiction that I've done," Tarantino said, of the kind of Los Angeles film he hopes to make. He said Pitt and DiCaprio together will be "the most exciting star dynamic duo since Robert Redford and Paul Newman."
Tarantino also took the opportunity to remind the theater owners at the convention, that he too is an exhibitor — he owns the historic New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles.

Cal State Stanislaus officials launched an “immediate investigation” this weekend after one of their students, white supremacist Nathan Damigo, was captured on video punching a woman in the face during a melee in Berkeley.
“The university has zero tolerance for the use of violence and we will take all of the necessary legal and disciplinary measures to ensure that all students and everyone on campus have a safe and secure environment,” Cal State Stanislaus President Ellen Junn said in a statement Sunday.
Violent confrontations broke out in Berkeley on Saturday. Clashes between backers and critics of President Trump — and scuffles between self-described anti-fascists and white nationalists — resulted in 21 arrests and numerous injuries.
Damigo charged a diminutive woman who was involved in the fighting and punched her in the face, then ran away into the crowd.
Video of the punch went viral, with many on social media calling for Damigo's arrest and his expulsion from Cal State Stanislaus, where he is a social sciences student.
Actor Chris Evans, who plays Marvel's Nazi-punching superhero Captain America, tweeted video of Damigo's punch on Saturday, saying, “I hope I run into Nathan.”
Damigo did not respond to requests for comment.
The presence of the 30-year-old former Marine corporal continues to present problems at Cal State Stanislaus.
Damigo is the founder of a white nationalist group called Identity Evropa, which posts fliers around college campuses nationwide with slogans like “Let's Become Great Again” and “Protect Your Heritage.” In October, after Identity Evropa's material appeared at Cal State Stanislaus, someone responded by posting fliers on campus with Damigo's face and a warning that he was a “known white supremacist and violent offender.”
Junn said in a statement at the time that while safety was her top priority, she believed in the freedom of speech on campus, even if it was offensive.
On Sunday, Junn said the university was in contact with “relevant officials and will take appropriate and timely actions to address this issue.” She did not reference Damigo by name.
Janice Curtin, a spokeswoman for Cal State Stanislaus, said in an email to the Times on Monday that the university was not contacted by police but that Junn had received email and Twitter messages beginning Saturday.
As part of its investigation, the university's Police Department will be in contact with Berkeley police, she said. University leadership and campus legal counsel will be assembling teams to determine how to handle the situation, Curtin said.
Damigo, who was profiled by The Times in December, is an Iraq War veteran who was convicted of armed robbery after drunkenly pulling a gun on a La Mesa cabdriver he thought was Iraqi.
In November 2007, he had been home for a month after his second tour of duty and was suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder, drug and alcohol abuse and paranoia, according to San Diego County court records. A few days after the anniversary of a friend's combat death, he spent a night drinking and went for a walk with a gun. He came across the cabdriver, put a gun to his head and robbed the man of $43, records show.
He started reading books about race and identity in prison, he told The Times. He was greatly influenced, he said, by “My Awakening,” the book by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.
Richard B. Spencer, one of America's most prominent white nationalists, has come to Damigo's defense. Spencer was punched in the head by a black-clad person while being interviewed on Inauguration Day.
In a YouTube video, Spencer compared reaction to the video of him getting punched — which prompted the New York Times to ask, “Is it O.K. to punch a Nazi?” — to outrage over the video of Damigo punching the woman.
“This is not a situation where he randomly sucker-punched some woman,” Spencer said. “In fact, there was a maelstrom going on that he was involved in.”

Hartlepool residents have reacted with sadness at the news that the town's historic Wesley Building has gone up in flames.
The fire swept through the former church and nightclub at around 8:30pm on Saturday night, with flames seen around 20ft above the roof.
Flames seen around 20ft above the roof.
Two appliances from Stranton and a hydraulic platform from Saltburn were initially called in to tackle the blaze and at its height five fire engines were called to the scene along with a command control unit, two hydraulic platforms and a welfare unit.
During the incident Victoria Road and Wesley Square were closed and people were advised to avoid the area.
On Sunday crews returned to the scene at 8.20am after the roof collapsed.

Where can you find the Nike+ Sport Band look for your non-Nike+ Apple Watch? iMore's got you covered!
Apple Watch Nike+ is nigh-identical to the regular, aluminum Apple Watch Series 2. But its Sport Band is something else entirely. It's got an awesome, wacky, octopus-y perforated design, in black, silver, gray, and vivid green that's unlike any other band on the market.
You can get an official Nike+ Sport band directly from Apple for $50, but you don't have to pay the Nike brand price to get the Nike brand look.
Here are the best options if you're looking to get the Nike+ Sport Band look for less! 💰
Ouluoqi Silicone Band with Holes
Brand copycats are usually pretty easy to spot, but with this one it isn't so easy. Available in four different colors, the Ouluoqi Apple Watch band does a fantastic job of replicating the Nike Band, but for way less!
If you don't have the $50 it costs for an official Nike+ Sport band, this one will give you the look and feel you are after. It is made to fit all versions of the Apple Watch, and only comes in a size M/L.
You can order it in a black/gray combo, black/volt combo, silver/volt combo, and a silver/white combo, so you can pick the one that matches your style the best. Coming in at between $7 and $13, you really can't go wrong by picking up a few of the colors to match your different outfits.
See at Amazon
Senter soft silicone replacement Series 2
Highly-rated, comfortable, and darn near close to the real thing, this Senter soft silicone replacement for the Apple Watch Series 2 is another great option to keep in mind if you're looking for that Nike+ style.
The Senter can be easily adjusted depending on your wrist size, just like the Nike+ band; unlike the Nike+ band, however, you have a ton of vibrant, bright colors to pick from!
For around $16, you can pick up your futuristic accessory in azure/navy, black/grey, black/green, black/yellow, grey/green, grey/white, navy/white, pink/azure, purple/green, and red/black.
See at Amazon
Yearscase soft silicone bracelet
Many of these bands are only available for the 42mm versions of the Apple Watch, but this one comes in both a 38mm and 42mm size, so no one gets left out.
You'll have less color options, with only the black/volt and black/grey configurations being available in each size, but according to the reviews, it is worth it for the quality that you're getting here. From Jingyuan's Amazon review:
Looks and feels like the Apple Version, have no difference. Wears comfortable, Extremely nice watch band.
With more than 200 reviews the band sits at just barely under the 5-star mark. Priced at under $15, there is a whole lot of value here. If you are looking for a great band to match the look of the Nike version, this may be the one for you!
See at Amazon
What's your pick?
Is there a third-party Apple Watch band you've found that fills the Nike+ band-shaped hole in your heart? Let us know in the comments below, and we'll be sure to check it out!

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Gold prices edged down on Wednesday as a robust U.S. dollar weighed on the market, but concerns about political turmoil in Italy and Sino-U.S. trade conflict limited losses.
Spot gold was 0.2-percent lower at $1,296 per ounce by 0736 GMT.
U.S. gold futures for June delivery were down 0.3 percent at $1,295.40 per ounce.
"The stronger dollar is the most significant headwind," said Stephen Innes, APAC trading head at OANDA.
"With the yellow metal's sensitivity to the U.S. dollar on full display, it is unlikely gold will move significantly higher until we reach the EU 'Crisis Zone' which we are nowhere near at this stage."
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, hovered near its 6-1/2 month peak touched in the previous session.
Investors fear that repeat elections in Italy - which could come as soon as July - May become a de-facto referendum on Italian membership of the currency bloc and the country's role in the European Union.
"People are really worried about what's happening in Europe and the U.S.-China trade tensions ... we also see U.S. bond yields drop," said Richard Xu, a fund manager at HuaAn Gold, China's biggest gold exchange-traded fund.
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields on Tuesday registered their largest one-day drop since Brexit nearly two years ago.
Meanwhile, China on Wednesday lashed out at Washington's unexpected statement that it still holds the threat of imposing tariffs on $50 bln of Chinese goods, saying Beijing was ready to fight back if Washington was looking to ignite a trade war.
"That (U.S.-China conflict) is driving down risk appetite, hence the stock markets are tanking," Xu said.
Asian stocks extended a global sell-off on Wednesday as Italy's political crisis rippled across financial markets.
Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose 0.35 percent to 851.45 tonnes on Tuesday.
In other precious metals, spot silver was down 0.6 percent at $16.28 an ounce.
Platinum fell 0.4 percent to $900.45 an ounce, while palladium was 0.2-percent lower at $977.31.

What disqualifies you from a mortgage?
MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (WFXB) – There is no doubt that business is booming here on the Grand Strand . Everywhere you look, there seem to be more houses, more developments, more people moving in. So if you're one of those people, you probably need a mortgage…but what do you do if you can't get approved?
Faith Adams from Atlantic Bay Mortgage Group explains how one gets disqualified, and what one can do to resolve the situation.
Two women, two parallel lives, 70 years apart… both hit by a terrible tragedy and both beset by secrets and lies.
The invisible threads of fate are drawing together their dramatic stories at a beautiful Jacobean mansion deep in the Oxfordshire countryside, a place where hidden truths will finally be revealed.
Lulu Taylor, queen of a string of classic winter-warming novels like The Snow Rose and The Winter Children, casts a snow-spangled spell in a gripping, dark-edged and atmospheric mystery which comes ice-packed with intrigue, menace and romance, and stars two young widows facing up to deceit and betrayal.
In 1947, the worst winter in decades hits England, cutting off the inhabitants of Kings Harcourt Manor, a house dating back to the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods. For Thomasina (Tommy) Elliot, widowed at the start of war, it is particularly hard because the burden of taking care of the family falls on her.
She has the solace of her two children, Antonia and Harry, and the interesting presence of her brother's friend, Fred Burton Brown, who was badly burned in an accident during the war years in North Africa.
But there is also Tommy's difficult and constantly sniping mother, and Barbara Hastings, a manipulative, mysterious figure from her past who has turned up unexpectedly needing a temporary home and who appears to want a piece of Tommy's future as well.
In the present day, we meet Caitlyn Balfour who thinks her marriage to good-looking businessman Patrick is a success. He might be a ‘controlling perfectionist' who has talked Caitlyn into sending their only child Max to a boarding prep school… but Patrick is one of the few people not to fall head over heels for her friend Sara, a pre-Raphaelite style beauty who seems to catch the eye of every man.
She thought they were happy until Patrick is killed in a road accident after phoning her only minutes before with a strange, garbled message saying he had something to tell her about Sara.
With her existence turned upside down, Caitlyn is forced to reassess everything she thought about her marriage, what she truly knows about Patrick, and his real feelings for her best friend. In the refuge of an old manor house in Oxfordshire, she begins to discover the truth…
Taylor has evolved into an exciting and talented novelist, immersing her readers in compelling, beautifully written stories which deliver emotion, rich psychological insight, intrigue and suspense as well as plenty of stunning twists and turns.
In Her Frozen Heart, she cleverly weaves between the fortunes of Caitlyn and Tommy, exploring fascinating similarities in their fraught situations but also exposing the vast differences between the privations, rationing and social restrictions of women in the tough post-war period and the experiences and pressures of women in the 21st century.
Thrilling, escapist and provocative, this is the perfect fireside read for winter nights!

Hello again! It's me, Jenny S. Hopkins, your resident anonymous advice columnist. I hope you all are taking care of yourselves as the perpetual midterm season descends upon us.
For me personally, it's been difficult to make time for things other than studying. This weekend, I went on a road trip down south. Getting off campus really helped me clear my mind and gave me a nice break from the daily grind here at Hopkins.
If October is making you feel overwhelmed or you are in need of advice, don't forget that you can always submit your questions to me at dearjennyshopkins@gmail.com.
Anyway, let's move onto this week's question. In my previous column, I heard from a reader who was struggling to make Baltimore feel more like home.
This week we're switching gears completely to a topic of a more intimate nature. That's right, today we're talking about S-E-X, baby.
Dear Jenny S. Hopkins,
I had a sex dream about someone who's not my boyfriend, and it's made me feel really uncomfortable. I know that you can't control what you dream about at night, and I know that it doesn't mean that I am not in love with my boyfriend (I love him very much and my attraction for him hasn't decreased at all).
But what do I do about this awkwardness I feel around the person? It makes me feel embarrassed whenever I see him.
Signed,
Confused and Embarrassed
Dear Confused,
I've decided to simply address you as “Confused” because in my opinion you have nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed about. Sexual desires are normal; Sex dreams are, too.
Your question, though, is a good one. Many people have experienced the old “I had a sex dream about my friend” dilemma.
What does it all mean? Should you psychoanalyze your dream? Should you try to pretend the dream never happened?
Well, Confused, you definitely do not need to freak out or put so much weight on the situation at hand. While dreams can give you insight into your subconscious thoughts and desires, they can't tell you everything.
There are many reasons for which you might have dreamt about your friend. Maybe you are craving a closer relationship with this person or you want to get to know them better. Alternatively, there may be qualities that you admire about your friend that you subconsciously want to take on.
Or maybe you are simply attracted to your friend. There's nothing wrong with that. Does this mean you're being unfaithful? Certainly not. You can't help who you find attractive.
I will say that if the sex dreams become a common occurrence, it may be worth examining your current relationship and determining if there is anything lacking, namely intimacy. Physical and emotional intimacy are both important parts of a healthy relationship, so just check in with yourself to make sure your needs are being met.
We could talk all day about the psychological motives behind your sex dreams, Confused, but that's a rabbit hole I feel is not worth going down. So let's move on to the heart of the matter: the fact that your dream is impacting your real life.
I can understand that you may feel uncomfortable around this person now that you have seen them in a different way. In terms of what to do about the awkwardness, you just have to tough this one out, especially if you see your friend often.
Don't avoid them. Talk about things you normally talk about. Sit next to them. Say hi. It might sound crazy for me to be making these recommendations because all of this seems so intuitive, but sometimes you have to go through the motions until you feel a little less awkward.
In time, the awkwardness will pass. Until then, sweet dreams. May they be restful and unsexy.
Best,
Jenny S. Hopkins
The Easton Police Department responded to 101 calls from Aug. 7 to 10, including two complaints of disorderly conduct, and a report of deceased chickens found by the side of the road.
Domestic fight
Officers were dispatched to Westwood Drive for a report of a son and father yelling at each other Aug. 8 at 10:05 p.m. The argument began with siblings arguing between each other about ice cream being spilled in the vehicle and then again on purpose in the bedroom, police said.
The father attempted to break up the argument between the two juveniles, police said. One of the juveniles began to scream and ran to the bathroom and locked himself in the bathroom. The father continued yelling at the juvenile, who would not unlock the bathroom door.
The father then struck the door using his knee, putting a hole in the door. He later stated that this was done in an attempt to check on his son for his safety, police said.
The father was issued a misdemeanor summons for disorderly conduct. He was ordered to appear in court on Aug. 9.
Disorderly conduct
On Aug. 9 at 12:09 a.m., after receiving a 911 call, officer's arrived to the home of local residents because of an argument between the couple, which, as the argument continued, became physical.
The argument started when the first victim/offender started yelling at the second victim/offender about an incident that took place out of town last week, police said.
Both offenders were issued a misdemeanor summons for disorderly conduct and ordered to appear in court Aug. 9.
Deceased chickens
A police officer found three deceased chickens with parts missing but feathers intact on Route 58 Aug. 9 at 1:36 p.m.

Sonam Kapoor says gender disparity in Bollywood will continue if actresses don't take united stand
Sonam Kapoor, known for her unabashed honesty, has revealed how she has rejected movies owing to low remuneration.
Though the Neerja star did not name any film, she said that she was recently offered a project for which the makers offered her too less money. "Recently I was offered a project, which I was excited for, but the money being paid was shit. I made a call and said, this is very disrespectful. There was shock on the other side. I told them, you put me in a position after being ten years in the industry, after giving the most profitable film Neerja a year ago so please tell me why is it that this is what you decided to give me," she told The Indian Express.
"They were like 'Our last film with so-and-so star didn't do well so we don't have that much money.' I was like, because of this xyz star whose film didn't do well, the one person whose film actually did very well you want to underpay me to pay this 'star' more? I told them to move on and get someone else as frankly, it was very disheartening," she further added, in her interview to The Indian Express.
Sonam also explained how situations started getting competitive as she kept rejecting films due to the pay disparity and those films were getting accepted by other actresses. The other actors who were ready to work for a lesser amount made the journey a little difficult for her.
She said if she took a stand, there was always another actress who was ready to submit herself to the low remuneration. She claimed that the pay disparity will continue if the actresses do not take a united stand, and keep pulling each other down.
Sonam is currently shooting for Padman as the female lead opposite Akshay Kumar. The actress has also recently been quite vocal about the need of hygiene for women and awareness on menstruation issues.

Iowa senior lineman Keegan Render has been named to the Rimington Trophy Preseason Watch List, the Boomer Esiason Foundation announced today.
The Rimington Trophy is awarded to the nation's premier center in college football and is presented annually by the Boomer Esiason Foundation.
Render started in all of Iowa's 13 games in 2017. The Indianola, Iowa native saw action at center, right guard, and left guard last year, while playing in every offensive down in five of 13 games. Render was part of two 50-point offensive outputs, as the Hawkeyes gained 487 yards of total offense against Ohio State and 505 yards of total offense against Nebraska.
The Rimington Trophy winner will be announced on Jan. 12, 2019, at the Rococo Theatre in Lincoln, Nebraska. The center with the most first team votes will be determined the winner.
Render and the Hawkeyes open their season on Sept. 1 against Northern Illinois.
