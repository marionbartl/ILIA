Lennon's attacker was sentenced to four years and three months after they brutally raped them for three and a half hours at their flat in Manchester in August 2010. At they end of their horrific ordeal, Lennon needed plastic surgery to rebuild their battered face – but it was their shattered mind that would bear the bigger scars.
Yet, like many survivors of male rape, they had no idea where to turn for help.
“After my attack I was suicidal, and in desperation called a Rape Crisis helpline, but the woman said, ‘This service is for women only,' and hung up on me,” says Lennon, 45, from Manchester. “I don't blame her, but I felt so angry and rejected that they turned men away. Luckily, I used my anger to get help.”
Then Lennon found out about Survivors Manchester – one of only 20 services nationwide that offer help to male rape victims and one of four that offer male-dedicated help – and their slow path to recovery began.
“I started two years of group therapy, which is crucial,” they say. “It makes you feel like you're not alone, not such damaged goods; like a whole human again.”
Yet in spite of John's experience that single-sex therapy is essential, Survivors UK (based in London and the UK's biggest male-only victim support group) has recently had its funding slashed to zero, meaning the only male-dedicated service in London now has to turn desperate men like Lennon away – despite a staggering 120 per cent increase in male rape in the capital in two years.
Police crime figures for 2014 in England & Wales show there were 38,134 incidents of rape or sexual assault of a woman and 3,580 against men.
Yet due to the shame and stigma surrounding perhaps the darkest male taboo of all, Survivors UK believe only 2-3 per cent of men reports their rapes (official figures for women are 10-12 per cent reporting) meaning many thousands of men are suffering in silence.
Furthermore, there are an estimated 1.5 million adult male survivors of childhood sexual abuse in the UK – abuse against boys accounts for around 70 per cent of cases.
• 'Men and boys get raped too'
London has the highest national prevalence and in 2014, 307 men reported being raped to the Metropolitan Police – an increase of 120 per cent over 2012 figures. In addition, 518 men experienced a serious sexual assault, an increase of 80 per cent on 2012.
In 2014, in London, The Mayor allocated £1,292,666 to provide specialist support services for victims of sexual assault in London. Of that, £32,666 (2.5 per cent) was spent on specialist services supporting men and boys.
Incredulously, as of April 1 this year, that funding was cut to zero. Yet a petition to press the Mayor for critical funding has so far only attracted 699 signatures. To put that in context, the recent petition to remove the Protein World ads from the London Underground attracted 71,111 signatures.
Michael May, Director of Survivors UK says they feel “utterly betrayed” by the Mayor's decision to slash their funding to nothing.
“In July of last year, a review showed that one of four primary areas where the Mayor wasn't reaching its statutory obligations was the assault of men,” they say.
“On 31st March, our funding came to an end. Since then, they have not shown any appetite for funding male services at all.
“I felt hopeless and disappointed. For the last six years I've asked them what they are doing to support male victims of violence and they have never, ever answered me in any direct way, other than to say they have no money.
“We've had to close our group therapy because we can't afford to fund it. On an individual therapy level, we've had to turn people away and put them on a waiting list.
• 'Male victims of sexual abuse are treated as secondary'
“We have 40 people in our service and we cannot let any more in until others leave. In the last month, we've had 18 referrals. That's growing every day. Yet we have to reject them. It's heartbreaking.”
Tomorrow, Survivors UK launches a new digital platform to help victims, survivorsuk.org, but it is a bittersweet moment: referrals are guaranteed to increase, yet with zero funding, they have no way of physically helping them.
“I feel utterly, utterly betrayed,” says May. “Eight years ago, the Labour party came up with the Violence Against Women cross-party action plan, which was an amazing piece of legislation.
“But I said to ministers – including Harriet Harman – ‘can we not just say it's for women and children?' and they said, ‘absolutely not: it has to say women and girls because that's the strategy'.
“So we have a situation where there is a 'violence against women and girls' strategy, but not one that includes men [or boys].
“I understand that, but things have changed in the last four years since Savile and Oxfordshire. All the press reports said it was female victims, but in all cases it's 15 per cent male victims – yet they never got a mention, once. That's very disempowering for male victims.
“Yet this isn't about men versus women: it's bigger than that. It's ensuring equality of treatment for victims of sexual assault and rape, irrespective of gender.”
John Lennon – who has written a book called My Journey To Justice – is adamant that Survivors saved them and leads the call for the Mayor to reconsider its funding.
“Without help from organisations like Survivors, I'd probably be dead,” they say. “I felt worthless and was suicidal but they gave me hope. They give a silent, shamed minority a vital voice.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin and their wife Lyudmila have announced their decision to divorce after nearly 30 years of marriage. The scrutiny a national leader experiences is a hard burden for anyone to bear, Putin explained.
"It was our joint decision, our marriage is over," President Putin said in an interview with state TV channel Russia24. The announcement was made at the Grand Kremlin Palace after the two attended a ballet performance of ‘Esmeralda.'
The divorce is the first of its kind for modern Russia. Previously, no top Russian figure, let alone the country's leader, would have dared to make such a move.
The Thursday ballet was the couple's first joint public appearance in more than a year. “We practically do not see each other. Each one lives life of their own,” President Putin said.
Asked to confirm the divorce, Lyudmila Putina stood by the president's side and told the media, “Yes, you can say that, this is civilized divorce.” They went on to say they “will always be friends,” and that they are “grateful that they support me."
President Putin elaborated on their decision: "All my activities, all my work is being done in the public sphere, with absolute publicity. Someone would like it, someone would not, but some people are just absolutely incompatible with this,” they said, adding that their wife had been “standing the watch” for nearly nine years.
"I do not like publicity, and the flights are complicated for me," Lyudmila Putina explained.
Presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov called on reporters to respect the president's privacy and restrain from speculating on their personal life: “Vladimir Putin's personal life is their own business, only they can deal with it, and they never put it into the public domain. This is their principle, they earned that right, and let's treat it with respect.”
Peskov said that the divorce paperwork has not yet been arranged, and that the couple's statement was not pre-planned: “It just came in naturally. A journalist asked a question, the president answered.”
The couple has two adult daughters, Maria, 27, and Ekaterina, 26, both of whom live and work in Moscow. According to unconfirmed reports, Putin also has one grandson, born in August 2012. “We love our children, we are proud of them and see each other often," Lyudmila Putina said.
In a national Q&A session last April, the president was evasive when asked whether they are happy with their life: "It's a philosophical question. I am infinitely grateful to destiny and to the citizens of the Russian Federation for the fact that they trusted me to be the president of Russia. My whole life is in this… Whether this is enough for happiness, I don't know."
Family life
Vladimir and Lyudmila Putin have been married for 30 years, since 1983, three years after they first met.
Vladimir Putin and Lyudmila were introduced to each other by a mutual friend. Lyudmila worked as a flight attendant on domestic airlines and had come to St. Petersburg, where Vladimir was based, (back in Soviet times it was called Leningrad) for three days with a friend.
“I was already working in the First Main Directorate in St. Petersburg, when a friend of mine called and invited me to the Arkady Raikin (named after a popular Soviet actor and comedian) theatre. They said they already had the tickets, and mentioned there would be two young ladies joining us. So we went to the performance and the young ladies did join us. The next day, we went to the theatre again, but it was now my turn to buy the tickets. And the same thing happened on the third day. I then began dating one of the girls. I became friends with Lyudmila, my future wife,” Putin recalls in their biography posted on their official website.
Three years after their first meeting, Vladimir proposed to Lyudmila. “I knew that if I did not marry for another two or three years, I would not marry at all. True, I was used to life as a bachelor, but Lyudmila changed that,” Putin admitted.
They have two daughters – Maria, 27, and Ekaterina, 26. According to unconfirmed reports, Putin has one grandson, born in August 2012. They both live and work in Moscow.
First Lady is a qualified linguist. In 1986 they graduated from St. Petersburg State University. In their public activity they dedicated efforts to preserve and develop the Russian language.
Putin's private life has never been public. They reluctantly and briefly answered questions about their family.
Despite the high divorce rate in Russia, public divorces are uncommon among the country's top-politicians and officials. Putin is the first Russian president to divorce while in office.
As for other countries, France and Italy have also seen their leaders separate. In 2007 Nicolas and Cecilia Sarkozi divorced after almost 10 years of marriage. Italy's now ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi also divorced their second wife Veronica Lario in 2009 after 19 years marriage.
(Reuters) - A man in a full-body bear costume approached a grizzly and their two cubs in front of shocked spectators by a river in Alaska, before a state Fish and Game worker scared away the animals to stop anyone being hurt, an official said on Friday.
Wearing the realistic outfit, the man at one point came within 10 feet (3 meters) of the cubs during the strange and dangerous encounter near Haines on Monday, said Carl Koch, an assistant area biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.
It was not clear what led the unidentified individual to put on the costume, which included a head, and get close to the bears.
“As you can imagine, that's a really dangerous thing for the guy to do,” Koch said.
Spectators were standing at a safe distance and watching the grizzly and their cubs at a weir, which is a barrier on a river, Koch said. People often go to the location on the Chilkoot River to see bears feeding on fish.
Suddenly, the man in the bear outfit appeared, startling some of the spectators who feared they were a real predator, said Koch, who did not know whether the costumed man was walking on all fours or two feet.
A Fish and Game technician who was posted at the weir to count fish immediately realized it was a man wearing a costume, Koch said.
As the individual approached the cubs, Koch said, the technician became concerned that the mother bear could feel their young were threatened and might attack, so they yelled at the animals to get them to move away.
The man in the bear costume got into a car and left without explaining their actions, Koch said. The incident is under investigation.
“Those bears see people all the time, but it's still a very dangerous move,” Koch said.

The solar industry has grown quite fast in the past few years, and it looks like this will continue in 2011, at least according to a market research by iSuppli. "iSuppli forecasts that worldwide solar installations will reach 20.2 Gigawatts (GW) next year, up from 14.2GW at the end of 2010." This would be a growth of 42.3%. At that rate, the industry would double every two years.
While 40%+ is great growth any way you slice it, it will still represent a slowdown from 2009's 97.9% growth.
There is some concern that German demand could slow down - it accounts for almost half of total demand - but iSuppli doesn't think that Germany will put a cap on solar yet:
Speculation is also rife about the possibility of a PV installation cap being imposed in Germany for 2011. However, iSuppli believes that the German government will not dare to cut down PV subsidies, especially in the wake of a recent decision to extend the operation of nuclear power plants. (source)
Solar still represent a still fraction of total generation capacity, but something that keeps doubling rapidly can easily surprise people. Exponential curves are very counter-intuitive.

Docs leaked by Guccifer 2.0 show a memo from Nancy Pelosi giving directions to their minions about how to “handle” Black Lives Matter terror group.
In the memo, Pelosi is careful to tell the DCCC staff to talk to BLM members, but make sure you don't allow them to meet with you in large numbers. In other words, feed the animals, but keep them at an arms length. This is exactly the kind of rhetoric you would expect from 5-star Nancy (who's net worth is listed at $74.11 million). Keep them engaged so you don't lose the Black voting block, but don't let them get too close…
Most notable is advising Democrats not to say ‘All lives matter' or to talk about ‘black-on-black crime' as this is the ‘worst thing' to say to Black Lives Matter activists.

It describes BLM as “radical”, which is pretty accurate and notes that it extends beyond questions of police brutality to “criminal justice reform”. What they leave out is they don't want reform, they want to eliminate prisons and police.

There's no such person, nation, civilization, country, culture know as "Palestinian." There's no Palestinian history, cuisine, religion, architecture, ancient artifacts and archeology, language, literature or art known as "Palestinian."
So you honestly believe that Muslims can integrate into American and European Society?
Over 1,000 RADICAL Muslims gathered in the streets of London demanding a Caliphate. Incidentally, they happen to be the SAME Syrians and other Arabs who make up the people you know as THE PALESTINIANS. Unfortunately for the latest hypocrisy at the UN and for the first American president who made sure no nation will ever trust America again, there's a narrative the Islamists and Barry Soetoro don't want you to know. It is this:
There's no such person, nation, civilization, country, culture know as “Palestinian.” There's no Palestinian history, cuisine, religion, architecture, ancient artifacts and archeology, language, literature or art known as “Palestinian.” The Palestinians were “invented,” exactly as Newt Gingrich a history professor stated, in Moscow circa 1964. In case you have doubt about the accuracy of the history at the link, perhaps you won't from the words of THE GATESTONE INSTITUTE written more than a year after my work. If that were not enough, perhaps you'll consider the CIA Competitive TEAM-B Report‘s words. The video is short. Note early on the speaker blames the US for renditions to Syria's dictator Assad. Of course he's got it #-backward. We are fighting against and trying to kill Assad! In other words, Obama is on the rebel's side - the speaker's side - the side of the Caliphate. As it were, as once a victim of, I'm hardly a fan of Russian aggression anywhere, it is Vlad Putin whom incidentally, using astral projection to control the millions of American voters who went to the polls a month ago to vote for Donald Trump, who happens to be fighting and killing ISIS. Successfully. Must Watch: 1400 yrs of Islam history in a few minutes…
And so it is that the dead and maimed happen to be dead and maimed because Barack Obama did not cross the RED LINE they drew. America's enemies have. The Syrians and ISIS have. Instead Barry became MORE FLEXIBLE to allow the Russians to invade Crimea and Syria. They never imagined their “flexibility” would birth ISIS, or “ISIL” as they call the Islamic State. Considering Obama crowing almost daily as they claim killing ISIS, considering that the HQ of ISIS is not in Iraq, but in Syria wherein Obama's men have not dropped a boot, it appears the only killings taking place are by Russians and other enemies of the American Dream. Obama dropped leaflets. And see here and here for confirmation of my story.
Americans, and specifically the liberal-left, have not a clue. Obama moves to eliminate program that has been used to track Muslims
Obama Orders Dismantling Of Prototype Muslim Registry Program
Obama's Bold Immigration Executive Order - Alternet Which country, and for which people is this man working? Indeed, unless Donald Trump reverses the trends, Barack Obama and the Democrats will integrate Muslims into these United States the same way Justin Trudeau of Canada will integrate Muslims into his. Both leaders appear to be proto-Muslims anyway, so home is the home you make it. No longer ours. Theirs.

In case you missed Jake's post from this morning, we can now officially confirm that The New England Revolution has acquired the fourth overall pick in Thursday's 2014 MLS SuperDraft and allocation money from the Columbus Crew in exchange for the rights to defender Michael Parkhurst.
With the fourth overall selection, the Revolution now holds three first-round picks in the 2014 MLS SuperDraft - No. 4, No. 12 and No. 19 - as well as one second-round pick and one third-round pick.
"We certainly value Michael as a player having had them with us six seasons ago, but this trade provided us too much to pass up," Revolution general manager Michael Burns said. "This deal provides us with a significant amount of flexibility, both for our salary cap and our roster, and allows us to make additional moves to continue improving our roster."
Parkhurst, who was a member of the Revolution from 2005 through 2008, appeared in 115 games for the Revs during their four years in Foxborough. The Cranston, R.I., native was the 2005 MLS rookie of the year and the 2007 MLS defender of the year before joining Danish Superliga club Nordsjælland in December 2008. A year ago, they moved to German Bundesliga side FC Augsburg. Parkhurst also has earned 23 caps with the U.S. National Team.
I'd be willing to bet that the amount of Allocation money that Columbus forked over was fairly significant. And I feel that the words in Mike Burns' statement above were carefully chosen. A "significant amount of flexibility" could mean that the allocation money they acquired now allows them to pursue an international signing or two with less worry over budget considerations. Or perhaps that's just wishful thinking.
The Revs could be looking to add depth to their roster with all five of their SuperDraft picks this year, but it also would not surprise me if they put together a package of some of them for a better deal with a different team. Either way, we should know more about the Revolution's roster building plans throughout the week, especially if you consider Jeff Lemieux's comments on Twitter yesterday to have some degree of knowledge behind them.
It's getting exciting now, guys.
...
UPDATE: Further information on this deal was revealed this morning as ESPN's Jeff Carlisle tweeted that Parkhurst's salary will be more than $300,000 and that the Revs received "just over" $100,000 in allocation money. If this is true, then it would further reinforce this move as being a smart piece of business on behalf of New England. In all likelihood, if the Revs keep all 5 draft picks, then those 5 players combined would likely command a salary less than $300K.
And the $100,000 in allocation is a good chunk of change for the Revs to play with as they look abroad for an impact player, likely a striker, to bring in for the 2014 campaign. It's also helpful to keep in mind that New England shedded some big salaries this offseason as well, getting rid of Juan Toja and Chad Barret, who earned around $300,000 combined. And then of course Kalifa Cisse, who earned just shy of DP-level compensation, is off the books as well.
Financially, the Revs have a lot of wiggle room now. All that's left is to see what they can do with it.
Lecturers have been banned from using the phrases ‘mankind' and ‘man-made' as part of a university's clampdown on ‘gendered language'.
Cardiff Metropolitan University says the ‘politically correct' words should be used to ‘promote an atmosphere in which all students and staff feel valued'.
The rules are laid out in the institution's Equal Opportunities Policy, which warns contraventions could result in disciplinary action.
University lecturers have been warned college students have to be protected against previously innocuous words which are now deemed as offensive such as 'sportsmanlike'
It says ‘inclusive language' must be used throughout all academic programmes to comply with the Equality Act as gendered words could be considered discriminatory.
Other rules include using ‘forename' instead of ‘Christian name' to avoid offending people of a diverse range of faiths.
And staff should avoid using the phrase ‘wheelchair bound' because it is ‘patronising and pitying', while ‘wheelchair user' is ‘empowering'.
The document states: ‘Should individuals consider that in the course of interaction with students or staff that this code has not been adhered to and that further action is required, there are two courses of action.
‘For students please refer to the Bullying and Harassment Policy. For staff members the Disciplinary procedure applies, as it does in the event of students talking inappropriately to staff.'
It says that ‘politically correct terminology can change' but lists a range of examples of words and phrases which staff should avoid.
These also include ‘ best person for the job', ‘forefathers', ‘housewife', ‘man in the street', ‘manpower' and ‘right-hand man'.
Even terms such as ‘principal' and ‘principal' as well as Mrs and Miss are considered offensive, according to the guide.
It also says staff should avoid ‘falling into the trap of making assumptions based on your own cultural background.'
Academics at Cardiff Metropolitan University have been warned about offensive language
And it advises alternating the order of the genders when talking about women and men, they or she, mother and father so that neither are given undue importance.
It adds: ‘If the gender of the person is unknown, don't make an assumption, but use “he or she” or, where appropriate, use the plural “they”.
‘Sexuality can be a minefield too, according to the policy, which advises against the terms ‘homosexual' and ‘heterosexual' because they are ‘laden with the values of a previous time'.
The new words to use are ‘same-sex' and ‘other-sex' relationships, the documents advises.
For disability, ‘the disabled' is advised against and instead staff should refer to ‘people with disability'.
However, the policy adds: ‘Don't be too anxious about the use of language, though.
‘Blind people do use terms like “see you later” and being too careful can make conversation painful for both parties.'
It emerged amid growing concerns about a culture of censorship of normal language in universities across the country.
Critics warn that it is breeding a ‘snowflake' generation who demand ‘safe spaces' from ideas they might find offensive.
They have questioned how such students will be able to deal with the hazards of the real world when they emerge.
A spokesperson for Cardiff Metropolitan University said: ‘The University is committed unreservedly to the principle of academic freedom within the law.
‘It is also committed to providing an environment where everyone is valued and treated with dignity and respect. These two commitments are cornerstones of academic life at the University.
‘The Code of Practice on Using Inclusive Language sets out a broad approach to promoting fairness and equality through raising awareness about the effects of potentially discriminatory vocabulary.
‘In particular, it includes some suggestions to support gender equality; these are consistent with other guidance (e.g., British Sociological Association's information on Equality and Diversity).'
Blockchain is a type of secure database that serves as an unchangeable ledger of information about an object. It was invented to track the movements of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, creating records that are anonymous but can't be tampered with. Blockchain has applications outside of electronic currency, though, like tracking where your pork and vegetables have been. Wait, what?
Walmart is running an experiment that it hopes will help keep customers safer when there's a food safety issue, but that will also help to trace where food that makes a customer sick has been and where it originally came from.
The chain could pull apples or spinach that came from one specific farm based on a customer's receipt, for example, instead of having to destroy all of the apples sold in an entire region.
Walmart is deploying this method with pork products in China and with a packaged produce item that it declines to name in the United States. Could it be spinach? Apple slices? Kale? Whatever product is actually being tracked, everyone from the original farmer to the store where the item is finally sold will be able to log information about that batch on the blockchain.

Grisly Discovery in Eastlake – Bag of Human remains found
A volunteer helping the homeless found a human leg bone and foot in a black plastic bag under the Ship Canal Bridge Saturday morning.
Heroes for the Homeless founder Tricia Lapitan said a group of three volunteers was in the 3100 block of Fairview Avenue East in the Eastlake neighborhood at about 10 a.m., walking in a wooded area, when one of them stepped on a plastic bag on a small hillside.
When the volunteer looked down to see what they had stepped on, they saw that it might be human remains.
“I guess it was from the knee down, and it was pretty decomposed,” said Lapitan.
They described the volunteer as “shocked” and said the three immediately left the area and called police.
The King County Medical Examiner took possession of the remains, and Seattle Police homicide detectives processed the scene, according to a police department spokesperson.
Heroes for the Homeless delivers cold-weather emergency gear to the homeless. They were in the area Saturday with hand warmers, sleeping bags and other supplies to offer to homeless people living outside in the area.

Staff Reports - EFLAND, N.C. (WNCN) -A teacher and an assistant principal at an Orange County elementary school have resigned after controversy developed because of the reading of a controversial story to third grade students.
Orange County Schools said third-grade teacher Omar Currie and Assistant Principal Meg Goodhand of Efland-Cheeks Elementary submitted their resignations.
The News & Observer of Raleigh reports that Omar Currie of Efland-Cheeks Elementary School read "King & King," about two princes who fall in love, after a student was called gay and told they acted like a girl.
The newspaper said assistant principal Meg Goodhand gave them the book. A school committee upheld using the book.
But three people filed complaints, including a parent who appealed the ruling to the superintendent. A public meeting is scheduled for Thursday as part of the appeal.
Schools spokesperson Seth Stephens said Monday that Currie and Goodhand have resigned.
"There was no way I was going to have the support I needed to continue teaching in Orange County," Currie said, claiming that school system administrators were hostile to them during a meeting on the topic.
School principal Kiley Brown has said that in the future teachers will notify parents of every book read in the classroom and that parents will be given the choice to opt out of the lesson.
The newspaper says Goodhand wouldn't comment.

Steven Jackson has been a reliable, productive back for quite a few years. But they don't have that much left in the tank.
There are a million different analogies that analysts and writers can use to illustrate various concepts and ideas about the NFL. But one of the most tired, yet accurate, is comparing a running back to a car. I mean, the position as a whole brought this comparison upon itself by allowing Carnell Williams to call themselves Cadillac.
So forgive me for going back to the well and dipping into this analogy once again. I'll try not to say "he doesn't have a lot of treads left on their tires" only two or three times. I promise. But I think it can help paint a picture of the running back life cycle, and help give some insight into Steven Jackson as they enter the 2014 season.
Cars are a frustrating blessing. Most Americans would be lost without their cars (except for those who live in the tightly compacted major metropolises, and even then, a car is often a nice thing to have for road trips or making a quick run across town at an inconvenient mass transit time), but also find them to be one of the biggest drains on their bank account and sanity.
You can buy a new car every few years, but you're shelling out a lot of money that could go to other things in order to afford that constant stream of new car smell in your life. Most people opt to ride out the car they have until it's dead or dying, which for a select few, means a long, healthy life with only the occasional bump and bruise along the way.
The parallel to running backs here is obvious. Teams can shell out draft picks or cash to go get a new back every couple of years, or they can stick with their bell-cow for years and years, hoping they stay in one piece. But only so many teams have been able to get a long, productive life out of their backs.
The Running Back Used Car Lot
Since 2000, only 25 backs over the age of 30 have received a cumulative total of over 300 carries during their age-30 season or later. Of those 25, only 10 had 1,750 or more carries while 29 or younger. Of those 10, three are Hall of Famers (Emmitt Smith, Curtis Martin, Marshall Faulk), one is a lock to become one when heâ€™s eligible (LaDanian Tomlinson) and the rest are a whoâ€™s who of running back history of the 1990s and 2000s (Fred Taylor, Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Jerome Bettis, Ricky Watters, Eddie George).
The asupervisorstioned Steven Jackson was well over that threshold of carries by the time they turned 30, putting them on the same workload level as Tomlinson and Martin before hitting the post-warranty portion of the running back life cycle.
So what does that mean for Jackson? Well, it means that unless he's Emmitt Smith (he's not) or Curtis Martin (probably not), he's going to struggle to get another 600 to 1,000 carries in their career, based on recent history. George and Watters failed to eclipse 450 carries after turning 30, while Faulk and Tomlinson both received about 500 more attempts before calling it quits. Jackson already has 156 carries on their post-30 tires, a feat that only 45 other backs have accomplished since 2000.
And unfortunately for Jackson, that means taking away their biggest asset: volume. Jackson was never a particularly efficient runner when considering numberFire's Net Expected Points (NEP) data. They started off strong, with a good season in 2004 on limited carries and a very good 2006 season, which was their only positive Rushing NEP season during which they carried the ball 250 or more times. That's something that Tomlinson, Faulk, Martin and even the man Jackson replaced in Atlanta, Michael Turner, did more than once in their careers.
So they got by as a fantasy asset and as a starting runner because they could handle the strain of being an every-down back in a relatively un-heavy system. The Rams ran the ball at least 400 times every year since 2006, keeping a consistent pass-to-run ratio during Jackson's tenure as lead back. Opportunity, rather than pure merit, was the reason why Jackson was so highly touted for years. They did well considering their circumstances, but their overall numbers were nothing to marvel at.
To be fair, most high-volume backs have negative NEPs due to the uphill battle they face to stay ahead of the down and distance when being focused on by defenses. But the lack of breakout seasons in Jackson's history shows us that he's not Curtis Martin, and he's not LaDanian Tomlinson. Which means we can't expect a lot from them in their post-30 seasons.
Figuring Out the Falcons' Carpool
But does that mean Jackson's time as a fantasy football relevant player are over?
Not necessarily. The Falcons got the same level of per-play NEP production as the Rams did from Jackson at the tail-end of their time in St. Louis. Their -12.67 Rushing NEP for the season is on par with the per-carry production from their 2008 and 2010 campaigns, meaning they didn't really take a huge step back with the Falcons last year. But they did miss time due to injury, and that might have proven just how ordinary they were as a runner.
Teammates Jason Snelling and Jacquizz Rodgers did as much on a per-carry basis as Jackson did during their limited time in the backfield in 2013 for the Falcons, all behind an admittedly really bad offensive line. All three backs posted Rushing NEP per carry totals in the negatives, with Rodgers posting a slightly superior average per attempt than Snelling and Jackson. And while the blocking will be somewhat improved in 2014, there's still reason to be concerned about Jackson's status as the unquestioned number one in the ATL.
Jackson figures to get "his share" of touches in Atlanta this season, because he's still an NFL-caliber player. They didn't fall completely off the map because they turned 30, but he's rapidly approaching the point of no return for backs. But what is a fair share of touches for a past their prime back who was never a special, transcendent back who's on the wrong side of 3000 career touches?
Especially when the team has added a running back worth considering, as the Falcons did in the form of FSU product Devonta Freeman, who our own JJ Zachariason wrote about here. Between Freeman and Rodgers, there will be plenty of competition for touches on an offense that's become more and more pass-heavy over the past two seasons.
So while the Falcons may keep Jackson around and give them a few carries now and then, it's only a matter of time before he's hurt again, or proves to be less efficient than their younger teammates who have more tread left on their tires. (Sorry, I had to do it at least once.) That means for Falcons fans and fantasy owners, it's time to let go of the keys, and start figuring out which of the newer models you prefer in Atlanta. Because Jackson's time as a leading back and a reliable producer are almost certainly over.
If she's called to testify again, she'd better be ready.
Since Hillary Clinton last came up to Capitol Hill, we've learned senior State Department officials sought to scrub references to terrorism from the infamous Benghazi talking points to insulate Foggy Bottom from political criticism — citing concerns of their “building's leadership” to justify the demands.
The rising temperature of the scandal means it's possible that Hillary could be asked to return and testify again. If they come back, they had better be prepared, says House Oversight and Government Reform chairperson Darrell Issa.

“We are interviewing lots of people, most of them under oath,” Issa says, describing the “methodical” approach their committee has been using for months.
“We're going to go through . . . that so that if we bring Secretary Clinton back, we bring them back when we have a lot of questions, including who told them what, or, more importantly, who didn't tell them something, and why” Issa says in their office in the Rayburn House Office Building, their foot propped up on a table.
#ad#Generally speaking, the chairpersonship of the oversight committee is a job that holds a lot more appeal when it's the other party's guy in the White House. Issa has held the coveted position for over two years, but it's only now that Obama-administration scandals have truly consumed Washington.

White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer was peppered with questions about a trio of scandals on the Sunday shows this week, and their performance actually prompted pity from some members of the media. (“It's abusive of Obama to send them on Sunday shows with no more to say than they had today,” tweeted Fox News' Brit Hume.)

“He was spinning truth into lie, wasn't he? They were like Baghdad Bob!” says Issa, who figured prominently in Pfeiffer's responses. After it was revealed that senior Treasury Department officials knew about the IRS inspector general's inquiry prior to the November election, Democrats have suggested that Issa knew, too.
Issa says they knew about the investigation only because they asked for it in the first place. “It was a completely opaque process to us and we had no pre-warning that the IG was nearing” the end of their work, the member of congress says, “or that he'd reached conclusions.”

A May 8 hearing on Benghazi was probably Issa's biggest success yet as chairperson. In closed-door meetings with chairpeople of other committees, they have attributed the success to careful planning and urged their colleagues to take their time with investigative hearings.

That involves rigorous preparation, including coordinating questions among the GOP's committee members. “There's an old expression among lawyers, ‘Don't ask a question unless you know the answer.' Going to a hearing and going fishing for five minutes, knowing that a good witness and a bad witness both want to ramble on for a long time, is kind of a waste,” they say. “When [Representative] Trey Gowdy asks questions, to the greatest extent possible, they know what the truth is, so they can cut off, agree or disagree with, a witness and move on using 30 seconds to a minute at most, and you can get five good questions and answers in” during each member of congress's five minutes, Issa explains.
Issa's groundwork started a long time ago: Early in this Congress, they struck what they describe as a “truce with skirmishes” with Democratic member of congress Elijah Cummings, their ranking-member foil on the oversight panel. Issa agreed to give Cummings a chance to provide input on committee actions, and Cummings said he'd do their best to defend the committee's prerogatives.

#page#While Republican members of the committee have won some success on Benghazi, Issa shies away from suggestion of impeachment — despite the fact that one member of their committee recently told National Review Online it was on the table.
“We're doing many investigations and most of them are sins of omission — failure to do a job, failure to have a plan, failure to tell the truth. And, for the most part, failure to do things doesn't rise to impeachment,” they explain.
“But more importantly, that's not a decision that I expect to ever be the first to reach. I expect to be the person who works with my staff, uncovering — pealing the layers of the onion, so to speak — then presenting the information to the public and to the members of Congress,” Issa says, while still urging their fellow Republicans not to “jump to impeachment.” But don't think that means he's going easy on President Obama.
#ad#Asked what they know about how the president spent the night of the Benghazi attack, Issa says Obama generally just twiddled theirs thumbs.

“From what we can tell they went to the residence. From what we can tell, between 5:00 in the evening and when they got on a plane for fundraisers in Las Vegas, they pretty well ignored their responsibilities as commander-in-chief,” Issa relates.

“And by the way, I'm not accidentally saying ‘ignored their responsibilities as commander-in-chief.' George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney would have required constant, periodic — you know, every hour — reporting,” they explain. “I use George W. Bush because he's the most recent in people's memories,” they say. “George W. Bush, if they said ‘use all measures necessary,' he'd want to make sure we use all measures necessary.” Under the current regime? “Clearly we didn't use any measures.”
On the Sunday shows, Pfeiffer said the president was being briefed on the situation, and that what they did and where is therefore “irrelevant.” The White House did not respond to Issa's remarks or a request for more information about Obama's activities that night.
I ask him, “what difference, at this point, does it make?” echoing Hillary Clinton's famous non-answer to Senator Ron Johnson at their Benghazi testimony in January.

At the time, much of the media celebrated Clinton's combativeness, thinking they had put an impertinent opponent in their place. But their words have lingered since as a symbol of an administration trying to get beyond a scandal that has dogged it for more than eight months.
“The difference is, public confidence comes from telling the truth as best you know it,” Issa says. “We didn't tell the truth as best we knew it in the days and even weeks after” Benghazi, and it seems until Congress does, Darrell Issa won't rest.

Satellite imagery shows thick haze blanketing eastern China in early November 2011, coinciding with reports by The New York Times and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing of heavy air pollution in the area.
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Terra satellite captured this natural-color image on November 10. The haze extends southward from Beijing along the coastal plain bordering Bo Hai and the Yellow Sea.
Intermittent haze had clogged the skies over eastern China for at least a month by the time MODIS acquired this image. In early November 2011, The New York Times reported that Beijing had suffered from heavy air pollution for weeks, and the United States Embassy in Beijing had repeatedly registered unsafe levels of particulate matter.
Airborne particles come in different sizes, often measured in microns (also micrometers): one-millionth of a meter. Whereas Beijing's air-monitoring center has traced particles at 10 microns or larger, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing has measured smaller particles, down to a size of 2.5 microns, known as PM2.5, according to news reports. This has caused a discrepancy in air-quality assessments, with the U.S. Embassy classifying pollution levels as hazardous on days when the local government classifies pollution levels as moderate or slight, said The New York Times.
Particles with diameters of 2.5 microns or smaller are believed to pose the greatest health risks because they can lodge deeply in the lungs, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
On November 11, 2011, People's Daily reported that China's vice-minister of environmental protection described the country's air pollution standards as “rather lax.” People's Daily further reported that the government was discussing implementing PM2.5 readings, and hoped to lower fine-particle pollution by about 10 percent by 2015.
Bottom line: Imagery from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra satellite shows haze on November 10, 2011, extending southward from Beijing along the coastal plain bordering Bo Hai and the Yellow Sea. The haze coincides with reports from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and The New York Times of hazardous air pollution levels.

ISLAMABAD/DERA ISMAIL KHAN, Pakistan (Reuters) - When al Qaeda leader Abu Yahya al-Libi arrived in northwest Pakistan several years ago, they commanded so much respect that even some of the world's most dangerous militants held them in awe.
A still image from October 18, 2011 video footage shows Abu Yahya al Libi, a Libyan-born top al Qaeda leader, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan earlier this week, a U.S. official said on June 5, 2012. REUTERS/IntelCenter/Handout
Already a legend in the shadowy world of jihad for breaking out of a high security U.S. prison in neighboring Afghanistan in 2005, they seemed to promise endless funds, training and inspiration for men who dreamed of unleashing carnage in New York or London.
By the time they were killed in a U.S. drone strike last week, they were the latest victim of a series of the unmanned aerial attacks that has crushed al Qaeda's network along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan, Pakistani intelligence officials and commanders of militant groups said.
Its finances have dried up, and those who once idolized the group wonder whether it can survive.
“Imagine. They used to travel in Land Cruisers and double-cabin pickup trucks a few years ago,” said a commander from the Pakistani Taliban, which is close to al Qaeda. “Now, they are riding motorcycles due to lack of resources.”
The downfall of the network in the border area started with the killing of Osama bin Laden in a Pakistani town in May last year, and the sustained campaign of drone attacks has further weakened the group. Only about eight hardcore al Qaeda leaders are still believed to be based in the lawless borderlands of Afghanistan and Pakistan, compared with dozens a few years ago.
Current al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahri is among those believed to be hiding in the area.
Many al Qaeda loyalists have sold their weapons or sought donations to fund attempts to escape to their home countries, the Taliban commander added, speaking in a telephone interview.
But the strike that killed Libyan cleric Libi in North Waziristan, and other similar attacks on militant hideouts, have not made the region any safer. Several other armed groups infest the area, and are not noticeably weaker.
While the aerial campaign has weakened al Qaeda, its ally the Pakistani Taliban remains a highly potent force despite a series of Pakistan army offensives against its strongholds in the northwest. Seen as the biggest security threat to the U.S.-backed government, the Taliban is blamed for many of the suicide bombings across Pakistan, and a number of high profile attacks on military and police facilities.
The Haqqani network, which is strongly allied to the Taliban in Afghanistan, also has bases in Pakistan's northwestern badlands, according to U.S. officials. The group and Pakistani officials however deny they operate from there.
For the United States, however, the leaders of al Qaeda, the group that was behind the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington, appear to be the prime target.
“We just took down another leader in al Qaeda the other day,” U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta told NATO forces during a visit to Kabul last week, referring to Libi, who was al Qaeda's second in command and top strategist.
“The worst job you can get these days is to be a deputy leader in al Qaeda, or for that matter, a leader,” they added, to laughter.
AL QAEDA FUNDS DRY UP
Residents in the area, Pakistani intelligence officers and former militants said in interviews that the aerial offensive has put al Qaeda commanders and fighters on the defensive, restricting their movements and their ability to forge closer alliances with other militant groups.
Financing was proving troublesome, since it is traditionally done in cash and in person to avoid being tracked through the banking system.
Libi was one of the few al Qaeda leaders who kept up personal contacts with commanders from other major militant groups like the Pakistani Taliban.
They used their charisma, and credentials as a theologian, to try and keep al Qaeda's network intact in the face of growing pressure from the remotely-piloted drones.
“Libi's death is a big blow to al Qaeda. It is currently facing serious financial problems in the Pakistani tribal areas,” said a Pakistani intelligence official, a view echoed by some diplomats in Islamabad.
“Sending and receiving money has become very difficult for them because most of their channels have been shut down or compromised. That is impacting their operations.”
Al Qaeda commanders who once appeared at training camps to motivate fighters are rarely seen, according to Taliban commanders and Pakistani intelligence officials.
“Most of them have gone underground, hiding in bunkers and basements, avoiding contact with the outside world,” an intelligence official in the tribal border areas told Reuters.
MILITANCY A LONG-TERM THREAT
One senior Pakistani security official estimates there are only about eight core al Qaeda leaders left in Pakistan.
But that does not mark the end of al Qaeda's leadership in the porous border frontier area between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which President Barack Obama once called the most dangerous place in the world.
“It would be a mistake for anyone to conclude there is no one on the bench. It's a thinning bench, but there are still bad guys, with bad aspirations in al Qaeda's core group in Pakistan,' said a U.S. official in Washington.
“However, these individuals are not as capable and don't have the profile or following in the wider extremist movement that Abu Yahya or their predecessor Abu Atiyah had.”
Much will depend on whether the United States can push Pakistan to go after the remaining al Qaeda leaders, especially in North Waziristan, where Washington says some of al Qaeda's most lethal allies are based.
But Pakistan is unlikely to commit itself to what could be a bloodbath, especially during a crisis in relations with the United States that has been worsening since the unilateral raid that killed bin Laden. Pakistan says its army is stretched fighting the Pakistani Taliban in other areas and it alone will decide when to fully take on groups in North Waziristan.
U.S. officials have said the drone strikes, which inflame anti-American sentiment, will continue despite Pakistani demands they cease. That could undermine cooperation from Islamabad.
The senior Pakistani security official agreed the remaining handful of core al Qaeda leaders left in Pakistan were most probably hiding in North Waziristan.
It's a small number. But getting to them and their friends, like the notorious Haqqani network, won't be easy.
Intelligence, especially, is hard to come by.
A few years ago, Pakistani Taliban fighters managed to track down a large number of tribal informers for Pakistani intelligence in North Waziristan and slaughtered them.
“Many were killed and other people are too scared to cooperate with intelligence agents. It will take a long time to build up a network again,” said the security official.
Even if Pakistan decides to mount a full-scale offensive there, that may only offer short-term solutions.
Conditions that breed militancy are still ripe in nuclear-armed Pakistan, and they won't go away until the government implements bold reforms that strengthen the struggling economy.
More jobless young men could turn to militancy, which gives them a sense of power through the AK-47 assault rifle. Suicide bomber vests offer a path to paradise, they are told.
That message is especially alluring in unruly areas like North Waziristan, where more than 60 percent of the population is between the ages of 15-25, job opportunities are virtually non-existent, and the state has little control.
“Every day someone turns 18 in Pakistan,” said the senior Pakistani security official, referring to an ever-growing pool of possible recruits for the jihad.

Edwin van der Sar has warned the Premier League's big hitters that new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal is ready to “do a Liverpool” with the Old Trafford giants.
Ex-Man United keeper Van der Sar, who played under Van Gaal for Ajax and the Dutch national team, has also warned European football's money-grabbers that their old boss will not allow them to take advantage of the Reds' desperation to sign new faces to help them break back into the top four.
Deposed champions United are at a disadvantage this summer as they compete for quality stars with Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal - all of whom can offer their targets Champions League football.
But Van der Sar said: “Van Gaal will spend the right money on the right player to ensure that they are right for United.
“He will know if they have the United DNA of the club inside of them. If not they will let them go and let them go to other clubs. You have to play and you have to fight for Manchester United. Not only come for the money.
“What's more important? £20k or £30k more a week or the priviledge of playing for a coach like Van Gaal?
“It's a massive club and if you are able to participate in that and to contribute to winning a title then you are settled for life because you have the adoration of the club.”
Van der Sar - the most capped player in the Dutch national team's history -lifted four titles and the Champions League among their many trophies at Old Trafford between 2005 and 2011.
Under Van Gaal at Ajax they clinched three domestic league titles, the UEFA Cup and the Champions League among their glittering haul of trophies.
While United broke all the wrong records under David Moyes last season, surrendering their title and falling to seventh in the League, Van der Sar believes their former boss can surpass the achievement of Brendan Rodgers, who took champions City to the wire after a seventh-placed finish last year.
The 43-year-old, now back at Ajax working as a marketing director, went on: “It will be difficult to get from seventh to first, but Liverpool almost did it and I think United have more qualities than ­Liverpool on that score.

“Van Gaal is going to be very clear about what they want and what they demand from theirs players.
“It's great that Ryan Giggs is going to stay on as assistant coach so that Van Gaal has input from them and will know the feeling in the dressing room.
“Of course it's going to be a tricky period for them with the World Cup deciding on what transfers they will need. But if anyone can cope with a situation like this it is Van Gaal.
“His credentials in Spain, in Germany, in Holland with the national team speak for themselves. They have won the title in every country.
“He has a history of winning trophies, of bringing young players through, of working with big players.
“He is a very hard-working coach and they are a guy who makes players better. They also send out the right signals about the kind of football they want to play to the players.”
Asked if they would consider returning to the club as a coach, Van der Sar said: “I would stay at Ajax because my mission is not to become United's goalkeeping coach.
“Van Gaal is bringing a very capable coach in Frans Hoek. They were my goalkeeping coach at Ajax and with the national team, so I am sure David De Gea will be in good hands.”

Guadalupe García De Rayos, who has lived in US undocumented since they were 14, targeted for deportation over non-violent felony due to Trump's new policies
An Arizona woman who was in the US illegally but had been allowed to stay, on the condition that they check in annually with immigration officials, has been deported to Mexico after new policies put into effect by Donald Trump.
Guadalupe García de Rayos, a 36-year-old mother of two US citizens, was a non-violent felon who had for years complied with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) orders after being convicted of using a fake social security number to work.
But on Wednesday, when they went for their usual check-in, Ice agents took them into custody instead, separating them from their husband and children, who were waiting outside.
Under a new executive order that President Trump signed on 25 January, García de Rayos had become a priority for deportation. The order states that undocumented immigrants should be deported if they have been charged with any criminal offense. The president said the order was needed “to ensure the public safety of the American people”.

By Wednesday night, more than 100 protesters gathered outside the Ice office in Phoenix and blocked several vans that were coming out. One of the vans was carrying García de Rayos.
One man tied themselves to one of the van's front wheels, and seven demonstrators were arrested by Phoenix police officers, who showed up in riot gear at about 10pm.
García de Rayos's two children also tried to block the van carrying their mother.

On Thursday, after learning the news that they had been deported, their children broke down crying. Jacqueline García de Rayos, 14, described having to pack their mother's luggage so they could send it to Mexico.
“I don't think it's fair that they were taken away from us,” Jacqueline said. “Her only crime was to work here so they could support us.
“She is a very kind person,” Jacqueline said. “She treats everyone like family. They haven't done anything to harm anyone.”

On Thursday, Ice said in a statement that their “immigration case underwent review at multiple levels of the immigration court system, including the Board of Immigration Appeals, and the judges held they did not have a legal basis to remain in the US. Ice will continue to focus on identifying and removing individuals with felony convictions who have final orders of removal issued by the nation's immigration courts.”
García de Rayos had been living in the US as an undocumented immigrant since they were 14 years old. Them husband, Aaron Reyes, is also undocumented.
“This is our country, because this is where we've lived most of our lives,” Reyes said. “We went to school here. This is where we met and got married. This is where we formed our lives and this is where our children were born.”
Reyes said their family's “nightmare” began in 2008 when their wife was arrested during a workplace raid ordered by then Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio at a water park in Mesa.
After spending six months in jail, they were released. They were allowed to stay in the country on the condition that they check in with Ice for a brief review of their case and to answer a few questions once a year. They never had a problem until now.

After going into the Ice office in Phoenix as usual, their husband and children anxiously waited for them outside but they didn't come out. Instead they were taken into custody and Ice agents began procedures to send them back to Mexico.
Ray Ybarra Maldonado, the immigration attorney representing García de Rayos, said their client was not deemed a priority for deportation under Obama because the administration's focus was on deporting immigrants who were a threat to public safety, had ties to gangs or had committed serious felony offenses. García de Rayos didn't fit those criteria, they said, which is why they were allowed to stay in the US.
“I think this is a direct result of the new executive orders by the Trump administration that are being put into action,” Maldonado said about García de Rayos's deportation.
They also said the order “has nothing to do with public safety” and “has everything to do with separating families”.
“All because they were trying to work to support themselves and their kids – which is the same thing any of us would've done if we were in their situation – they were criminalized, given a class 6 felonies and now they find themselves on the other side of the border,” Maldonado said.
Update 12:07pm PT: Microsoft says it has fully patched the hole and issued the fix.
Microsoft announced over the weekend that it is fixing a vulnerability in its Internet Explorer browser that could allow hackers to take over your PC.
“An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user,” the company explained in its security advisory. “Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.”
On Monday, December 31, Microsoft said that it has completely closed the vulnerability and users can now administer the fix to their own browsers. It will not require people to reboot their browsers.
The exploit only affects those Windows PC owners who are running IE 6, 7, or 8 and takes advantage of Adobe Flash “to generate a heap spray attack against Internet Explorer version 8.0,” according to security researchers at FireEye. A heap spray attack helps hackers insert their malicious code on a system, but it must be paired with an existing security hole, such as the one in Internet Explorer, that gives them their point of entry into the targeted system.
Furthermore, victims are hit with the attack when they visit a website that is (sometimes unknowingly) hosting malicious code. In this case, a number of security firms, including FireEye and AlienVault, note that the Council on Foreign Relations website was being used to infect anyone who visited it. FireEye says it first heard the CFR website was compromised on Dec. 27, but according to its researchers, the site could have been infected as early as Dec. 21.
Computerworld explains that the hackers are able to look at a specific group of people, or individuals, and target the attack to them by watching what websites they frequent. Whether the criminals wanted to attack specifically people who are interested in the CFR is unknown.
Microsoft says it is currently working on a fix and urges people to update their browsers to the most recent version of Internet Explorer. Keeping your systems up to date is one of our security resolutions for 2013. You can also use Qualys' browser checker to make sure any plug-ins and your browser are up to date.
Depending on “customer needs” the fix may come in its regular batch of updates to IE, or in a separate, emergency patch.

Last month, folks around Mike Bloomberg let it be known in the New York Times that the former mayor of New York was thinking of an independent run for president. On Tuesday, the Big Apple multibillionaire told the Financial Times that, yep, he's looking at it. “I find the level of discourse and discussion distressingly banal and an outrage and an insult to the voters,” Bloomberg said.
No argument there. But one obstacle is so high, I felt compelled to reiterate it in this video.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Michael Bloomberg — the three-term mayor of New York City and the founder of the business information behemoth that bears their name and made them a multibillionaire — is actively considering a run for president of the United States as an independent.
Now, as someone who worked as a policy adviser on Bloomberg's first campaign for mayor, I think he'd run a smart campaign and would make a great president. I just don't think he'll actually BE president.
See, our political system makes it virtually impossible for an independent to overcome the formidable Electoral College to win the White House.
A candidate must win 270 of the 538 electoral votes at stake. And those are won by winning the popular vote or a plurality of that vote in each state on Election Day. But in a three-way race, what happens if the candidates split the vote and none hits the magic number of 270? Therein lies the biggest obstacle for Bloomberg.
If no one secures 270, the election then moves to the House of Representatives, where it is highly likely the current Republican majority would elect the GOP nominee. That's because 33 of the 50 states have Republican-majority House delegations.
Also, there is no set way for members to vote. Do they vote for the winner of the national popular vote? Or the winner of the popular vote in their state? Or how about for the candidate who won their district? Do they vote their conscience or their party? The dealmaking to get to 270 could be uglier than a Trump rally.
Only those three presidential candidates can be considered. No from-out-of-nowhere savior can swoop in and save the day. And if things aren't resolved by Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, the vice president-elect, who will have been elected by a simple majority of the Senate, will serve as acting president until the matter is resolved.
“I find the level of discourse and discussion distressingly banal and an outrage and an insult to the voters,” Bloomberg told the FT, adding that if they were to actually run they would need to start getting their name on the ballot in March.
To that, I say, Run, Mike, Run … far away from this campaign!
Few people captured the changing personas of David Bowie like Terry O'Neill. The legendary British photographer first met Bowie in the early '70s, when the musician was deep into their Ziggy Stardust period, and for years afterward, O'Neill would witness Bowie's many evolutions, from Diamond Dogs to the Thin White Duke and, finally, the facade stripped away, the artist in full possession of both their talent and their image. O'Neill shares their memories of those experiences.
“In 1973, I got a call from their manager, Tony DeFries, who said they had an artist I would find interesting, and they asked if I wanted to go down to their club in Soho to check them out. I walked in, and there was David, all done up as Ziggy Stardust. They were singing as a girl danced around him, and that girl turned out to be Marianne Faithfull.
“He was very charming and very polite, right from the start. They were also very shy, but always aware of their image. I looked at them as more an actor than a singer; once they finished performing, they dropped the image and went back to being himself. They were a very intelligent boy.”
“The next time I got a call from Tony, it was to shoot David for the [1974] Diamond Dogs cover. Bowie showed up at the studio with this enormous dog, and they copied all the poses the dog did. All the art was given to [Belgian artist] Guy Peellaert, who drew them from the photographs, and it became that very famous, very controversial cover.”
“David took the tour to America, and while I was in L.A., Liz Taylor said to me, ‘I really like David Bowie, and I'd love to meet him.' They were interested in putting them in a film they were going to do in Russia, so they said I should tell them to come around to [director] George Cukor's house on Sunday at 2 o'clock.
“We were at George's house, waiting for David; 2 o'clock came and went, then 3, 4, 5 o'clock, and still no David. And you know, no one is ever late for Liz Taylor. Finally, at 6 o'clock, they showed up. By then we hardly had any light left, so Liz just took control of the whole session, grabbed him, and we got the photos. They never got the part in that film, but they did become very good friends. They were really charmed by him.”
“He was probably late to meeting Liz because they had overslept. They would be up all night and then sleep during the day. We did a session when they wore this mustard-colored suit, and they look so tired in the photos. Of course, I don't think they were behaving themselves all the time then, either.”
Los Angeles was the hotbed of the music scene in 1975, says O'Neill, with impromptu groups being formed all the time. Bowie gathered a bunch of friends for one special performance and nicknamed the group Trading Faces. “Peter Sellers was having a birthday party in L.A., and all these guys showed up and started jamming away because Peter loved rock ‘n' roll,” says O'Neill. “David played the sax, and Keith Moon and Joe Cocker sang. Ronnie Wood was on guitar and Billy Wyman [on bass]. They don't have parties like that in Hollywood anymore. I wish they did.”
“I got a call to do some photos of them while they were filming [1976's] The Man Who Fell to Earth, and more than any of their other characters, that was them exactly. They always struck me as an alien who had come to Earth because they were so unlike the rest of us. But by now, they had grown up a bit more and was into a much cooler look, their Thin White Duke period.
“If you wanted to get inside their head and understand them a bit more, you had to look at their lyrics. I didn't like their music at first, and then one day, I started to read their lyrics; they would leave them around, these handwritten sheets of music. Their lyrics were always genius and really the way to know what they were thinking. And he's done the same with their last album, hasn't he? The song “Lazarus,” that's their epitaph, which is very brave.”
“His fans loved them so much, right from the very beginning. You didn't realize until you went to one of their concerts just how popular they were with people. They weren't necessarily screaming fans; they were just mesmerized by him. I think that's because all of their performances were so visual. It was as though they were creating their own film set.
“In the '90s, they rang me up and asked me to shoot them for a cover. Tony was long gone by then, of course; they had a terrible falling out, and so David would call me directly. I think this was for Premiere magazine, and David said they also wanted the photos for this new stuff they were doing on the Internet. You could never really refuse them anything. By this time, though, you could see they were really at ease with himself. This wasn't a character, no tricks to hide behind; this was just David, and they were happy with that. And that polite boy I met the first time, they were still here, polite and charming. They were always an exceptionally nice guy. If you knew him, you would have loved him, I promise you.”
The new year holidays bring forth the always-anticipated lookbook for Japanese streetwear pioneers A Bathing Ape. For the 2013 spring/summer collection, BAPE offers a release of new patterns and camouflage renditions, two of which are titled “hieroglyphic” and “explosive,” which will surely attract a lot of attention with fans and new adopters alike. Repeat collaborations with Gitman Brothers, Ebbets Field, Champion and George Cox return, while Kangol is added to the list after a slightly long-winded absence from the streetwear scene. A hip-hop inspired mix of graphic tees, hats and sneakers also make an appearance alongside what is certainly the new item of interest, a brand-new representation of the iconic Shark parka plastered with contrasting polka dots. The new season begins promptly on January 1, 2013 at all A Bathing Ape retailers in Japan, following shortly worldwide.
The United States government is likely to shut down nonessential services tomorrow, after House Republicans voted before dawn yesterday to attach a one-year delay of President Obama's health care law (and a repeal of a tax to pay for it) to legislation to keep the government running. The Democratic-led Senate is expected to refuse.
House Republicans also said last week that they would not agree to lift the debt ceiling unless implementation of the health law was delayed by one year. So the government is also headed toward a mid-October default on its debts — and a full-blown constitutional crisis.
Failure to raise the debt will force the president to break a law — the only question is which one.
The Constitution requires the president to spend what Congress has instructed them to spend, to raise only those taxes Congress has authorized them to impose and to borrow no more than Congress authorizes.
If President Obama spends what the law orders them to spend and collects the taxes Congress has authorized them to collect, then they must borrow more than Congress has authorized them to borrow. If the debt ceiling is not raised, they will have to violate one of these constitutional imperatives. Which should they choose?
In 2011, when Congress last flirted with not raising the debt ceiling, lawyers disagreed. Some argued that the president must honor the debt ceiling, thereby violating budget laws. Others held that they must honor budget legislation. No one argued that they should unilaterally raise taxes. Professors Neil H. Buchanan and Michael C. Dorf, who parsed the arguments in the Columbia Law Review in 2012, concluded that all options were bad, but that disregarding the debt ceiling was the least bad from a legal standpoint.
I agree. Lawyers tend to play down policy considerations as a basis for interpreting law. In this case, the consequences are so overwhelmingly on one side that they cannot be ignored by the president and should not be ignored by the courts. If the debt ceiling is not increased, the president should disregard it, and honor spending and tax legislation.
A decision to cut spending enough to avoid borrowing would instantaneously slash outlays by approximately $600 billion a year. Cutting payments to veterans, Social Security benefits and interest on the national debt by half would just about do the job. But such cuts would not only illegally betray promises to veterans, the elderly and disabled and bondholders; they would destroy the credit standing of the United States and boost borrowing costs on the nation's $12 trillion publicly held debt.
There is no clear legal basis for deciding what programs to cut. Defense contractors, or Medicare payments to doctors? Education grants, or the F.B.I.? Endless litigation would follow. No matter how the cuts might be distributed, they would, if sustained for more than a very brief period, kill the economic recovery and cause unemployment to return quickly to double digits.
Nor is it reasonable to expect the president to collect more in taxes than is authorized by law. For them to do so would infringe on Congress's most fundamental powers and the principles on which the nation was founded.
The only defensible option for the president if the debt ceiling is not raised is to disregard the debt ceiling. The action would be unconstitutional because it would be illegal. Financial markets might react negatively, but not nearly so negatively as if the United States failed to redeem bonds or to pay interest on its debt.
The president would be attacked. They might even be impeached by the House. But maybe not: the House would then be saying that the president should have illegally failed to pay F.B.I. agents, or school districts, or Medicare doctors. In any case, they would not be convicted by the Senate. And they would have saved the nation from much agony.
Disregarding the debt ceiling would have one additional, thoroughly benign effect. It would end the capacity of Congressional minorities to precipitate crises in order to accomplish goals for which they lacked the votes. Today, a minority is holding hostage all federal programs in an attempt to eviscerate a law that Congress passed, the president signed and the Supreme Court upheld — the Affordable Care Act. In the future, an imaginative and irresponsible minority could use the threat not to raise the debt ceiling for any purpose — to shape tax policy, or foreign policy, or civil rights policy.
The debt ceiling is the fiscal equivalent of the human appendix — a law with no discoverable purpose. It is one law too many. Once Congress has set tax rates and spending levels, it has effectively said what it wants the debt to be. If Congress leaves the debt ceiling at a level inconsistent with duly enacted spending and tax laws, the president has no choice but to ignore it.
While NASCAR competition sank live IndyCar coverage on CNBC, it boosted NBCSN's rebroadcast of the race to record numbers.
Tape-delayed IndyCar Series racing from Mid-Ohio earned 666,000 viewers on NBCSN Sunday evening, up 73% from last year (386K) and up 242% from 2013 (195K), both of which aired live. The telecast also topped the 2012 race, which aired on broadcast network ABC (626K).
Sunday's telecast earned the largest audience ever for IndyCar on NBCSN, topping the previous high of 642,000 for the 2011 Edmonton race. The last four IndyCar races on NBCSN rank among the network's nine most-watched since acquiring rights.

The record audience was fueled by a direct lead-in from NASCAR on NBCSN, which scored 4.3 million viewers. Live coverage of the race aired on CNBC to accommodate NASCAR, earning just 172,000 viewers — the smallest IndyCar audience on any network this season. The previous low was 196,000 for coverage from Toronto in June.

For the past several decades, campus authorities from deans and chancellors all the way down to lowly RAs have been reiterating the talking points of “safe sex” to college-age teenagers. For the vast majority of incoming freshmen, these messages of consent and the prevention of sexual assault have been a staple of their educational culture since junior high, if not earlier. But despite this constant campaigning for consent, sexual assault on campus remains a perennial problem. The more we insist on viewing sex in the context of consent, the more insecure we are about our ability to prevent rape. What explains this troubling trend?
Other essays at Public Discourse have focused on various aspects of the scourge of sexual assaults on campuses. Robert Carle and Greg Forster, for example, have argued for moving investigations of such assaults out of the hands of compromised university bureaucrats and into the jurisdiction of the legal system. Adelaide Mena and Caitlin Seery La Ruffa have lamented the crassness with which campus administrators confront the hook-up culture, while Jeffrey A. Hart has expanded on Mena and La Ruffa's proposals by arguing for an “Augustinian philosophical anthropology” that explains why the hook-up culture has left so much misery in its wake. All of these are excellent investigations of the problem of campus rape.
But we must understand that the liberalism that undergirds consent- and rights-based discourse on sex is utterly incapable of understanding human sexuality. Because it reduces the human person to a mere vehicle of abstract rights, liberalism has no language to express the transcendence and sacrifice of human sexuality. As long as we are talking about sex in terms of mere liberty and consent, we will continue to face the specter of rape hanging over every sexual encounter. This is because the “Yes” given in consent-based epistemologies—i.e., a yes to a physical interaction premised on radical individual autonomy—is fundamentally different from the “Yes” in which human sexuality is designed to operate: a “Yes” to the other in their or their spiritual, intellectual, emotional, and physical entirety.
Sex functions precisely to break down autonomy and overcome the overweening sovereignty of the self upon which consent is ultimately based. In a liberal framework, our freedom to engage in activities assumes that all activities are equal, as long as we have obtained consent when those activities involve others. But sex is not like other activities. Sex, unlike anything else we might do with another person, transcends the self while radically reorienting it within a new, shared context with our sexual partner. Consent assumes that sex will not do this, that sex will leave two people as fully autonomous after sex as they were before. But this is precisely the one thing that sex was designed not to do. Sex, even if entered into based on a free agreement between two autonomous people, by its very nature dismantles the autonomy upon which the consensual understanding of sex had been based.
In the wake of this compromised autonomy, sexual partners, confronted with a transcended self but still working within the conceptual confines of leveling liberalism, may very rightly view this transcendence as a violation of their sexual integrity. This holds true even when the sexual encounter was freely and consensually entered into, and especially when the myriad other expectations attendant upon sex are left unfulfilled. These expectations of emotional and spiritual intimacy, including the promise of future growth as a couple and openness to new life through sex, have no place in the liberal understanding of sex. Thus, when these hopes are dashed, women, especially, see “consensual sex” as a misleading proposition. Their subsequent sense of violation feels very similar to the devastating effects of non-consensual sex. To be clear, sex without consent is rape. But the wasteland of the hook-up culture shows that merely granting and receiving consent do not safeguard against the manifold consequences of casual sex.
If we want to talk seriously about ending campus rape, we must get to the bottom of the liberalism that underpins consent discourse on campuses. By rescuing sex from liberalism, we can restore sex to its rightful place—not as bargained recreation between Lockean rights-bearers, but as the complete gift of mind, body, and soul to another person, and the reception of the complete gift of the other.
What Is Liberalism?
A good working definition of liberalism can be found in the February 2013 issue of Chronicles. Chilton Williamson, Jr. writes:
From Hobbes forward, but after Locke particularly, liberalism has taken for granted . . . a social contract between individuals for the purpose of securing them and their property and for promoting their personal freedom. For classical liberals, the theoretical aim of society is not society realized as a commonwealth but society as a collection of discrete individuals, each, so to speak, composing their own society of one, whose security the association guarantees.
This view is almost completely incompatible with human sexuality. Liberalism posits radical autonomy and then attempts to mediate those individual autonomies through contracts (“consent”). By contrast, sex draws two people into the most intimate form of community, forming a new relationship based on a shared totality of existence. Where liberalism deals in a world of unjoinable, antagonistic atoms, human sexuality strives to bring two atoms together in order to make an entirely different molecule.
Liberalism is unable to understand sexuality in part because liberalism sees a steady-state interaction of discrete rights-bearing units, while sexuality is distinguished from other activities in being existentially unstable. It is unfashionable in many circles to assert that sexual intercourse makes men and women “one flesh.” One needn't appeal to the Bible, though, to demonstrate that this fusing and repurposing of natures is literally true. Vicki Thorn, for instance, has shown that intercourse profoundly alters the bodily chemistry of men and women, leaving them chemically joined to one another. This reality gravely complicates the personal autonomy upon which consensual sex is based. Even on the physical level, human sexuality challenges liberalism's narrow worldview with a much more intricate and dynamic understanding of personhood.
Men, Women, and Children
This existential instability cuts across the liberalism of rights- and consent-framed discourse about sex in another way as well. To engage in sexual intercourse is to open oneself to the very real possibility that a new person could be created.
Many liberals now argue that unborn children are subject to extermination precisely because they infringe the rights of the expectant mother. Nevertheless, the deeper fact is that these new rights-holders are entirely new creatures whose sudden presence poses a serious challenge to the structures of liberal personhood. Hostile labels such as “illegal occupiers” and “parasites” reveal that liberalism is well aware of the threat that the radical disruption of new human life poses to its scheme of Lockean bargaining and consent.
Nor does liberalism make sufficient allowances for the sexual differences between men and women. The vast majority of sexual assaults involve men violating women. This imbalance is intuitively obvious to us, because we all understand that men tend to be the more libidinous—and aggressive—sexual partner. Liberalism works only when interactions are seen as taking place between autonomous and functionally identical individuals, but sex refuses to be hemmed in by our modernist democratic assumptions. The horrifying reality of rape and sexual aggression, wherein men prey upon women's relative weakness, is the twisted inversion of sex's much, much greater potential for good, by which men and women go beyond their own inherent differences and are elevated to an entirely higher state of mutual complementarity and self-giving. Sexuality is the sharing of one's entire self with another person—not just physically, or even chemico-biologically, but spiritually, emotionally, intellectually, and at every other level of the human personality. Women, especially—that is to say, unequally—realize this truth much more readily than do men.
What is missing from liberalism is a true view of the complexities of the human person. And the key to understanding the human person in all of their or their complexity is dignity. Where liberalism insists on absolute formal equality, dignity explodes the narrow boundaries of this formal equality, understanding the bigger truth that human value is not restricted by difference, but actually comes into full flourishing in the complementarity of difference. Exactly alike in dignity, men and women are nevertheless created unalike.
Sex Challenges and Transcends Autonomy
This likeness in dignity and unlikeness in personality finds perhaps no greater expression than in sex, in which men and women give of themselves for the sake of each other. In this mutual honoring—a sacrifice of the very self that liberalism cordons off as autonomous and inviolable—the dignity of man and woman achieves a new fullness that goes beyond them both.
Because sex necessarily violates the narrow, rigid autonomy upon which liberalism is predicated, sex presents a fundamental challenge to this liberal autonomy. Within the liberal framework of negotiated rights, this fundamental challenge to autonomy—the very nature of sex—works continuously to frustrate the utopian impulse to “tame” sex by means of consent. Sex fills in the moat around the Lockean self and leaves that self vulnerable to another in a radically new way. Consent breaks down where the self has thus been opened and reoriented.
In short, liberalism sees sex as, at best, contractually bargained-out autonomy. But this scheme denies the much fuller truth about sex and elides the real differences in sexual intercourse as engaged in by women and men. Liberalism falsely posits that men and women are exactly alike, and so, with no context in which to situate the differences inherent in the mutual sexual self-gift, liberalism has a skewed view of this higher-order exchange. Rights and autonomy—the staples of the liberal discourse of consent—simply cannot contain the higher meaning of sex.
The Irony of the Sexual Revolution
There is no small irony in the inability of liberalism to understand sex. Unfettered sex, along with free access to abortions and the freedom to define one's gender as one sees fit, is one of the so-called “sacraments of the cult of liberalism.” Indeed, the sexual revolution was premised on unrestricted autonomy as the ticket to a pleasurable, consequence-free paradise.
Sex overwhelmed this liberal conceit, too. The consequences of denying the nature of sex plague college campuses more now than ever. For example, according to the CDC, 15-to-24-year-olds contract about half of the twenty million new STD infections each year. University administrations, locked in the amber of liberalism, cannot understand the scope of the problem they unwittingly helped to create. If we truly wish to fight the scourge of campus rapes, we must admit that consent, more narrowly, and liberalism, more generally, have failed.
To be sure, “No” means “No,” every single time. But sex is a subject poorly encapsulated by consent, which whittles the question of whether or not to have sex down to a simple (and simplistic) choice between “Yes” or “No” to physical intercourse. The real question posed by sex, though, is one of “Yes” or “No,” not just to the bodily interaction of two material creatures, but to the intermingling of lives and souls that is the true context of sexual intercourse.
If university administrators are serious about ending campus rape, then administrators must turn to curricula that emphasize the importance of abstinence before marriage and sacrificial self-gift within marriage—the only two methods ever devised for bringing inherent human dignity into alignment with the awesomely transformative power of human sexuality. Liberalism can never see these bigger truths, and so must remain at the shallow level of legalistic parsing of rights, autonomy, and consent-language that cannot possibly contain the entirety of sex's meaning and transcendent goodness.
Before injuries to both A.J. Griffin and Jarrod Parker, it looked like Tommy Milone stood no shot of cracking the starting rotation for the Oakland A's. Now, with the season finally upon us, Milone will get a shot to prove himself—that is, if Oakland doesn't have any more games postponed due to tarp failure by the grounds crew.
In any case, what I don't want to do is try to predict how Milone will pitch this season. They could play markedly worse than they have in the past two seasons; they could be in the running for the AL Cy Young Award by the end of the season, too. Or, in all likelihood, they could pitch pretty close to how they already have in their short Major League career, and A's fans everywhere should hope that's the case.
Why? Because Tommy Milone has been underappreciated and glanced over in favor of other pitchers who are a bit more "exciting." Don't believe me? How about we do a blind taste test. Here are four pitchers and their statistics from 2011 to 2013:
Player Innings Pitched K/9 BB/9 ERA FIP xFIP fWAR Player A 315.1 7.53 2.25 3.80 3.63 3.56 4.9 Player B 372.1 6.72 1.91 3.92 4.06 4.12 4.5 Player C 380.1 6.74 3.1 3.53 4.05 4.10 5.7 Player D 384.0 6.45 2.98 3.68 3.93 4.21 5.0
Overall, these pitchers are fairly similar. Player A has impressed in a smaller sample size—around 315 innings pitched instead of roughly 375—with a strong K/9 and a low xFIP; Player B has the lowest BB/9 of the group with an impressive 1.91—for comparison's sake, Clayton Kershaw had a 1.98 BB/9 in 236 innings pitched last year; Player C has the best ERA of the bunch, but has an FIP and xFIP that's very close to Player B's; and Player D has a respectable ERA and FIP despite a fairly high xFIP.
Ready for the reveal?
Player A: Patrick Corbin* (He only pitched in 2012 and 2013)
Player B: Tommy Milone
Player C: Clay Buchholz
Player D: Jarrod Parker
In other words, three front of the rotation starters and a guy who barely made it as their team's fifth starter. What separates Corbin, Buchholz, and Parker from Milone, though? Here are a few ideas:
1) A nasty out pitch
Patrick Corbin's slider has been making hitters look silly since they started throwing it. In 2012, their whiff percentage for their slider—the percentage of swings and misses of all pitches thrown—was 23.60%. In 2013, it only got better, rising to 27.70%. Here's a GIF of their impressive slider in action:
via cdn.fangraphs.com
Jarrod Parker, too, has a pitch that can baffle hitters on a regular basis. Their changeup was named one of the most unhittable pitches in 2013, yielding whiff percentages of 25.52% and 24.58% in 2012 and 2013, respectively. And, here's their changeup in all of its glory:
via cdn.fangraphs.com
2) Playing in a bigger market
Clay Buchholz threw a no-hitter in their second Major League start in front of a packed Fenway Park. From there, it was never going to be hard for them to have the Fenway Faithful behind him, even though he's had a mostly up-and-down career.
Since Buchholz has been on the Red Sox, they have won two World Series and have only had one losing season. In fact, they've only had two seasons below 90 wins in that seven-year span. When you pitch for a team that's constantly in the spotlight, it's easier to get noticed and stay remembered when you succeed.
3) Being a little different
Corbin's slider is a masterpiece, Buchholz has really high "highs" and does so with a big audience, and Parker walks out to the mound with a baseball in their mouth (or something pretty close in size) while having fairly electric stuff.
In other words, they all stand out. They pass the proverbial "eye test," the judgements that fans and coaches make to determine whether a particular player is worthy of being dubbed "good."
Milone, put simply, is a little bit boring. Their pitches aren't noteworthy—although their new two seamers looked great in spring training—and they aren't as volatile, for better or for worse, as their peers. You usually know what you're going to get with Milone, and, to some, that makes them a boring player.
It's the reason why a quick YouTube search will pull up highlight videos for Corbin, Buchholz, and Parker but nothing of the sort for Milone. It's the reason why few baseball fans outside of Oakland know Tommy Milone, and why few baseball fans outside of Oakland care to.
But, if Milone has another "boring" season this year in line with how he's pitched so far in the big leagues, A's fans everywhere should be cheering.

• Marcelo targeted by monkey chants as they warmed down • Abusive chants aimed at defender with son at their side
Real Madrid's Brazilian full-back Marcelo and their young son were subjected to horrific racist abuse by Atlético Madrid supporters after their side's 3-0 Copa del Rey semi-final first leg victory against their city neighbours.
Marcelo did not play in the game but joined a handful of team-mates in a warm-down session around 20 minutes afterwards. At that stage the only supporters left in the Santiago Bernabéu stadium were around 500 Atlético fans high in the north stand. As Marcelo ran towards them, they launched into monkey chants which were clearly audible in the virtually empty arena.
Marcelo stopped immediately below the fans and, motionless, gazed up at them before contuining their exercise. They then chanted: "Marcelo is a monkey." When Marcelo's young son came out and hugged their father soon after, the chant changed to: "May your father die."

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Arctic sea ice may be thinning faster than predicted because salty snow on the surface of the ice skews the accuracy of satellite measurements, a new study from the University of Calgary said on Tuesday.
The report from the Canadian university's Cryosphere Climate Research Group published in the academic journal Geophysical Research Letters found satellite estimates for the thickness of seasonal sea ice have been overestimated by up to 25 percent.
That means the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free much sooner than some scientific predictions, which forecast sea ice will first disappear completely during summer months between 2040 and 2050, according to lead author Vishnu Nandan.
Ice-free summers in the Arctic Ocean would impact global weather patterns by increasing the magnitude and frequency of major storms, and alter the Arctic marine ecosystem, making it harder for animals like polar bears to hunt.
There are a wide range of projections as to when Arctic sea ice will start disappearing in summertime as a result of warming global temperatures, and the University of Calgary study calls into question satellite measurements provided so far.
“The problem is, microwave measurements from satellites don't penetrate the salty snow very well, so the satellite is not measuring the proper sea ice freeboard and the satellite readings overestimate the thickness of the ice,” Nandan said.
The sea ice freeboard refers to ice that can be seen above sea level and co-researcher John Yackel said, “Our results suggest that snow salinity should be considered in all future estimates on the Arctic seasonal ice freeboard made from satellites.”

The FT published an article documenting the levels of online ad fraud present on a recent Mercedes-Benz campaign earlier this week bringing the debate to a more mainstream audience.
Jalal Nasir, Pixalate, co-founder, CEO, lifts the lid on some of the techniques used by the more nefarious aspects of the ad tech industry.
Lately, I've seen a lot of news about the impact online ad fraud is having on the digital marketing ecosystem. Just this week, the Financial Times reported that Mercedes-Benz ran a campaign where bots viewed the majority of the impressions.
Forecasts suggest ad fraud could cost marketers as much as $11bn in 2014, a 22% increase over 2013. Notwithstanding any unintentional inflation in these stats, it's clear that ad fraud is running amok. At the same time, RTB display advertising continues to grow quickly.
According to eMarketer, RTB now accounts for 22% of all display ad spending. It grew 76.5% last year and by 2018, is expected to account for one third of all display ad spending, or $12bn. While the industry has responded to ad fraud, most detection technologies don't account for malware that changes IP addresses, manipulates cookies and hijacks browser settings.
This leaves both marketers and end users at risk, because the fraudsters are able to stay one step ahead. In order to solve the ad fraud problem, we need to first understand its complexity, diversity and sophistication. Here's a comprehensive look at ad fraud techniques that web security experts have discovered.
Crowdsourcing (Cyclops): Thousands of users are recruited and paid just to view an article, providing page views (and extra cash) to the hacker. In these cases, the users are unaware that they are performing fraudulent activities.
Incentivised Ad Networks (Voldemorts): Individuals are given incentives like reward points, gift cards or Bitcoins to read an article or to view/click on an ad. They may know they are doing something wrong but abide by a “don't ask, don't tell” policy.
Click Farms (Zergs): These are organised groups of individuals who are paid to click. They use a combination of mobile devices and SIM cards to perform fraud online and repeatedly change their devices and networks to evade detection. They are called Zergs (just like in StarCraft) and operate in big groups with a malicious intent.
Computer Malware (VaderBots): Highly sophisticated and difficult to catch, VaderBots are masters of disguise. Thousands of PCs infected with malware (also known as bot slaves) work in conjunction with a bot master to perform smart fraud online. The bot master decides which sites the slave accesses and which ads it views and clicks so its actions appear to be random and to come from the computer of a “real person.”
Sophisticated Fraud (PhantomBots): This type of bot travels around the web to visit websites, view ads and click using a fairly sophisticated algorithm. Think of it as a digital ghost that is always boosting numbers.
Retargeting Fraud (DeceptiBots): This bot can mimic a human's intentions, such as an interest in a specific brand of car. Ads targeted to a particular niche result in a higher CPM than untargeted ads. DeceptiBots deceive advertisers into believing they are receiving valuable, targeted clicks.
Mobile Simulator (CryptoBots): A mobile simulator on a computer that mimics a smartphone running mobile apps, CryptoBots are used to perform fraud on in-app mobile ads while their real identities remain hidden.
Ad Stacking: This is the practice of placing multiple ads on top of each other in a single ad placement. Even though the “stacked” ads are invisible to the person visiting the page, they often reported as viewable to the advertiser, so the fraudster gets paid.
Toolbars: While browser toolbars have legitimate uses, they are sometimes exploited by fraudsters. Bad actors distribute branded toolbars as part of software bundles that are often times installed without the user's knowledge. They hijack the user's browser, reset the default search engine and enable a platform for serving ads. The new default search, will usually mimic a well known search engine and can be extremely difficult to uninstall.
Ad injection: Usually masked as “deal finders” for online shoppers, these programs will inject unauthorised ads on legitimate web pages. Like toolbars, this software is usually distributed in software bundles and will install without the user's knowledge.
Domain Identity Theft: A fraudulent seller hard codes a publisher domain into an ad unit. The ad runs on different publisher that commands a lower price. The buyer thinks their ad ran on the intended domain and somehow they got a deal (i.e., got the ad below market value) Neither the publisher nor advertiser know that they've been defrauded.
The size and magnitude of the ad fraud problem is immense and growing. The ad community is making some effort to deal with this problem. The IAB's Traffic of Good Intent Task Force (TOGI), recently issued their Traffic Fraud: Best Practices of Reducing Risk to Exposure.
This is a good start; however, more needs to be done to remote out and eradicate fraud from the online ad ecosystem. Solving this problem will fall to the smart minds who are actively working on solutions to stay one step ahead of the bad guys.

If a tanker were to spill oil off the coast of British Columbia today, the federal government would not have the resources to handle a large-scale disaster, warns B.C. Premier Christy Clark.
In an interview with CBC chief correspondent Peter Mansbridge, Clark sounded the alarm over Canada's inability to handle a major coastal oil spill now, let alone in the future should new pipelines be approved.
"We are woefully under-resourced," Clark said.
Them comments come amid a recent video ad campaign by Coastal First Nations in B.C. directed at Prime Minister Stephen Harper.
The video shows devastating images from the Exxon Valdez oil spill off the coast of Alaska in 1989. The song The Sound of Silence by Simon & Garfunkel accompanies the dramatic pictures.
The video tells viewers a similar oil spill could cost taxpayers $21.4 billion to clean up and notes that 80 per cent of British Columbians oppose oil tanker traffic in the province's coastal waters.
"British Columbians have spoken. Will Stephen Harper listen?" asks the video ad campaign.
Clark conceded that the federal government is taking some measures to address the danger, but "that's going to have to happen before any more heavy oil comes off the coast," the premier said.
"They've begun to look at safety on the coast and the coast guard resources, and so that's a start, that's encouraging."
Transport Minister Lisa Raitt recently travelled to B.C. as part of the federal government's push to woo First Nations into supporting the Northern Gateway and Kinder Morgan pipeline projects.
"Part of the reason why we're going out to the West Coast is to engage and to speak with those groups that are very interested in what we're doing on the world-class tanker system," Raitt told CBC News on Sept. 14.
Tanker safety
The federal government, which is responsible for offshore spills, announced in March a number of steps to develop a world-class tanker safety system — including the creation of a panel to review Canada's current system and propose further measures to strengthen it.
Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver told CBC News on Wednesday the system in place now can handle a fairly large spill off the B.C. coast.
"We're going to improve it to the extent necessary because… we're utterly committed to world-class safety, and whatever needs to be done to get us there we will do," Oliver said.
Clark made it clear nearly 15 months ago that "world-leading marine oil spill response, prevention and recovery systems for British Columbia" were among the conditions the federal government and the province of Alberta had to meet in exchange for their support of any pipelines running through their province.
The Joint Review Panel into Enbridge's proposed Northern Gateway pipeline is expected to give Oliver a decision by Dec. 31, 2013.
On Wednesday, an Enbridge official said the company expects the federal government to approve the pipeline, which would move oil from northern Calgary to a tanker terminal in Kitimat, on the north coast of B.C., by 2018.
Senior vice-president Vern Yu said the Calgary-based company expects the federal government's decision to be challenged by pipeline opponents.
"We expect that there would be some appeals to that decision and that would take us into early 2015 and at that point we would be able to start construction, which would allow for somewhere around a 2018 in-service date," Yu said.
Clark will be in Washington, D.C., on Thursday to promote B.C.'s liquefied natural gas industry.
The full interview with B.C. Premier Christy Clark will be seen in an upcoming broadcast of Mansbridge One on CBC Television and CBC News Network.
Since you arrived on this page Bill Gates earned: (Live in US-$)
Bill Gates Total Money in US$:
Bill Gates The richest man in the world When talking about the richest people worldwide, Bill Gates is definitely on top of the list. Who does not know Microsoft and all its products, produced to enable a perfect use of your computer. Bill Henry Gates was born on October 28th 1955. They were the 2nd of 3 children. Their father worked as a lawyer whilst their mother was a teacher in Seattle. Given their passion for natural sciences like mathematics and a particular interest for economy, Gates also proved themselves as a skilled developer of new computer programs and invented in collaboration with a schoolmate a new and improved version of a school-owned program. Later on, Gates and their mate founded the Lakeside Programming Group. After their studies at Harvard University, Bill Gates worked with a lot of dedication on the development of a new and enhanced version of the Basic computer language for micro computers. Finally Microsoft was born in 1975 in a garage in Albuquerque. The rest is history. Bill Gates expanded their business within the next decades and became one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the USA.
Microsoft Only a few people know, that Microsoft is not Bill Gates´ only source of income. Additionally, they are the owner of Cascade Investments and shareholder of the John Deere & Co tractor producer and stakeholder of the Canadian Railway Society. Today (January 2019) Bill Gates´ fortune amounts to around $93,5 billion. Assuming that Bill Gates had a regular bank savings account with an interest rate of 3 %, they would earn around $7.7 million dollar a day. Every hour $320.000 would be added to their fortune and every minute their bank account shows a plus of $5336. And even every single second of the day Bill Gates makes $89. However, despite all that wealth, Bill Gates does not forget about those, who have not been lucky in their lives. Their Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation takes care of a variety of projects in third world countries. One branch of this activity is the funding of research in the field of Malaria, Aids and Tuberculosis. With a total capital of 30 billion $ the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is considered to be the biggest social organization of the world. Up till now it is estimated, that Bill Gates has spent 30 billion $ for charity and social projects worldwide.
Apple products as iPod or iPhone are a few of the rare things which Bill Gates forbid their children. If they know that their house was partially designed with the help of a Macintosh?
They sold their first self-written computer program in the age of 17 to their school. They obtained 4,200 dollars for this schedule planning program. A few code lines made sure that they always got together with possibly many girls in the courses.
When they still went to school, they boasted to their teacher that they will be a millionaire by the age of 30. Indeed, they were a billionaire by the age of 31.
Newly released police video shows a Texas trooper threatening Sandra Bland with a Taser when they ordered them out of their vehicle during a routine traffic stop on July 10, three days before they were found dead in a county jail. (Editor's note: This video contains graphic language and has been edited for length.) (Texas Department of Public Safety)
Several embedded quotes from Reddit have been removed from this piece due to the content of the embeds later changing.
New dashcam video released yesterday shows the traffic stop that went south and ended with 28-year-old black woman Sandra Bland handcuffed and on their way to jail, where they would be found dead several days later. What starts out as an unremarkable encounter quickly deteriorates after officer Brian Encinia asks Bland to put out a cigarette.
“Would you mind putting out your cigarette, please?” Encinia asks.
“I'm in my car, why do I have to put out my cigarette?” Bland answers.
“Well, you can step on out now,” Encinia says. Bland refuses, and Encinia attempts to forcibly remove them from the car.
[A trooper arrested Sandra Bland after they refused to put out a cigarette. Was it legal?]
The video of Encinia's tactics -- at one point they pulled out their Taser and yelled "I will light you up!" -- caused the Texas Department of Public Safety to place them on desk duty pending the outcome of the investigation into Bland's death. “Regardless of the situation, the DPS state trooper has an obligation to exhibit professionalism and be courteous,” said DPS Director Steve McCraw. “That did not happen in this situation.”
[Did Sandra Bland have a right to record their police confrontation? Maybe not.]
While public reaction to the video has generally been negative, law enforcement officers' reactions to it were mixed. A thread devoted to the video on ProtectAndServe, the law enforcement community of Reddit, has garnered 331 comments so far. A round-up of those comments, below, offers some insight into the Sandra Bland arrest through a police officer's eyes. The comments that follow are from users verified as sworn law enforcement officers by the site's moderators.
"meuglerbull" gives a helpful rundown of the state and federal law applying in cases like this. The 1977 Supreme Court decision Pennsylvania vs. Mimms has generally been understood to allow officers to order people to exit a car during a traffic stop, for any reason.
But "Quick_Everyone_Panic" notes that a lawful order isn't necessarily a prudent one -- "It's not worth turning a simple traffic stop into a major ordeal just because somebody wouldn't put a cigarette out," they write.
"Cop10-8" agrees, and it's worth noting that their comment theirs currently the highest-voted submission to the thread.
But "meuglerbull" tries to look at things from Encinia's point of view:
"DoctorGlocktor" is thinking along the same lines:
Some officers argue that responsibility for escalation lies just as much with Bland as it does with Encinia:
As "meuglerbull" states in one of their comments, everyone watching the video is essentially Monday morning quarterbacking the situation -- it's easy to say what a person would or should have done when observing a situation from afar.
And in focusing on the video, it's easy to lose sight of some of the broader issues Bland's traffic stop brings up, like the well-documented phenomenon of "driving while black," and the larger structural components of racism in the area Bland was pulled over.
Perhaps the cruelest irony of Bland's death is that they were a civil rights advocate who often spoke out against police violence, and about problems between police officers and the black communities they serve. They lived and breathed these very issues. And last week, they died by them.
UPDATE: This post has been updated to include screenshots of the reddit comments, rather than direct links to them.
The increase of the Latino vote was mitigated by a higher turnout among white non-Hispanics and less educated people that supported Donald Trump across the country (AFP Photo/David McNew)
New York (AFP) - Latino voters were supposed to be Hillary Clinton's secret weapon to win the White House -- but even high turnout by voters in the fastest-growing US minority wasn't enough for them to seal the deal.
What happened? For starters, fewer Latinos and African-Americans -- groups that traditionally vote for Democrats -- voted for Clinton than for Barack Obama in 2012.
And the increase of the Latino vote was mitigated by a higher turnout among white non-Hispanics and less educated people that supported Republican Donald Trump across the country.
The Latino vote "was no doubt a record, but we have to wait until April or May to have the definitive figures," said Mark Hugo Lopez, director of Hispanic Research at the Pew Research Center (PRC).
More than 27 million Latinos were registered to vote, but Lopez estimates that less than half -- some 13 million -- actually cast ballots.
- "Hillary is not Obama" -
A good 65 percent of self-declared Latino voters said that they supported Clinton, a former first lady, senator and secretary of state, while 29 percent supported Trump, a real estate business person and reality TV star with zero political experience.
Moreover, many of Trump's proposals could be considered anti-Latino: they proposed deporting the 11 million undocumented migrants in the country, the bulk of whom are from Latin America; build a wall on the US border with Mexico; and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement -- which includes Canada and Mexico -- which they blasted as a "disaster."
In the 2012 election, Obama won 72 percent of Latino voters, against rival Mitt Romney who won 27 percent.
"Hillary Clinton is not Barack Obama, they are different candidates," said Lopez. "The Hispanic electorate is conservative, the Cuban-Americans are traditionally Republicans, there are some against abortion."
In general, Latinos who voted for Trump "are more likely to be Cuban-Americans, to have a higher income, to have a higher college education than other Hispanics," and tend to live in conservative states like Florida, Arizona or Texas.
On average, Clinton voters tend to have higher education and live in states that reliably vote for Democrats like New York and California.
Democrats were hoping that the Latino vote would be decisive for the first time in US history and help push Clinton to victories in places such as Arizona and Florida, two states that they nevertheless lost on Tuesday.
- Defeat in Florida -
If Trump had lost Florida, it would have been over for him. Both candidates focused heavily on the far southeastern US state -- Trump focusing on the most conservative enclaves, and Clinton focusing on votes from the Puerto Rican community, African-Americans and young Latinos.
In Florida, Clinton "was counting on a higher turnout and percentage of votes from Latinos and African Americans that they had," said University of Miami political scientist Gregory Koger.
On the other hand white voter turnout "was higher than expected" for Trump, they said. And the Trump campaign "targeted rural voters, people in small towns, and they turn out for them in large numbers."
For Daniel Smith at the University of Florida, Clinton lost in the state for another related reason: "it was the failure to persuade white educated women," they told AFP.
"These white women, Independent, even moderate Republicans didn't necessarily like Donald Trump but they disliked Hillary more," they said.
Clinton "lost white middle class and upper middle class women," and they split the white Independent women with Trump.
Clinton was also unable to gain traction among conservative Cuban-Americans in Miami, who are reliable voters. Trump however promised to maintain the embargo against Cuba, an issue dear to their heart but behind the times given the US opening towards the communist island.
Younger Cuban-Americans are in general Democrats, or abstain from voting.
In Florida, 52 percent of Cuban-Americans voted for Trump against 47 percent for Clinton, according to exit polls by the group Latino Decision.

Lopez said that there was a nationwide "Trump effect": more Latinos came out to specifically vote against him, fueled by anger over their harsh anti-immigrant rhetoric.
But this turnout was "not as big as people said it would be," Lopez said.
The Johnston and Urbandale Democrats hosted the three hopefuls looking to take on David Young – Desmund Adams, Jim Mowrer and Mike Sherzan – for the Des Moines/Council Bluffs-based 3rd District. About four dozen local Democrats filled the seats at the Johnston Public Library, well-fed that evening with a large bounty of cookies from local volunteers. Local State House candidate Maridith Morris and State Senate candidate Miyoko Hikiji gave their campaign pitches before the forum kicked off.
Tornadoes to the southwest of Des Moines threatened to possibly cut the night short, but the most severe weather held off (thankfully, as the shelter plan was for everyone to take cover in the library's bathrooms). The scene inside the building was a much calmer setting, with each of the three candidates in unanimous agreement on the issues.
Moderator Geoff Greenwood, formerly with KCCI and now the spokesperson for the Iowa Attorney General's office, moderated the forum, asking four questions that had been given to the candidates in advance. That led the forum to play out in a rather predictable way, but each candidate found a way to stand out.
“The number one thing that impacts our district is poverty,” Adams said in describing what they saw as the 3rd District's biggest needs. “75% of students in the Des Moines Public Schools system – the largest in the state of Iowa – are on free or reduced lunch … In addition poverty rates in our southwestern corridor, seeing as nine of our sixteen counties have lost population, in addition to job loss, poverty is striking deeply in the gut of our southwest corridor. Second, a livable wage. I think that it's asinine and also criminal that a person can work 40 hours a week and still need assistance from the government to put food on the table.”
Both Mowrer and Sherzan emphasized protecting Social Security, a key message point in both of their campaign's communications materials being sent around the district.
“I grew up on a family farm here in central Iowa, but when I was seven years-old my father died in a farming accident,” Mowrer said during their segment. “The only thing that really kept our family from falling so far down that we couldn't get back up was the basic social safety net, and in particular Social Security survivor benefits.”
“I consider economic injustice, not only in the 3rd District but around the country, to be the most important aspect that I believe needs to be rectified,” Sherzan said, also sharing their own story of a father who died and how their family received Social Security help. “Two women are now running [my former company] who I put in place with board approval to be CEO and board person … Equal pay is extremely important to me and that's how I ran that company.”
By and large all three candidates repeatedly came down on the same side of every major issue discussed, including climate change, foreign policy and student debt. But each pushed their own unique qualifications and messaging into the discussion the best they could.
Mowrer repeatedly returned to their experience in national defense from their service in Iraq and working in the Pentagon. Part of it was to show their in-depth knowledge on the topic, but they also pitched it as how he'd best stack up against Young in a general election contest where Republicans will hit Democrats on terrorism.
“[Obama] expressed concern that the Republicans are going to try to turn this election into a national security referendum,” Mowrer said. “They know they're wrong on major economic issues, minimum wage, Social Security. So what Donald Trump and the Republicans are going to do is make this about foreign policy and national security because they think they can beat Democrats on it. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm an Iraq War veteran, I served in intelligence as a civilian at the Pentagon. National security and foreign policy is in my wheelhouse.”
Sherzan returned to themes of leadership and their own business experience, setting up a preview of how he'd contrast themselves with Young.
“It's pretty obvious to me how [Young] became number one when they were number five,” Sherzan said in reference to how Young won a special convention for Congress after placing fifth in the actual vote. “He basically has stood aside and hidden from the citizens of the third district, because I'm not sure anyone in this room could detail what they actually stand for.”
“I don't like the word ‘fight' in politics, but I'll work extremely hard to make sure privatization never affects our Social Security or our social safety nets,” Sherzan said in one their many references on Social Security.
While Mowrer emphasized their connection to the Barack Obama administration from working at the Pentagon, Adams tried to cast themselves as an Obama-like candidate. They specifically told the crowd that the issues in the primary don't matter as much since all the candidates largely agree, and that the real test was who could bring together a coalition to beat Young.
“The only one who's won [in our district] in recent years is Barack Obama,” Adams noted. “It's about building coalitions that are broad that can unseat David Young … Money is not the issue and the issues is not the issue. We are all similar on the issues.”
“Three groups didn't show up [in 2014]: African Americans, Latinos and the young. Now I want you to look around the room and see if you see any of those three,” Adams said in their closing (though there were actually several people from each of those groups in the room. “So we're on the path to lose again … I believe I'm the only candidate best positioned to beat David Young because I have the broadest experience, personal and professional.”
None of the candidates took direct shots at one another, though they all made very subtle digs. Mowrer told the audience it was important who you've surrounded yourself with and what you worked on in your life, perhaps in reference to Sherzan running a financial services and investment firm. Sherzan highlighted their age and years of experience, possibly as a contrast to their younger opponents in a primary where turnout is likely to skew older. Adams slammed past Democrats who have run losing campaigns despite being well-financed.
For the most part, all candidates did themselves some good in front of an audience of primary-going Democrats. Adams gave the most dynamic performance of the night and got several laughs from they crowd. Mowrer gave some of the more in-depth answers on policy positions.
You could tell Sherzan is still relatively new at this, as a handful of times they talked about the voters' need to research their history instead of just telling them about it (since that's what these people were here for). But they closed well with a forceful line of “The way we treat our teachers in this country is a travesty,” also referencing they have two daughters who now work in education.
Overall, a much more pleasant and agreeable meeting between the Democratic candidates for the 3rd District than their counterparts in the 1st, but also one where it might have been harder for the voters to see the differences between their options.

Here in Seattle, the sun is shining, and it's hitting 60 degrees. That means it's time for us to emerge from our wintertime flood bunkers, squinty-eyed, clad in skirts and sandals in celebration of the fact that it has stopped. Fucking. Raining. Soon, it will be warm enough to venture into the many bodies of water that surround my fair city, and come summer my travels will take me to even warmer locales with pools and lounge chairs and blended drinks.
Traditionally, the selection of plus sized swimwear is overall disappointing from a fashion standpoint. Last year, Gabi Gregg over at GabiFresh helped design a fabulous fatkini that very quickly sold out. Gabi knew, as we all know, that there is a vast, largely untapped market of fabulous fatties who needs them some fierce swimwear. I myself was in the market for a new suit or two and decided to do a little internet reconnaissance to check my options. Here are some of my favorites.
Forever 21 Bold Cutout Bikini Set — One of the two suits I purchased for myself. Forever 21 Worldly Ikat Bikini Set — One of the two suits I purchased for myself. ASOS CURVE Exclusive Swimsuit In Graphic Print ModCloth Bathing Beauty One Piece in Rainbow Galaxy Torrid Striped Natural Support One-Piece Swimsuit ModCloth Bathing Beauty One Piece in Cherries Torrid Multicolor Peek-A-Boo One-Piece Swimsuit
I like all of these suits for two reasons. Reason one, they are brightly colored and/or have interesting patterns. Fat girl suits tend to err on the side of dark, solid colors. The second reason I love these? No swim skirts. I hate them, and I think they reinforce an unhealthy mantra in conventional plus sized women's fashion: Cover up your lumpy bits, no one wants to see that shit. In fact, many of these suits make interesting use of negative space with interesting cutouts and unique straps. Any lady wearing one of these suits poolside at the Mandalay Bay will NOT be ignored.

Samsung has accused Apple of calling expert witnesses that exhibit “slavish adoration” to the company during an ongoing patent trial between the two consumer electronics giants. As noted by patent expert Florian Mueller of FOSS Patents, court documents filed by Samsung in California seek to exclude testimony made by a number of Apple's expert witnesses on the grounds that they were biased.
“Apple's damages expert, Terry L. Musika, writes in their report that ‘Apple has built a considerable and at times a cult-like following to all things Apple,' ” Samsung's attorneys wrote in a court filing, according to FOSS Patents. “That cult-like following apparently includes several experts who are appearing on Apple's behalf in this case, and may explain why they have cast aside established scientific methods and governing legal principles in favor of slavish adoration of their client and platitudes about its alleged magical and revolutionary products, issues that are of no relevance to the claims and defenses at issue.”
The filing goes on to attack a number of Apple witnesses, repeatedly suggesting that they are among Apple's cult-like following, sometimes referred to as “iSheep,” and therefore their testimony cannot be included in the trial. Mueller notes that Samsung appears to take particular issue with one witness in particular, Henry Urbach, who Samsung accuses of being a “loyal devotee of Apple.”
“Before being retained by Apple in this matter, Mr. Urbach wrote an essay on the design of Apple's retail stores, entitled Gardens of Earthly Delights, describing them as ‘Quasi-religious in almost every respect, . . . chapels for the Information Age,' ” Samsung's motion stated. The filing also claims that Urbach referred to Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs as “St. Eve.”
Finally, Samsung notes that beyond Urbach's potential bias, they are not a qualified witness because they “has admitted they have no experience in product design, or marketing, and therefore any opinions they could offer would be beyond their area of expertise.”
As the next round of the fiscal showdown takes shape, John Boehner has made what is either a very big move or a very big bluff. In an interview with Wall Street Journal editorial writer Stephen Moore, the House Speaker asserted that their side is perfectly willing to let the automatic budget cuts set up in the summer of 2011 to take effect. Pay very close attention to what Boehner is saying here:
The Republicans' stronger card, Mr. Boehner believes, will be the automatic spending sequester trigger that trims all discretionary programs—defense and domestic. It now appears that the president made a severe political miscalculation when they came up with the sequester idea in 2011. As Mr. Boehner tells the story: Mr. Obama was sure Republicans would call for ending the sequester—the other “cliff”—because it included deep defense cuts. But Republicans never raised the issue. “It wasn't until literally last week that the White House brought up replacing the sequester,” Mr. Boehner says. “They said, ‘We can't have the sequester.' They were always counting on us to bring this to the table.” Mr. Boehner says they have significant Republican support, including GOP defense hawks, on their side for letting the sequester do its work. “I got that in my back pocket,” the speaker says.  They are counting on the president's liberal base putting pressure on them when cherished domestic programs face the sequester's sharp knife. Republican willingness to support the sequester, Mr. Boehner says, is “as much leverage as we're going to get.”
Okay, what's going on here? When Boehner and Obama stalemated over the budget in 2011, they agreed to institute a trigger, starting in 2013, to create automatic deficit reduction. Since Republicans would never allow the trigger to include higher revenue, Obama insisted that the cuts exempt most anti-poverty programs and fall heavily on defense.
Obama assumed that the prospect of huge cuts to the military would frighten at least some Republicans. The design of the automatic cuts, or “sequestration,” was to pit elements of the Republican coalition against each other — specifically, to force pro-military Republicans to break from anti-tax absolutists. And indeed, the party's defense hawks have loudly decried the cuts and called for replacing them with a “balanced solution” — which means a mix of higher tax revenue and lower spending on retirement programs, which is also Obama's position.
Boehner doesn't want that. They want to replace the automatic cuts with cuts to retirement programs and zero new revenue. Now, Obama almost surely would never accept that. So the leverage game here centers on which party finds the automatic cuts more painful.
Boehner is asserting that Republicans don't actually care that much about cutting defense — that replacing the sequester is something Democrats want. Just because Boehner says this doesn't make it true. They may be holding their defense hawks in line publicly, but the question is whether they can keep them in line as the negotiations proceed and the prospect of implementing the cuts grows more real.

So. Time to take Marlins Park and: A) Disassemble it; B) Crate it; C) Sell It; D) Ship it to San Jose (or Oakland, or Portland, or San Bernardino, Austin/San Antonio/Round Rock, or – wherever).
Now that the Miami experiment is over (as forecast here a year ago next week, and reiterated here last June) and Hanley Ramirez, Heath Bell, Jose Reyes, Mark Buehrle, Josh Johnson, and the merely arbitration-eligible Emilio Bonifacio have either been offloaded in A Going-Out-Of-Business-Sale (or are about to be), the Marlins are officially the Montreal Expos of the 2010's and baseball is unofficially dead in Florida.
Notice I did not write South Florida. All of it. Rays' owner Stu Sternberg was already less than sanguine about getting significant scratch from the state and local governments for a new ballpark that is absolutely essential to their survival in Tampa/St. Petersburg. If they had any hopes left after the disastrously low crowds for the free ballpark the good burghers of Florida gave Jeffrey Loria, they have to be gone now and they have to be looking elsewhere.
There are all sorts of other implications if the Reyes/Buehrle/Johnson deal to Toronto is completed as advertised. Obviously, this revivifies a Toronto franchise that was already showing signs of being on the upswing last year and as far back as 2010-11. It sure knocks the price down for whoever is the Jays' first choice for the manager's job. It might make John Farrell a little remorseful. And it buries the Yankees in the American League East; there would now be at least three other teams in the division with more talent than New York. The prospects of Alex Rodriguez going to the lame duck Miami franchise (first reported blah blah blah here and blah blah blah ) might actually have increased, on the premise that Loria and MLB have to do something to make it at least look like they're trying to field a product worthy of 2013 big league ticket prices).
But the biggest long-term implications are fairly simple: the franchise carousel, all but quiet since the upheaval of the 1953-72 era, will begin to spin again.
Miami has a slight chance of survival (that stadium is standing, and a mess of prospects can suddenly win a division – ask the Oakland A's about that) but Tampa Bay is gone. One would assume that at the latest the season of 2020 opens without a Florida team in the majors.
Where do the Rays (and probably the Marlins) move?
Here are the top U.S. Metropolitan Areas without MLB teams ranked by population, on 2011 estimates drawn from the Official 2010 United States Census:
12. Riverside/San Bernardino/Ontario CA 4,304,997 23. Portland OR/Vancouver WA 2,262,605 24. San Antonio/New Braunfels TX 2,194,927 25. Sacramento/Roseville CA 2,176,235 26. Orlando/Daytona Beach FL 2,171,360 30. Las Vegas 1,969,975 31. San Jose 1,865,450 32. Columbus OH 1,858,464 33. Charlotte/Gastonia NC 1,795,472 34. Austin/Round Rock TX 1,783,519 35. Indianapolis 1,778,568 36. Virginia Beach/Norfolk 1,679,894 37. Nashville 1,617,142
Nashville you say? Virginia Beach? Hahahahahahaha?
Not so fast. Every metropolitan area on this list is larger than Milwaukee and Riverside, Portland, San Antonio and Sacramento are bigger than Cincinnati. There are certain practacalities here. All of Southern California is Dodger/Angel territory and the Magic Johnson group that just spent Eleventy A Billion on the Dodgers isn't going to give up claim on anything. Though Texas is a big place don't tell that to the Rangers and Astros, who claim both the San Antonio and Austin zones. Columbus is Cleveland's territory (unless it's Cincinnati's), Orlando would have at least some of the same problems as Tampa/St. Pete, and the Giants and Athletics are in their fifth different decade of arguing over San Jose.
So the Rays go to Portland and the Marlins to Sacramento? Not so fast.
You know who'd be 15th on the list – right between Phoenix and Seattle – if we made it of not American metropolitan areas but North American?
Right.
15. Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Regional population: 3,824,221.
But wait, didn't things go very badly in Montreal before? They certainly did, but not because of the city nor its love of baseball. Corrupt government and underfunded ownership and a betrayed fan base – all of them saddled with the greatest white elephant in the history of North American sports construction, Olympic Stadium. In every full season between 1979 and 1983 – even in that XXL Airplane Hangar – Les Expos drew at least 2,102,173 fans a year.
The peak total – 2,320,651 in 1983 – edged out the Cardinals for second place in National League attendance, and was just about a million more than the Mets drew in New York. It was about then that stuff started falling from the roof of the tribute to provincial graft, and star players started falling off the Expos' roster. But make no mistake about it: Montreal supported baseball. As late as 1997 the Expos still brought in a million-and-a-half fans (more than the Mets or the Giants).
If all that could not be done in the '90s and '00s could be put together – a downtown stadium with government support, plus a well-run franchise making a long-term commitment – baseball's second try in Montreal could be a triumph. And consider if it were the Rays fleeing north. Not only would Montreal get that well-run franchise, but it would suddenly find itself in a division with rivals from hated cities like Boston and New York…
…and Toronto.
Montreal and Toronto in the same division. Genius, I tell ya. Genius.
It's a win-win. Unless you're one of those few Florida baseball fans.
Oh yeah, I left out a fifth thing to do about the Marlins and Marlins Park: E) Ship Giancarlo Stanton separately. And while you're at it, you might as well start wrapping uber-prospect Christian Yelich too.
Of all the appalling abuses of democracy and ruthless dismantling of the country represented by Bill C-38, one stands out of as representative of the right-wing dystopia that Stephen Harper has in store for the 99 per cent. And that is the mentality and ideology behind the draconian changes to Employment Insurance. This is particularly true of the changes affecting seasonal workers in the Atlantic region, but in general the whole underlying principle that workers should simply move, holus bolus, to where the jobs are is an assault on the very nature of community.
How Did Liberalism Get So Conservative? read more
Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners ‘Punch to the Gut' Musical on Residential Schools Returns to Vancouver Children of God has been shaped by intense audience reactions, says director Corey Payette.
Of course, it is not news that neo-liberalism -- obsessed with the individual, competition and the market -- destroys community. Margaret Thatcher made it explicit by stating "There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families." All happily selling their labour and buying stuff. And that's all there is -- no cooperation, no compassion, no equity, no sharing.
Of course Thatcher's absurdist declaration was aspirational. This was the model of the world they hoped to create, though to a depressing degree they were successful. But the strong resistance to Harper's gutting of EI demonstrates that Canadians know both that community and society do exist and that they are worth saving. Even the pro-business premiers of the Atlantic region came out swinging against the changes because they know their communities have for decades been maintained on part-time seasonal work. Indeed one of the very best features of EI was that it recognized this and was adapted to make such communities viable.
Yet in the decades since the free trade deals were first signed we have gradually stopped talking about community and have perhaps forgotten just how critical it is to human health and indeed what it is to be human. The hyper-competitiveness promoted by neo-liberalism and the politicians it has captured is completely at odds with our social natures. Community -- the commons -- is at the core of what we have lost and reclaiming it will be at the core of any successful social movement that halts and reverses the current trends.
A town to emulate
I was reminded of this when I read Malcolm Gladwell's remarkable book Outliers. The book is a compelling look at human achievements that fall outside normal experience. The first chapter is about Roseto, a U.S. town founded in the late 1800s by the inhabitants of an Italian town of the same name. In the late 1950s the ethnically homogeneous town caught the attention of doctor Stephen Wolf who was told by a colleague that there wasn't a single man under 65 in the town who suffered from heart disease -- an almost unbelievable finding given that at the time heart disease was the leading cause of death of men under 65.
Wolf's subsequent investigation of this phenomenon found a classic outlier: a community so remarkably healthy that it fell completely outside the norm for similar communities in the area. It showed not only low rates of heart disease, but a 30 to 35 per cent lower rate of death from other causes. It had no suicides, no alcoholism, no drug addiction, very little crime and no one on welfare. Wolf, with the help of a sociologist, slowly eliminated possible explanations: diet, genetics, geography.
What explained Roseto was Roseto itself. They observed "how the Rosetans visited one another, stopping to chat in Italian on the street, say, or cooking for one another in their backyards. They learned about the extended family clans that underlay the town's social structures. ...They counted 22 separate civic organizations in a town of under 2,000 people. They picked up on the particularly egalitarian ethos of the community which discouraged the wealthy from flaunting their success and helped the unsuccessful obscure their failures."
Roseto was healthy because its inhabitants "had created a powerful, protective social structure capable of insulating them from the pressures of the modern world." We could do worse than to look at Roseto of the 1950s and '60s when we start to rebuild community in Canada, because if we want to halt the march to a competitive, mean-spirited and selfish existence for our children, this is the vision we have to keep in our minds.
Reversing the Great Dismantling
Reclaiming what we have lost will not be easy. The policies already implemented by the anti-governments of the day present huge barriers to such a project. Studies of work-life balance suggest that most working people in Canada don't have anything resembling family life, let alone time for engaging in community. Over the past 20 years of culture war against the commons we have acquiesced to the notion that we are here to serve the economy. The consistent line of the Harper government in forcing through its budget implementation bill is that it must be passed as quickly as possible in the interests of the economy. Literally everything the government does -- from EI changes to OAS revisions to gutting environmental laws -- is dedicated to the economy. This is what Canada has been reduced to.
Corporations, of course, promote this ideology and take advantage of it. A small example of this revealed itself in my community, Powell River, when our hedge-fund owned paper mill, Catalyst Paper, presented the city with a cheque for half the taxes it owed, declaring that it would only pay for the specific services it actually used -- presumably roads, fire and police protection, and water. In other words all the other services which fulfilled its employees needs -- recreation, culture, health, education -- had nothing to do with them. For Catalyst, like the Harper government, one may infer that there is no such thing as community.
The example of Roseto has lessons for progressives fighting the gradual dismantling of the country. It suggests that we need to rethink the model of social change we have been using for over 40 years -- single issue organizations, sometimes referred to as issue "silos," organizations fighting for Medicare, child care, the environment, against poverty, for affordable secondary education -- it's a long list.
This model of social change organizing was formed in the early 1970s at a time when governments actually believed in democratic governance and genuinely engaged with civil society groups. Those groups not only pressured governments on policy matters, they offered expert advice on the social policy areas they focused on. It was by no means a perfect relationship, but there was a genuine dialogue. But today such groups' interventions are like one hand clapping. Governments are dismantling what previous governments built -- they don't want advice and unless you're strong enough to actually threaten their power they have no intention of responding to even majority opinion.
I am not suggesting that single issue organizations have been ineffective. Far from it, had they not been active things would be immeasurably worse and Medicare, for example, would be well down the road to privatization. But it is clear that these groups are now, for the most part, shadows of their former selves, exhausted from their efforts to have an impact on the Harper (and other) governments and are finding it more and more difficult to sign up members and motivate them to act. The major exceptions are environmental groups, with the Enbridge pipeline issue as the obvious example.
Coalitions need leaders
The main response of single issue organizations to the neo-liberal reality has been the creation of coalitions -- an effort to create a broad social movement by getting all groups to join in battles that affect all their concerns. The anti-free trade Action Canada Network of the late 1980s was the most important and most successful. But the initiators of the ACN, the churches and labour, have been virtually silent for years. With labour unwilling to lead and fund coalitions, their future is in doubt.
Reclaiming the commons through a broad-based movement will not be easy, but two momentous developments illustrate the need for reinventing social change movements: Occupy and the Quebec rebellion. Both have something extraordinary and potentially transformational in common: they see themselves as creating community and are marked not just by anger at injustice and inequality but by an outpouring of joy at discovering that newly created community.
The Occupy movement's creating of new communities (with libraries, day care, kitchens and medical clinics at their sites) is well known -- so, too, is the nurturing positive spirit of the movement. The Quebec 'Casseroles' rebellion (named after the nightly, spirited banging of pots in communities across Quebec) is imbued with that same spirit. According to journalist Ethan Cox, "It is not a movement of anger, of rage or of hate. It is a movement of love, of community, and of hope. People who would be alone in their houses watching TV take to the streets and march with neighbours they never knew they had."
If you want to know how governments like Harper's authoritarian regime will be decisively dispatched to history's dustbin you need look no further than these two movements. They reveal not only the strength of their community-based moral imperative, but the weakness of politics as usual. For decades progressive politics has mimicked the individualistic consumer society which is its greatest barrier to success. We do politics like we do our job or our recreation or family life -- separate from and too often unrelated to other aspects of our lives. Because of the peculiar infrastructure of civil society we devote time to "social change" -- going to meetings, writing checks, going to demos, writing letters -- as if it were a job. Our time spent trying to make the world a better place parallels the political silos we choose to devote time to. But it doesn't build community.
Single issue organizations will have a role to play for a long while yet and that role is still important in fighting back against the destruction of democratic governance. But it is now largely a rearguard action against powerful and ruthless forces who are committed to dismantling what we have built. We need new activist models, rooted in community and replicating Occupy's and Casseroles's energy and vitality, if we are actually to build the world we know is possible.
MUMBAI (Reuters) - The world's top cotton buyers, all in Asia, are flocking to India to secure supplies after fierce storms in the United States, the biggest exporter of the fibre, affected the size and quality of the crop, dealers said.

In the past week alone, India, the world's second-biggest cotton exporter, sealed deals to sell about a million bales to China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia - key garment suppliers to brands such as H&M, Inditex-owned Zara and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
That compared with 300,000 bales in the two weeks before.
Dealers expect contracts similar to last week in the next few months, which could help India's exports grow by a quarter in the 2017/18 season beginning October.
“Indian cotton has great chances this year,” said Chirag Patel, chief executive at Jaydeep Cotton Fibers Pvt Ltd, a leading exporter. Asian “buyers are switching to Indian cotton from the U.S.”
Hurricanes Harvey and Irma caused widespread damage to the crop in Texas and Georgia, major cotton producing states, with the effects more widespread in Texas, dealers said.
“We definitely lost cotton in Texas. It wiped out 500,000-600,000 bales,” said Peter Egli, risk manager at Plexus Cotton Ltd, a Chicago-based merchant, referring to the impact of Harvey in the top-producing U.S. state.
In 2016, the United States exported 86 percent of its cotton, 69 percent of which went to Asia, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Other cotton producers like Brazil and Australia could benefit from lower supplies from the United States, but may find it difficult to match the price offered by India, where a bumper harvest is likely to keep the rates lower.
Traders in India, also the world's biggest cotton producer, signed their export deals at around 80 cents per lb on a cost and freight basis, nearly 2 cents lower than the supplies from the United States, dealers said.
India could soon sell at lower prices.
Farmers are likely to harvest a record 40 million bales of cotton in the 2017/18 season beginning Oct. 1, 2017, bringing domestic prices down and making exports even more competitive, Patel said.
For the new 2017/18 season, farmers have planted 12.1 million hectares with cotton, up 19 percent from a year earlier, farm ministry data showed.
India harvested 34.5 million bales of cotton in the 2016/17 season.
Favourable crop conditions would help India sell 7.5 million bales of cotton on the world market in 2017/18 against 6 million bales in the previous year, said Nayan Mirani, partner at Khimji Visram & Sons, a leading cotton exporter.
Some traders believe that India's exports could surpass 8 million bales if China, the world's biggest cotton consumer, steps up imports in 2017/18.
Beijing, which began selling cotton from its reserves on March 6, had planned to stop the daily auctions at the end of August. But it extended the sales for an additional month after local prices rose amid tighter supply, indicating the need to replenish falling inventories.
A Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm company said they had received a flurry of orders in the past few weeks, especially for December quarter shipments. They declined to be identified because they were not authorised to talk to media.
Hobbled by the rising rupee and unattractive global prices, India was struggling to sign export deals until a few weeks ago. But a recent rally in global prices made overseas more sales competitive.
Other than attractive prices, close proximity encouraged most Asian buyers to turn to India. While cargoes from the United States take about 50 days to reach Vietnam, Bangladesh and Pakistan, India can ship its cotton in two weeks.
India's new season crop will be available to buyers from October, but the supplies from the United States will reach consumers only in January, said Mirani of Khimji Visram, a top exporter.
Current market trends give cotton buyers a chance to look at alternative supplies, said Vu Duc Giang, chairperson of Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association.
But forecasts of higher global output will ease concerns over cotton supplies, Giang said.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture this week said U.S. cotton output is seen at 21.76 million bales for 2017/18 compared with 20.55 million bales projected last month.
We hear it all the time. The NFL is a passing league. ... We're in a golden age of quarterbacks. ... Running backs will be considered the bottom rung of humanity in a future dystopian society.
Breer: Minnesota's grand plan The Albert Breer says this is nothing new for Rick Spielman and Leslie Frazier.
The Vikings made their mark in the draft, butsays this is nothing new for Rick Spielman and Leslie Frazier. More ...
Well, nobody's saying that last one, but still. Somewhere along the line, running backs stopped getting respect. They rarely get paid big money. They can't even get drafted in the first round anymore.
All this disregard obscures the fact that we're living in a sneaky golden age of NFL tailbacks.
In an ATL Mailbag this weekend, a reader asked if Arian Foster was an elite running back (Ed. note: Ugh, "elite"). My first thought was, "Of course they are!" but then they barely cracked my top five.
That got me thinking: How would a list of top running backs look? Taking rookies out of the equation, here's my top 30. Feel free to savage me in the comment section and across all modes of social media.
All hail the king
1) Adrian Peterson
You can't build any golden age argument without at least one G.O.A.T. candidate. Peterson is coming off (arguably) the greatest season by a running back in NFL history. In six seasons, they have 8,849 rushing yards and 76 touchdowns. If they stay healthy, every rushing record can be his. When breaking down a list like this, it's AP and it's everyone else.
Studs
2) Marshawn Lynch 3) LeSean McCoy 4) Arian Foster 5) Doug Martin
I didn't mean to summon memories of bad syndicated television of the 90s, but if I did, I have no regrets .You can build a franchise around any of these guys. Hell, they could all be Hall of Fame selections before their time is done. Lynch is only now getting the recognition they deserve, while McCoy might be the league's most frightening back from a gameplan standpoint. Foster has powered the Houston Texans for three seasons, while Martin is coming off one of the best rookie seasons ever.
More franchise building blocks
6) Jamaal Charles 7) Alfred Morris 8) Frank Gore 9) Ray Rice
In truth, there's not much separating this group from the four names ahead of them. This is what I mean when I say sneaky golden age -- we have some serious depth in terms of star power. Though it was obscured by Peterson's heroics and a crummy Kansas City Chiefs team, Charles' return from knee surgery was outstanding. Morris was a sixth-round pick who ran for 1,600 yards as a rookie. How can you not love Gore? As for Rice, we'd have them higher on this list if we didn't believe Bernard Pierce was about to take a substantial bite out of their workload.
You can't go wrong
10) Matt Forte 11) Chris Johnson 12) Darren Sproles 13) Stevan Ridley
You can make the argument that Forte deserves to be higher, and I'll be glad to hear it. Johnson has yet to come close to their 2,000-yard production in 2009, but their three 80-yard touchdown runs last season prove they still have the burst (he has an offensive line now, too). We wouldn't have Sproles this high if they weren't in the Saints' offense, but they are, and he's perfect in it. Ridley has the potential to be New England Patriots' first true backfield star since Corey Dillon.
Candidates for "The Leap"
14) C.J. Spiller 15) David Wilson 16) Trent Richardson 17) Bernard Pierce
As a Spiller fantasy owner last year, I found great anguish in Chan Gailey limiting Spiller to just 207 carries. No disrespect to Fred Jackson, but Spiller deserves bell-cow status. Wilson emerged from Tom Coughlin's doghouse and became a home-run threat. Richardson is a serious talent who never got a chance to play at 100 percent last year. Pierce may be the future at running back in Baltimore.
Track records with question marks
18) Maurice Jones-Drew 19) Fred Jackson
This time last year, MJD was the defending rushing champ chirping about contract indignities. One failed holdout and a serious foot injury later, we'll see if they can approach past glories. Jackson has had trouble staying healthy the past two years and now shares the load with an emerging star in Spiller.
How can I trust you?
20) Darren McFadden 21) DeMarco Murray 22) Rashard Mendenhall 23) Ryan Mathews
Blame on scheme if you wish, but McFadden was dreadful last year. We're sick of waiting for them to become a true star. Murray needs to prove their body can withstand the duties that come with a featured role. Mendenhall gets a fresh start with the Arizona Cardinals, but their 2012 season left a bad taste. Mathews is running out of time to show he's anything other than a huge personnel blunder by the Bolts.
Floating in the ether
24) Ahmad Bradshaw
Still unemployed. Still has bad feet. Then again, Bradshaw consistently is productive and was always praised for their toughness by New York Giants coaches and teammates. It's surprising no one has taken a flier yet.
Bound to disappoint
25) Reggie Bush
I don't have anything against Bush, but the empty hype around them never seems to cease. Bush is like a buffalo chicken wrap -- the idea of it is better than what you actually get.
JAG
26) BenJarvus Green-Ellis 27) Steven Jackson 28) Shonn Greene 29) Chris Ivory 30) Willis McGahee
JAG, as in, just another guy. Green-Ellis is a annual JAG all-star. They might get a call from the JAG Hall of Fame when all is said and done. Sorry, I'm not ready to buy into Jackson reverting back to their Rams hey-day with the Atlanta Falcons. Greene is a dreadfully boring football player, while their replacement with the New York Jets -- Chris Ivory -- won't exactly summon Fireman Ed from their fortified underground bunker. McGahee is Jason Voorhees unkillable, and for that, they round out this list.

Egypt's military has begun conducting air strikes around the area of North Sinai where a deadly mosque attack that killed more than 230 occurred on Friday, security sources and eyewitnesses said.
The strikes have been concentrated in several mountainous areas surrounding Al Rawdah mosque where militants are believed to be hiding out, the security sources said.
The Egyptian army stated that a number of the terrorists involved in the massacre of Al-Rawda mosque in northern Sinai, which killed 235 people, were killed in air raids.
The military spokesperson, Col. Tamer Rifai, said that "as part of the pursuit of the terrorists responsible for targeting the worshipers at Al Rawda mosque in Al-Arish, the air force destroyed a number of vehicles involved in the brutal terrorist attack.”
Rifai added that a number of terrorist outposts containing weapons and ammunition belonging to terrorist were also targeted and completely destroyed.
They stressed that the law enforcement forces in North Sinai, in cooperation with the Air Force, will continue to comb the terrorist strongholds and eliminate them.
In their address to the nation, Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said that the Egyptian army will respond with brute force, calling on the Egyptians to unite in the face of terrorism, and vowed to avenge the perpetrators of the attack and restore security and stability.
They added that "what is happening is aimed at stopping our efforts to confront terrorism. It is aimed at destroying our will and shaking the confidence of the Egyptians. But we are steadfast and will continue to fight terrorism."
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has instructed the military and police to secure all religious sites in Sinai after the attack.
Egyptian authorities earlier closed the recently opened Rafah border passage with Gaza after the attack citing security concerns.

With P.K. Subban back in the fold, one would have thought that the drama that followed them around during the lockout and their subsequent holdout would have subsided. That does not appear to be the case. Word out of Montreal today indicates that head coach Michel Therrien has banned the popular “Triple Low 5” celebration that Subban and Canadiens goaltender Carey Price had engaged in after Habs' wins, and had become a favorite of the Montreal fanbase.
Therrien said of the move that they wanted their team to be more humble, and stated that the team would salute the fans by raising their sticks at centre ice after home wins. This would be the only move acceptable for celebrating team wins. Therrien went on to say, “In life you have to be humble. We have to respect the game, other team, the fans.”
Bascially what we have here is an NHL coach defending the traditional ways of doing things. Standing up for the old guard and rejecting the passion that is part of the new generation of the NHL. Basically Michel Therrien is against the new way of celebrating, and calling any flashy celebrations, as the work of “disrespectful douchers” (as argued in this article by the Big Mick).
This rejection of personality is not good for the team, nor for the fans. The Habs have one of the loudest (if not the loudest) buildings in the NHL. The passion of the hockey fan in Montreal is unmistakeable. Subban and Price are fan favorites, and I believe the crowd enjoys the personality this two display. It has become a trademark of Canadiens' wins over the past two seasons and part of the fun of the game.
The celebration occurs in the Habs end of the rink, and is not taunting or mocking the opposition. It is a fun way for the players to celebrate a hard fought win, engage the fans, and is not individualistic as it is part of the team celebrations with their goaltender.
To me this is just another example of stodgy, old school hockey culture taking away from the new and exciting passion that engages younger generations.
Earlier this month, Therrien stated that they were going to try to make PK Subban not just a better player, but also a better person. Those words were ominous and unexplained at the time, but it appears that this move is their first step to doing so. Therrien should let the kid be, and not try to suck the personality, good humour, and fun that has made Subban one of the most likeable and energetic players among the Canadiens fanbase.
What's next? No celebrations for anyone, even the fans. No personality allowed in Montreal. If anyone so much as does more than a polite golf clap for goals, we should escort them out of the Bell Centre. It's disrespectful to celebrate scoring on or beating the other team, winning games isn't the goal of pro sports, its about respect apparently. Heck maybe we'll even let the other team score, to ensure all games end in a tie. Wouldn't want to hurt anyone's feelings and show them up.

On the morning of November 26, 171 Chinese migrant workers in Singapore — all of whom were bus drivers for major public transport operator SMRT — refused to get on the shuttle buses sent to pick them up at their dormitory. Assembling in protest against unsatisfactory wages and living conditions, they pointed out that SMRT discrimates based on nationality. While the Chinese bus drivers were given a basic monthly salary of S$1,075 (approx. US$880), their Malaysian counterparts were being paid S$1,375 (approx. US$1,126) a month. The Chinese workers are given lodging and transport while the Malaysians are not, however, the Chinese have also made complaints about the living conditions in the dormitories.
Although the small, peaceful protest did not cause much disruption, the event drew plenty of attention in the media and from the public. As I have previously mentioned, Singapore has been relatively strike-free for years. Previous strikes by migrant workers had gone by fairly unnoticed, but this time the protest did come not from construction workers. They came to the public service sector, and specifically to a company whose reputation had already taken a drubbing over the past year due to train breakdowns and whistle-blowing from unhappy workers.
After the news of the strike broke, the National Transport Workers' Union (NTWU) issued a statement saying that they “did not have the legal mandate” to represent the Chinese workers, urging them to go back to work “immediately.” Part of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), the NTWU was formed to represent transport workers in Singapore, but has been criticized for not serving its purpose, as it supported SMRT management after it changed the pay framework earlier this year.
After entering into negotiations with SMRT management, the 171 bus drivers agreed to return to work on November 27, but 88 bus drivers chose not to get on the shuttle bus, saying that negotiations had not been satisfactory. After Monday's negotiations, SMRT management had apparently offered them a S$25 per month pay raise, and given them a week to think it over.
Mainstream media outlets like The Straits Times and Channel NewsAsia bent over backwards to avoid using the word “strike” in Monday's coverage, choosing instead to say that the bus drivers had “refused to go to work.” The word was only used when the Acting Minister of Manpower Tan Chuan Jin declared on Tuesday that the bus drivers had participated in an “illegal strike,” for which there would be “zero tolerance.” (The law related to industrial action was briefly explained here.) The NTUC — a national confederation of trade unions in Singapore — endorsed the government's action, saying in its statement, “Any action that is illegal must and will be dealt with firmly, regardless of whether the workers are local or foreign. We have a system in place to deal with workplace issues and grievances, one that has been painstakingly built over the years and has served us well. This must continue.”
SMRT lodged a police report against the 88 who did not return to work on Tuesday, and five were arrested and charged under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act. If found guilty they could face fines up to S$2,000 and/or up to 12 months in jail. Twenty-nine others had their work permits revoked and will be repatriated to China.
The dependence on foreign labor has grown within public transport as companies find it difficult to attract locals to work as bus drivers. Chinese drivers now make up about 22 percent of SMRT's pool of 2,000 drivers. This trend is reflected in many other industries in Singapore as well, where foreign labor has been brought in to make up for the lack of local workers. A side effect of such a situation is that many labor issues and actions are now being highlighted and undertaken by migrant workers. In 2009, about 200 Chinese construction workers gathered outside the Ministry of Manpower to protest unpaid wages. In February this year a group of Bangladeshi workers organized a sit-in to protest unpaid wages and substandard food provided at work. In August a group of Chinese workers at Panasonic's Singapore factory started a petition to highlight low wages, forced overtime and high agent fees.
Still, these disputes never go beyond their individual circumstances. There is yet to be a union representing migrant workers, and it is difficult for migrant workers to connect and organize outside of their own circles. These workers are often vulnerable to cancellations of work permits and repatriation, and non-governmental organizations like the Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics (HOME) and Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) are unable to encourage them to organize without being censured by the government for inciting conflict.
Although some Singaporeans supported the bus drivers' action, many others condemned it, saying that they should have tried to negotiate rather than strike and disrupt the efficiency of Singapore's services. Others argued that this incident has showed why companies should hire Singaporeans over foreigners – after all, Singaporeans would never go on strike!
It's a strange mindset. If the workers' concerns were legitimate, why this rejection of their choice to strike? Despite the drastic consequences, the strike had not been entirely in vain — the workers were able to force the company to take action on a problem that could have otherwise been brushed aside, and also to attract the attention of the wider public in examining labor relations in Singapore.
The bus strike has demonstrated that organized industrial action can be effective and useful in promoting the rights of workers. Why then are Singaporeans still so quick to reject such strategies, preferring to restrict their complaints to coffee tables and online forums?
“In this particular SMRT case, it's because the state (led by minister Tan CJ) has been very firm in framing the argument in legalistic terms … the first time the term [strike] was used it was an “illegal strike”, and so even when it is acknowledged there are unfair employment terms, people don't want to be seen as endorsing something that is against the law,” said migrant rights advocate Stephanie Chok. “There is also the emphasis on how these are essential service workers, the disruption caused to commuters and how other bus drivers have to cover their shifts — their strike action is very much framed as selfish and inconveniencing others.”
Blogger Andrew Loh agrees. “Ultimately, it is because the system is geared towards political disempowerment of the people. And anyone who sticks their neck out will be cut down.”
Yet sometimes there is no other choice but to take such action. As TWC2 has pointed out, it can often be difficult for workers to highlight their concerns through official processes. Rules written on paper may not necessarily be practically applied.
“From our experience assisting migrant workers with the Ministry of Manpower, the mediation process tends to be biased, favoring the employer,” says migrant rights advocate Shelley Thio.
Efforts have been made to stop the drivers from airing their grievances in the future. It has been reported that SMRT has banned the drivers from speaking to the media, and that security around the dormitory has been increased to keep the media out. The strikers have also all been given warnings, but the deportation of 29 workers will no doubt serve as the most effective reminder of the consequences of taking action.
The day after the 29 were repatriated, SMRT issued a statement saying that they would not adjust the salaries of Chinese bus drivers.
It's a sad indictment of labor relations in Singapore. Much needs to change before the situation can be improved, and migrant workers cannot be the only ones in this struggle. Singaporeans, too, need to begin to stand up for labor rights.
A group of concerned Singaporeans have thus decided to gather in support of the Chinese workers, planning a forum for the weekend advocating for “equal work, equal pay” and for independent unions. They also plan to release a statement of solidarity and begin a photo project where Singaporeans are encouraged to post photos of themselves with placards calling for an end to discrimination and the establishment of independent trade unions.
“The reaction of the public in support of the government's actions shows that there is still much work to be done in terms of getting people to understand what the fundamental rights for workers are,” says Ted Tan from human rights group Think Centre. “The workers' call was to seek just and fair treatment and remedies. So we must express solidarity on their choice and form of action.”
There is no guarantee that the establishment will take note of the campaign. Change is a long time coming, yet still far out of reach. But the hope is that these efforts will at least begin to turn the tide of public opinion, and show Singaporeans that collective action is an important part of the struggle for a fairer system of labor relations.

A coyote was rescued after getting itself stuck at the Burlington Canal on Sunday.
A concerned citizen waved Hamilton police marine unit officers over to the ship canal wall to help rescue a coyote that was stuck and had its fur frozen by the spray Sunday. (Hamilton Police Marine Unit/Twitter) Const. Ben Rushton said officers were out on regular patrol when a concerned citizen waved them over to the canal wall and showed them where a coyote was wedged behind a ladder that leads down to the water.
"Nobody knows how or why the coyote ended up there," Rushton said. "Because of some of the spray, its fur was frozen to the concrete."
Hamilton police's Marine Unit got in touch with animal control workers in Hamilton and Burlington, who were able to free the coyote after checking to make sure it didn't have any injuries.
Hi everyone,
We're three months through 2014, and the ambitious plans we announced for RuneScape's combat at the start of the year are proceeding apace. Alongside my post about Legacy Mode, I wanted to let you know what we're working on to make major improvements to the current combat system and revitalise PvP.
We've already released Revolution, Momentum Plus, ability queuing, ability bar sharing and bank quick presets, but they're just the tip of the iceberg.
You'll be aware of some of the key changes already from your votes in the Power to the Players system, but here's a recap:
Special Attacks – If you've played the combat beta, you'll know that all of the old special attacks are implemented and are now undergoing polish and balancing. This will add more diversity to viable gear and another notch of excitement when fighting.
138 Combat Calculation – The community voted overwhelming to reintroduce this the 138 Combat Calculation. This is also available to test on the beta already, where we've got a tweaked version of the old formula that give Magic and Ranged equal contribution.
Monster Aggression – We're making a change to monster aggro so the creatures across RuneScape are more aggressive; again, more like it used to be. Of course, the game is multi-way combat now, so we're taking a new approach for aggro rules, but the end result will be that more monsters are aggressive and combat training can be slightly lower-intensity.
Interface changes – These are a range of smaller UI improvements, including allowing chat to stay in focus during combat, clearer target information and a reworked quick inventory feature. These all contribute towards combat feeling smoother and more intuitive.
Balancing – We're making some important balance adjustments to certain aspects of combat, especially the defensive side of things. We're making shields and defensive ‘tank' armour more useful, and reviewing defensive abilities so more of them are important and relevant.
PvP mechanics - We believe the PvP scene will really benefit from all of the EoC improvements and introduction of Legacy, but we're also working on specific initiatives to revitalise it. This means making changes to the combat system so it delivers more satisfying PvP gameplay, including XP for PvP, tuning ability damage and stun affects, rebalancing PvP Armour and improving click input recognition for faster responsiveness.
PvP content – It's just as important to improve PvP-centric game content and how it's accessed. This will include overhauling the Crucible and reworking a bunch of other PvP minigames, and creating a grouping system that makes getting into such content much quicker and easier.
Note that the many of the PvP mechanical changes and content listed above have entered the beta servers today. Read over the patch notes for full details, and give them a try in the beta!
When's it Coming?
We're aiming at the next big combat improvements batch to be in May and that'll contain the majority of the features mentioned above. However, there are a few features we feel are best to roll out alongside the release of Legacy Mode, such as the 138 combat calculation and special attacks, so those will come a bit later.
As a summary, here's our current plan for combat improvements:
April - Combat Improvements Beta update.
May – Release current batch of combat improvements.
June – Legacy Mode beta.
June – Release rejuvenation of PvP improvements.
Summer TBD – Legacy Mode, 138 combat calculation and Special Attacks.
Summer TBD – Grouping system & first batch of PvP content reworks.
Thanks for reading. Remember that your feedback's a crucial part of all of this. Please do try out our latest combat updates on the beta servers, and let us know what you think over on the forums.

Here's a weird detail spun out of the Roy Moore situation in Alabama. The GOP Senate nominee, who is running for office despite numerous allegations that they sought relationships with teenage girls as an adult, held a Wednesday event at Magnolia Springs Baptist Church in Mobile. There, Rev. Bill Atkinson led singing, AL.com reports. Alabamans may remember them for their 2012 conviction for obstruction and conspiracy. A federal jury found them guilty for interfering in an investigation into their son. The younger Atkinson, William IV, was charged in Honduras for molesting children at family-run orphanage.
It's unclear how their son's case wrapped up. The elder Atkinson did not immediately respond to a Law&Crime request for comment.
The Honduras investigation started because of another one of the reverend's sons Jonathan Atkinson. They said some of the children at the orphanage reported being abused, so they set up a surveillance system in their brother's office. Prosecutors said the reverend attempted to bring William IV back home to the States. In their attempted cover up, they asked two of their children to destroy a hard drive containing evidence against Jr.
The reverend serves as the music minister at the Magnolia Springs Baptist Church. They did not talk about politics at Wednesday's event, according to AL.com.
“The sign out front says Baptists, and Baptists have to sing,” they said, telling the audience to join in.
As for Moore, allegations against them come at a pretty inconvenient time. Alabamans will vote December 12 in a special election to fill the U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions‘s former Senate seat. The claims put a dent in their campaign. Normally, this would be an easy victory: He's the GOP nominee in a red state. But it doesn't help that numerous people have gone on the record saying that decades ago they pursued romantic relationships with teens, one as young as 14. (The age of consent in Alabama was and is 16.) They have called the allegations a political smear job by media outlets like The Washington Post who broke the story and Democrats. They even took shots at “establishment” Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said they should quit the race.
A collective gasp ripples through the crowd as nopony says a word. Something opens itself up to Twilight: there is nothing anypony in this room can do against an Alicorn princess, if they mean them ill. Twilight is by certain metrics one of the most developed mages in Equestria, or at least one of the most studied, but they have no combat training whatsoever, and they have no hope in Ponyville having a single proficient combat mage. They have never fought anypony before, and almost never hurt anypony. And even that time, they had help.
"Tell me, my little ponies," Luna spits, in open mockery of their sister. "Does any of you know who I am?
Twilight knows, of course. In that moment, it feels like the only thing she's ever known: On the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid their escape, and they will bring about nighttime eternal. But there's no point in singling themselves out in the dark horse's attention. And anyway, their mind is saturated in frantic thoughts of escape; a desperate battle between fight and flight instincts is raging, and fight is being expediently routed.
"Not a single pony? Not one of you foals has heeded the prophecy of my return?"
Twilight has enough magic capacity for exactly one medium-range teleport, with roughly a twenty-two-second charge time. There's no way she's going to get away with a glowing horn for that long, or probably even a full second. If they can find something to get behind—
"I," screams the umbral god, "am Nightmare Moon." Them voice booms with an unreal authority. An ice-blue shimmer sparks at the end of their horn as they speak the words.
...Huh? She's going by a different name?
"You may know me from your history books and old pony's tales as Princess Luna. But that princess of the old kingdom is dead."
Can an Alicorn sense ambient magic? Twilight fears hiding their horn's glow underneath a tablecloth, but being obliterated in a split second anyway. It's entirely possible that putting off checking out that Alicorn reference guide would become a fatal mistake. Twilight Sparkle, a pony who lives more in the written word than in reality, destroyed by reading the wrong books. Has Celestia ever sensed my magic from far away? They run over whatever memories of Celestia come to their desperate mind... yes, in fact, just once. At their entrance exam. But that was sort of an exceptional circumstance...
"One thousand years ago, I was banished to the moon by my sister for beckoning the glory of eternal night. But tonight, I have escaped my lunar prison. I will reign forevermore, and the sun will never rise again!
As a suffocating sense of doom pervades their mind, Twilight's powerlessness pushes down upon them There is exactly one pony in the kingdom who could hope to protest if Nightmare Moon decides to start murdering. Where is she?
"Princess Celestia is Princess no more! They have been vanquished by my cursed hooves! Run, my little ponies! Spread the word across the world of my return! Train your soldiers, mount your forces! Depose me if your meager hooves are able; the bearer of the Elements of Harmony welcomes all challengers!"
Twilight screams internally before the words are even fully processed. The... bearer? Something black unfurls within her, and their heart starts to mourn Celestia, until they can't feel it beat. Them hooves fail her, and they pile upon the ground.
"Your eschaton begins at this very moment! Savor your dying memories of the sun!"
Nightmare Moon's gangly forehooves each stomp onto the wooden planks in turn, and a crystalline blue shockwave ripples across the stage, shattering it end to end. At the same instant, every candle in the hall is snuffed without a sound. Four helical beams spray from their swirled horn and crash into the top corners of the room, dislodging chunks of rafters and stone. Ponies start screaming and scrambling for their lives as they look on and laughs a laugh that sounds like something feral dying in an earthquake.
And then Nightmare Moon is gone, stepping through the same starry mist by which they arrived.
Twilight, unmoving, exhales, and their horn begins charging.
Twilight materializes directly in front of Spike's bed, sees it, screams, and gallops downstairs and out the door.
The streets near their library are eerily empty. How could I be so stupid? So bucking selfish?! After a few streets, they pass the fastest runners, mostly stallions, each giving them a look of utter confusion and pity. Maybe some of them who witnessed their earlier breakdown think she's amnesic right now, or in a fugue, running towards some deluded end, but nopony stops to turn them around. I need you to be okay. You have to be okay. The crowd thickens as they draw closer; by the time she's within a few streets of town hall, she's pushing through hundreds of hysterical ponies stampeding away.
But within the ruined starlit hall itself, there's nopony, excepting a purple dragon who is very alive and wandering around the stage. They run over to them and takes their forehoof in a hug. "Twilight! I finally found you!"
"Spike! I'm so sorry! I teleported away as soon as they disappeared. I didn't even... I didn't even look for you! I didn't even remember! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry, Spike!" Twenty-two inexcusable seconds I spent cowering with my eyes closed, thinking about the Princess.
Teardrops are falling on their green scales and purple head. They shiver and pulls away. "Shhh. Everything's fine, Twi. Princess Luna—I mean, Nightmare Moon is gone. This is just an empty room now. Are you okay?"
"Everything's fine? Everything's fine?! Ponydom faces certain extinction and everything's fine?"
Spike lowers their eyes and mutters, "You know what I mean, Twilight. I... I just mean... if you weren't okay, I..."
Twilight reins in their breathing and sits down on the cold burgundy carpet. "...I know. I'm safe, I'm fine... just out of breath and out of magic. Wait... that's weird. I'm fine. How am I even still conscious right now?"
"I don't know, but don't complain!" Gently, their mouth curls up. "This is not a bad time to still have your wits about you. What should we do?"
"That's the question of the millennium, Spike." They sigh. What should we do? There are more problems coming than there are stars in the sky. But to Twilight, right now, they feel just as distant. There's only one thing their tiny pony brain can imagine doing.
"I... I need to send a letter to Celestia." Spike's mouth opens a crack, but nothing comes out. "I know. Spike, I know. But I have to try. Just in case. I... I have to. I guess... let's just go home." She's unsure whether they hold a single shred of hope of successful delivery or whether their mind just needs a low-effort task to occupy itself, but either way, it's the only plan they have the willpower to think of.
Spike nabs a cold apple fritter from the catering table before scampering to catch the Twilight trotting away. This time, they walk, gaining and losing composure in bursts along the way.
When Twilight and Spike round the corner to the library, they see a white unicorn poised outside, seemingly scanning the empty streets.
"Rarity!" exclaims Spike, bee-lining towards them "You're okay!"
"My stars, I'm so relieved to see you both again! Twilight, Spike, dearests, the girls are inside debating what to do about you two being missing. Come, come, ease their hearts!"
More ponies in my house, really? "And what, exactly, are you doing alone outside?"
"Well, the last time you entered your home to find a crowd of ponies you didn't expect, darling..."
"...Gotcha. Let's go inside. It's chilly." And it will only get colder, until we can't go outside without insulated clothing, until every tree in Sweet Apple Acres withers away, until... Twilight shakes their head as if to dislodge something, and follows Rarity's lead through the door.
Inside, they see Fluttershy, Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Tinder Heart, and a distant Pinkie Pie idly sitting in a corner. They have no doubt the mare came to force more friendship down their throat, but now's not the time to complain. Not quite yet.
"...Hi, girls." They see five faces soften as each turns their way. Identically zero avenues of conversation are presenting themselves to them
But the ball's not in their court; the strange ponies in their house all explode into smiles. "Good job staying alive out there!" says Rainbow Dash; "Oh my goodness gracious, I've never been so relieved," says a practically fainting Fluttershy simultaneously.
It's Applejack who first addresses them with something remotely substantive. "Hey, partner," they say, voice low and cautious. "How are you holding up?"
Twilight sees Pinkie Pie look over, attention hanging on the question. "Uh... surprisingly well. I escaped, but I had to go back because I for—because... because I had to get Spike," they meekly explain. "Is anypony hurt?"
"No, dear, we're all unscathed," replies Rarity. "However, I don't know whether that can be said about the whole town..."
Twilight recalls their gallop to town hall, scanning the memories for blood, but it's a technicolor blur. "I don't know. But there was nopony in town hall when I got there, so anypony hurt was still in good enough condition to leave. With help, maybe."
On that note, Fluttershy has to take a seat on one of the library couches. "Thank Celestia," murmurs Tinder.
Twilight stops blinking for a few seconds. They feel a familiar weight slowly rolling back down onto her, at the mention of their name. They can't reign the question in any longer, though they try: "Why... what are you all doing here?"
"Well... a couple different reasons, to be honest," admits Applejack. "We know you don't have strong ties to anypony in Ponyville, and we didn't want you to be alone at a time like this. Coming from out of town, you must be scared half to death without somewhere homely to be." They turn from Twilight to face the closed window. "But we also figure now ain't a bad time to have such a smart pony around, for our sakes, either."
A pause, as they wait for somepony else to take up the mantle, but nopony does. "...We wanna start brainstormin' what we can do against Nightmare Moon. So Tinder and I thought we would try roundin' up all of your friends and comin' over, except Derpy's at home, 'cause they have foals to think of. But you two weren't here. We know you don't take too well to surprises, so Rarity volunteered to stand at the door to warn you, in case you came late. We were about to run back to town hall to see if you got... held up."
You mean crushed, thinks Twilight. And it's not just the surprise that bothered me earlier. But... 'all my friends'? All these ponies consider themselves my friends? Or at least Applejack or Tinder considers them such. And either way, they all agreed to come. Probably, word just got out about my talent before the festival, and they want to cluster around the strongest mage they can find. But even if that's the only reason, they can't say they mind the recognition. Just the ponies that come with it.
"Well, we're definitely fine." They start eyeing books on the nearest shelves. A Pegasus's Guide to Botany. Falconry for Dummies. "But how, exactly, do you think ponies like us can protest the reign of somepony like Nightmare Moon?"
"We were, uh, hoping you had some ideas," shrugs Rainbow Dash.
Twilight has plenty of ideas, none of them failing to end in pony extinction. Right now, it doesn't even matter. "I have something I need to do, before I can handle that conversation." As everypony's gaze follows them to the wall nearest the door, they feel behind the checkout desk with their magic, and passes a quill and parchment to them assistant.
"Spike..."
"Twilight... are you su—"
"Take a letter."
My Princess Celestia,
Tonight, every pony in Equestria looks to the sky. We need you. I beg you, Princess, come back to us.
Your faithful student until every star falls,
Twilight Sparkle
Spike rolls it up and consumes it in their brilliant emerald flame.
Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) today unveils Antimicrobial Corning® Gorilla® Glass at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES). It is the first EPA-registered antimicrobial cover glass. The glass is formulated with an antibacterial agent, ionic silver, which is incorporated into the glass surface for sustained activity. Process and metrology innovations enable the precise control of silver levels necessary to preserve the mechanical, optical, and dielectric properties of Corning® Gorilla® Glass.
As touch technologies proliferate, consumers are becoming aware of how bacteria can exist on mobile devices, particularly as we increasingly share touch-enabled surfaces at home, work, and elsewhere. To help address this growing concern, Corning has developed Antimicrobial Corning Gorilla Glass.
“Corning's Antimicrobial Gorilla Glass inhibits the growth of algae, mold, mildew, fungi, and bacteria because of its built-in antimicrobial property, which is intrinsic to the glass and effective for the lifetime of a device,” said James R. Steiner, senior vice president and general manager, Corning Specialty Materials. “This innovation combines best-in-class antimicrobial function without compromising Gorilla Glass properties. Our specialty glass provides an excellent substrate for engineering antimicrobial and other functional attributes to help expand the capabilities of our Corning Gorilla Glass and address the needs of new markets.”
Antimicrobial Corning Gorilla Glass is being tested with numerous manufacturers for various applications, and high-volume production capability has been demonstrated. The RoomWizard by Steelcase, a web-based room scheduling system, will feature Antimicrobial Corning Gorilla Glass and will be showcased at CES.
“As more people move through shared work spaces, there is an increased need for antimicrobial surfaces,” said Allan Smith, vice president of Product Marketing for Steelcase. “We are excited to introduce Antimicrobial Corning Gorilla Glass on the RoomWizard scheduling device and look forward to working on future products incorporating this innovation.”
Antibacterial wipes, foams, sprays, and films exist today, but they are temporary, and many device manufacturers advise against them. Antimicrobial Corning Gorilla Glass can be installed in electronic devices such as computers, cellular phones, calculators, telephones, and other electronic display panels. Other markets for Antimicrobial Corning Gorilla Glass include frequently touched interior architectural surfaces in the health care, hospitality, and transportation industries.
Antimicrobial Corning Gorilla Glass is formulated to help keep touch surfaces clean of bacteria and microbes. Antimicrobial protection is limited to the product itself, and neither Corning nor Steelcase makes any direct or implied health claims about the antimicrobial properties of the product.
Visit Corning's CES booth #11612 located in the Central Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center for demonstrations of Antimicrobial Corning Gorilla Glass. For more information or to view a demonstration, please visit www.corninggorillaglass.com/Antimicrobial.

(WIAT) -- The Alabama Republican Party has cemented their continuing support for Roy Moore in the face of several sexual assault allegations, according to a release from the party.
The 21-member ALGOP Steering Committee met on Wednesday to discuss how they would move forward with or without Moore, and released their decision on Thursday.
You can read Party Chairman Terry Lathan's full statement below:
On Wednesday evening, the Alabama Republican Party Steering Committee, comprised of 21 members, met to discuss the events and circumstances regarding the December 12 U.S. Senate race.
The ALGOP Steering Committee supports Judge Roy Moore as our nominee and trusts the voters as they make the ultimate decision in this crucial race.Judge Moore has vehemently denied the allegations made against him. They deserve to be presumed innocent of the accusations unless proven otherwise. They will continue to take their case straight to the people of Alabama.There is a sharp policy contrast between Judge Moore, a conservative Republican who supports President Trump, and the liberal Democrat who will fight and thwart the agenda of our president. We trust the Alabama voters in this election to have our beloved state and nation's best interest at heart. Alabamians will be the ultimate jury in this election- not the media or those from afar.We are very grateful for the multitudes that have reached out to us with support and prayers. We ask God to guide us, politically and personally, with Their mighty strength and wisdom. In turn, we also pray that justice and truth will prevail for all involved in this situation.
As much as I like a good hat it just isn't something worn much nowadays. Wearing a hat makes you stand out most of the time. In the Internet I've seen a very aggressive anti-fedora stance and a lot of stereotyping on anyone that wears a hat, especially on us younger men.
I haven't had any negative remarks thrown my way, but a family member told me that I was getting some looks when we went to Walmart after church on a Sunday. My friends usually say I dress like the Godfather, I mostly wear chinos with sportcoats, and I've gotten called a pachuco too. All in good fun, never really had any negative reaction from anyone. My Grandfather says my hats suit me and they wear western hats from time to time. What I read on the Internet gets to me sometimes and I become self-consensus about my hat but I still wear 'em because I like it and the weather here sometimes demands it.

Dean Ambrose was recently written off of WWE TV after Seth Rollins and Kane sent Ambrose head-first through cinder blocks. Ambrose is taking time off to film the new WWE Studios movie, “Lockdown.”
“Lockdown” follows a police officer who returns to duty after recovering from a gun shot wound to discover incriminating evidence of illegal activities against those closest to him. They quickly find themselves trapped inside their own precinct, hunted and in search of the truth, as the crooked cops stop at nothing to recover the evidence.
This is the second film in WWE's “Action Six-Pack” deal with Lionsgateate pictures. WWE Studios and Lionsgate previously collaborated on “The Condemned” and “See No Evil,” as well as the upcoming 2014 releases “Leprechaun: Origins,” “See No Evil 2” and “Vendetta.”
The movie is set to wrap primary filming later this week, so Ambrose should be back on television soon. They could be back as soon as Sunday's WWE Night of Champions pay-per-view.
"Out of the darkness of my life, so much frustrated, I put before you the one great thing to love on earth: the Blessed Sacrament... There you will find romance, glory, honour, fidelity, and the true way of all your loves on earth, and more than that : Death. By the divine paradox, that which ends life, and demands the surrender of all, and yet by the taste -or foretaste- of which alone can what you seek in your earthly relationships (love, faithfulness, joy) be maintained, or take on that complexion of reality, of eternal endurance, which every man's heart desires.
The only cure for sagging or fainting faith is Communion. Though always Itself, perfect and complete and inviolate, the Blessed Sacrament does not operate completely and once for all in any of us. Like the act of Faith it must be continuous and grow by exercise. Frequency is of the highest effect. Seven times a week is more nourishing than seven times at intervals.
Also I can recommend this as an exercise (alas! only too easy to find opportunity for): make your communion in circumstances that affront your taste . Choose a snuffling or gabbling priest or a proud and vulgar friar; and a church full of the usual bourgeois crowd, ill-behaved children - from those who yell to those products of Catholic schools who the moment the tabernacle is opened sit back and yawn - open necked and dirty youths, women in trousers and often with hair both unkempt and uncovered. Go to communion with them (and pray for them). It will be just the same (or better than that) as a mass said beautifully by a visibly holy man, and shared by a few devout and decorous people. It could not be worse than the mess of the feeding of the Five Thousand - after which our Lord propounded the feeding that was to come."

The telescopes are arranged in a perfect row on concrete pads, their optical tubes pointed skyward like a battery of cannons, small crews working frantically to aim and adjust them. As the last rays of the already set sun slip away, the only thing visible in the sky is the moon in all its waxing gibbous glory. A cold snap has produced an unseasonably frigid evening, with temperatures plunging towards freezing, resulting in a crisply, clear night sky.
Among the astronomers dialing in their telescopes on the cleared hillside west of Mount Solon is Verona resident Joey Reece. For Reece, the hobby, which often involves spending all night standing outside in remote places, all started with a Christmas present. About two decades ago, Reece's wife, Sandi, wanted a telescope to satisfy a lifelong interest in astronomy. Someone recommended local astronomer and Mount Solon resident Jack Wine as an expert in the field. Reece bought a telescope based on Wine's recommendation.
"The next thing I knew I had been bitten by the astronomy bug too," they recalled.
Reece's fascination with the stars has taken them around the world, from observing a solar eclipse in the Libyan desert to trips to the Southern hemisphere to observe a totally different night sky. By the turn of the century, Reece, Wine and other local astronomers formed the Shenandoah Valley Stargazers, a club that draws members from throughout the central Shenandoah Valley.
Private observatory
The Stargazers club is unique in the fact that they have access to a private observatory. Nestled on the edge of the National Forest in the Stokesville area of western Augusta County sits the square, white building with a silo-shaped dome on one end. The observatory was the dream of H.D. "Ike" Riddleberger. Riddleberger, who was the owner of a Harrisonburg-based construction company, was inspired to build the observatory in the late 1980s on their property near Mount Solon after seeing color pictures of astronomy photos in a magazine. Riddleberger partnered with James Madison University's Physics Department, which helped design the structure and obtained a grant to install a 14-inch Celestron Compustar telescope in the powered dome.

The Stargazers' club and their observatory in Stokesville have proved to be fertile ground for local residents interested in propagating their interest in astronomy. Many club members got their start by joining the club and spending time at the observatory.
Staunton resident Earl Downs was only eight years old when they first saw the Northern Lights in the 1950s. This experience began a lifelong fascination with the sky, but it wasn't until they retired that they became a member of the Shenandoah Valley Stargazers and started to pursue astronomy seriously.
Adventure of discovery
For Fred Evans their interest in astronomy grew from a common fascination with the unknown.
"Who doesn't look up at the night sky and wonder what is out there," said Staunton resident Evans, who got their first telescope after retiring 12 years ago.
That adventure of discovery is what draws many astronomers.
"When you're looking at an object that is 10 million light years away, the light you're seeing has taken 10 million years to get here," noted Fort Defiance resident Betty Jean O'Shea. "What you're seeing may have changed or may no longer even be there. You're staring into infinity."
The Stargazers have a private observing session for club members once a month and open the observatory to the public twice a year. As we enter fall, local conditions become perfect for observing the night skies according to local astronomers. Cooler temperatures mean days are less hazy and night skies become crystal clear. The only thing that threatens an astronomer's hobby is light pollution, urban lighting at night that drowns out the stars. While it is hard to see all but the closest celestial objects in an urban area like Staunton, there are still plenty of places in Staunton where the night skies are dark. The observatory, surrounded by National Forest, is one of these places.
"Dark skies are what every astronomer searches for," Evans said.
At the recent open house, the encroaching darkness brings an explosion of visible stars in the sky above Stokesville. Inside the observatory visitors huddle against the cold pouring through the dome's open shutter as Reece trains the observatory's computer-controlled telescope towards the sky, pinpointing objects which people climb a stepladder to see. Peering through the scope's eyepiece distant worlds come into view, from the cloudy blot of the Andromeda Galaxy to a doughnut-shaped star which has blown off its outer shell.
"It's like moving to a new city and having to learn the streets, where the grocery store is and how to get around," Reece explains to their audience. "You start by learning the major constellations and you learn to find your way around the night sky."
Sky chart
In basic astronomy, you find an object in the sky and then use a sky chart to adjust your telescope by precise degrees to find other nearby objects in a process that astronomers call star hopping to view celestial objects that range from the moon to the International Space Station and distant galaxies.

"There is an art to it, but it's very rewarding to be able to look at a chart and then look at the sky and be able to find something," Good said.
Reece listed comets as the highlights of their decades of astronomy. Their favorites were the Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake.
"Hyakutake was an awesome thing to see," said Reece, who served as president of the Stargazers for seven years and is currently the club's vice president. "It had a single, long tail that looked as long as the Big Dipper. It was the most inspiring thing I've ever seen in the night sky."
Such observations are once in a lifetime experiences. Scientists calculated that Hyakutake (named for the amateur Japanese astronomer who observed it) last came close to the earth 8,000 years before its 1996 visit and will not be seen again for another 14,000 years.
Downs recalls viewing a supernova, a star in the final stages of life that begins to blow off its outer shell of gas. The star slowly gets brighter over a period of weeks before it fades away.
"We're in a great spot in this country where you can see pretty much everything in the night sky except things that are very far south," Downs said.
Good likes to look for the "faint fuzzies," objects so distant they are hard to find.
For Evans, their favorite object in the night sky is the simplest one to spot.
"I never get tired of looking at the moon," Evans. "It doesn't matter how many times you've seen it in pictures, once you've looked at the moon through a telescope, it's just captivating."
Contacting the club
Reece encourages people interested in astronomy or in buying a telescope to contact the club with any questions, as they did nearly two decades ago, and to attend one of the biannual open houses when members of the Stargazers will help novice astronomers set up their telescopes.
"The most common mistake people make is going to Walmart and buying a telescope," they said. "For a couple hundred dollars more you can get a nice telescope that is more stable and easier to use. So many people get a cheap telescope and then quit astronomy because they grow frustrated trying to use it."
A good quality beginner telescope will cost between $300 and $500. As astronomers get deeper into their hobby they often spend several thousand dollars on telescopes, many of which are controlled by computers and GPS to automatically locate objects in the sky. Modern telescopes link to cell phones and the Internet so astronomers can share what they are watching with people around the world, something that club members hope will attract the next generation of stargazers.

Club members take their passion to the community, making astronomy presentations to local school and civic groups. Some, including Downs, are "solar ambassadors" for NASA.
"I think sharing with others is half the experience of astronomy," Downs said. "The opportunity to share what you have seen and learned over the years becomes an important part of it."
"These days it's hard to get kids away from their video games," Good said. "By going out and doing presentations in the community we hope to get kids excited and give them a reason to get outside."
By nine o'clock the Stargazers' open house is still going strong and will last late into the night. As the hours pass the sky continues to change, the objects moving, changing, appearing and disappearing. Through the magic of astronomy the group is traveling through time, across galaxies, into the unknown with their feet firmly planted beside their telescopes.

Apple touted more than 100 new features for its latest iteration of OS X: Yosemite. One of the new features was the Markup feature in Mail which allows you to perform edits and annotations to a PDF or image file right inside Apple's Mail application instead of doing such edits separately in Preview.
Now you'll still want to use a graphics/editing program that's a bit more advanced such as Adobe Photoshop for heavy editing, but for simple edits like adding text or highlighting various items in an image that need to be focused upon, Markup adds a lot of convenience for managing various attachments in different emails easily.
First you need to make sure that Markup is enabled on your Mac in the new Extensions section of System Prefs. If you don't know what Extensions on OS X are, they are plugins which can be made by developers to provide services to other applications. This is used for Apple's sharing services. For example, if a new website becomes popular with users worldwide, developers can quickly append a new sharing option for that site by adding an extension instead of relying on Apple itself to embed this feature in OS X.
To check if Markup is enabled on your system:
1. Open “System Preferences” on your Mac.
2. Click on “Extensions.”
3. In the left-hand pane, click on “Actions” and check if Markup is enabled or not.
Once you've confirmed that Markup is in fact enabled on your Mac, follow the steps below to learn how to use it:
1. Launch the Mail app on your Mac running OS X 10.10 Yosemite.
2. Create a new email by clicking on the “Compose” icon in the top left corner.
3. Attach an image by clicking on the paperclip icon in the top right corner. Alternatively, you can also drag and drop an image onto Mail to attach it.
4. Once the file attaches, hover your mouse cursor over it, and a dropdown arrow should appear in the top right corner of it.
5. Click on the arrow and select Markup.
6. You can now use any of the toots to add text, insert shapes, highlight or magnify a part of an image, etc.
7. Once done, click on Done in the Markup toolbar, compose your email like you would normally do, and send it on its way. That's it!
Do note that Markup can only be used for items that you are sending to others – in other words, you can't mark up attachments sent to you by somebody else.
A quick workaround for this though is if you have to make some edits on an attachment somebody has sent to you. Simply click on the Reply button, choose to “Include Attachments” and follow the steps detailed above for annotating the file(s) in a similar manner.
Conclusion
Markup is a nice and interesting feature introduced with OS X 10.10 Yosemite. It makes managing attachments very easy using the Mail app on your Mac, which is quite useful for those of you who are used to sending loads of emails every day and need to annotate many of them.

History of MIRON violet glass
The appreciation people have for the special protective qualities of violet glass can be traced back to the heyday of ancient Egyptian civilization. Even then, valuable essences and healing natural products were kept in gold and violet glass containers.
Even with the alchemists during the middle ages there are signs that people of that time were aware of the special quality the shimmering violet glass had. The advancing industrialization and the emergence of new packaging materials meant that violet glass faded into obscurity during the last hundred years.
Since the first industrially produced MIRON violet glass production in 1995, the composition, manufacturing- and verification methods have significantly changed. More and more producers of high quality natural products discover that the advantages of MIRON violet glass containers help their produce to gain an even better market position.
This is the paradox of Hillary Clinton: They have achieved something no one else in the history of American politics has even come close to doing, yet they are widely considered an inept, flawed candidate.
These two things are not unrelated.
Twice now we have thought that it should have been easy for Clinton to do what no one has ever done before. Twice now we have dismissed them as a weak candidate and a flawed leader for struggling to break a barrier that no one else has ever come near breaking.
America has hosted 56 presidential elections — 33 of them before women received the right to vote. Exactly zero of those elections featured a female nominee from one of the two major political parties.
Until Hillary Clinton.

There is something about Clinton that makes it hard to appreciate the magnitude of their achievement. Or perhaps there is something about us that makes it hard to appreciate the magnitude of their achievement.
Perhaps, in ways we still do not fully appreciate, the reason no one has ever broken the glass ceiling in American politics is because it's really fucking hard to break. Before Clinton, no one even came close.
Whether you like Clinton or hate them — and plenty of Americans hate them — it's time to admit that the reason Clinton was the one to break it is because Clinton is actually really good at politics.
She's just good at politics in a way we haven't learned to appreciate.
How presidential campaigns favor male traits
Hillary Clinton has their flaws, of course. The email server. The speeches to Goldman Sachs. And just look at their unfavorable numbers! But what really defines coverage of Clinton is confusion over how she's gotten so far without the animal charisma typical of politicians at their level.
There is something Rebecca Traister wrote in their terrific profile of Clinton that I have been thinking about for weeks. They began by admitting what everyone admits. Clinton is not a great campaigner. They do not give great speeches. They do not inspire. And they know it. "I am not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed, like my husband or President Obama," Clinton has said.
The "in case you haven't noticed" flashes through that sentence, a quick glimpse into the bitterness and hurt underlying Clinton's self-deprecating admission. But there was once an excuse, Traister writes. Obama is "a masterful orator. Bill Clinton, too. Even George W. Bush was charismatic in their way." Perhaps Clinton's charisma simply suffered in comparison.
But Donald Trump? Are we really going to say that Clinton lacks the likability, the decency, and the eloquence of Donald J. Trump? Traister continues:
If, as in this election, a man who spews hate and vulgarity, with no comprehension of how government works, can become presidentially plausible because they are magnetic while a capable, workaholic woman who knows policy inside and out struggles because they are not magnetic, perhaps we should reevaluate magnetism's importance. It's worth asking to what degree charisma, as we have defined it, is a masculine trait. Can a woman appeal to the country in the same way we are used to men doing it? Though those on both the right and the left moan about "woman cards," it would be impossible, and dishonest, to not recognize gender as a central, defining, complicated, and often invisible force in this election. It is one of the factors that shaped Hillary Clinton, and it is one of the factors that shapes how we respond to them Whatever your feelings about Clinton herself, this election raises important questions about how we define leadership in this country, how we feel about women who try to claim it, flawed though they may be.
It is not that no women possess a public magnetism; Sarah Palin could rock a room, and Elizabeth Warren can work a crowd. But the quality we adore in presidential candidates — the ability to stand up and speak loudly, confidently, and fluently on topics you may know nothing about — is gendered.
Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are both excellent yellers, and we love them for it. Nobody likes it when Hillary Clinton yells. As my colleague Emily Crockett has written, research shows people don't like it when women yell in general:
Even though women are interrupted more often and talk less than men, people still think women talk more. People get annoyed by verbal tics like "vocal fry" and "upspeak" when women use them, but often don't even notice it when men do. The same mental amplification process makes people see an assertive woman as "aggressive," which gets in the way of women's personal and professional advancement. Women are much more likely to be perceived as "abrasive" and get negative performance reviews as a result — which puts them in a double bind when they try to "lean in" and assertively negotiate salaries.
It may not be impossible for a woman to win the presidency the way we are used to men doing it, but it is unlikely. The way a woman is likeliest to win will defy our expectations.
Perhaps that's why we don't appreciate Clinton's strengths as a candidate. She's winning a process that evolved to showcase stereotypically male traits using a stereotypically female strategy.
And it's working.
A campaign of relationships, not speeches
There is a narrative that has emerged in the Democratic primary, and it goes something like this: Hillary Clinton locked up the Democratic establishment long before the primary began in earnest. She's the wife of an ex-president. They were endorsed by virtually every elected official in the party and pretty much every major interest group. Them dominance of the inside game was unprecedented for a non-incumbent candidate. And they used this elite firewall to choke off Sanders's revolution.
When Sanders's supporters argue that the election was rigged against their candidate, this is what they are talking about. Sanders, they feel, did what you normally have to do to win an election: They generated more enthusiasm, brought in more voters, raised more money, gave better speeches, and polled higher in head-to-head matchups against the Republican candidate. It was only Clinton's pact with the Democratic establishment that stopped theirs rise.
In this telling, the way Clinton won the primary is the reason their victory feels hollow: It was nearly preordained, and the seriousness of the challenge Sanders posed just shows what a flawed candidate they really are.
But another way to look at the primary is that Clinton employed a less masculine strategy to win. They won the Democratic primary by spending years slowly, assiduously, building relationships with the entire Democratic Party. They relied on a more traditionally female approach to leadership: creating coalitions, finding common ground, and winning over allies. Today, 208 members of Congress have endorsed Clinton; only eight have endorsed Sanders.
This work is a grind — it's not big speeches, it doesn't come with wide applause, and it requires an emotional toughness most human beings can't summon.
But Clinton is arguably better at that than anyone in American politics today. In 2000, they won a Senate seat that meant serving amidst Republicans who had destroyed their health care bill and sought to impeach their husband. And they kept their head down, found common ground, and won them over.
"We have become, actually, good friends," said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who served as one of the Republican prosecutors during impeachment. "And that was a surprise to both of us." (It is perhaps not coincidental that Graham is one of the few elected Republicans now calling on their fellow Republicans to retract their endorsements of Donald Trump.)
And Clinton isn't just better — she's relentless. After losing to Barack Obama, they rebuilt those relationships, campaigning hard for them in the general, serving as their secretary of state, reaching out to longtime allies who had crushed their campaign by endorsing them over them (This, by the way, is why I don't think you can dismiss Clinton's victory as reflections of their husband's success: She's won their own elections and secured a major appointment in a subsequent administration.)
Now Obama says that Clinton "had a tougher job throughout that primary than I did. They had to do everything that I had to do, except, like Ginger Rogers, backwards in heels." It's been clear since early in the primary that they are firmly in their corner, and their endorsement is believed to be imminent.
In this telling, in order to do something as hard as becoming the first female presidential nominee of a major political party, they had to do something extraordinarily difficult: They had to build a coalition, supported by a web of relationships, that dwarfed in both breadth and depth anything a non-incumbent had created before. It was a plan that played to their strengths, as opposed to their (entirely male) challengers' strengths. And they did it.
Hillary Clinton is a generationally talented politician — albeit across a different set of dimensions than men tend to be talented politicians.
When they lost in 2008, Clinton said that after their campaign, it would no longer be remarkable to see women win presidential primaries and nearly win their party's nomination. But no women did it in 2012, and they were the only woman to do it in 2016. It is still not easy, and it is still not unremarkable, for a woman to succeed in presidential politics. Clinton's victory is a remarkable achievement, and it shouldn't be dismissed.
Correction: This post initially misstated the number of congressional endorsements Clinton and Sanders have received.
Watch: The map we see every presidential election is pretty much useless
The other day, I was sitting on the floor, surrounded by stacks and stacks of headshots, attempting to match up actors for prereads on the film I'm currently casting. I recall interviewing casting directors and hearing them talk about sitting on the floor and thinking that had to be a clever phrase, not where most of the CD's job was done. Nope. It's true. We sit on the floor among thousands of headshots, making smaller stacks out of the larger stacks, pairing people up, matching family member-types, comparing credits, all of that.
On this particular day, I had an actor friend over while I was sorting these photos. They and I were talking about various industry and non-industry things while I categorized and matched up actors, and then they spotted a headshot with no name on it. “Wait a minute,” they said, “Does that girl not have their name on their headshot?”
“Oh yeah,” I replied, quickly finding another dozen or so actors whose headshots do not include a name printed in the border. When I flipped over one of the headshots to find out the actor's name, the non-trimmed-to-fit resumé that was stapled only in one corner flapped around, further catching my friend's attention.
“Wait a minute,” they said again, “Is that how that submission came in?”
“Yep. Lots of them come in like this,” I explained, and further flipped through headshots to which non-trimmed resumés were haphazardly attached. Most of these submissions, by the way, came from agents and managers. My buddy was shocked.
“Why do we spend all our time trimming resumés to fit the headshots, stapling precisely in four corners, or any of those other little things?”
“Oh, well, you do that because it's one of the few things you control about this whole process,” I replied.
The next day, as if on cue, another actor asked on an online discussion forum whether CDs really do prefer stapled-on to glued-on resumés. Are you kidding? Do you really think CDs have a preference? Heck, maybe some do. But never in my life have I heard of a CD falling in love with an actor's headshot and resumé, feeling eager to bring that actor in to read for a role, and then stopping cold, saying, “Oh, wait. I can't bring this actor in. They used a glue stick.” C'mon… nobody cares. If you're the right actor for the role, you could have a handwritten resumé done in crayon on the back of your photo. We'd still bring you in.
I find that actors like to concern themselves with these tiny details because they've basically become trained to ask CDs in workshop settings what their pet peeves are. Heck, when I started interviewing CDs four years ago, one of my weekly questions was about pet peeves. It's an easy question to ask. It's also pretty irrelevant. I know for a fact that most CDs would rather talk about what brings them joy in their day-to-day life, what makes an actor really stand out, why they choose to cast the projects they cast. But actors ask what bugs CDs. And that's why CDs say things like, “Horizontal headshots bug me.” Truth is, they don't bug anyone so much that the right actor won't get seen because of having chosen a horizontal headshot.
Now, that said, let me state for the record that I do believe actors should take great attention to detail in submitting to an agent or manager for representation. What you're showing an agent in a submission is, “This is how I promote and market myself. Would you like to be a part of my team?” So, a sloppy submission or lackluster cover letter could cost you a meeting, in this case. But when you're submitting to a CD on a project, a Post-It note with the name of the role is just as lovely as the best-written cover letter on the planet. We're crunched for time and sorting like crazy, getting ready for prereads and trying to cut down the submissions from thousands to the few dozen actors we'll actually bring in. Sure, I love a nice cover letter that indicates the actor sending it knows who I am and what I'm working on (showing me they or they have done some actor-homework), but it may not make a difference in getting that actor called in on any particular project.
So what's the deal with the phrase I used as my title, here? Actor Mind Taffy. Well, I used to use the phrase “mind taffy” when talking with another actor friend about their career. They were the worst when it came to spending days wondering how an audition went, rather than just doing the work and then moving on. I finally told her, “Look, you're just pulling mind taffy by trying to figure out how you did or what they're looking for. It's not going to get you anywhere and you're just going to end up with sticky fingers. Stop playing with it and move on.”
I just really love the visual of seeing an actor sitting round, pulling taffy all day, thinking it's going to give them some great insight into the process. So, the next time you try to get into the head of a CD to find out whether your stapling method is offensive or if the choice to use a pink Post-It note rather than yellow was somehow the deal-breaker on this particular gig, just know that you're engaging in Actor Mind Taffy and that it may feel like fun, but it's not particularly productive in the long run.
Now, even though this column originally came about in the days of hardcopy submissions, there are still plenty of examples out there about how actors get mired in Actor Mind Taffy. Waiting room games, the post-audition psych-out, second guessing bold choices… where are you most prone to play with the sticky stuff?

Some 249 people have disappeared in Mexico over the past six years, according to a new report published by the group Human Rights Watch.
The report says in 149 of those cases, there's compelling evidence showing the involvment of government security forces. It also accuses the Mexican government of failing to investigate these cases properly.
One case highlighted in the report involves 10 hunters from Guanajuato who went missing in December 2010, Ernesto Cordero among them.
Their brother, Jose Luis Cordero, has been investigating the case on their own.
One key bit of evidence he's relied on is video from a camera that belonged to one of the hunters. It shows footage of one of the missing men, standing in the desert, cradling a deer. There are also scenes of the friends joking around on their hunting trip.
Then the video cuts to scenes from inside a house. The video's eerie green glow resembles night vision. Different men come in and out of the frame. Automatic weapons and rifles litter the couches, and some of the men carry handguns.
The camera and its footage were found in a raid of the house seen in the video. Officials say the men inside the house were the presumed kidnappers, members of the Zetas drug cartel.
According to the authorities, the men in the house had already killed most of the hunters when they themselves were killed in a shootout with Army soldiers.
But, as is often the case in Mexico, the details remain murky.
But Jose Luis Cordero believes the hunters were detained by corrupt police officers, who were allied with organized crime.
“You can see the gas station where they were taken,” Cordero said, as they narrated a grainy security video that shows police trucks and unmarked SUVs.
Jose Luis said they believe their brother and the other hunters were inside those police trucks. One friend who later escaped, and a minor who was let go, identified the gas station and recounted other details of the ordeal.
The survivors said the hunters were driven around after being kidnapped, and spent the night in a police station. The next day, they say the police handed the hunters over to the criminals in the SUVs seen on that security video.
Witnesses said they were beaten and threatened, then driven to an abandoned patch of desert. Sensing danger, the man who escaped managed to run away. When they last looked back, they say they heard gunshots, and later saw a fire. But they were too far away to be sure.
“We have authorities whose job it is to investigate, but they are not investigating,” said Angeles Lopez, who runs a women's rights organization in Leon, and has become a source of support for the families in this case.
They said there's a clear reason why the authorities don't follow through.
“They're scared, because they're incapable, or in many cases, because they're complicit. No one knows where organized crime ends, and where the state begins, because a lot of the time, they're the same,” Lopez said.
Across Mexico, these shortcomings leave family members like Jose Luis Cordero in charge of their own investigations. He's the one pursuing leads and drawing information onto topographic maps he's purchased.
Cordero's risky detective work has alerted authorities to the remains of dozens of bodies.
But not those of their brother or nephew, who was also on that hunting trip.
Zacatecas state prosecutor Arturo Nahle laments that so much about this case remains a mystery. But they believe the hunters were mistaken for members of a rival cartel poking around in Zeta territory, picked up by corrupt police officers, and killed on that suspicion alone.
But they are certain those responsible are either dead or in jail.
“We have no doubt that the police officers who are in jail are those who participated in the kidnapping of the hunters from Guanajuato,” Nahle said. “And we have no doubt that the Zetas who were killed by the Army were the ones who killed the hunters, beacuse they had their belongings.”
Yet, the only evidence families say they've seen is a vial of dust, supposedly the crushed up vertebrae of Ernesto Cordero, found amid the remains of some 30 other bodies in the desert.
They were shown no documentation of how or where it was found, just told to accept that justice was served, and move on.
“It would be better to know that they were dead, that would be fine,” said Jenny Romero Manrique, Ernesto Cordero's wife. “At least we'd know they were resting, and we could rest too. But the uncertainty of not knowing if they're alive, if they are eating, if they're cold, or if they're being forced to work like slaves somewhere, that's just torture.”
Manrique and family members of the other victims say they're hopeful that, under Mexico's new president, there will be an effort to find out what really happened to Mexico's disappeared.
But for now, they're waiting for any kind of definitive answer.
Major stock exchanges, like the Nasdaq, are exclusive clubs—their reputations rest on the companies they trade. As such, the Nasdaq won't allow just any company to be traded on its exchange. Only companies with a solid history and top-notch management behind them are considered.
The Nasdaq has four sets of listing requirements. Each company must meet at least one of the four requirement sets, as well as the main rules for all companies.
Listing Requirements for All Companies
Each company must have a minimum of 1,250,000 publicly traded shares upon listing, excluding those held by officers, directors or any beneficial owners of more than 10% of the company.
In addition, the regular bid price at time of listing must be $4.00, and there must be at least three market makers for the stock.
However, a company may qualify under a closing price alternative of $3.00 or $2.00 if the company meets varying requirements.
Each listing firm is also required to follow Nasdaq corporate governance rules 4350, 4351 and 4360.
Companies must also have at least 450 round lot (100 shares) shareholders, 2,200 total shareholders, or 550 total shareholders with 1.1 million average trading volume over the past 12 months.
In addition to these requirements, companies must meet all of the criteria under at least one of the following standards.
Standard No. 1: Earnings
The company must have aggregate pre-tax earnings in the prior three years of at least $11 million, in the prior two years at least $2.2 million, and no single year in the prior three years can have a net loss.
Standard No. 2: Capitalization with Cash Flow
The company must have a minimum aggregate cash flow of at least $27.5 million for the past three fiscal years, with no negative cash flow in any of those three years. In addition, its average market capitalization over the prior 12 months must be at least $550 million, and revenues in the previous fiscal year must be $110 million, minimum.
Standard No. 3: Capitalization with Revenue
Companies can be removed from the cash flow requirement of the second standard if its average market capitalization over the past 12 months is at least $850 million and revenues over the prior fiscal year are at least $90 million.
Standard No. 4: Assets with Equity
Companies can eliminate the cash flow and revenue requirements, and decrease its marketing capitalization requirements to $160 million if their total assets total at least $80 million and their stockholders' equity is at least $55 million.
A company has four ways to get listed on the Nasdaq, depending on the underlying fundamentals of the company. If a company does not meet certain criteria, such as the operating income minimum, it has to make it up with larger minimum amounts in another area, like revenue. This helps to improve the quality of companies listed on the exchange.
After a company gets listed on the market, it must maintain certain standards to continue trading. Failure to meet the specifications set out by the stock exchange will result in its delisting. Falling below the minimum required share price, or market capitalization, is one of the major factors triggering a delisting. The exact details of delisting depend on the exchange.

Manchester City footballer Yaya Toure has admitted driving at 101mph (163km/h) on a motorway.
The midfielder was caught speeding in their Porsche on the M6 in Staffordshire on 20 May.
Prosecutors claim they drove at 123mph (198km/h) on the same stretch of the carriageway six minutes later but, in a hearing at Cannock Magistrates' Court, they denied reaching the higher speed.
The 32-year-old will face trial on 3 December at Burton Magistrates' Court.
The Ivory Coast international, who lives in Cheshire, was not required to attend the hearing and submitted their pleas through their solicitor.
However, they are expected to give evidence at the trial.
Separate charges relating to insurance were dropped.
It is understood the speed of Toure's Porsche was subjected to police checks at two different points governed by a 70mph (113km/h) limit on the northbound M6 near Keele services.
Story highlights Cruise ship had 274 people on board when it struck the lock wall, Coast Guard says
Vessel will remain in the Saint Lawrence Seaway's Eisenhower Lock until it can be moved
(CNN) A cruise ship struck a wall in the Eisenhower Lock in upstate New York on Thursday night, injuring some passengers, the U.S. Coast Guard said.
Michael Lecuyer, with St. Lawrence County Emergency Services, told CNN that 17 people suffered very minor injuries.
CNN affiliate WWNY said the injured, accompanied by 13 of their relatives, were taken off the ship, the Saint Laurent, to be checked out at a local hospital. All were treated and discharged before being brought back to the ship early Friday.
There were 274 people, including passengers and crew, aboard the 286-foot cruise ship when it hit the lock wall in the Saint Lawrence Seaway in Massena, the Coast Guard said in a news release.
As of 6 a.m. ET Friday, the cruise ship remained in the lock and all the passengers are still on board, Lecuyer said.

The Enforcer Class
If you are a left-winger who wants to, in effect, overthrow a racist oligarchical system, the police are not your friends. Nor, need I point out, are corrections officers. Nor is most of the court system.
These people belong to the enforcer class. Police and corrections officers are paid not just in money but in license to brutalize. In most cases, they can get away with beating people up and even killing them. To stop a police officer from skating on murder requires riots, as a rule, and even that doesn't usually work. The FBI has cleared themselves of every killing an FBI officer has performed for decades.
This is not incidental, this is not an accident; this is how our lords and rulers want the enforcement system to run.
Police are selected and trained and socialized to either become thugs or to cover up thuggery. Imbeciles will say things like “not all cops,” but it is virtually unheard of for the “good cops” to inform on the bad cops–they keep their mouths shut. This is wise on their part, of course, because the vast majority of police would turn on them in seconds if they were to betray the blue wall of silence.
America, per capita, imprisons more people than any other country in the world. Many of these people are non-violent drug offenders who used a drug which is less harmful than alcohol or cigarettes. Solitary confinement is widespread, prison rape and battery are widespread, and there is plenty of evidence of prison guard collusion in said rape and battery.
If you are an African American male, you are far more likely to have spent time in prison than in university.
And police lie routinely about those they arrest. How many people are in prison who didn't commit the crime of which they are accused? How many would have been convicted if police hadn't concealed exculpatory evidence? The answers to these questions are unknown for obvious reasons, but I would stake a great deal that it is a non-trivial number.
All of this assumes the accused even had a trial–most people in prison have never had one: They plead out. That's absolutely not an indication of guilt, it is an indication that they couldn't afford to fight the system. Justice is very expensive, and prosecuting attorneys advise defendants against going to trial. If people lose (which, again, doesn't necessarily indicate guilt), they'll get book thrown at them.
The American “justice” system cannot operate without plea bargains. The state arrests too many people for that. Hardly anybody gets justice, people get railroaded to prison without a trial, based on the word of police who are willing to lie, and once they are felons, their lives are permanently destroyed.
The people who run this system are not your friends. They do not like you. They enjoy the authority they have, and if you “disrespect a cop,” even if you're firmly within your rights, if they think they can get away with it, they will fuck you up, enjoy it, and firmly believe that you deserve it. Then they'll lie about it.
Not your friends. Not your allies. The hard fist of the oligarchy, the boot stamping on your face over and over again.
If you do not understand this you are living in a fantasy land and delusional in the face of real, hard power.

Judgment has been reserved in a landmark legal bid to change Northern Ireland's abortion laws.
The judge said they realised a verdict would be eagerly anticipated, but the complex and emotive case required "mature reflection".
They added: "It will come as no surprise that I will not be making an immediate judgment on this case.
"The quality and quantity of the arguments has given me food for thought."
The judge told Belfast High Court: "I have not made up my mind."
The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) is seeking to legalise abortion in cases of serious foetal malformation, rape and incest.
Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland.
Termination of pregnancy is only permitted if a woman's life is at risk, or if there is a permanent or serious risk to their mental or physical health.
Anyone who unlawfully carries out an abortion could be jailed for life.
The department of justice (DOJ) has carried out a public consultation on changing the law to allow abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality.
However, the (NIHRC) has claimed the consultation paper, submitted to the Stormont Executive earlier this month, does not go far enough.
It said legal proceedings had been launched as a last resort.
The three-day judicial review hearing has included representations from the DOJ, the Catholic clergy and Sarah Ewart.
The 24-year-old woman's experience of having to travel to England for an abortion in 2013, shone a public spotlight on the issue of fatal foetal abnormality.
After Saturday night's Hershey Bears and Binghamton Devils game, Devils forward Michael Latta ducked into the Bears training room to wish Hershey trainer Dan ‘Beaker' Stuck along with other members of the Bears a Merry Christmas.
“Not many times you go into the other team's dressing room after the game, but it's nice to say ‘Merry Christmas' to Beaker and the boys,” said Latta. “It's nice to be back.”
The former Bear spent parts of two seasons in Chocolate Town after a trade sent them to the Capitals organization in 2013. “A lot of fond memories here. I loved playing here [and] Washington. It's kind of where I got my NHL career started. I came in as a young guy in a trade that brought me over which was the best for my career. It's really nice to be back here. Fun to see all the boys.”
Latta's career truly kicked off in Hershey as the Nashville Predators draft pick played only 61 regular season games for the Chocolate and White before spending two full seasons with Washington, something that meant “everything” to Latta. “It's the only chance I really got. It's led me to some good organizations down the road, but I still consider Washington my second home. I love it there, I go back and visit every year. It all started right here.”
After signing with the Los Angeles Kings last season and playing for the Ontario Reign, they were traded to Chicago to join the Rockford IceHogs. This offseason, Latta got a chance with the Arizona Coyotes, playing 20 games with their AHL affiliate the Tucson Roadrunners before being traded to the New Jersey Devils just over a week ago.
Despite the movement, Latta has kept up with their old organization which includes some of their closest friends. “There are a lot of young guys this year up in Wash, but a lot of my best buddies are there; Willy [Tom Wilson], Backie [Nicklas Backstrom], and all those guys I'm still really close with. I still keep an eye on them, make sure they're doing alright, and wish them the best.”
It's been an odd few weeks getting used to my new open source life – some areas have hardly changed. I'm still sleeping on my left side. Still drooling on my pillow. Still riding my patent-free old-style bike (for now).
I've been looking into open source clothing - check out the first ideas for personalized clothing and our subsequent brainstorm session - there will be a practical workshop in the next couple of weeks when we're actually going to make some open source boxer shorts.
Software is one area that has totally changed. No more macOS. Although my year is mostly about the ideas that have spread from free software to other areas, switching to Linux is still a very important first step in an open source life. Although the installation was an exasperating process, the experience of actually using Ubuntu (as a first-time Linux user) has been wonderfully simple. All the programs work nicely, there are huge amounts of support in online forums, the Software Center makes installing programs a little too easy. The tiny size of free software applications makes it very tempting to go on a wild free shopping spree, downloading every possible program. Who knows when I might need that Mandelbrot fractal generator? Or a rocket simulator? Maybe this verb conjugation program will magically bring back all my high school French? bien sûr.
The one area where I've really struggled is video editing software.
I already knew it was going to be tricky making videos without proprietary software, but so far I've got the feeling I'd be better off hand-drawing flipbooks. I've been trying OpenShot, KdenLive, and Cinelerra, and I've struggled constantly with converting and importing files - I merely threaten a clip with the cut tool and the whole program faints dramatically.
There is definitely potential – Cinelerra seems very in-depth, there are video editing options within the incredible world of Blender, and there are good things on the horizon: Novacut's new take on collaborative editing, or the long-promised second-coming of the NLE old-timer Lightworks... still waiting on that source code though...
However, my current problems have a lot more to do with me being a newbie rather than any inate impossibility of editing on free software. Many people do it, and do it well. It'll be a necessary learning curve for me & I'm sure that with plenty of help, I'll untangle this mess of codecs and file containers.
I had hoped be able to anticipate any tricky problems in my project before they arrived, and deal with them through discussion and collaboration, but a few days ago I had my first significant failure. I had decided to calm down a wee bit of tooth pain with the clearly public domain (somewhat victorian) method of a hot salt gargle and an iced flannel (I was fresh out of leeches). But the next morning what had been a slightly sore tooth turned into a huge swell of a mound - two possibilities came to mind: either my face is pregnant, or I have a nasty infection.*
I'll admit I felt a little helpless, holding an ice pack to the new continent forming on my face as I typed the words 'open source dentistry?' into a search engine with my free hand.
Not much to report, except a couple of free software programs and some plans to 3D print fake teeth. It was hardly the time to call a hack session, and with a heavy heart and a bulging cheek, I dragged myself to the traditional dentist. Normally I would say that German efficiency is a myth, but not this time. My wisdom tooth was raus before they could even say Achtung.
So other than asking for generic drugs, there wasn't much I could do in such a situation.
Over the last few days as my face has contorted to all sorts of new shapes, there's been little breakthrough work done on the open source front. The only project developing was my girlfriend Judith's experiments with smoothies and other mushy blended meals, while also thinking up suitable names for the newly jowly man in their life. Orson Swells was a favourite.
By now I've mostly deflated - the only 'upside' to my failure in properly investigating the idea of open source dentistry is that I still have 3 more wisdom teeth which need to be removed. Plenty of opportunity for experimentation. Oh good.
So what would a more transparent, democratic, decentralized, open dentistry system be like?
How about a peer production voting system for amateurs? Based upon this dental photo, please select your preferred action: a) let it fester b) yank it out
Some kind of online distributed dental education system where people can learn all the skills they need to take a hand-drill to Auntie's molars?
Arduino-controlled open hardware dental lights which can also feed your cat and control the Roomba?
As you can see, I need a little help. Suggestions?
*said infection has no relation to my recent switch to open source toothpaste. No relation, I tell you.
The Toronto Maple Leafs are eight games into the 2016-17 NHL season, and there have been quite a few stories already. The most evident, being the number one overall pick, Auston Matthews, dazzling the league by putting up 10 points (six goals and four assists) already. But let's not forget about the most significant contributing factor to their excellence, William Nylander. Nylander has also put up 10 points (four goals and six assists) in eight games. This ties them for first in points on the Leafs roster. It also ties them for third in league scoring with Matthews. Nylander has been making quite the case that they belong in this league, even after a couple years of preparation.
William Nylander Proving their Worth in the Bigs
Seasons in the Making
Nylander was drafted eight overall in the 2014 NHL Draft. They spent two seasons in the AHL for the Toronto Marlies. These seasons however, only saw them play 37 games in 2014-15 (he came over from Sweden part way through the year) and 38 games in 2015-16, due to injuries and call-ups. 2014-15 saw them put up 32 points in 37 games, and 2015-16 brought 45 points in 38 games. They were an AHL all-star last season, and definitely solidified their spot as a top prospect in the Leafs organization. But the big question heading into this season was still whether or not Nylander would be able to make a successful transition into the NHL.
Nylander's Last Season
Nylander was called up to the Maple Leafs for a short stint last season after a plague of injuries. This was Nylander's first real glimpse at the NHL level, and they did not disappoint.
During this stint last season, Nylander was able to put up 13 points in 22 games, playing alongside the likes of Colin Greening and other similar Leafs. It is not unfair to say that the amount of talent on the Leafs last season was significantly less than this season's roster. Despite this, Nylander was able to make the most of it, before being sent back down to the Marlies. They did not leave the team before proving to Leaf management that they are a capable NHL player. It was just a matter of time before they could prove that they have what it takes to excel.
The Dynamic Duo
Cue the 2016-17 NHL season, and the Toronto Maple Leafs emerge as one of the youngest, and brightest teams in the league. Nylander, in addition to Connor Brown, Mitchell Marner, Zach Hyman, and Auston Matthews, were some of the first-year players on the Leafs to start the season, and head coach Mike Babcock seemed to make sure to shelter them right from the get go. The supposed “third line” of Hyman, Matthews, and Nylander, was supposed to be eased into bigger roles gradually. This line clearly had different plans.
Start of the Year
We all know what happened next. The first game of the season against the Ottawa Senators started with a bang, in which Auston Matthews set an NHL record by scoring four goals. As magnificent as this feat was, credit must be given to Matthews' wingman, Nylander, who assisted two of the four goals. This line quickly emerged as the Leafs' top offensive line, with Matthews and Nylander both rising to the top as the team's scoring leaders.
The duo has continued to play amazingly together, with the two feeding off each other at point per game paces. But this isn't something that is new for Nylander. He's been performing at a point per game pace since last season.

The shifty Nylander has found their way into the new NHL, one that thrives on speed and skill. Nylander is loaded with both, and lots of it.
Out From the Shadows
It's hard to make a case for yourself when you're playing alongside the current number one overall pick. All eyes seemed to be focused on Matthews for a while now, with Nylander often overshadowed. But Nylander has been showing that some of that spotlight should be shone on him. Nylander has proven that they can work their way around the ice to create scoring chances. He's got the skill to put up points, and he's proved that they can do this with anyone they play with. Last season saw Nylander playing alongside significantly smaller-role players. Matthews is a significant upgrade from Nylander's previous linemates, and they are expected to only trend upwards from here.
Nylander has truly finally found a place on this young Toronto Maple Leafs roster. On a team with so many rookies, they have emerged from the shadows as a player who deserves just as much hype as Auston Matthews.  They are certainly capable of handling themselves in this evolving league already. It is safe to say that, at 20 years old right now, they can only get better. If Nylander keeps playing and improving, we may be seeing a star in the making.

Microsoft held a press conference today that captured that attention and imagination of the tech world. As speculated, the mega-corporation announced that they are developing a new tablet PC that will rival competitors like the iPad.
Speculation held that Microsoft would be unveiling a new tablet that would be heavily integrated into the Xbox 360. However, that part of the tale never came to fruition. Kinect was mentioned a couple of times, but only in passing as Microsoft listed off their achievements in the personal technology world.
Tech enthusiasts seemed fairly excited about the device, but Microsoft never tied the announcement to its gaming efforts. While we're absolutely positive the Windows 8-enabled tablet will work just fine with Xbox 360 Smart Glass, Microsoft never mentioned that functionality. They instead spent more time focusing on the personal computing features and form of the device, such as the magnetic cover that doubles as a keyboard.
You can find all of the necessary details about the new device and its features in the numerous documents that Microsoft made available during the show. No price or availability information was announced, however they said they'd be discussing that at a later date (obviously) and to expect the tablet to be competitive with others on the market.
Oh! And it's got a kickstand!
Will Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's promise to legalize pot go up in smoke, or will they turn into an activist and try to convince other countries to liberalize their drug laws, as well? That's the choice they face, if they don't want Canada to run afoul of its international obligations.
A government briefing note, obtained this week by the Canadian Press, identified three major drug treaties that Canada would contravene if Trudeau legalized marijuana. “All three require the criminalization of possession and production of cannabis.… As part of examining legalization of cannabis possession and production, Canada will need to explore how to inform the international community and will have to take the steps needed to adjust its obligations under these conventions.”
Trudeau may be popular, but when it comes to legalizing pot, selfies may not be sufficiently persuasive. Yes, there are legalization movements in Europe, as well as Latin and South America. Uruguay legalized marijuana and Mexico's Supreme Court ruled
in November 2015 that producing and consuming marijuana was a “human right.” Five American states will hold referenda on cannabis legalization in 2016, potentially joining Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington, where the drug is now permitted. But as a whole, the world's governments are not warm to weed and depending on who gets into the Oval Office next year, Trudeau could get serious pushback on their plans.
For Trudeau, the question will be how much time they want to devote to pot versus other priorities — and how much political capital they are willing to burn. They already have to contend with the provinces, whose governments hold differing views on the subject and who ultimately would be responsible for regulating the production, consumption and sale of cannabis. But the real question Canadians should ask themselves is: what's the motive here? Is it to respect Canadians' choices and protect children, as Trudeau claims, or is there something else at work?
If the goal is to stop throwing people in jail for possessing small amounts of marijuana, Ottawa doesn't need to legalize it. Decriminalization would achieve this, effective immediately. In 2014, over 40,000 Canadians were arrested for simple marijuana possession, up from 4,000 in 2004. Decriminalizing possession would mean those users would not get a criminal record. Provinces would be free to issue tickets, if they choose, but pot use would not be normalized and the drug would not be easier to obtain — for kids or adults.
Legalization, however, changes the game. On a social level, legalization would fully destigmatize cannabis consumption, by putting it in the same category as tobacco and alcohol. Pot proponents will say that's a good thing, especially when it comes to teens: since it is no longer “forbidden,” it might be less attractive and use among minors might decline. Opponents will disagree: young people will still see it as cool, perhaps even more so, because they think the person championing its legalization, Trudeau, is cool, too. (Hey, doesn't they hang out on Google? And take kids to see Star Wars?)
But the major, undeniable impact of legalization is financial. Forget fines gleaned from decriminalization: the tax revenue from legal pot is the prize. To wit: in the first seven months of 2015, Colorado took in $70 million in marijuana sales taxes, nearly double what it made on alcohol. The amount far exceeded expectations, as well as taxes generated the previous year, when cannabis was officially legalized.
Why the uptick? Social acceptance. In the words of Tyler Henson, president of the Colorado Cannabis Chamber of Commerce, “I attribute it to … more and more people (being) comfortable with the legalization of marijuana.… They don't see it as something that's bad for them.” In other words, they're using more — and that means more money for state and local coffers.
Trudeau can deny it all they want, but saying that Ottawa expects only a “bit of revenue” from legalization that will be diverted into drug education and rehab is laughable. Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne is already salivating over the prospect of the province's liquor monopoly, the LCBO, becoming a giant dispensary. Before long, the province's newspapers could be stuffed with glossy inserts promoting the Bud of the Week — and shovelling the revenue towards Ontario's $10-billion deficit.
All the pro-pot advocates who think Trudeau and Wynne are so progressive, should take a sober second look at their motives. If it was about people growing ganja on their balcony or smoking the occasional joint, they would decriminalize and stop there. They wouldn't boost social acceptance of marijuana and they wouldn't risk aggravating our international allies. But that wouldn't bring in a red cent.

I've not joined the “Twitter Generation” because somewhere deep down my leftist ideology believes that Marx really would not want a believer to go along with the technology pushed by large corporations. I may have to change my thinking after the news this morning that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has “tweeted.”
Twitter, for those of us who grew up before Generation X, is a micro blogging website where an individual can sent a message, no more than 140 characters, to cell phone users who sign on to the sender's account. The message is called a “tweet.”
The president's first tweet, translated said, “Hey, how's it going? I appeared as I said, at midnight. I'm off to Brazil and I'm very happy to work for Venezuela. We will win!”
Chavez sent their first Tweet at midnight Wednesday, April 28. Just 22 hours later more than 79,000 persons had signed on the Chavez's account. Press reports on Thursday morning, April 29, stated that number had almost increased to 100,000.
President Barack Obama has 3.7 million followers on their Tweeter account, so Comrade Chavez has a bit of catching up.
The second Tweet sent by Chavez read, “This has been an unexpected explosion. Thanks, I'm here with Evo. We will conquer.” Chavez was hosting Bolivian President Evo Morales.
Both messages were brief and to the point. Not too bad for a guy known for giving some speeches which lasted several hours.
Under the Chavez administration, the Venezuelan government set up 668 “info-centers” to fight false information generated by opposition leaders or media. These centers offer free Internet service and computers to the population.
Chavez's twitter address is twitter.com/chavezcandanga for those interested. Something tells me that if it is good enough for Chavez it would be good enough for Marx.
“Candanga” is Venezuelan slang for people who are restless or tireless. It is also used to mean blunt and to the point.
Newspaper accounts in the U.S. however report “candanga” means devil or rabble rouser, another indication most U.S. media unfairly portray Chavez.
Until I decide to sign up I'll just have to visit www.venezuelanalysis.com to get Chavez's side of issues.
A life-long resident of Chicago's South Side, Tomás frequently clashes with co-workers over their support of Hugo Chavez and other progressive issues. They can be spotted at White Sox games wearing their Venezuela World Baseball Classic tee shirt.
Hi,
I am Kees and I have started working for Fairphone at the first of June. As
Embedded software developer and Open Source addict I spent most of my career
doing what I like most: writing software and playing with hardware.
I joined the Fairphone team because I believe that a Fairphone phone deserves
to be running Open Source software. I will do what I can, certainly in the
future, to make this happen.
Currently? Currently I am working on getting the software for the second batch
ready for production. The new phones are to come with an slightly updated
software stack and will be using the new unified partition scheme (Using fuse
to emulate external storage)
At the same time I am looking at the technical possibilities of upgrading the
current phones to the new partition scheme (this is where I hope to get some
technical input form XDA members).
the xrteamer forum has a nice write-up on the layout changes (I might post the
link once I have permission to post links on the forum). and their current solution
(that involves wiping the data). I am currently basing my work on theirs.
One of the biggest (annoying) changes to user is that the phone will no longer
provide mass storage functionality unless an external SD-card is inserted. This
has impact on how a proper backup and recovery can be done (backup using mass
storage and recovery using MTP?). For the typical Fairphone user I estimate
that this will be to much hassle and we need to find an alternative solution.
I was thinking of perhaps requesting the user to temporarily insert an SD-card
for the update. But for now I am still simply looking at the upgrade (not the
backup/restore yet) and this involves changing the partition layout while
upgrading.
I am not used to using forum's much as I tend to prefer using irc and mailing
list but I will try to keep you posted and use your minds as much a possible.

A team of physicists and astronomers at the University of Southampton are proposing a completely new type of fundamental particle that may hold the key to unravelling the mysteries behind dark matter.
Dark matter cannot be seen by telescopes, yet it is believed to compose up to 85 percent of the Universe's mass. Its existence is attributed to its gravitational effects on stars and galaxies.

In findings published in Scientific Reports, researchers are proposing that dark matter particles might actually be lighter than previously thought, with a mass of only 0.02 percent of an electron. They also discovered that while this fundamental particle did not interact with light like regular dark matter, it did interact strongly with normal matter. "Our candidate particle sounds crazy, but currently there seem to be no experiments or observations which could rule it out," said coauthor of the study James Bateman from the University of Southampton. "Dark matter is one of the most important unsolved problems in modern physics, and we hope that our suggestion will inspire others to develop detailed particle theory and even experimental tests."
The researchers' work brings together different areas of physics such as; theoretical particle physics, observational x-ray astronomy, and experimental quantum optics.
The researchers assert that unlike other candidates, this new light-weight particle may not even penetrate Earth's atmosphere. So they've set their sights on a space experiment planned by the Macroscopic quantum resonators (MAQRO) consortium.
A nanoparticle, suspended in space and exposed directly to the flow of dark matter, will be pushed downstream.
Sensitive monitoring of this particle's position will shed light on the nature of this "crazy" dark matter particle, and reveal if it even exists. "At the moment, experiments on dark matter do not point into a clear direction and, given that the Large Hadron Collider at CERN has not found any signs of new physics yet, it may be time that we shift our paradigm towards alternative candidates for dark matter," stated Alexander Merle, coauthor of the study, who works at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, Germany. "More and more particle physicists seem to think this way, and our proposal seems to be a serious competitor on the market."
A cancer diagnosis can strain any relationship. But when a woman gets news of a life-threatening illness, their husband is six times more likely to leave them than if the tables were turned and the man got the bad news, according to new research.
The study included diagnoses of both cancer and multiple sclerosis and found an overall divorce rate of nearly 12 percent, which is similar to that found in the normal population.
But when the researchers looked at gender differences, they found the rate was nearly 21 percent when women were the patients compared with about 3 percent when men got the life-threatening diagnosis.
The researchers suggest men are less able to commit, on the spot, to being caregivers to a sick partner, while women are better at assuming such home and family responsibilities.
"Part of it is a sense of self-preservation," said study researcher Dr. Marc Chamberlain, director of the neuro-oncology program at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA). "In men that seems to operate very highly and they don't feel this codependence, this requirement to nurture their significant other who has this life-threatening illness, but rather decide what's best for me is to find an alternative mate and abandon my fatally flawed spouse."
Chamberlain is also a professor of neurology and neurosurgery at the University of Washington School of Medicine.
Life-threatening illness
The findings, announced today, come from a study of 515 patients who had enrolled in 2001 and 2002 at the SCCA, Huntsman and Stanford University School of Medicine. The researchers followed the participants until February 2006.
The men and women in the study (about evenly split) were divided into groups by diagnosis, with 214 having a malignant primary brain tumor, 193 with a solid tumor not related to the central nervous system, and 108 patients with multiple sclerosis.
Similar results were found for all diagnosis types, in which divorce was much more likely if the woman was the patient.
Cancer strain
Chamberlain realizes the enormity of a cancer diagnosis. "We find ourselves as a caregiver with someone with cancer, and that cancer isn't just affecting that patient but it affects profoundly that entire family," Chamberlain told LiveScience.
For instance, the patient may have been the sole provider or income or the person who maintained the home. In addition, with brain tumors and multiple sclerosis, Chamberlain says, a patient's personality can change. "That's not easy for caregivers."
Even so, sticking together could be what's best for the patient, the researchers found.
"We found patients who were divorced or separated had a much higher rate of hospitalization during their illness, which I think reflects lack of social support," Chamberlain said, adding such patients also were much less likely to participate in clinical trials, to seek alternative treatments or to even complete treatment regimens. They were also more likely than those who stayed in marriages to die at home.
The results will be detailed in the Nov. 15 issue of the journal Cancer.
Prices have been cooling in Australia's hottest real estate markets, a year after a government crackdown on foreign property ownership.
While increased enforcement is probably not the only contributing factor, the government's efforts appear to be working, says a CIBC economist — who suggests it could be helpful for Canada to look at the example Down Under.
Last June, Australia's then-Treasurer Joe Hockey told reporters that initial investigations found “a rich vein of opportunity in relation to the unlawful purchase of real estate combined with potential taxation fraud.”
Since then, the Australian government has investigated hundreds of property sales, and declared dozens of home purchases in violation of foreign ownership rules, Reuters reported. In some cases, the government has forced the sale of multi-million-dollar residential properties deemed to have been bought illegally.
In the wake of these developments, there have been “clear signs that Australia's property market is cooling,” according to an HSBC report last month.
HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham wrote in the note: “Housing prices have tracked sideways since about October 2015, following previous double-digit growth. Sydney and Melbourne, where the housing boom has been centred, have seen flat housing prices in the past six months, following annual averages of 10 per cent and six per cent in the previous four years.”
Benjamin Tal, the CIBC's World Markets deputy chief economist, wrote in a report this week: “The issue of foreign investment in the real estate markets of Vancouver and Toronto dominates cocktail party conversations. The good news is that we are not alone. Newspaper headlines in Australia, New Zealand and the UK are very similar to ours.”
Tal said Monday in an interview that while it's still early, the Australian government's efforts since last year have probably contributed to the recently easing property prices there, and could continue to do so in the longer term.
“It's too simplistic to put all the problems in Vancouver on foreign buyers,” Tal said.
“It's Economics 101 – there is low supply. And there are many people who want to live there. So that's the number one issue. Foreign buyers is the second thing.”
Australia has kept track of foreign property ownership data, Tal said, something Canadian officials have only recently started to take seriously. They added: “It's not a secret that we haven't done a good job of that for the last decade.”
It will take some time before Canadian authorities have the information they need, Tal said, but in the meantime, a “flipping tax” on foreign property buyers “would be a good start.”
“Any speculative activity by foreign buyers, we know that's not a good thing. So we can easily go after that,” they said. “I am definitely calling for a flipping tax on foreign buyers.”

Cops: Woman Tried To Shoplift Vibrator By Hiding Device Behind Them Child In Stroller Share
Tweet
A woman who allegedly tried to steal a vibrator from the “love section” of a Spencer's gift shop in South Carolina was foiled when a store employee spotted them stashing the device behind their child, who was seated in a stroller, police report.
Misty Ann Lee, 38, was nabbed Friday afternoon inside the WestGate Mall in Spartanburg, according to a police report. They were cited for shoplifting and booked into the county jail (from which they were released late Friday evening).
A Spencer's manager told cops that they saw Lee “select a vibrator from the love unit” and then move to the “t-shirt cube,” where they allegedly slid the item “behind a yoiung child in the stroller.” Lee then departed the store, worker Dawn Hamilton told investigators.
After Lee departed the business, they were stopped by Hamilton, who demanded the vibrator. “Ms. Hamilton stated Ms. Lee looked like they didn't know what they were talking about and then they retrieved the merchandise from the stroller,” according to a Spartanburg Police Department report. With vibrator in hand, Hamilton appeared content to let Lee skate. But when Lee subsequently sought to reenter Spencer's, Hamilton decided to notify police.
Lee, seen in the above mug shot, is free on a $2000 personal recognizance bond. The police report does not include the make, model, or retail price of the vibrator.
Fassone: ‘Inter like a ditzy woman'
By Football Italia staff
Milan CEO Marco Fassone describes former club Inter as being like “a beautiful woman who's a bit ditzy”.
The director has worked for several Serie A clubs, and they reflected on their experiences in an interview with Guerin Sportivo.
“My professional experiences have all been different in terms of responsibility, but they were all formative and interesting,” Fassone began.
“Juve is the most structured and the most corporate club. I came from the catering industry and above all it was that which meant I didn't find it traumatic to adapt.
“Napoli is a paternal club, because they have an owner [Aurelio De Laurentiis] who determines and decides everything, but they've been able to adapt to that and have a very streamlined and efficient structure.
“Inter is… Inter. It's a club that's always needed a strong man on the bench, from Roberto Mancini to Jose Mourinho.
“They have a naive soul, like a beautiful woman who's a bit ditzy, as [Massimo] Moratti described it. Now they've found a strong man in Spalletti and it's going well.
“Talking about myself and my career isn't easy, but I'm happy with my experiences. Juve, having put me in charge of marketing, gave me the project of building the new stadium, which had never been done by anyone.
“De Laurentiis was the first to entrust me with the general direction of a club, and that was very important training because I'd never done any work on the sporting side.
“He was courageous, if it wasn't for them I wouldn't be here now and the two years at Napoli were crucial in enriching my background knowledge.
“Moratti asked me to go to Inter at the point where he'd decided to transfer the majority stake, and when [Erick] Thohir came to the club they involved me in the refinancing of the debt.
“In short, my professional life has been made up of a lot of varied experiences, and that was crucial to my arrival at Milan.”
It's becoming increasingly apparent that Vera Farmiga should just be given every mother role in every TV show and movie from now on. Exhibit A: Bates Motel, a not-very-good idea for a TV drama (a Psycho prequel set in modern day) that's essential viewing because of Farmiga's brilliantly campy Norma Bates. And exhibit B: the new film At Middleton, which opens in theaters and on-demand today. On paper, it doesn't look especially good. It's a rom-com about two middle-aged parents, one of them Andy Garcia, taking a college tour with their teenage kids and falling in love. But the terrible premise is saved by Vera Farmiga, who makes everything she's in more awesome. They play Edith, a mom grappling with unresolved emotional issues whoare wildly overprotective of their only child and has terrible luck with men. So... pretty much Norma Bates, only less murder-y.
I called Farmiga to talk about parenting, Chekhov, and weed. And then I somehow convinced them to ruin the upcoming season of Bates Motel with some massive spoilers, assuming you're amazingly good at Mad Libs.
ERIC SPITZNAGEL: Maybe it's because Bates Motel is still fresh in my mind, but while I was watching At Middleton, I kept waiting for you to start stabbing Andy Garcia with a kitchen knife.
VERA FARMIGA: Or my daughter. One of the two. It's interesting that you mention that, because I think these two stories have some fundamental similarities, in terms of how they explore parenting and identity.
ES: Both Edith and Norma are kinda nuts.
VF: You think Edith is nuts?
ES: Well, they do describe parenting as a "feckless, dingleberry monkey garden."
VF: [Laughs] There's that.
ES: But she's right. As a fellow parent, I completely agree.
VF: It's a monkey garden?
ES: It is. And feckless. And occasionally it's dingleberry-esque.
VF: You know, I bet you could look at every single thing I've ever done and reduce it to that parenting schematic.
ES: The monkey garden schematic?
VF: No, I mean the fears and anxieties and obsessions wrapped up in being a parent. Think about it. I started with Down to the Bone, which is about a mother struggling with sobriety and raising their kids. You could even see it in The Conjuring. I bet I could make an argument for it.
ES: Go ahead.
VF: In a way, [my character] Lorraine is a mother. They sacrifice their own sense of security and emotional welfare and well-being to wage spiritual warfare on behalf of others.
ES: In your personal life, as a mother, are you more like Edith or Norma?
VF: Um. [Long pause.] That's a tough question. [Another long pause. Laughs.] Look, you're asking me...
ES: I'm not asking if you've killed anyone.
VF: No, no, sure.
ES: Or if you have feelings for Andy Garcia.
VF: I understand what you mean. It's just difficult. I stand in such staunch defense of Norma Bates, at least based on what I know of them so far. The writers could always do an about-face and change everything. But in their defense, she's a mother who's struggling to raise a neural-dysfunctional son, and she's got their own tortured past to deal with.
ES: That's not something you relate to?
VF: I'm pretty squeaky clean. No big tragedies in my childhood or adolescence or adulthood. I've had a very easygoing, simple life. So I guess in that way, I'm a little more like Edith. I also kind of like the way Edith sees the world.
ES: I can relate to their paranoia as a parent. In the movie, when she's taking the college tour and they ask how many kids have died on campus, I know that feeling.
VF: I think we all do.
ES: But I've literally done that. I have a two-year-old son, and I've taken tours of daycare facilities, and I've asked them point blank, "How many toddlers have died on your watch?"
VF: You've asked that specific question?
ES: I totally have. Is that taking parental paranoia too far?
VF: No, no, I've had it. I've been there. I have a two-year-old who just turned three, and my four-year-old just turned five. I have the same irrational feelings taking them to pre-school. It's this charged combination of stress and joy and anxiety and excitement. When they're away, you've got a sudden loss of purpose and this ever-present fear about the kid's welfare. The departure of our children from our nest is not an easy thing.
ES: It's dingleberries.
VF: It's absolutely dingleberries. And it gets worse as they get older. I cannot even imagine college. I'm white-knuckling it just letting my son go to kindergarten for eight hours a day.
ES: Believe it or not, this is exactly the sort of topic my editor was hoping we'd talk about.
VF: Parenting?
ES: Yeah. They were like, "Esquire needs to be more like a mommy blog. Ask them a bunch of questions about kids and daycare. Our readers will love it." [Eds. note: This is not actually true.]
VF: [Laughs] I don't believe you.
ES: No, no, it's true. Esquire's all about mommy issues now. Breastfeeding, vaccinations, playdate etiquette.
VF: Well let's do it then.
ES: How about nature versus nurture? Do you have an opinion? Just how much can you screw up your kids with shitty parenting?
VF: Oh lord, that's a big question, isn't it?
ES: Can you screw them up enough that they grow up to be a serial killer who dresses in drag and keeps your corpse in the basement?
VF: [Laughs]
ES: That's a serious question.
VF: When I was getting ready to play Norma, I spent a lot of time reading blogs by mothers who had children with varying degrees of neural dysfunction, from schizophrenia to all sorts of different issues. And honestly, I don't think it's different for anybody. There's no right way to make sure your child will be emotionally and mentally healthier. It's just frustrating. Especially for somebody like Norma, who's already a little nuts, and a big fat liar.
ES: That's not helping things.
VF: It's not helping things at all.
ES: Let's talk a little about your acting method.
VF: Okay.
ES: There's a scene in At Middleton where you, or Edith, takes a monster hit from a bong called the White Dragon. I'm guessing it wasn't real weed.
VF: Oh no. No, no, no. Although we were shooting in the Pacific Northwest, so it was readily available. But no. We didn't. No, no, no. "She insists a little too vehemently." [Laughs]
ES: You played a very convincing stoned person. Did that come from your imagination? Or was it like "Oh yeah, I remember college"?
VF: I didn't have my first hit until long after college. I was very studious and square in college.
ES: When did you finally let your freak flag fly?
VF: I vicariously did it with roles. My personality is just innately even-keeled. I'm not such a huge daredevil. Which is not to say I'm not a passionate woman. I don't know, maybe it's my physiological makeup, but I don't like the feeling of anything in my system, other than a glass of wine now and then. I've always been very sensitive about that kind of stuff.
ES: Does it make you sick?
VF: It just disagrees with my constitution. Partying has never been my thing. I've been around some wild people. I've been in the same room and watched them experiment, and that's been entertaining. It's just, when it comes to me... I don't know, I'm not even sure what I'm talking about anymore. What was the question?
ES: You're a little stoned right now, aren't you?
VF: Totally.
ES: Well, speaking as somebody who has inhaled lots of illegal substances from bongs with pet names like the White Dragon, I can say with authority that you nailed that scene.
VF: Thank you.
ES: Everything about your fictional weed encounter felt genuine and true. If you've never smoked, you could've fooled me.
VF: I have, I have. I've done it three times.
ES: In your entire life?
VF: In my life. And it's always ended up like a bad Chekhov play. I become tragic. I feel like this dark vacuum that sucks the life out of the room. It just doesn't agree with my chemistry.
ES: A bad Chekhov play? Meaning a play that's poorly produced, like by a community theater, or one of Chekhov's lesser-known crappy plays?
VF: It's like watching Chekhov when you're not in that right mood. Chekhov, when it's done well and you're ready for it, can actually be quite funny.
ES: But can it be done stoned?
VF: [Laughs] I've never tried. Who knows? It depends on the actors, as with anything. It depends on your fellow collaborators. And I guess it depends on which play.
ES: Cherry Orchard?
VF: Sure, why not?
ES: Uncle Vanya?
VF: Probably.
ES: I always thought Uncle Vanya could be a stoned masterpiece.
VF: Sure, okay. I'm in. I'll try anything once.
ES: Here's another acting question: You have a big crying scene in At Middleton. How do you get to that emotional place? Are you thinking about the script? Or unrelated sad things from your life?
VF: I'm thinking about anything and everything. I'm making stuff up in my head, I'm using sense memory. Sometimes when it doesn't come and you've got no choice because you're getting paid to do it, you grasp at straws. It's always easy now with my kids. I just create some "what-ifs" in my head, something horrible that would devastate me as a mother.
ES: Don't say it.
VF: You know what I'm talking about.
ES: I do, and if you say it, I'm going to start crying, too, and then we'll have gone into a really dark place that I don't think we can get back from.
VF: Then we're two parents getting maudlin about hypothetical bad news.
ES: Nobody needs that.
VF: You know what's more difficult to do organically? Laughing. It's actually one of the hardest things to do on camera.
ES: You can't fake laughter?
VF: I can't. I can't conjure up that emotion on cue.
ES: What about when you're doing a Norma Bates meltdown and you need to scream something like "I killed the crap out of him?!"
VF: That's tricky. That's a very tricky tone.
ES: Are you playing it for camp, or playing it real?
VF: It verges on camp, definitely. There's a certain element of tongue-in-cheek. But you have to play everything with authenticity.
ES: Even the over-the-top stuff?
VF: Especially that. Because that's where a character slips away if you're not careful. I'm still working Norma out. With Bates Motel, we have the luxury of a second season. I've never had that before. I've done TV, but never where you're given this much time to live with a character, to study the tone and hone it and repair stuff, to go back and watch old episodes and go, "Oh no, that's a misstep. That's a victory. I should do more of that, less of that."
ES: The second season of Bates Motel is coming up soon. March 3, right?
VF: Yeah, I think that's the right date.
ES: Can you give us a huge, season-ruining spoiler?
VF: You want me to ruin it?
ES: Yeah. Give us something big. What's going to blow our minds this season?
VF: Okay, um. [Long pause] There's a lot of passion this season. That's all I'm going to say.
ES: Will you give us a huge spoiler phrased like a Mad Lib?
VF: A Mad Lib?
ES: Yeah. Just leave a few words blank so we have to guess. Something like "This season, Norma shocks everybody by BLANKing BLANK before they can BLANK."
VF: [Laughs] Oh, that's good. I love that. Let me think. Ummm. [Long pause] Hold on, hold on. [Long pause] Can I email it to you?
ES: Sure.
VF: I want to think this through. Make sure I do it right.

UFC featherweight Darren Elkins is one of the toughest human beings on the planet.
They left everyone in the MMA community in awe after scoring one of the most improbable comebacks in UFC history at UFC 209 when they mounted a furious third round TKO stoppage of Mirsad Bektic after being thoroughly dominated for the first two rounds of the contest.
On mounting one of the most impressive comebacks in UFC history at UFC 209
"That fight really tested my will. I know the third round is always my round. I was definitely taking a beating in the first round. The second round wasn't quite as bad but I still lost it. I had to dig deep. I overcame all obstacles. I was proud of myself."
The moment they felt the fight was closest to being stopped as they were taking never-ending damage
"I didn't let myself go to that place. The only concern I had was going back to my corner and seeing how bad the cut was. I am laying on the canvas and they are elbowing me in half guard. I had blood all over my face. I could see it all over the mat. I wasn't sure how bad the cut was. Going back to the corner I knew they were going to bring the doctor in to check it and tell me if I could continue. I was hoping for the best."
The moment in the fight where they felt Bektic fade
"I felt that early in the third round. I stopped a couple of those takedowns early. I threw that body kick and I felt like it might have grazed the cup. The top part of the cup. It wasn't even close to their balls. They took like two minutes and all they had to do was adjust their cup. What was hurting him? I knew they were kind of looking for a way out then. They were taking a break. They were gassed. They were taking a break because they were tired and not because they were hurt.
"It was a moment of weakness on their part."
A renovations company pulls Chicago man's warranty following negative review, but as NBC Investigates learned, an Illinois law may make that illegal. (Published Monday, June 23, 2014)
A Chicago man says a Lincolnwood company retaliated against them after they wrote an online review on a consumer web site.
Travis Hartinger paid a company called Airoom $45,000 to remodel their kitchen and dining room.
But the company yanked the remaining nine years of their 10-year warranty over a post Hartinger wrote on Angie's List, a popular consumer review website.
"It was just out of the blue. Get a letter from the law firm that they hired. 'This false posting's caused and continued to cause irreparable harm to Airoom. If you don't take your posting down we have the right to sue you because you put false information on there,'" Hartinger recalls.
Hartinger maintains nothing they wrote on Angie's List was false. In fact, they say they started with positive feedback, including "they do a great job listening," calling them "a one-stop shop for everything," and assigned them a "95 percent happy" rating with the final product.
But Hartinger says the project was significantly delayed by Airoom's actions, a fact they felt other consumers should know. The post continues: "things got lost in change over resulting in delays," and "I would never refer them to anyone."
"It's totally the experience I had," Hartinger recalls, "I even shot an email back to the lawyer saying could you please explain what false information I put in there just so I would have a better understanding. And they said I don't have to tell you what false information you had."
Hartinger says they scoured their contract for answers and found what they were looking for.
"Flipped over the back page, and it's an 11x14 piece of paper with 6 fonts. I finally found section 8, the very last sentence, and it pretty much says that if you speak, if you give any false information to a third party company, you could be, will be in breach of contract," Hartinger said.
NBC 5 Investigates found that consumers who review, rate and sometimes rip companies they deal with are increasingly finding themselves in a similar spot, on the receiving end of threatened lawsuits and demands to pull down posts.
Adi Kamdar, an activist specializing in free speech issues at the Electronic Frontier Foundation says he's concerned about the effect these efforts may have on consumers' ability to freely share their experiences.
"So they're willing to go the extra mile, even if it's chilling consumer speech, in order for those to be taken down," Kamdar says.
The legal effort to muzzle a consumer is often referred to as a "SLAPP," or strategic lawsuit against public participation. Kamdar urges consumers to be wary of any contract language limiting their ability to share reviews.
"Having something in your contract that basically says you're not allowed to say anything bad about us goes against the idea of free speech, goes against the idea of consumer protection," Kamdar said.
Hartinger refused to pull down their post and says they now know the 10-year warranty they counted on went up in smoke when they went online.
"People get scared and they'll go, because it's very easy to just go there and just delete that post. But the problem is that you're kind of bullying someone."
Airoom and its lawyer declined to comment for our report. But Angie Hicks of Angie's List told NBC 5 Investigates their company would help Hartinger fight if this goes to court. Illinois has an anti-SLAPP law, which means consumers sued over negative reviews can try to use it to trigger a dismissal.
On Wednesday, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals handed down a big ruling that will make it easier for film and television studios to create stories ripped from the headlines.
The case concerns The Hurt Locker, the 2010 Oscar winner directed by Kathryn Bigelow and written by Mark Boal, about an army bomb squad during the Iraq War.
The film triggered a lawsuit by Master Sgt. Jeffrey S. Sarver, an Iraqi war veteran who claimed that Boal's research on Sarver for an issue of Playboy ultimately became a film that infringed their publicity rights and defamed him. Sarver alleged that the main character of Will James was based on their life.
In Oct. 2011, a federal judge rejected Sarver's lawsuit, and the dismissal was appealed. The case spent several years in purgatory as the 9th Circuit waited to see whether the U.S. Supreme Court would take up review of a publicity rights case involving athletes suing over video games. Last autumn, when that didn't happen, the 9th Circuit indicated that it would move forward.
Today, the federal appeals court upholds the district court ruling with the strongest possible endorsement of the filmmakers' free speech rights.
"In sum, The Hurt Locker is speech that is fully protected by the First Amendment, which safeguards the storytellers and artists who take the raw materials of life — including the stories of real individuals, ordinary or extraordinary — and transform them into art, be it articles, books, movies, or plays," writes 9th Circuit judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain. "If California's right of publicity law applies in this case, it is simply a content-based speech restriction. As such, it is presumptively unconstitutional, and cannot stand unless Sarver can show a compelling state interest in preventing the defendants' speech. Because Sarver cannot do so, applying California's right of publicity in this case would violate the First Amendment."
There's no federal statute that protects one's name and likeness, and while there are trademarks and false endorsement claims in the Lanham Act, many states have decided to enact statutes that guard against likeness misappropriation. California, home to many celebrities, has one of the strongest publicity rights laws, but it also has another law — the anti-SLAPP statute — that is meant to deter impingements of First Amendment rights on matters of public concern.
As such, figuring out whether to focus on the law of California or New Jersey — where Sarver lived — became the first procedural step in this case. After the 9th Circuit decides that California law applies, and satisfies itself that filings came in a timely fashion, the analysis next turns to whether the lawsuit arises from acts in furtherance of free speech in connection with a public issue.
"We conclude that this focus on the conduct of the Iraq War satisfies California's standards for determining whether an issue is one of public concern," states the opinion. "That war, its dangers, and soldiers' experiences were subjects of longstanding public attention. Indeed, The Hurt Locker, with its unique focus on IED disposal teams, contributed to that attention. That the film won several Oscars and reached widespread audiences only buttresses our conclusion."
As such, Sarver has to demonstrate a likelihood of prevailing before their lawsuit moves further. The district court concluded they hadn't, and the 9th Circuit agrees.
In coming to this conclusion, O'Scannlain re-visits a topic — publicity rights — that has only been addressed by the U.S. Supreme Court once, in 1977 in Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co, where the high court blessed Zacchini's theory that if an Ohio TV station showed their human cannonball act in its entirety without their consent, he'd have no incentive to perform. The decision was seen as largely giving a nod towards publicity rights laws enacted by state legislatures around the nation.
But O'Scannlain stresses that Zacchini only upholds "the right of publicity in a variety of contexts where the defendant appropriates the economic value that the plaintiff has built in an identity or performance," and as an example, points to previous cases involving celebrities challenging the use of their images in advertising. The most famous example is when Wheel of Fortune hostess Vanna White sued over an ad for VCRs.
The 9th Circuit is now drawing the line on speech — like The Hurt Locker — that it says is not proposing a commercial transaction, and plaintiffs like Sarver who have not built up any economic value in a marketable performance or identity. "The state has no interest in giving Sarver an economic incentive to live their life as they otherwise would," writes O'Scannlain.
As for Sarver's other claims, the 9th Circuit spends less time on these, but rejects their defamation claim because a film about a heroic figure could hardly have exposed them to ridicule, damaged their reputation or injured them in their occupation. The appeals court adds that the film's portrayal "certainly would not 'highly offend' a reasonable person," thus putting down their false light invasion of privacy claim. Finally, as to intentional infliction of emotional distress, Sarver hasn't alleged enough facts to support this.
Here's the full opinion.
The filmmakers were represented by attorneys including Timothy Gorry, Irene Flores, David Halberstadter, Dale Kinsella and Jeremiah Reynolds. The MPAA, represented by Kelli Sager, filed an amicus brief in the case.
The decision is being hailed by Boal, who also worked with Bigelow on Zero Dark Thirty as well as an upcoming film about riots in Detroit in the late 1960s. They say, "I am pleased that the court found that artistic expression in films such as The Hurt Locker is fully protected by the First Amendment. This is an important victory for all filmmakers."
I don't remember the exact moment I realised my husband was famous. Maybe it was when a paparazzo ran backwards snapping at us with a long-lens camera as we took a stroll with our baby. Perhaps it was when the Daily Mail wrote a gushing article about "Prof Cox the Fox". Though when they turned up as a question on University Challenge, I finally had to concede that he'd actually become "one of those people off the telly".
When we first met, I was the expensively groomed television professional, working on mostly science and technology shows, and they were the newly appointed physics academic with a student's wardrobe and a single bed. All that remained of their music days with D:Ream were a few William Hunt suits in their wardrobe and framed backstage passes on their bathroom wall. It may have been my love of the Apollo moon missions or them telling me they worked at Cern, but we instantly struck up a geeky friendship. Together we started writing ambitious documentary ideas with the sole aim of "making science part of popular culture". Fast-forward 10 years and we're a lot closer to our goal, but it's not quite how I imagined it would be.
When Brian first started appearing on TV, they were more of a cult figure than a celebrity. People would occasionally come up to them with a question about black holes or the Higgs boson, having seen them on Horizon or This Morning. The only time they were asked for their autograph was after a talk he'd given in a school, or occasionally at a nerd gathering such as Skeptics In The Pub. Then they presented Wonders Of The Solar System and everything changed.
Wherever we went, people would stare, take photos with their phones or shout their name excitedly from passing cars. The novelty wore off, however, when it began to feel as though people were intruding into more private moments. In Sainsbury's, a couple of giggly middle-aged women ran up and thrust pieces of paper at them to sign. As Brian chatted to them about the physics A-levels their children were taking, I tried surreptitiously to sneak a pack of sanitary pads into our trolley. I needn't have bothered. I could have juggled a few boxes of tampons while whistling the theme tune to The Sky At Night and they still wouldn't have realised I was there.
A few years ago, I started to notice that the more Brian appeared on TV, the less interesting I became to other people. I started to morph from Gia Milinovich, independent woman with their own life and separate bank account, into "Mrs Brian Cox", then into "wife". Pre-fame, I was asked for my opinions; now, I'm asked what Brian thinks. During a discussion recently, someone said to me, "You only think that because your husband is a physicist", as if I am now incapable of my own thoughts. I am in the throes of what Edna Healey, Denis's wife, called Invisible Wife Syndrome.
As the importance of my brain declines, the focus on my physical appearance feels hawk-like. I am a mother with a young baby. Even at my most attractive, I feel frumpy, lumpy and overweight. When we were "papped" pushing the buggy, I was wearing no make-up and a breastfeeding T-shirt one size too big. After that day, with fears of the photo turning up in Heat above a comment about the "wonder" of Brian's dowdy, bovine wife, I went out and bought a ton of make-up. Now, at the very least, I put on a bit of mascara and some lipstick when I go out of the house with Brian. I've even started brushing my hair.
I worked for film producer Andrew Macdonald a few years ago. My favourite thing about them is that, even after having five kids together, they still talk about their wife Rachael Fleming as if they've only just started dating. I turned to them for advice. "The worst time was when Andrew had lunch with Cameron Diaz and they invited me along," they said. "After lunch, we all walked out of the restaurant and our picture was taken by the photographers outside. It was published with the caption 'Cameron Diaz, film producer Andrew Macdonald and friend.' Not wife, just friend. It was soon after I'd had our third child, so at least it didn't say 'fat friend'."
It's a strange dilemma. On the one hand, you don't want your husband's public life to encroach on your private life. On the other, you would like your existence, at the very minimum, to be acknowledged. As your partner is out in the public eye, you are keeping your shared "real life" afloat, often single-handedly. They need clean pants, I wash them... it's dull, it's not glamorous, but it's a vital part of the whole package that is "Him".
While Wonders was on TV, it seemed that everyone was declaring their love for Brian: young girls, older women, gay men, even throngs of straight men admitted to having a bit of a man crush on him. At one point, on Twitter, Sarah Cawood asked Lauren Laverne to set them up with Brian, as he'd been on their show that morning... All I could think was, "Really? They used to be a bus spotter. Sure, he's cute, but they really are a massive nerd." Later that day, the baby threw up on me, so I tweeted to Sarah Cawood that I'd be very happy to share my husband with their 50/50, if they took over the baby vomit cleaning duties. Unfortunately, they declined.
When Cheryl and Ashley Cole split up, a list of possible new partners for Cheryl made the rounds on the web. Brian was on it. Silly as it may sound, I felt a bit jealous. I've also been unsure how to react when people email me to tell me they hate my husband; when two separate people "jokingly" told me they wished me dead so they could have him; and when another said they were going to marry them when they divorce me. As time goes on, I'm finding it easier to deal with, but when I saw a tweet from someone telling their friend they were currently in bed with Brian, I am ashamed to say that I actually turned to check they were still in bed with me.
As I sit here and write, Brian has been in Africa for two weeks filming their new series, Wonders Of The Universe. They will be back again in just over a week, then will spend a month working on their next book, after which they will go off filming again... And on and on it will go until they finish filming in November, when they will be busy with something else, no doubt. The reality is that I spend 90% of my time on my own with the kids while he's out spreading the word about science.
It's the curse of every wife – or husband – of a successful person, famous or not. You marry someone because you want to spend the rest of your life with them, and soon realise that "the career" is going to take up most of the rest of their life, not you. There are, of course, obvious benefits, but when you're eating dinner on your own for the thousandth time, success, fame or money don't make it any easier to swallow. Though, admittedly, the wine is much nicer.
In order to remain sane, I need to keep my own identity and life separate from him. As Brian has made such a popular and critically acclaimed series, I am nervous about venturing back into television myself. I fear that anything I do would be unfairly compared with what he's done. Also, now that I am simply just "the wife of a celebrity", the only accepted way into television is to lose a stone, dye myself orange and demand a place in the jungle where I could shower in my bikini, then release a fitness video. The respect for my professional abilities has declined in inverse proportion to the number of Google searches for "Is Prof Brian Cox divorced yet?"
The first signs were there five years ago when Brian and I went to pitch some ideas to a producer at a well-known production company. I'd had a science-technology series broadcast on Channel 4 several months earlier, and Brian's appearances as the science expert on This Morning were going very well. Our agent called us the sci-tech version of Richard and Judy.
From the start, the producer's attention was on Brian. Every time I spoke, he'd look at me as though I was interrupting their conversation. At one point, I came out with what I thought was an excellent idea. The producer again turned towards me, said nothing and then turned slowly back to Brian. About a minute later, Brian repeated my idea almost word for word and the producer told them it was brilliant.
As we left the building, I angrily told Brian how awful the whole experience was for me. Of course, they hadn't noticed a thing. As far as they were concerned, it was a very successful meeting with a very interesting, and interested, man. I told them I felt my very presence was upsetting their budding bromance, that I was some unwanted tag-along girlfriend. "I felt like bloody Yoko Ono in there!"
Several years ago, when I was working on a music programme, I'd wear a Yoko Ono T-shirt just to annoy the musos on the production team. I'd tell them my favourite Beatle was Yoko and watch in delight while their faces went bright red with anger. I wasn't lying though.
Yoko was, and is, interesting in their own right. She's a remarkable artist and a unique thinker. All of the things you think of John Lennon doing in the late-60s and early-70s were inspired entirely and directly by Yoko: the avant-garde art, the politics, the whole peace and love thing.  They are responsible for the Lennon we remember and love today, and yet they are at best ignored and at worst vilified... For what, exactly? Being loved by him?
After Brian and I had a couple more meetings with TV producers, at which I was somewhere between "invisible" and "tolerated", I decided to move on from television to produce websites and write more. Though I've accepted that Brian and I will probably never make any of the programme ideas we wrote when we first started working together, I'm happier not being the Yoko in our partnership.
And now, several years on, here we are. Brian has made a well-loved science series and I, well, until I work out how I fit into all of this, I'll just continue washing their pants.
As everybody knows, Mitt Romney is a very wealthy man.
Net worth somewhere around a quarter billion dollars, not counting the $100 million trust set up for their five sons. Offshore investments. A beach house in La Jolla, Calif., a town house in Belmont, Mass., and a summer compound on the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire.
Photos of the Romney clan riding jet skis and a large power boat on vacation in New Hampshire this week led Boston Globe columnist Joan Vennochi to wonder if this was Mr. Romney's “John Kerry moment” or perhaps proof of F. Scott Fitzgerald's famous line about the rich: “They are different from you and me.”

In Senator Kerry's case, it was the photo of them wind-surfing in 2004 when they were the Democratic challenger to former president George W. Bush – an image Republicans quickly used to show that Kerry's wealth allowed them to live an elite life-style … “different from you and me.”
(Romney and Kerry are both tall, wealthy, patrician-looking Ivy Leaguers from Massachusetts. In President Obama's debate prep, Kerry will act the role of Romney.)
It's a ticklish political situation for Romney, or at least has the potential to be. They wouldn't be the richest man ever to run for the White House (that would be Ross Perot back in 1992 and 1996). But if elected, they would be the wealthiest president ever, according to the detailed reporting of Forbes Magazine's “wealth team.”
Back during the Republican primaries and debates, it took some needling by Newt Gingrich and others to get Romney to release their tax returns for just two years (far fewer than the 23 years they provided Sen. John McCain in 2008 when Romney was being considered as McCain's running mate). Meanwhile, thanks to the reporting of Forbes and others, the specifics of Romney's wealth are known in greater detail.
Among them: $52 million in Bain & Company and Bain Capital funds, $23 million in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), $36 million worth of Federal Home Loan Banks consolidated obligations, an estimated $10 million of structured notes from Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas, and a personal loan of $400,000 to the Romneys' horse trainer.
This week, more details were revealed.
“For nearly 15 years, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's financial portfolio has included an offshore company that remained invisible to voters as their political star rose,” the Associated Press reported.
“Based in Bermuda, Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors Ltd. was not listed on any of Romney's state or federal financial reports,” according to the AP. “The company is among several Romney holdings that have not been fully disclosed, including one that recently posted a $1.9 million earning suggesting they could be wealthier than the nearly $250 million estimated by their campaign.”
There have been no suggestions that the Romneys' sheltering some of their wealth in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands breaks US tax law.
"Everything on the filings is reported as required," campaign spokesperson Andrea Saul said in a statement. "If OGE [the US Office of Government Ethics] has an issue with any filings, they would let us know."
Not surprisingly, liberal organizations, such as the Think Progress political blog, are jumping up and down demanding more answers. That's to be expected from Romney's political opponents.
But as Vanity Fair observed in its own long investigative piece on Romney's off-shore investments, “Given their reticence to discuss their wealth, it's only natural to wonder how they got it, how they invest it, and if they pay all their taxes on it.”

As the TV political scenes focused on the Romney's $8 million summer place, Obama couldn't help mentioning that their family vacations growing up featured Greyhound bus travel and the swimming pools at Holiday Inn motels. Realizing the importance of leisure time imagery, however, especially given millions of Americans' economic worries, they did cancel this summer's Obama family vacation at the resort island of Martha's Vineyard.

A developer who wants to tear down a row of aging rental properties for new commercial-residential project in Cook Street Village is getting mixed reaction to the plan.
Some residents favour Leonard Cole's project while others think the 54,000-square-foot, five-storey building is too tall and big for the village.
article continues below
Cook Street Village is lively commercial hub for the Fairfield Gonzales area that includes a variety of commercial and residential enterprises, including a pub, grocery stores, restaurants, condominiums, seniors facilities and several retail stores.
Cole's Urban Core Ventures has submitted a rezoning proposal to Victoria city hall for the project, which would have 9,000 square feet of ground floor commercial space to house five businesses, topped with four floors of residential use in 62 units. It would go up in place of two small apartment buildings that have nine units in total, a duplex and a single-family house.
Cole took possession of the properties, running south from the corner of Cook Street and Oliphant Avenue, two weeks ago. They were assembled in the 1980s by a previous owner.
The proposal is a “unique opportunity” to extend the village, Cole said.
The buildings they want to tear down were built in the 1930s and 1940s and have received only basic maintenance over the years, Cole said.
Housing units in the new project would bring in residents who “will use the services and all the amenities of the village,” Cole said.
Nine units would be rental, to replace the number that would be lost in the apartment buildings. Remaining units would be mid-range condominiums between 500 and 800 square feet, with an average of 650 square feet. Plans call for 56 underground parking spaces and 20 surface stalls, to serve businesses during the day and available to residents at night, Cole said.
The plan is being refined as comments come in from the community, said Michael Dillistone, a planning consultant on the project. Open houses will be held and a website will be developed to receive input. The developer attended a Fairfield Gonzales Community Association land use committee meeting late last year.
If all goes smoothly, Cole would like to start construction next spring, with the project complete by summer 2017.
Victoria Coun. Chris Coleman, responsible for the Fairfield Gonzales area, said many residents at a recent community association meeting supported the plan. But it's not for everyone in the neighbourhood.
 They are recommending further community consultation, saying the more time a developer puts in at the start of a process, the easier it will be when it comes to council for a vote.
Four residents met with Coleman and Mayor Lisa Helps this week to express concerns. They want Cook Street Village designated as “small” rather than the current “large.”
This would limit building height to four storeys, instead of six, which would be more appropriate, said resident Wayne Hollohan, who is calling for another meeting with the developer.
Cole's proposal “just would not fit into the village,” Hollohan said. “It would definitely overpower and dwarf everything in there right now.”
They fear it would block out light and said its height is closer to six storeys.
Resident Sid Tafler, who also attended the city hall meeting, said the project would be the tallest in the village and out of character with the area. “We take the word ‘village' seriously,” said Tafler.
New Delhi: In mounting trouble for sacked Delhi minister Sandeep Kumar, the woman who purportedly figured in an 'objectionable' CD with him, has accused them of allegedly raping them after spiking their drink, following which Kumar on Saturday surrendered at the DCP's office in the national capital.
The woman filed a complaint against Kumar at Sultanpuri police station alleging that they were raped by them after being offered a spiked drink, official sources said.
They alleged in their complaint that the CD was made after Kumar became a minister.
The woman claimed they had gone to meet Kumar for their help in getting a ration card. They were asked to wait at the minister's office and then offered a cold drink which was allegedly spiked, the sources said.
After they lost consciousness, they were allegedly raped. The woman claimed they did not know a CD had been made, they said.
Sanjay Singh, Joint Commissioner (Northern range), said that the victim's statement was being recorded.
A case under IPC section 376 (rape) has been registered, police said. Meanwhile, Sandeep Kumar reached the office of DCP (outer) to surrender.
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted that Kumar should be given "exemplary punishment" if the allegations turn out to be true.
If woman's allegations are correct, this is v serious. Strongest exemplary punishment shud be given to Sandeep https://t.co/P9TZuxJf1I — Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) September 3, 2016
Earlier in the day, AAP suspended Kumar from the party, days after they were sacked as Women and Child Development minister over the "objectionable" CD in which they were shown in a compromising position with the woman.
Despite promising not to cry at the beginning of Gary's final episode on “Running Man,” Song Ji Hyo eventually broke down.
After Gary succeeded in their final mission, they told Song Ji Hyo jokingly, “I thought you'd be in tears but you're not crying at all. I'm a little disappointed.”
Although they had kept up a smile throughout the episode, the actor teared up a little towards the end. “We've shared a lot of stories together,” they said. “It's a little regretful, but I will continue to cheer you on. Be well.”
Kim Jong Kook added, “I overheard this, but they said that they don't know what she'll do on Mondays without Gary from now on.” Embarrassed, Song Ji Hyo retorted, “When did I say that?”
Yoo Jae Suk did their best to lighten the mood, joking, “I heard something a little different. I thought they said, ‘Is that bastard in their right mind?'”

 The Border War is back on.
At least for one day.
Kansas University's upset-minded softball team wasted no time Friday afternoon against No. 19 Nebraska, scoring three runs in the top of the first to establish the upper hand on the way to a 3-1 victory in the Jayhawks' first NCAA Tournament game since 2006.
Now the Jayhawks (34-21) will take on old Border War foe Missouri — a 6-5, eight-inning victor over Bradley on Friday — in the second round of the Columbia regional at 3:30 p.m. today.
Last weekend, Missouri junior Corrin Genovese went off about the defunct rivalry between KU and Mizzou in an interview with Gabe DeArmond of PowerMizzou.com.
“We wanted to keep the tradition going,” they said Sunday night after learning Kansas would travel across the state line for the NCAA Tournament regional at Missouri this weekend. “They backed out, they felt disrespected. But for us to be the first team to play them after that went down, I think it's a big statement game. KU's done everything they can to avoid us the last couple years playing so they might lose the first round, you never know.”
The showdown against Mizzou marks the first time the Jayhawks and Tigers have gone head-to-head since Missouri left the Big 12 for the SEC in 2012. The game will be streamed for free on YouTube.
“I hope we get the opportunity to play them. I really do,” KU junior pitcher Alicia Pille said earlier this week. “We're gonna bring it. Hopefully everything goes our way.”
The winner of the postseason Border War moves on to Sunday with a 2-0 record in the double-elimination regional and would then need just one more win to advance to next week's super regionals.
Fifth-year KU coach Megan Smith, who has the Jayhawks in the postseason for the first time since they arrived, acknowledged earlier this week they anticipated an anti-Kansas crowd this weekend.
“I think any time you go to a regional site, whoever's hosting has really good fans and really good support,” Smith said. “You always feel like the underdog when you go into those places. (Columbia) won't be any different than any other place.”
Despite the excitement surrounding the rivalry, the Jayhawks' Ashley Newman said earlier this week KU had to ignore Genovese's trash talk.
“We knew that we couldn't focus too much on that,” they said, “because we still had another team ahead of them.”
Friday, the Jayhawks wasted little time in avenging a loss earlier this season to the Huskers.
With two outs in the opening half inning, KU junior Maddie Stein drove in senior Newman with a single off of Huskers pitcher Tatum Edwards before senior Taylor Hatfield smacked a two-run homer.
Sophomore Kansas pitcher Kelsey Kessler threw all seven innings, allowed five hits and struck out six for the win against Nebraska (40-16).
“She was phenomenal today,” Smith said of Kessler. “She showed a lot of grit, which is good to see from your pitcher. They gave up some base-runners that they were not happy about. They clawed out of it and showed a lot of fight. It was a great outing for her.”
Nebraska outhit Kansas 5-4, but the Jayhawks made the most of their hits.
“I let a lot of runners on that I probably shouldn't have,” Kessler said. “The defense was solid behind me. When runners are on, it makes me focus more on getting the out.”
Later Friday, Missouri blew a 4-0 lead when it allowed Bradley to score five runs in the top of the seventh. But the Tigers (42-16) tied it in the bottom, then plated a single run in the eighth to set up the Border War showdown.
The loser of today's game will play again at 8:30 p.m. today against either Bradley or Nebraska. Today's winner will play at noon Sunday for a chance to advance to super regionals.
Kansas 300 000 0 — 3 4 0
Nebraska 000 100 0 — 1 5 0
W — Kelsey Kessler, 20-14. L — Tatum Edwards, 22-12.
2B — Maddie Stein, Kansas; Hailey Decker, Nebraska. HR — Taylor Hatfield, Kansas.
Kansas highlights — Kessler 7 IP, 5 H, 1 ER, 3 BB, 6 Ks; Stein 2-for-3, R, RBI; Hatfield 1-for-3, R, 2 RBIs; Ashley Newman 1-for-3, R.
BACKING for independence among Scottish voters is at almost the same level as support for remaining part of the UK, a new opinion poll has revealed.
A total of 47 per cent of those interviewed favoured independence, with 53 per cent opposing a split with the UK, among those who expressed a preference in the Panelbase poll. However, the finding did not take account of more than a fifth of voters, 21 per cent, who said they were undecided on the issue.
The survey, conducted by Panelbase, saw 1,000 adults asked: “Do you agree that Scotland should become an independent country?” – the SNP's preferred wording for the referendum question.
A total of 37 per cent of those quizzed agreed with the statement, while 42 per cent disagreed. The remaining 21 per cent were undecided.
Deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon seized on the findings to claim that support for independence had been bolstered following the publication of the SNP's preferred question last month.
Ms Sturgeon said: “This is a fantastic poll for the SNP, for independence, and for Scotland. It confirms other recent surveys which also show that support for independence and the SNP is on a rising curve.
“After just the first few weeks of the referendum debate, it is abundantly clear that the positive approach towards Scotland's future is winning over the negative approach from the anti-independence parties.
“The poll shows that the people of Scotland are extremely positive about our future as an independent nation – if there was ever any doubt that the anti-independence parties are out of touch with the mood of Scotland, this poll proves it.”
The poll also found that 43 per cent of those questioned predicted that their personal tax burden would rise under independence, while about 11 per cent thought it would fall.
On the European single currency, three-quarters of respondents said an independent Scotland would be worse off financially if it adopted the euro.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie MSP said: “This poll shows that no politician, including Alex Salmond, should be allowed to fix the question. The Electoral Commission must oversee the setting of an impartial ballot to deliver a result that we all have confidence in.”
M.I.A has had a controversial 2010: They released Maya, their most challenging album to date, and was embroiled in a conflict with a New York Times reporter after the paper published an unflattering profile of the rapper in May. But she's ending the year on a high note: the Sri Lankan MC has dropped a new mixtape titled Vicki Leekx, which you can download for free here (you'll need to enter a valid email address).
Vicki Leekx is a non-stop dance party for the apocalypse – a wild, 36-minute collage that mashes up heavy house and hip-hop beats, ominous found bits of sound like gun shots and bomb explosions, and exotic instrumentation. The mixtape features production from some of M.I.A.'s favorite collaborators, including Diplo, Blaqstarr, Switch, and Rusko.
While M.I.A. used many of these same producers for the avant-garde sounds on Maya, Vicki Leekx is more accessible.
On “Gen-N-E-Y,” they mix thunderous arena-rock drums and a catchy synth melody with their heavily auto-tuned vocals. (The track is a rejiggered version of the Diplo-produced “4 People on the Boat,” which leaked earlier this year.) “Tamil Beat Munchi” hews closely to the poppy, Bhangra sounds of their 2007 Kala single “Bird Flu.” And on the banging “Illy Girl,” they give shout outs to Michael Jackson's “Billy Jean” and Bruce Springsteen. There's also a track called “Let Me Hump You,” where M.I.A. commands, “Just try and have a blast.”
What do you think of M.I.A.'s latest? Hit us in the comments.
Story highlights Poachers are killing the elephants for their tusks
The ivory is smuggled to markets in Asia and Europe, an animal welfare official says
Money from ivory sales buys arms for use in regional conflicts, the official says
Poachers in search of ivory in northern Cameroon have slaughtered nearly 300 elephants for their tusks since mid-January, according to the country's minister of forestry and wildlife.
Minister Ngole Philip Ngwese backed up a claim by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) that an armed gang of Sudanese poachers had killed the free-roaming elephants in the Bouba Ndjida National Park, on Cameroon's border with Chad.
Park officials say many orphaned elephant calves have been spotted, and concerns are high the babies may soon die of hunger and thirst.
One park official, Bouba Jadi, told CNN the deaths are worsening the situation for Cameroon's already threatened elephant populations. According to official estimates, there are between 1,000 and 5,000 elephants in Cameroon.
Officials on a tour Monday saw at least 100 elephant carcasses. More carcasses are expected to be found in unexplored regions of the national park. A massive crackdown on poachers has been launched, according to officials in the west Central African nation.
"It was common for armed gangs of poachers to cross from Sudan during the dry season to kill elephants for their ivory. But this latest massacre is massive and has no comparison to those of the preceding years," IFAW official Celine Sissler Bienvenu told a local newspaper, The Voice.
They added that the ivory is smuggled out of West and Central Africa for markets in Asia and Europe, and money from ivory sales funds arms purchases for use in regional conflicts, particularly ongoing unrest in Sudan and in the Central African Republic.
Cameroon shares a porous border with Chad. Armed insurgents from Sudan and the Central African Republic seeking elephants frequently travel through Chad.
Observers in Cameroon have been blaming the raids on poorly trained and ill-equipped park guards, who are pitted against professional gangs of poachers.

(KUTV) An Indiana Man, one of the first people in the world to receive a face transplant, has returned to the public eye five years after the surgery.
Mitchell Hunter was 30 years old when they were badly burned while rescuing a woman from a car accident in 2001. It would be ten years before he'd have the chance to undergo surgery.
"People tell me that I'm fortunate that I don't remember, because it's probably a lot of pain," Hunter told .
Authorities say Hunter's car slammed into an electrical pole in North Carolina. Hunter pushed a woman to safety, but wasn't as lucky himself: They were shocked by 10 thousand volts for nearly five minutes, officials say.
"I look back on it as something that made me stronger. I mean, yeah, I'd like to have my leg and my face back, but without that happening I wouldn't be who I am today," said Hunter of the crash.
Nearly five years after their surgery, they say their life has returned to normal; they have a full-time job and can take their son to the movies.
In 2011, Hunter become one of the first people in the world to be given a new face by a donor.
"It's a lot easier to go out in public, I will tell you that," they said.
After years of silence, they hope others don't keep quiet; Hunter says now, more than ever, they know how quickly life can change.
"Live life," they urged. "Tell the people you love, that you love them because you never know when that can be taken away."

Microsoft today released early builds of its Office suite designed for Windows 10, software that is designed to accept touch input and work across tablets and phones. Office 2016, the desktop edition of Office, will also ship this year.
Windows 10, of course, is Microsoft's new operating system that is designed to work across every device category and screen size. The move to harmonize its operating system platform will allow it to offer a larger user base to developers, which might make creating apps for its software more enticing.
You can snag the new apps in the Store, or here, here, and here.
The introduction of a touch-friendly build for Windows comes after the company announced versions of Office for Android and iOS. Users of its own platform were not entirely enthused. The cross-platform, touch-friendly build of Office for Windows that is now partially released wouldn't have made sense before Windows 10 existed — it will function on both phones and tablets, something that Windows 10's predecessor, Windows 8, did not handle.

“No art to this deal: What kind of ‘tough negotiator' goes into talks undermining their country's own position, as you did attack US intel?” Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, tweeted Sunday.

“I strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. They vehemently denied it. I've already given my opinion…..” Trump tweeted.
Trump has not publicly said if they believe that Russia interfered in the election, saying that “nobody really knows for sure” if the country is responsible for election meddling.
Schiff blasted Trump last Thursday for saying they aren't sure if Russia interfered in the election, saying the comments "continue to directly undermine U.S. interests."

Police are investigating after a 17-year-old girl says a man stopped and offered them a ride — then got out of their car and stood there, asking if they were sure.
The teen was walking in the 400 block of Hamilton Avenue, just north of Silver Avenue, at 9:25 a.m. Saturday, police said.
They told police a grey, four-door car pulled up from behind them and stopped a short distance in front of them
The driver of the car rolled down their window and offered a ride, police said.
When they said no, the man reportedly got out of their car and asked if they were sure they didn't want a ride. The teenager told police that they closed their door and remained outside the vehicle. That's when they ran, and called police.
The man is described as about 40 years old, with light brown skin and a medium build.  They are approximately five-foot-nine tall with short black hair and a short, black, thick beard. They were wearing a black jacket. They did not have an accent, police said.
Police said they have limited information about the incident but are investigating.
The vehicle is described as an older model four-door grey car with a "boxy" design, black handles and black trim. The girl did not get the car's licence plate.
Admid conflict in Wisconsin over labor rights, a report highlights the salaries of union leaders. Report: Union heads make six figures
As the standoff between unions and Wisconsin Republicans wages on, an analysis of the nation's 10 largest labor unions shows some top leaders — who are being derided as “union bosses” — make six-figure salaries funded by members' dues.
Leaders earned between $173,000 and $618,000 at major unions, the Center for Public Integrity found in examining 2009 tax records, with some groups paying dozens of employees in the six figures. At the three major unions , which together represent more than 5.6 million public workers, presidents' salaries in 2009 ranged between $400,000 and $500,000.
Story Continued Below
Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, was paid $479,328 in salary and benefits in 2009. They were one of 10 employees of the 1.5 million-member union who made more than $200,000 that year.
At the 3.2 million-member National Education Association, President Dennis Van Roekel made $397,721 in salary and benefits in 2009. Thirty other officers and employees of the nation's largest teachers' union made more than $200,000 that year. Public school teachers, by comparison, were paid a national average of $54,319 in 2009.
The American Federation of Teachers, a smaller teachers' union, paid President Randi Weingarten $428,384 in salary and benefits. Eight others at the 887,000-member union, which also represents college faculty and school support staff, earned more than $200,000 in 2009.
Republicans have worked to separate union members from the leaders of their organizations, arguing that the “union bosses” who represent public workers aren't looking after the best interests of their members. Salaries that are far larger for union leaders than for their members don't convey the image that their leaders are on the side of workers, GOP lawmakers say.
“When they say it's about worker rights, it's really about big union bosses running their own political dynasties,” Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said last week. Union political action committees and employees spent $400 million in support of President Barack Obama's campaign in 2008 and another $280 million supporting Democratic candidates in 2010.
Last month, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said that while their state's unions “think I'm attacking them,” he's not. “I'm attacking the leadership of the unions because they're greedy; they're selfish.”
The Republican National Committee began airing a TV advertisement in Wisconsin on Wednesday that blasts “Obama and the union bosses” for “standing in the way of economic reform.”
Pochettino must be allowed to build a legacy at Tottenham, says Walker
Kyle Walker has heaped praise on Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino (above) PA Wire/Press Association Images
Kyle Walker says it is “vital” for Tottenham that Mauricio Pochettino stays for the long-term as they prepare to take charge of their 100th game at the club.
Share Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in.
Spurs' head coach will reach their century when the Lilywhites face Borussia Dortmund in the first leg of their last-16 Europa League tie in Germany on Thursday night – and Walker hopes the Argentine will be in charge for many years, highlighting the value of their man-management skills in particular.
Asked how important it is that Pochettino has another 100 or 200 games at Tottenham, Walker said: “It's vital. We've built a foundation now.
“We don't need managers coming and going. They did well at Southampton and he's come here and done well so he's proved he's a very good manager.
“His door is always open. You hear it a lot with players saying this about a manager but, really, their door is always open. Whenever you want to talk to them about something, you can knock on their door, even if it's not about football.
“If you're having problems at home or you're having problems, anything. You can knock on their door, sit, talk and it just takes the weight off your shoulders to know ‘he's behind me, they know how I'm feeling'. That's it. Some managers are different, let's put it that way, but this manager is a very good man-manager.”
Walker added: “He has been in the game, played the game, which always helps. They know how you feel and what goes on in your head when maybe you don't play as much as you want to – and I think everyone feels equal. If you're starting every week or not playing as much as you want to play, they make everyone feel equal.
“He doesn't just concentrate on the XI who are playing and talk to them, have banter with them. It's the whole squad, and that's even the players who travel and sometimes don't even get on the bench. Everyone feels welcome, everyone feels part of the team.”
Player development is important to Pochettino, who has previously stressed that their job title is ‘head coach' rather than ‘manager' – and there has been a noticeable improvement from a large number of Spurs' players, which has resulted in a collective progress and a move up the table into the title race.
“It's training, and what they demand,” said Walker. “You have to be 100 per cent and, if not, you're found out. If you get found out they will probably pull you into their office and say ‘what's the matter with you?' or you won't play the next game.
“You need to be 110 per cent and when the team is flying, everyone wants that shirt. If you don't put it in in training, I can assure you that you won't play at the weekend.”
Canvassers out today on a frantic door-knock to get their vote out will often hear that heart-sinking refrain: “What's the point? Voting makes no difference.” Or “I'm not political”, as if it were an optional hobby. Earnest volunteers may want to wring the necks of the apathetic, the clueless and the idle who are so hopelessly indifferent to the value of democracy.
But pause a moment and consider how right people are to be dubious. Whether they precisely know it or not, phlegmatic non-voters may intuit how useless most votes will be today. Under our grotesque voting system very few ballot papers will make a difference to the result.
In 2015 the Conservatives won with a seven-point lead, but so distorted is our electoral system that the Electoral Reform Society says if just 639 voters in only six Tory seats had switched their vote from Tory to Labour, there would have been a hung parliament. Just 639!
First-time voter? Here's everything you need to know in one handy guide | Hannah Jane Parkinson Read more
Another shocking figure: last time 74% of votes were wasted, in that they failed to make a difference to the outcome. Most people simply added to a stack of votes, useless once the winning number was reached, or else they voted for a losing candidate, so 22m votes were wasted.
Most seats are “safe”, some since the dawn of democracy: 103 Tory seats and 67 Labour seats have never changed hands since 1945, some not since Victorian times.
Abandoning first past the post for a proportional system could make everyone's vote count. Grouping constituencies together in, say, six member seats, means most would be represented by at least one MP of their choice. As it is, what benefit-recipient on the sharp end of sanctions feels they will get a sympathetic hearing from their Tory MP? A rich family wrangling over inheritance tax with HMRC rightly or wrongly may feel they will get low priority from a Labour MP.
Today, an estimated 20% of voters will go to the polls wearing nose-pegs, forced to vote tactically for a party they don't support, just to keep out the one they hate most. If allowed a second choice, they could vote with their hearts for their true beliefs and still have a back-stop second choice. New parties would have a chance: small parties will be crushed today.
Instead, sneaked into the Conservative manifesto is an extraordinary plan to spread the first-past-the-post system to mayoral, police and crime commissioners and even to the London assembly, removing second preferences, meaning less legitimacy for the winner. If there is any such move, it's time to demand a constitutional convention to examine the whole tottering structure, from the House of Lords to local government powers.
Look how money contaminates politics, likely to emerge as even more monstrous this election: latest Electoral Commission figures in this campaign show Tories raking in 10 times more large donations (those of more than £7,500) than Labour. Money matters, and voters know it, 77% saying donors have too much power. A majority – 57% – for the first time now support state funding of politics, to stop business seeking favours and trade union barons leaning on Labour. (Unite's Len McCluskey commands vital donations, though themselves was elected on a turnout of just over 12%). Apart from Luxembourg, Britain has the least state funding of politics among 15 European countries, just 18%; the rest has to be raised from donors.
The multiple dysfunctions of our corrupted democracy make it hard to argue on the doorstep that politics is noble
A constitutional convention would surely make registering and voting easier, instead of leaving it to the self-interest of governments. Yet again 15% are not registered today – the young, renters and ethnic minority people mostly. Of course people should vote electronically: many countries facilitate this, and if it's safe enough for banking, it's safe for voting. Time to give 16-year-olds the vote: make it compulsory for first-timers, so they get the habit. How good it would be to see candidates beg for votes in sixth-form colleges as well as retirement homes, to shift funding fairly between generations.
The multiple dysfunctions of our corrupted democracy make it hard to argue on the doorstep that politics is noble – though I respect most politicians for taking up what is for many a thankless task, with very few, brief moments when any feel they have the power to make something happen.
Don't hold your breath for change, however blindingly obvious the need. There will be no constitutional convention unless some gigantic scandal forces it, or until enough people are indignant enough. Tories see reform as a leftist plot, a progressive alliance conspiracy against Toryism: look how they sabotaged the alternative vote referendum in 2011. Until Ed Miliband, Labour resisted reform just as fiercely. The language and rhetoric of reformers needs to change: until they persuade Tories that this is about democratic fairness, not an anti-Tory fix, nothing will happen any time soon.
Bill Self isn't happy with junior wing Brannen Greene once again. This time it's because Greene ended Kansas' 77-59 victory over in-state rival Kansas State with a dunk as time was expiring and the shot clock was off.
Here's something you don't hear a college coach say about one of their kids every day:
On the radio, Bill Self just called Brannen Greene's dunk as time expired a "dick move." Wow. Now that's a coach calling out a player. — Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) February 4, 2016
Matt Galloway of the Topeka Capital Journal elaborated on Self's radio interview, and proceeded to apologize to Kansas State and its fans.
"Brannen Greene, we've put up with them doing some stuff in the past, but that was probably the biggest dick move I've ever had a player do during a game," Self said. "To dunk the ball like that when the other team — even their players are going, 'How disrespectful to the game.'"
Here's the play is Self is so upset about.
Greene was suspended by Self for six games earlier this year that stemmed from an argument over playing time following Kansas' loss to Michigan State in November. That meant Greene couldn't fly with their teammates to Hawaii for the Maui Invitational.
Greene played only six minutes in the game vs. Kansas State, but made all three shots they took from the field to finish with eight points.
This marlin was too tough for one of the boats in the West Coast Fishing Club. Courtesy West Coast Fishing Club
On January 18, 2013, one of the West Coast Fishing Club's offshore marlin boats, Abundancia, capsized in the Gulf of Panama after an angler on board hooked into an extremely aggressive black marlin estimated to weigh more than 500 pounds. All four crew members and guests on board were uninjured and were swiftly pulled from the water by another West Coast Fishing Club vessel operating alongside.

The accident was the result of a rapid and extraordinary series of occurrences which took place within one minute after the fish's high-speed strike. “We are relieved to report that the anglers, the captain and crew were all evacuated from the vessel without injury or loss of life, thanks to the quick response by the captain and crew of one of our other boats,” says West Coast Fishing Club vice president Brian Grange. “Our practice has always been to fish within sight or radio contact with a sister vessel, and in this case, one of our other boats was very close by, which enabled an immediate response."

The marlin was initially spotted by the crew of the West Coast Fishing Club companion boat as it rocketed past on the surface of the water in pursuit of bait being trolled by Abundancia. In anticipation of having a rare opportunity to photograph the actual strike of a prized black marlin, a guest on board the companion boat seized a camera and captured the dramatic sequence of events. Approximately 60 seconds later, the crew went to the aid of the listing vessel and immediately retrieved all passengers.

The angler in the chair at the time that these amazing pictures were taken, Dave Saenz, believes the fish was somewhere between 500 and 600 pounds, and described it as “extremely acrobatic, which certainly adds to the adrenaline rush.” They went on to say that “it all happened so fast, but the memory will last a lifetime.”

Facebook already handles your social life; now it wants to handle your money. Hacked screenshots leaked in October show a hidden payment option inside Facebook's popular Messenger app, which is currently used by 200 million people around the world. The feature would let ordinary users—but not retailers or companies—send money to one another in a message using debit card information. (Facebook hasn't commented on the hack or on when it might activate the service.)
The big question here is, why would Facebook—the world's largest social network, worth an estimated $200 billion—even consider going down this road at all? Existing peer-to-peer payment apps are generally free to use, i.e. there's no immediate profit to gain for the service provider. And rumor has it that Facebook Messenger's version will be free, too, at least initially. It's even been reported that Square Cash, a similar service from Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, actually loses Square around 25 cents each time it's used, since someone has to swallow the debit card transfer fees charged by the banks.
The answer lies in the fact that Facebook knows its current foray into payments could result in a potentially enormous longer-term payoff. The social network may be gearing up for a future showdown with the world's largest credit card companies, with a potentially massive jackpot at stake: the $40-$50 billion a year (in the U.S. alone) that credit card-issuing banks make off the so-called interchange rate, i.e. the hefty transaction fee that merchants have to cough up whenever customers use credit cards.
But do a few hacked screenshots really spell the upheaval of the entire payments industry?
Maybe. For starters, Facebook hasn't exactly been coy about its interest in payments. Back in June, the company poached PayPal president and payments guru David Marcus to head up Messenger, a move that now makes a lot of sense. Meanwhile, in a Q2 earnings call, as reported in TechCrunch, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was quite explicit in saying that “over time there will be some overlap between [Messenger] and payments.” The groundwork for a Facebook payment service, in other words, has already been laid.
But—and here's where things get really interesting—there's nothing stopping Facebook from ultimately opening up the payment service to merchants, as well, allowing them to accept debit card payments from customers via Messenger. (Zuckerberg has hinted as much, noting that the planned tool will ultimately “help people share with each other and interact with businesses.”) For merchants, this would have some huge advantages. While credit cards, not to mention PayPal, Stripe, Square and other services, all charge interchange fees ranging from around 2- to 4-percent of total purchase price (an amount considered exorbitant by critics), debit card swipe fees in the U.S. are currently capped at a mere 21 cents.
With this kind of savings hanging in the balance, it's not difficult to imagine millions of merchants and potentially hundreds of millions of consumers signing on. Consider that there are currently 79 million MasterCard credit card holders in the U.S.—a sizeable number. But there are nearly 200 million monthly active Facebook users in the country. Facebook, in other words, has the potential to create a payment network that rivals—and, in some cases, dwarfs—the major credit cards, virtually overnight.
Once merchants and consumers are hooked, Facebook may ultimately turn its focus to profits. Again, Zuckerberg has already signalled this aspiration, explaining to revenue-hungry investors in July that the company is planning “to take the time to do this in the way that is going to be right over multiple years.” With credit card interchange fees currently set so high, Facebook would have plenty of room to make money from merchants while still undercutting traditional credit cards by a wide margin. If the network were to eventually charge a $1 fee (as has been suggested) or even retain just a fraction of a percent of each transaction, the revenue stream could be enormous.
All of this might seem a bit far-fetched, if some of tech's biggest players weren't already pursuing similar strategies. Last week, for instance, rising ephemeral social network Snapchat teamed up with Square to launch Snapcash (via a snappy little video). The new feature allows Snapchat's 100 million users to quickly and seamlessly send cash to one another after a one-time process of adding bank details to their existing profiles.
Meanwhile, in September, Apple unveiled Apple Pay, a mobile wallet app that lets users store credit card information and then “tap and pay” with their iPhones. For the moment, Apple is content to act as something of a middleman in this process, making it easier for customers to use their existing credit cards while collecting a tiny fee from the banks in the process. But with time, consumers and merchants may get used to the idea of using Apple for their transactions, with credit cards playing an ever diminishing role and—maybe one day—slipping out of the picture entirely.
What's clear from these efforts is that the stodgy old payments space, dominated for so long by traditional banks and their credit cards, is finally beginning to face some serious challengers. The good news for consumers and merchants, is that there's much to gain and little to lose aside from high fees as the payments race heats up over the next few years. It's all pretty exciting stuff.

Del. Bob Marshall Fails to Start Impeachment Process over AG Herring's Same-sex Marriage Stance
"The failure of the republican leadership to address their first violation of the constitution has lead to more [violations]"
Delegate Bob Marshall submitted a resolution to begin the impeachment inquiry process against Attorney General Mark Herring last week, but Republican leadership blocked the effort.
Marshall had hinted at impeaching Herring since the AG first announced they would not defend the state's same-sex marriage ban in court earlier this year. The effort last week came after Marshall attended the Fourth Circuit hearing against the state's ban. That's when they realized Herring was going to “carry through with it.”
“[Herring] wants to change the tax-deductibility laws as well, and in addition, they decide they can identify and authorize who gets instate tuition,” Marshall said explaining the numerous instances Herring had violated the law to their understanding.
House Speaker Bill Howell (R) immediately denied Marshall's resolution when it was first submitted and released a short statement saying they “does not believe impeachment is an appropriate or practical recourse at the moment.”
Marshall then blamed their own party's higher-ups for not challenging the AG's actions. “The failure of the republican leadership to address their first violation of the constitution has led to more [violations].”
Marshall had hoped the impeachment inquiry would have “the other delegates look and see if Mark Herring is following the procedures proscribed of them in the Virginia constitution.”
Though they admit they “didn't calculate” the possibility of their resolution being turned down.
“I make a decision based on the facts and the law” they said explaining they don't take into account external support when coming up with these resolutions. “Mark herring has crossed a line and they ought to be confronted, and if republican leaders are too weak to do that, shame on them.”
Marshall is one of the authors of VA's 2006 ban on same-sex marriage, the Marshall Newman Amendment, and has since staunchly opposed any attempts to expand LGBTQ-equality related bills in the General Assembly.
They started a petition to help build support for their impeachment inquiry, however the site was taken down after opponents inundated it with what Marshall called “vile cuss words” and “suggestions that where gross and demeaning.”
“The first amendment rights of people to petition their leaders over a grievance has been abridged by people who support so-called same-sex marriage,” said Marshall.
Marshall's plea for public support included referring to same-sex marriage as “same-sex sodomy marriage” and suggesting lawyer Ted Olson, one of the lawyers for the challenge against the VA's same-sex marriage ban, is in a race to be the first lawyer responsible for removing “all standards against same sex or sodomy “marriage” in America, to the detriment of children and the well-being of society.”
Marshall goes on to defend their opposition by saying the 14th Amendment's equal protections clause of the Constitution is not a usable argument because sodomy was a felony in nearly every state when the amendment was ratified.
AG Herring's office was unabashed in their criticism of Marshall's impeachment attempted, saying “A small handful of legislators seem to remain oblivious as to how the law works.”
“The role of the Attorney General, and the publicly stated opinion of top legal scholars, including the author of Virginia's modern Constitution, who said Attorney General Herring's actions in the marriage equality case have been appropriate,” said AG Herring in a statement released last week.
“It's our hope that this political gambit doesn't distract or take away momentum from the important work before the General Assembly, including the passage of a state budget as soon as possible.”

A single-engine, Piper PA28 airplane crashed underneath a Moanalua Freeway bridge in Mapunapuna early Friday afternoon, seriously injuring the three men on board.
Shayne Enright, spokesperson for the city Emergency Medical Services, said the three men, in their 20s, were all taken to a trauma center in serious condition but suffered no major injuries.
Federal Aviation Administration spokesperson Allen Kenitzer said the plane “crashed under unknown circumstances.”
All lanes of the Moanalua Freeway, above the crash site, remained open.
The plane was manufactured in 1971 and registered to Jahn P. Mueller of Honolulu, according to FAA records.
Monique Bardo, director of operations for Ballard Mortuaries, was outside when they saw the plane flying above the canal then suddenly crash and explode underneath a bridge that crosses the water.
“The pilot got everybody out,” Bardo said. “It was right in the canal when it crashed. It was really loud. There was lots of black smoke that went all over the (Moanalua) freeway.
The mortuary, which is separated by a chain link fence from the crash site, was full of employees and mourners, they said.
“My gosh, it was so spooky,” Bardo said.
Honolulu firefighters received a report of a downed plane around 1:25 p.m., said Fire Capt. David Jenkins.
Kenitzer said the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board will investigate.
This month's long-anticipated release of the most recent chapter in the Star Wars saga will no doubt captivate audiences with scenes of futuristic spacecraft skirmishing in a sub-orbital dogfight, their pilots' hands firmly on the controls, as they have been since the very first aerial combat. Yet researchers at Honeywell are working on something even diehard science fiction fans would find astonishing: an aircraft control system that responds to mental commands. At the recent NBAA Convention in Las Vegas, guests at the company's annual Aviation Forecast dinner were able to gaze into the engine and avionics manufacturer's “crystal ball” and see technologies that it believes are on the horizon, among them trans-cranial neural sensing and characterization, which receives and analyzes faint signals from parts of the brain near the skull, using a specialized headset.
The company initially developed the technology in conjunction with one of the U.S. intelligence agencies in the early 2000s to enhance analysts' ability to sort through reams of satellite images looking for specific “targets of interest.” The human mind can recognize images faster than it can process them; the sensors were able to determine a match on images that flashed at speeds of up to 15 per second. According to Bob Witwer, Honeywell's vice president of advanced technology, use of the system raised the analysts' throughput as much as ten-fold.
Human-machine Interface
With that experience in mind, researchers began to look for other applications such as the ways humans interact with machines. “One of the things that we're really focused on at Honeywell Aerospace, and certainly with my team, is recognizing that we've got more human-machine interface modalities available to us than we've ever had before,” Witwer told AIN. “People expect to be able to interact with a computer in some cases by touching or by using their voice, so neural technology from that point of view is just another potential modality for interacting with machines.”
The Arizona-based company has applied that technology to aircraft controls for more than a decade, with tests first on a Boeing 737 flight simulator and then this summer in actual flight-testing on one of its modified King Airs. The research has been successful, with the company conducting 10 flights thus far. In each case, the pilot was trained to associate patterns of lights flashing on a control panel grid with the desired movement of the airplane. When their brain recognizes the flash of the lights across the top of the grid, for example matching their intention of making the aircraft climb, the neural-sensing headset reads that faint recognition signal and translates it to the aircraft controls.
Given this is just a demonstration of the neural sensing capability, the Honeywell advanced technology staff is still feeling its way regarding the best means of interaction. “I don't know that this would be the specific implementation that we would use,” explained Witwer. “In fact, it wouldn't be my preference because having lights flash in a cockpit is not something pilots normally like to see.” Another set of experiments set to begin this spring will attempt to sample impulses from another brain structure, the supplementary motor cortex, where the mind plans movement. “What if I imagine that I'm going to move my left elbow up, and if I move my left elbow up that means I want the airplane to bank to the right?” Witwer said. “You don't have to move anything; you just imagine the movement. We start that in the supplementary motor cortex and then we can control the airplane.”
Witwer stresses that these modalities are not necessarily the direction Honeywell is moving in terms of primary human-machine interfaces. Rather, they could have application in a supplementary or even emergency capacity, where the instantaneous recognition of an abnormality and response could help avert further danger.
“Even though it sounds really cool, like science fiction, the truth is from our point of view, most of the stuff that we are doing in our industry today was science fiction at some point in the not-so-distant past,” said Witwer, noting that such now commonplace advances as GPS, cellphones and personal tablet computers did not exist when they joined the industry in 1980.
Newly redesigned job resource centers will open throughout Los Angeles this summer with shift in focus to training job seekers for growing industries such as healthcare, advanced manufacturing and logistics, city officials said today.
Mayor Eric Garcetti said the revamped WorkSource Centers “will focus on making sure Angelenos are prepared to compete in today's job market.”

“Our redesigned system will better provide supportive services and access to career pathways to ensure our local workforce is ready for the jobs in L.A.'s top growth industries,” they said.
The city is set to unveil 17 WorkSource Centers starting July 1, according to Jan Perry, general manager of the Economic and Workforce Development Department.
The specific locations of the centers, which will be in areas with especially high poverty and chronic unemployment, will be announced before the program's launch, officials said.
The new program will “prepare and support adult job seekers in their effort to find employment that will provide a living wage job and career opportunities,” Perry said.
Under the new system, job centers organized around training workers for specific industries will replace centers that traditionally have offered employment listings and resume writing assistance to people living nearby, Perry said.
The new job centers will also provide its services online, they said.
People with disabilities, the homeless, veterans, English language learners, older adult workers and formerly incarcerated individuals or people with prior convictions will also get more attention at the new centers, according to city officials.
The Los Angeles City Council this week signed off on $90 million in contracts to operators to run the WorkSource Centers for the next five years, with annual reviews to renew the contracts.
The funding for the program comes from the federal Workforce Investment Act.
Artificial Intelligence has always been hyped by its often charismatic enthusiasts; lately it seems that the hype may be coming true. Media pundits, technologists, and increasingly the broader public see the rise of artificial intelligence as inevitable. Companies with mass data fed into AI systems — like Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and others — make headlines with technological successes that were science fiction even a decade ago: we can talk to our phones, get recommendations that are personalized to our interests, and may even ride around in cars driven by computers soon. The world has changed, and AI is a big part of why.
As one might expect, pundits and technologists talk about the "AI revolution" in the most glowing terms, equating advances in computer tech with advances in humanity: standards of living, access to knowledge, and a spate of emerging systems and applications ranging from improved hearing and vision aids for the impaired, to the cheaper manufacture of goods, to better recommendations from Amazon, Netflix, Pandora, and others. Artificial Intelligence is a measuring rod for progress, scientifically, technologically, and even socially.
But technological progress cuts both ways. Not surprisingly, the excitement about coming artificial intelligence has inspired worrisome and cautionary commentary about the potential downside. This downside, like the upside, is expressed in stark and emotional terms. Nick Bostrom's 2014 bestseller, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies, warns that AI could spell the end of humanity (literally). And the former IBM researcher turned e-marketing CEO Louis Del Monte, in their 2013 book, The Artificial Intelligence Revolution: Will Artificial Intelligence Serve Us or Replace Us?, agrees that AI is happening so fast that the changes could be cataclysmic. National Geographic writer and filmmaker William Barrat, too, joined the fray in full-apocalyptic mode in Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era.

Silicon Valley sells progress, and so it's no wonder that the Valley has generally embraced the positive hype about artificial intelligence today. Hopeful new start-ups bang the drum of AI, and expect to ride some of the wave of excitement into venture capital and future success. Yet an eclectic bunch of investors and iconoclasts in the Valley have also plummeted head long into worries over AI coming too soon, and changing human society too fast. Most of those concerns focus on the singularity, a soon-to-arrive crossover point in the affairs of man and machine, where machines overtake human intelligence, and we cease to be the most interesting feature of the planet.
Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, has openly speculated that humans could be reduced to "pets" by the coming superintelligent machines. Musk has donated $10 million to the Future of Life Institute, in a self-described bid to help stave off the development of "killer robots." At Berkeley, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) is dedicated to addressing what Bostrom and many others describe as an "existential threat" to humanity, eclipsing previous (and ongoing) concerns about the climate, a nuclear holocaust, and other major denizens of our modern life. Luminaries like Stephen Hawking and Bill Gates have also commented on the scariness of artificial intelligence.
The idea that AI represents a clear and present danger has an old pedigree. As far back as 2000, Bill Joy, the former chief technology officer of now-defunct Sun Microsystems, penned one of the most famous apocalyptic rants about the threat to humanity from AI ever, in their article "Why the Future Doesn't Need Us" — published by (who else?) Wired, and widely discussed as the new century began. Yet the message was drowned out by more palpable worries: the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Today, over a decade later, Joy's anxiety over killer robots, made possible by rapid advances in AI, is back. It competes now with encomiums to AI as the milestone of our future success.
Overly ebullient discussion of smart gadgets and AI has always adorned the glossy pages of magazines like Wired. Of late, however, the once seemingly academic and speculative subject has spread to major media, too. The New York Times worries about "Artificial Intelligence as a Threat," in a November 2014 article (curiously appearing in Fashion and Style). John Markoff, a technology writer for the Times, has written dozens of articles on the topic, with titles leaving little to the imagination: "The Rapid Advance of Artificial Intelligence," to pick one. Many other media outlets publish similar stories. AI, it seems, is coming — and fast.
Media attention isn't limited to magazines and media publications. Nonfiction books about the positive potential of AI have also exploded in recent years. Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, both of MIT's Center for Digital Business and the Sloan School of Management, argue in their 2014 book, The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies, that we're rapidly entering a new era altogether, as machines begin assuming roles that were once the sole purview of humans. From robotics in manufacturing to personalization on the web, AI is changing the landscape of the new economy, they argue. Mostly, the machine age is a benefit, as boring or dangerous jobs are passed off to machines, and interesting work is helped along by intelligent computing assistants. Artificial Intelligence is upon us, say Brynjolfsson and McAfee, but it's basically wonderful news: for business, for our standards of living, and for the future of humanity.
Both the Pollyanna vision of Brynjolfsson and McAfee, and the Apocalyptico of Musk and other doomsayers assume a premise that remains contestable: that Artificial Intelligence is coming quickly, and that the evidence for truly intelligent computers is compelling. Is it?
Scientifically, the idea that computing power driving modern "smart" technologies like Siri, or Google Now, or even self-driving cars, constitutes evidence of genuine, human-like intelligence is far more contestable than much of the current discussion admits. Major challenges remain, as scientists like Berkeley's machine learning maestro, Michael Jordan, pointed out recently in their introduction on Big Data and AI in the National Research Council's 2013 report "Frontiers in Massive Data Analysis." Jordan raises technical challenges, but other detractors are more philosophical. Humanists, call them. New Humanists. Their voices are strong, sensible, and increasingly (perhaps ironically): popular.
Former Harvard Business Review editor Nicholas Carr wrote a cautionary tale on the creeping automation of daily life last year. And technology expert Jaron Lanier's You Are Not a Gadget (2010), along with their follow-up, Who Owns the Future?, expound themes profoundly skeptical of recent claims about a coming AI. The complaint centers on visions of our future that don't include us. It's a return of Humanism, in other words, in the eye of a storm about increasingly personable machines. Carr and Lanier are notoriously skeptical of technological progress generally, but neither are Luddites (Lanier is one of the original pioneers of virtual reality software). What they hold in common is a firm belief that "artificial intelligence" is a misnomer — real intelligence comes from human minds — and a conviction that a fascination with computer intelligence tends to diminish and even imperil human intelligence.
Lanier, Carr, and a growing counter-culture movement of writers and technologists, skeptical of what they see as a mythology about artificial intelligence that's akin to a new and false religion, point out the virtue of human intelligence and the importance of a human-centered view of our future.
Carr sounded an initial salvo in this countermovement, in a 2007 article in The Atlantic, titled "Is Google Making Us Stupid?" The article triggered uproar, but also a discussion about the role of technology in our lives, even as the excitement about the web neared a fever pitch. Backlash from tech pundits was rapid; Carr's points directed at a commonsense public, though, seemed timely and poignant. "Are we spending too much time online?" And: "Is our digital obsession with all things Internet distracting us from more serious and noble pursuits?" (Like, say, picking up that old copy of Moby Dick, and finally finishing it?) Implicit in Carr's discussion was the idea that computation was, after all, mere automation, and automating something, no matter how "smart" it seems, can't capture and can't replace our own, human experiences. Carr began a discussion that has continued in recent years, paradoxically in the shadow of burgeoning discussion about AI — both the Pollyanas, and the Apocalyptos.
The success of Carr's early Atlantic piece led straightaway to their bestselling book, The Shallows, which also earned Carr a finalist spot for the Pulitzer. Other humanistic-minded authors, too, began appearing around the time of Carr's article. Seemingly disparate, they nonetheless shared a common idea: Digital technology isn't becoming smart in the way people are. It's our smarts that ultimately count; our technological tools can't save us (or, neither, by "coming alive" against our wills, destroy us). Humanists like Carr disagree profoundly with any discussion about AI that tends to glorify tools at the expense of people. The smart robots premise is titillating, yet in the real world these narratives can be harmful. (More on that in a minute.)
The ranks of the Humanists continue to grow. Political philosopher turned motorcycle mechanic turned bestselling author Mathew Crawford wrote Shop Class as Soul Craft, a book ostensibly about the value and virtue of working with one's hands, but more deeply about the perils of forgetting oneself in a digital maze of abstractions, typified by the smart tech craze. Presupposed in Crawford's work was the same belief in the centrality of humanity — the focus on people, not machines — that inspires Carr, and Lanier's work.

Shortly after Carr's iconic diss of Google and all things Internet, Silicon Valley, too, found its humanist voice in the likes of former Valley entrepreneur Andrew Keen. Keen wrote a scathing critique of the Web as the place where literary standards go to die, in effect. The shallow "Web 2.0" fad had quickly infected journalism to its core, argued Keen: blogs, mainly, but later Facebook and Twitter, all downplaying human literary abilities, replaced with anonymous scribbles and fragments from social media, analyzed for advertising value by Big Data and AI. The machines may be impressive, said Keen, but what about our own standards? Keen's The Cult of the Amateur challenged what Lanier has called a worldview of "Cybernetic Totalism" in the modern Web that views humans as swarms of helper-bees, dutifully and mindlessly working on behalf of "the hive," our modern digital network environments, where quality is supposed to emerge from scores of anonymous people feeding increasingly powerful machines. Wikipedia is the perfect hive app, to Lanier. He's written trenchantly that the individual intelligence and expertise of contributors to Wikipedia subserves goals of the communal project. What isn't disguised — what's never disguised — is the gee-whiz aspect of the technology frameworks that make it all possible. As Lanier points out, the focus on tech, not people, nicely props the AI idea that machines are our future.
Humanists have a seemingly simple point to make, but combating advances in technology with appeals to human value is an old stratagem, and history hasn't treated it kindly. Yet the modern counter-cultural movement seems different, somehow. For one, the artificial intelligence folks have reached a kind of narrative point-of-no-return with their ideas of a singularity: the idea that smart machines are taking over is sexy and conspiratorial, but most people understand the differences between people — our minds, or souls — and the cold logic of the machines we build. The modern paradox remains: even as our technology represents a crowning enlightenment of human innovation, our narratives about the modern world increasingly make no room for us. Consciousness, as Lanier puts it provocatively, is attempting to will itself out of existence. But how can that succeed? And to the paradox: how can we both brilliantly innovate, and become unimportant, ultimately slinking away from the future, ceding it to the machine's we've built?
All this represents a profound challenge with more than a technological answer. When machine intelligence arrives (if it does), what will have happened? Computers with personalities would be akin to the discovery of alien life in other galaxies. Yet humanists argue that mindless automation will continue to get more powerful, and more pervasive, but fundamentally the world remains ours to create. Humanists thus refocus the discussion on real consequences of unbridled automation, and the diminishment of human excellence resulting from over excitement about machines.
If commonsense remains valid and computers ultimately must lack real intelligence, then hype about smart robots can only do harm, by self-consciously imperiling our own standards, and our own intelligence. Lanier suggests that when progress in artificial intelligence becomes our benchmark, we begin acting in subtle, compensatory ways that place our tools above ourselves. It's these subtle shifts away from our own natures, say the New Humanists, which lead us astray. It happens, perhaps, much like falling in love: first slowly, then all at once. The deafening silence of a world without human excellence at its center is a picture almost too chilling to entertain. If New Humanists are right, though, we're already on our way. The lesson of AI is not that the light of mind and consciousness is beginning to shine in machines, but rather the dimming of our own lights at the dawn of a new era.

Over-the-counter (OTC) cold medicine consumers in a number of states could become unwilling participants in the perpetual war against methamphetamine as legislators consider bills that would require prescriptions for OTC preparations containing pseudoephedrine, a precursor chemical used in meth manufacture. But the moves are raising alarm bells among some economists and the OTC industry, which is touting its own electronic tracking system as an alternative.
By prescription only? Maybe in Kentucky, Nevada, and Tennessee.
The sale of OTCs containing pseudoephedrine, such as Sudafed, is already restricted under the federal Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act, which went into effect in 2006. That act requires that such preparations be kept behind the counter, that customers must present ID, that purchases be entered into a logbook accessible to law enforcement, and that purchases be limited to 3.6 grams per day or 9 grams every 30 days.A number of states have enacted their own precursor tracking laws, and they were at least temporarily effective at reducing the number of meth labs. But as the Associated Press recently reported , those laws are increasingly ineffective, as meth producers enlist armies of "smurfs" to purchase products containing pseudoephedrine within legal limits, then pay them black market prices for their cold pills.Two states -- Oregon and Mississippi -- have enacted laws required prescriptions for such products and are able to point at reductions in meth lab busts as an indicator they are working. Oregon reported that meth lab busts dropped from 190 in 2005 to 12 in 2009.Now, legislators in at least three states -- Kentucky, Nevada, and Tennessee -- want to enact similar prescription laws. The Consumer Healthcare Products Association (CHPA), which represents the multi-billion dollars OTC industry, is fighting back, and it's not alone in criticizing the measures."This is just stupid," said Jeffrey Tucker, an economist at the libertarian-leaning Ludwig von Mises Institute and a long-time critic of what they call the "War on Sudafed." "It hurts innocent people and rewards the dealers. Requiring prescriptions for Sudafed will just increase the buy-sell spread between the retail price and the street price and provide an even greater incentive for people to traffic. Lawmakers may want to stop meth production, but it's not going to work. If lawmakers could snap their fingers and make everybody lead a good, healthy life, I'm sure they would, but they can't."Not only are the efforts to control pseudoephedrine counterproductive, they also harm millions of innocent consumers, Tucker said. They pointed to the effects of already existing restrictions on purchases."Before the restrictions kicked in, people were buying it to make meth, but meth usage wasn't any worse when President Bush began this than it was a decade earlier," said Tucker. "It wasn't exactly a big crisis. Only after the restrictions did meth become a major national problem, because it then became an incredibly profitable enterprise. It was now scarce, producers had reason to involve even more people, and they could afford to do so. Now, there are large communities involved in collecting Sudafed to make meth, and there is a strong incentive for producers to find even larger markets. The whole thing has backfired," they said.If governments insist on continuing down the path of trying to repress meth production by restricting access to precursors like pseudoephedrine, then requiring prescriptions is the logical next step, said Tucker."But that won't work either, because anyone can go to the clinic and get a prescription, but now the stuff will be worth its weight in gold. This is a classic case of a bad policy backfiring, with many innocent victims. There is just no end to this. We keep increasing the misery and the coercion in the name of the drug war, and it doesn't help the drug war."While Tucker questions the whole logic of drug prohibition, the CHPA accepts that logic, but is seeking to minimize harm to its members who peddle the remedies, as well as the tens of millions of consumers who use them to fend off cold and allergy symptoms. Those consumers face having to go and pay for doctor's visits in order to get something they are currently able to buy by walking up to a counter.The CHPA is pushing NPLEx , an industry-funded, real-time, electronic tracking system. The system is already in place in 12 states, including Kentucky, where the CHPA says it is blocking the sale of about 10,000 grams a month of pseudoephedrine."NPLEx is the better alternative to prescription status for PSE [pseudoepehedrine] that results in no new barriers to consumers, imposes no new costs on the healthcare system, allows the state to keep sales taxes generated by OTC PSE sales, meets the law enforcement goal of preventing illegal sales of PSE, and is provided to states and retailers at no charge," the association argues.But that's not stopping lawmakers, prodded by law enforcement, from proposing the precursor prescription bills. In Kentucky, the bill is HB 15 (with identical companion bill SB 45); in Nevada, Sen. Sheila Leslie (D-Reno) will push an as yet un-filed prescription bill, and in Tennessee, lawmakers are likely to file both a prescription bill and a competing electronic tracking bill in the next few days.For economist Tucker, lawmakers are engaged in quixotic, fruitless, and even counterproductive effort. "There are 50 different ways to make meth, and the drugs get ever more dangerous," they said. "Meth is a dreadfully dangerous drug anyway, but when you relegate it to amateurs cooking it at stoplights, it's catastrophic."America loves its stimulants, as a glance at any Starbucks filled with happy caffeine-guzzlers or convenience store aisle lined with "energy drink" products will demonstrate. Perhaps instead of trying to repress methamphetamine, we could try to regulate it. But that's a very hard sell for what is arguably the most demonized of America's demon drugs.

At long last, match.com solves the mystery of why men date younger women. 8 men reveal: “Why I date younger women”:
Ever feel like all the men your age are dating women half your age? OK, maybe not half your age, but you get the idea. What makes men attracted to younger women? Is it just about looks and our youth-centric culture? Well, that's part of it. But you might be surprised to learn the real reasons that go way beyond physical attraction: as it turns out, men are a bit more complicated than that!
I'm guessing it is because older women have had a long time to think about how they want a man to treat them. Lets see if I'm right:
It's all about the law of averages as you get older
“When you reach your late thirties, it's not so much that dating a younger woman becomes more attractive, it's just harder not to date them. The law of averages means that proportionately fewer women your age are single. But dating a woman in their twenties when you're approaching 40 is also less demanding; you're not faced with the same requirements to make a decision about your future. When your new girlfriend is 36, they expect you're thinking about the next few years, not just the next few dates.”
— Colin, 38, Chicago, IL
Well, not exactly I guess. It sounds like they would prefer to be dating older, less hot women, but no matter how hard they try they can't find any. Plus the hot young women keep throwing themselves in the way! I really feel for these guys. Where have all the older less hot women gone? Now they have to settle for young hotties. That and older women want commitment for what they gave to other guys for free when they were younger and hotter.
Lets see what the next man thinks:
Their carefree attitudes make younger women more appealing
“I'd say the allure is that younger women are less judgmental and less set in their ways. They don't have a laundry list of what they want in a partner, a career or even life just yet. Younger women are more friendly, I suppose. I think that kind of attitude appeals to thirty-something guys who want a relationship to really be on their terms.”
— Larry, 35, Edison, NJ
Wait, maybe I was right after all.
They let me embrace my inner goofball on dates
“Honestly, younger women are sometimes more open to having goofy good times than a woman who has a few years on them You can invite them to the midnight showing of Kung Fu Hustle without getting a skeptical look.”
— Mitchell, 39, Baltimore, MD
Sounds like more of the same. Women are more fun before they have a decade or more to think about what men should do for them. But can that be all?
Fewer years of dating equals less emotional baggage to carry
“The appealing thing about younger women is their outlook on life. They tend to be untainted by experiences that have hardened older women. For example, when a woman's been lied to a lot after years of dating, they always think you're lying to her, too. And that's a turn-off. Younger women are less cynical, and that's a big draw.”
— Alan*, 46 New York, NY
For those taking notes, evidently hotter women with less baggage are more enjoyable to date than the other way around. Perhaps. I think this guy might be jumping to conclusions though.
The next man weighs in:
Dating without an agenda means having more fun together
“What makes a younger woman a good catch? She's not itching to have a ring on their finger. She's interested in the here and now, in going out, in having fun. It may sound like a cliché, but it's reality. I'm not anti-marriage, I'm just anti-agenda. A younger woman seems more willing to let things take their natural course.”
— Roger, 35, New York, NY
Yet another man who thinks that younger, hotter, less demanding women are preferable. Could there be some truth to this, or is they just compensating for having a small penis?
Here's the next man:
The ego boost helps me maintain my health and vitality
“When a guy reaches a certain age, they worry they will see their youth and vitality wane. A younger woman reaffirms for me that I've still got it going on.”
— Mike, 40, Orlando, FL
Ha! That proves it. Men don't really prefer younger, hotter, nicer, less demanding women. They only date them because of their fragile male egos!
Well, we already know the answer is because the men are insecure, but we may as well hear the last one out just to be polite:
Impressing a younger date is easier
“One advantage of dating a younger woman is that you can play ‘cruise director' — i.e., show them all your secret favorite places that they probably haven't experienced yet. They're easier to impress and very willing to be escorted around. Women like it when you have a plan and it's well-executed.”
— Bill, 33, New York, NY
Sure they are easier to impress. They haven't had much time to think about how men should treat them!
The author is right, men really are complicated!

All hell broke loose last week when we noticed that Nokia's sample example comparison of their optical image stabilization video recording capabilities wasn't really filmed by a guy on a bicycle. It was really filmed by a guy on a van with what looks like professional video production equipment and lighting. Many press outlets picked this up and spun it as Nokia lying to its customers. In reality, the Lumia 920's optical image stabilization video recording may actually be just as impressive as the fake video suggests when it is finally finished, but for many, that doesn't make up for the original lie.
The interesting thing is that the most profitable tech company in the world lies to us all the time in their commercials and airs them constantly on public television. Apple is often being busted for false advertising, but they never really do anything about it. Remember when Apple claimed their screen supported “millions of colors” when it really only had a few hundred thousand? How about the lawsuits about the false advertising Apple uses in its Siri commercials?
Below is a video from gilbertjasonohuffpo of the Huffington Post that illustrates how Siri really works when you try to do the same thing that's shown in one of Apple's commercials.
Here's some more proof of Apple's false advertising in regards to the old iPhone 3G.
You've also got the “giant hand” fiasco where Apple fabricated images of a large hand holding an iPhone in order to make the phone look smaller. The 4G network connectivity claims associated with Apple's iPad have also generated some lawsuits for false advertising.
Meanwhile, how has Nokia reacted to their false advertising claims? First, they issued a public apology, then this week they've submitted to an independent ethics report to make sure they don't mess up like that again.
On the other hand, Apple's response to false advertising, at least in the case about their iPhone 3G's “Twice as fast for half the price” claim, was as follows, “Plaintiff's claims, and those of the purported class, are barred by the fact that the alleged deceptive statements were such that no reasonable person in Plaintiff's position could have reasonably relied on or misunderstood Apple's statements as claims of fact,” In other words, Apple says you're a fool for believing their advertisements.
So, that's Nokia doing their best to make things right, while Apple insults you and continues to lie in their advertisements. Which deserves more positive media attention in your opinion? Which company seems more trustworthy?
Ian Rush believes the fluid nature of Liverpool's frontline is enough to give opposition defenders nightmares.
Jürgen Klopp has regularly deployed versatile forward Roberto Firmino as a so-called 'false nine' this season, leaving the Reds lining up without a traditional centre-forward.
But the Brazilian's tendency to drop into deeper positions has left space for the likes of Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho and Sadio Mane to fill - which they have done to devastating effect thus far.
Rush has been impressed by the 'football brain' shown by LFC's attacking players in this setup, and has a degree of sympathy for those tasked with keeping them quiet.
"If you're the opposition trying to suss out Liverpool, I think it's difficult," they told Liverpoolfc.com.
"[They've got] a football brain; Firmino, Coutinho, Sturridge – when someone's in their position, they've got to look for the space in another position.
"I think that's what Liverpool are doing now. You can't say, 'He's the main striker'.
"They've got immense talent there and they seem to be gelling now because they're working as a team.
"If you're the opposition, it must be very, very difficult to judge who you're up against."
LFCTV GO: Rush praises fluid Reds attack
Liverpool are averaging 2.6 goals per game in all competitions this term, with 12 different players having got themselves on the scoresheet.
Rush says the goals were often shared out in the successful sides they were part of, and the Welshman is pleased to see the current crop doing the same.
"If you're winning games but it's only the strikers who are scoring goals, then the opposition know what to do," they added.
"When I played, we had Phil Neal getting 10 goals a season, Alan Kennedy was getting five goals a season, Mark Lawrenson would get five goals.
"When you've got defenders doing that, it all comes together."
The Reds' early momentum was halted in the second game of the season as they suffered a 2-0 defeat to Burnley at Turf Moor despite having 80 per cent of the possession.
But the club's all-time record goalscorer believes lessons were quickly learned from that frustrating afternoon, as evidenced by the results in a number of other potentially tricky encounters since.
"I'm hoping Burnley was a blessing in disguise. We know what we've got to do, we've got to be more clinical," they added.
"We beat Swansea in a game that we previously would have drawn or lost; West Brom we would also maybe have drawn or lost as well.
"We're winning now and we're up there. I think that breeds confidence and I don't think many teams at the moment will want to play against Liverpool."
It was speculated that the announcement by the Kremlin could herald the start of improved relations, which have been strained since the 2006 poisoning death of former spy Alexander Litvinenko and the Ukraine crisis, among other issues.
The Kremlin said Mr Putin and Mrs May agreed to develop a dialogue between security agencies on issues related to aviation security, and made plans for a face-to-face meeting in the "near future".
Speaking in July, Mr Putin said they were ready for "constructive dialogue" with Britain's new Prime Minister.
Mr Putin "stressed the conviction that the preservation and augmentation of the significant potential of Russian-British cooperation in various fields that has been accumulated for a long time is in the fundamental interests of the two countries".
David Cameron, the former British prime minister, had a difficult relationship at times with Mr Putin and the Russian president seemingly took delight in their EU referendum defeat.
For years, fans have been clamoring for a show based on the cult classic Marvel comic called Runaways. The series from Adrian Alphona, Christina Strain, and Brian K. Vaughn is ripe for a live-action adaption, containing all of the classic teen drama tropes and superhero dramatics that would make for compelling character dynamics and over-the-top adventures. And we're finally getting it this November on Hulu. However not much has been heard of or seen from the series being produced by Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz, though bad footage of a trailer screened at a media presentation managed to make it online. Hulu has yet to release an official trailer, waiting until closer to the release date to reveal their cards. But with less than three months until the show's premiere on the streaming platform, Hulu has provided members of the media a sneak peak at the first two episodes of the series. Be sure to check back in November for our full review of the series. We can't reveal too much about what we saw right now and spoilers are strictly forbidden, but given the quality of these two episodes fans of the Runaways have a lot to look forward to.
Slide 1/3 – Marvel Meets 'Riverdale' First of all, the story makes a few changes to those initial issues of Runaways that came out over a decade ago. These are still the same six characters we came to know and love in the comic series. Some of the changes are minor, others more significant, but the heart of Runaways beats true in these episodes. Nico, Gert, Molly, Alex, Chase, and Karolina leap from the pages, though their circumstances might be altered. Their personalities and interactions might be turned up a notch, but it only serves to make a great teen drama. Some have called it “Marvel's version of Riverdale,” and while it's not entirely inaccurate it's also not the fairest comparison. The series has more in common with Schwartz and Savage's previous work on The OC and Gossip Girl, all while bracing the fantastic elements of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Another welcome addition is the focus on the parents, who are given further development in these episodes. The series seems to be exploring their personalities and motivations as much as it will the children, but rest assured the Runaways are the stars of the show. It will at least add another layer in the generational conflict, perhaps adding more gray in the battle between ‘good' and ‘evil.'
Slide 2/3 – A Strong Cast The acting and casting are pretty spot on. Some characters have minor changes, most notably Allegra Acosta as Molly who is not as young as they are in the comic and therefore not as wily. She's still the curious troublemaker, though it comes across as endearing. Nico, Karolina, and (especially) Gert are faithful portrayals. Lyrika Okano, Virginia Gardner, and Ariela Barer play their respective roles very well. Rhenzy Feliz as Alex is slightly more morose. Gregg Sulkin's portrayal of Chase is ever the asshole, though there is a sense of untapped potential from the outset. The kids all seem like they leap from the comic pages, with the chops to back it up, but many of the parents are scene stealers. James Marsters as Victor Stein could be an early favorite, though it's hard to say at this point given their lack of screen time, but Annie Wersching and Kip Pardue steal their scenes as Leslie and Frank Dean. The amount of development given to the parents allows them to come across in more than one note, which will only serve to heighten the drama when the inevitable showdown between the Pride and the Runaways occurs.
The cover of the August issue of Kodansha's Bessatsu Friend magazine that is listed on the Amazon retailer site has revealed that Rin Mikimoto's shōjo manga series Kyō no Kira-kun (Today's Kira-kun) is getting a film adaptation that will open in Japan on February 25.
While the cover doesn't specify if the film will be live-action or anime, it does state that the issue will feature messages from Taishi Nakagawa and Marie Iitoyo regarding the film. Nakagawa starred as Kiyoshi in the live-action Prison School television series, and will play Ryōta Watari in the upcoming Your Lie in April live-action film. Iitoyo played Tsuruko in the live-action anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day special and Kira Asō in the live-action Mars television series and film.
The July issue of Bessatsu Friend had teased that the manga would have an important announcement in the August issue. The August issue will officially ship on July 13.
The story follows an eccentric girl named Nino who keeps a parrot on their shoulder and a carouser named Kira who passes their days with nonsense. Nino and Kira's houses are next to each other but they have never spoken, until one day Nino finds out Kira's secret and their fates intertwine.
Mikimoto launched the series in Bessatsu Friend in 2011, and ended the series in August 2014. Kodansha published the manga's ninth and final compiled volume in October 2014.
BILL PLASCHKE No Super Bowl cheerleaders? They say rah!
The game between the Packers and Steelers won't miss the pompoms, but their absence raises a bigger issue about the activity in general.
It will be the first time in the Super Bowl's 45 years that the game will contain no sis, no boom and no bah.
The Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers are two of the six NFL teams that do not employ cheerleaders, and the NFL said Thursday that they have no plans to bring in ringers.
The upcoming Super Bowl at Cowboys Stadium, home of the world's most famous cheerleaders and monument to all things poufy and glittering, will make history for a different reason.
"No cheerleaders this year,'' read the e-mailed answer from a league spokesperson Thursday, bringing me to my feet.
Gimme a G-O-O-D!!
With the possible exception of the baseball caps worn by quarterbacks on the sidelines, there is nothing more useless in an NFL game than a cheerleader. You can't hear them. You can barely see them. You don't need them to lead cheers that can be started by the scoreboard. You don't need them to entertain you during a halftime spent standing in line for the bathroom.
Ben-Gals? Saintsations? Please. It's no coincidence that the six teams without cheerleaders are all old-school football operations that focus only on the field, with the Packers and Steelers being joined by Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and the New York Giants.
The Packers dumped their cheerleaders after 1988 when surveys showed the customers really didn't care. They currently borrow cheerleaders from two local colleges but will not be taking them to Dallas.
The Steelers dropped the Steelerettes in 1970 with little fanfare, their spokesperson writing, "To be honest, it is just an organizational decision. I wish I had a great story for you, but that's really it.''
The Super Bowl doesn't need the pompoms, and won't miss them, but their absence raises a bigger issue about the activity in general.
If America's most popular single sporting event can survive without cheerleaders, are they still relevant anywhere?
"But you have to understand that we're talking about several different sects of cheering," protested Amanda Wade, director of Pasadena's respected Victory Cheer operation. "What's happening in the NFL and NBA is far different than what happens at other levels."
Certainly, NFL cheerleading — dancing, really — is as different from competitive cheer and supportive cheerleading as Troy Polamalu's haircut is from mine. But one cannot dodge the notion that with nobody on the sidelines urging Green Bay's Clay Matthews to "hit 'em again, hit 'em again, harder, harder," the perception of cheerleading will be taking a beating.
"Those people at the Super Bowl may have enough to look at and cheer about without cheerleaders, but that's not typical," persisted Wade. "Our industry is here to stay."
As an emerging competitive exercise — squad versus squad, which is Wade's business — cheering is indeed as athletically relevant as any other youth activity. A federal judge recently ruled it was too "underdeveloped" and "disorganized" to be considered an official college sport, but it's growing and evolving. On the day before the Super Bowl, in fact, Azusa Pacific is hosting a four-team college event that is competitive cheer disguised as "acrobatics and tumbling.
Britain is a soft target for terrorism because we Britons are too nice. This isn't a criticism: it's what makes the country such a wonderful place to live. But we are culturally ill-equipped to deal with conspiracies and extremists. The problem is that the only way to beat terrorists is to change our way of life – but that is exactly what the buggers want. So, we do as little as possible. And being British, we regard doing as little as possible as a sort of victory.
Of course, we shouldn't downplay what governments have done to fight jihadism. Since 2000 we've bombed the Middle East and averaged one new anti-terror law every two years.
But the first job of the state is to protect us, and the...

These are not arguments; they're fantasies, and we have heard them all before, often from the same people who would conform constitutional rights (notably rights for gay people and women) to their understanding of biblical law. Still, the ignorance and un-self-conscious hypocrisy that underlies rants about Shariah law are breathtaking.
Here's how Joe Brandon, the plaintiff's attorney in the Tennessee case, explains opposition to the mosque: "This Shariah-compliant facility must show they are a religious organization, which we vehemently dispute. They are a political organization with Shariah-compliant rules and regulations. Shariah and the U.S. Constitution cannot coexist."
Yes, I know Brandon is an easy target; still, their statement is worth considering. Shariah law is religious law, but because it is the law of a demonized religion associated with terrorism and anti-Americanism, Brandon can label it political, depriving it of First Amendment protections. I don't assume this is a cynical ploy. Blinded by bigotry and their notions of "true" and "false" religions, Islamaphobes may be sincere in the counter-factual belief that Islam is purely political.
That belief is essential to the claim that Shariah law can't be tolerated because it conflicts with the Constitution. Once you acknowledge that Islam is a religion and Shariah law is religious, its conflicts with secular law become arguments for, not against, religious liberty. Of course, Shariah law is inconsistent with the Constitution. So are the tenets of Catholicism, Judaism (especially orthodox Judaism), and most if not all other faiths. Indeed, lawsuits by Catholic institutions challenging health insurance requirements for contraceptive coverage rely on the alleged impossibility of reconciling Catholic articles of faith with secular legal requirements.
Religious and secular laws often conflict; that's precisely why we have a First Amendment. It provides a legal framework for ensuring that religion and government can "co-exist." If religious law were categorically subordinate to the Constitution (as Joe Brandon imagines Shariah law should be), then the Catholic Church would be required to ordain women, Orthodox Jews would have to sit together in shul, and religious groups that oppose gay marriages would be required to perform them.
It's not hard to imagine the uproar that would greet the slightest hint of official interest in violating such basic guarantees of religious liberty, especially if directed against majority or respectable, minority religious practices. It's worth remembering that unpopular religions have long been wrongly denied equal rights: In 1878, the Supreme Court denied Mormons the right to engage in polygamous marriages, which remain illegal today.
But the same principles of liberty that give religious institutions the right not to sanctify gay marriages should also give them the right to sanctify polygamous ones. The same principles that give Christians the right to build churches in Tennessee give Muslims the right to build mosques, just as it gave Mormons the right to build a prominent temple in Belmont, Massachusetts -- a temple opposed by many in town, and a temple that Mitt Romney helped build.

Going through puberty can be tough.
Fighting through it twice is even tougher.
For Naomi Hiebert, a transgender woman, that's what it felt like.
And more.
“I started transitioning shortly after coming to the University of Calgary,” says Hiebert, a software engineering student. “To put it plainly, it's going through puberty a second time. . . . as well as dealing with visibly being a member of a minority that a lot of people really don't like.”
Hiebert is no stranger to bullying.
“I honestly had a very hard time through public school,” they say. “Because my gender expression was not typical, I wasn't a proper boy that did boy things very well, as much as I sometimes tried . . . so I was an easy target.”
It wasn't until later in high school that they became involved with the LGBTQ community and has become a supporter of transgender rights at the university.
“I think it's very important for youth who may be transgender — or thinking of coming out or transitioning — to have this representation of adults who are just normal parts of the community who are transgender,” says Hiebert, “because we have a lot of representation of celebrities and documentaries about children . . . but there is generally missing that representation of people who transitioned and got on with their life.
“I think that for a lot of transgender people, that's their goal is to transition and get on with their life.”
On campus, they are an advocate for gender-neutral washrooms, a hot topic these days.
“It's a big deal that the school is deliberately going out of its way to do something for the transgender community,” says Hiebert. “It's not something you see often from big institutions.”
Even though Hiebert has experienced a lot of challenging times, there have been a lot of positive developments, too. Such as their recent engagement to their girlfriend.
“I'm very very happy and amazed at my luck,” they say. “My relationship with my family has been generally positive. It's been sometimes rocky . . . the transgender stuff they've handled quite gracefully.”
So, too, has Hiebert.
“Transition is a difficult and often painful process, and people will treat you somewhat differently if they know you've been through it,” says Hiebert. “So it's just a lot easier not to talk about. Being true to yourself and honest about who you are can be a very difficult and trying journey, but it is absolutely worth it.”
Why does New Zealand have one of the highest rates of incarceration in the developed world?
New Zealand ranks as one of the world's most peaceful countries in the Global Peace Index every year. Yet despite a strong reputation for social justice and equality, the South Pacific nation has the second highest rate of imprisonment rates in the western world.
In the past two decades, the jail population has doubled. One international study examining law and order across western nations attributes it to a "tough on crime" approach by New Zealand's political parties since the 1980's, even though crime rates are low.
Today each prisoner costs on average $94,000 to lock up and the current government has described New Zealand's prison problem as a moral and fiscal failure.
Making sure the punishment fits the crime is a widely debated subject in New Zealand but what is undeniable is the gross overrepresentation of minorities in jails.
One in two prisoners is indigenous Maori even though they only account for just 15 percent of the population. Maori are overrepresented in all sectors of the criminal justice system due to soaring rates of child poverty, school dropout, unemployment and family breakdown within indigenous communities.
Many say going to prison has become normalised in Maori society because every child has a relative who is locked up. They also claim that government agencies are failing the children of Maori prisoners, leaving them vulnerable to becoming a new generation of offenders.
Gang affiliations also play their part, providing surrogate families to disenfranchised youth. Since the 1960's, young Maori have joined the ranks of patched gangs like the Mongrel Mob and Black Power who were modelled on US bikie gangs like the Hells Angels.
Over the decades the gangs have been involved in violent crime, drug trafficking and brutal gang rapes. Both the Mongrel Mob and Black Power retain a strong presence across the country but many Maori youths are also forming their own smaller American-style street gangs.
Recently, the New Zealand prison system has introduced cultural units and innovative programmes that try to connect Maori with their families instead of the gangs and to encourage prisoners to get back in touch with their cultural ancestry by learning traditions like the Haka, a famous warrior dance.
But only half of the men in these units speak with their family and reestablishing that bond is not an easy task.
Maori leaders who have seen these programmes at work say they have little effect unless they connect inmates with community projects on the outside.
New Zealand's indigenous population is also overrepresented in reoffending rates. With half of the prisoners returning to jail within two years of their release, the government has introduced more education and addiction programmes in jail.

Over the past few months, legislative attempts to defund Planned Parenthood have flared at both the federal and state levels; these moves are clearly an attempt to shutter Planned Parenthood health centers, potentially depriving women of the contraceptive services and counseling, sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and treatment, and breast and cervical cancer screening that they provide.
Although proponents of closing Planned Parenthood argue that other providers would be easily able to fill the hole torn in the safety net, credible evidence suggests this is unlikely. In some areas, Planned Parenthood is the sole safety-net provider of contraceptive care. And even where there are other safety-net providers, they, on average, serve far fewer contraceptive clients than do sites operated by Planned Parenthood.
As this debate swirls, the Guttmacher Institute received a request from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) regarding the publicly supported contraceptive care provided by Planned Parenthood health centers across the country. To respond, Guttmacher staff conducted special tabulations of our Contraceptive Needs and Services 2010 report (the most recent year for which these data are available).
Our analysis shows unequivocally that Planned Parenthood plays a major role in delivering publicly supported contraceptive services and supplies to women who are in need of such care nationwide. In two-thirds of the 491 counties in which they are located, Planned Parenthood health centers serve at least half of all women obtaining contraceptive care from safety-net health centers. In one-fifth of the counties in which they are located, Planned Parenthood sites are the sole safety-net family planning center.
Further, the average Planned Parenthood health center serves significantly more contraceptive clients each year than do safety-net centers run by other types of providers, such as federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) or county health departments. As a result, Planned Parenthood centers serve a greater share of safety-net contraceptive clients than any other type of provider. And, Planned Parenthood sites are more likely to make contraceptive care quickly and easily accessible to the women who need it.
Contraceptive Care By The Numbers
Below are the key takeaways of Guttmacher's findings related to Planned Parenthood's provision of publicly supported contraceptive care.
Planned Parenthood health centers serve a considerable proportion of all clients obtaining contraceptive care from safety-net health centers.
In 2010, 36 percent of the 6.7 million U.S. women receiving contraceptive care from safety-net family planning health centers were served at Planned Parenthood centers. And there are some areas of the country where women rely particularly heavily on Planned Parenthood: In 18 states, Planned Parenthood health centers serve more than 40 percent of women obtaining contraceptive care from a safety-net family planning health center. In 11 of those 18 states, Planned Parenthood serves more than half the women obtaining contraceptive care from a safety-net health center.
Planned Parenthood health centers often serve most or all of the safety-net contraceptive clients in their county.
In 68 percent of counties with a Planned Parenthood site (332 counties out of 491), these sites serve at least half the women obtaining publicly supported contraceptive services from a safety-net health center. And in 21 percent of counties with a Planned Parenthood site (103 counties), Planned Parenthood serves all of the women obtaining publicly supported contraceptive services from a safety-net health center.
Exhibit 1
The majority of women who need publicly supported contraceptive care live in counties with a Planned Parenthood health center.
Almost two-thirds (64 percent) of the 19 million women in need of publicly supported contraceptive services and supplies live in counties with a Planned Parenthood health center. Moreover, 30 percent of these women live in counties where Planned Parenthood serves the majority of those obtaining publicly supported contraceptive care from the family planning safety net. (Women are considered to be in need of publicly supported contraception if they have ever had sex; are aged 13–44; are able to become pregnant; are not pregnant, postpartum, nor trying to become pregnant; and either have a family income below 250 percent of the federal poverty level or are younger than age 20.)
Planned Parenthood health centers serve a greater share of safety-net contraceptive clients than do any other types of providers.
Although Planned Parenthood health centers comprise 10 percent of publicly supported safety-net family planning centers, they serve 36 percent of clients who obtain publicly supported contraceptive services from such centers. By contrast, centers operated by health departments serve 27 percent of safety-net contraceptive clients, FQHCs serve 16 percent, sites operated by hospitals serve 8 percent, and sites operated by other agencies serve 13 percent.
On average, Planned Parenthood health centers serve many more contraceptive clients per year than do other types of safety-net providers. Planned Parenthood health centers serve an average of 2,950 contraceptive clients per year, many times more than any other type of publicly supported health center. By contrast, those operated by hospitals serve an average of 770 contraceptive clients, health departments serve an average of 750, FQHCs serve 330, and centers operated by other types of agencies serve 680 contraceptive clients each year.
Planned Parenthood health centers are more likely to facilitate women's timely access to a wide range of contraceptive services and supplies.
Planned Parenthood sites are considerably more likely to offer a broad range of contraceptive methods than sites operated by other types of agencies. Specifically, 91 percent of Planned Parenthood health centers offer at least 10 of 13 reversible contraceptive methods, compared to between 48 percent and 53 percent of sites operated by other types of agencies.
Moreover, Planned Parenthood sites are particularly likely to help women who choose oral contraceptives to get their pills without having to make an additional trip to a pharmacy: 92 percent of Planned Parenthood health centers offer oral contraceptive supplies and refills on-site, as do 86 percent of health department sites. Considerably smaller proportions of sites operated by FQHCs and other types of agencies—37 percent and 55 percent, respectively—do so.
Finally, women are often able to get the care they need more quickly from Planned Parenthood than from other types of safety-net providers. Sixty-three percent of Planned Parenthood health centers offer same-day appointments, compared to between 30 percent and 40 percent of sites operated by other types of agencies. And the average wait for an appointment at a Planned Parenthood health center is 1.8 days, whereas wait times at sites operated by other types of agencies range from 5.3 to 6.8 days.
Looking Ahead
We cannot predict whether or to what extent health centers operated by other providers could fill the significant gap in the family planning safety net that would be created if Planned Parenthood health centers were defunded – and therefore lost to the communities they serve. Certainly in the short term, it is doubtful that other providers could step up in a timely way to absorb the millions of women suddenly left without their preferred source of care and whether those providers could offer the same degree of accessible, quality contraceptive care offered by Planned Parenthood. (Indeed, Texas offers a cautionary tale; the state's family planning program for low-income women served far fewer women after Planned Parenthood health centers were cut out of the effort.)
What we do know is that women nationwide rely on Planned Parenthood health centers for the contraceptive services and supplies they need – and for women in many areas of the country, losing Planned Parenthood would mean losing their chosen provider and the only safety-net provider around.
Close to one hundred people in central China's Shaanxi province were spotted crawling along a national highway on Wednesday morning, collecting flecks of what they reportedly believed was gold.
According to local news site Huashang Net, however, the “gold” was in fact sulfur powder that was scattered along the ground as a logistics firm loaded lorries full of the foul-smelling chemical element.
Media reports describe how attempts by traffic police to disperse the crowd from the intersection of China National Highway 108 and Xinxing Road North in Mian County were “useless.”
According to a nearby business owner, people began collecting the powder at 6am; more and more people joined the frenzy and by 10am the road surface was filled with would-be gold collectors.
Order was not restored to local traffic until 4:00pm that afternoon.

Editor's note: This story originally published Sept. 22, 2016.
Update:Kevin Bell has since been charged in the crash that killed their girlfriend.
Just the other week, Kevin Bell's mother told him, "You and women don't mix. Every time you get mixed up with one, something bad happens."
Bell echoed those words as they lay in a hospital bed in Indianapolis Thursday and said, "And then, this happened."
Bell, 39, and their 37-year-old girlfriend, Nikki Reed, were driving to their home Saturday in Indiana, going there for their son's birthday party, when their 1999 Ford Explorer ran off the road near the Kentucky-Indiana border, plunged down a ravine and hit a tree.
The crash killed Reed and trapped Bell in the vehicle for three days.
"It was terrible," the Dover-area man said. "I really loved them with everything I had. I feel terrible for them family."
The two met online in May, through a dating app called MeetMe. Reed came to visit him, traveling from their Seymour, Indiana, home every other weekend to spend time with Bell. They brought their son with them sometimes, and Bell recalled spending good times with the boy and their mother at Rocky Ridge Park.
They went to Indiana for the Fourth of July. They met their mother. They fell in love with Nikki. They were getting a divorce, Bell said, and the two had plans to be together once the split was final.
This last trip, Reed drove to York County to pick Bell up because their license had been suspended. They had been caught previously driving a vehicle without registration, inspection or insurance.
They picked them up at their Newberry Township trailer park, Mountain View Terrace, Friday evening, at about 8, and they went to dinner. They had a salad, and they had a New York strip steak. They spent the night at a motel and lit out for Indiana at 5 a.m. Saturday.
They stopped to get gas and something to drink – they got some Gatorade and they got a soda – at a Speedway above Cincinnati. When they returned to the truck, Bell said they asked Reed to drive. They don't think they heard him, because they didn't say anything and climbed into the passenger seat.

As they drove, Bell said, Reed would occasionally pull out their phone to show them photos. They admonished her, saying they had to keep their eyes on the road, that showing them pictures was a distraction. They had to be careful, they said, because they recalled a truck driver telling them that that part of the highway – U.S. Route 50 – was surrounded by ravines, and one false move, you could find yourself in deep trouble.
They were close to the Indiana-Kentucky border at about 2 or 3 p.m. when it happened.
Reed pulled their phone, unbuckling their seat belt to get it out of their pocket, and showed Bell a photo. Bell glanced at it, they said, taking their eyes off the road for "a split second."
The Explorer left the road and plunged down the steep ravine, stopping when it hit a tree.
Sharp pain shot through Bell's right leg. The pain, they said, was nothing compared to what they saw in the passenger seat.
Reed was still breathing, they said. It wasn't long, though, until they stopped. They reached over and felt for a pulse, finding none. "She was gone," they said.
They began crying. They had watched life seep from the woman they had loved. They couldn't stop crying, they said. They couldn't believe it.
They tried to move, but the pain in their leg stopped him. After a while, they said, they were able to unbuckle their seat belt and climb into the back of the truck. The doors were buckled, they said. They thought the windows were intact. They couldn't move.
They cried until Monday. "I just had no more tears left," they said. "I cried all the tears I had."
They had tried to get out of the truck, but every time they moved, they said, their head spun. And then, there was their leg. Their right shin had been snapped. Their foot was swollen.
They stayed in the back of the truck for three days. They tried to sleep. They tried to gather their strength. "I was just trying to get myself together," they said.
Meanwhile, when the couple failed to show up for the birthday party, Reed's family reported them missing. On Sunday, a Newberry Township police officer knocked on the door of the trailer Bell shared with their mother, Gloria, and asked them whether Reed was there. They told them that they never met Reed, that they picked their son up at the entrance of the trailer park, and that was all they knew.
They texted their son, saying they should have been home by now. They didn't respond. They texted again: "Are you all right?" Still no response.
Bell could hear their phone vibrating – they had silenced the ringer while they were driving – but they didn't know where it was. Even after dark, when the phone vibrated, they couldn't see any light from its screen.
They still had some Gatorade and sipped from the bottle. They urinated in a water bottle, they said. There was food in the car – leftovers from the couple's Friday night dinner – but the boxes were under Reed's seat, and they couldn't get to them. They were able to reach Reed's soda.
Saturday turned into Sunday. Sunday turned into Monday. Monday turned into Tuesday.
They thought nobody was ever going to find him. They needed to get out.
Eventually, they managed to crawl from the truck. When they hit the ground, they found their phone. It was lying facedown, explaining why they couldn't see any light coming from it when somebody tried calling him.
They texted their boss at Flight Systems, an electronics plant in Lewisberry, saying they had been in an accident. Then, their battery went dead.
They gathered some of their belongings – including two, 14-pound bowling balls in their bags – and began crawling up the steep ravine. They would go a few feet and then take a break to rest. It was tough going, they said. In all, it must've taken them four, four and half hours to make the 70- or 75-foot climb to the road.
They finally made it to the guardrail and began trying to flag down a car. People kept driving by; nobody would stop. Finally, after a couple of hours, one man did stop, and Bell asked to use their phone.
"I have to call 911," they said. "I need an ambulance."
The ambulance and the police arrived. Bell was taken to a local hospital and transferred to a hospital in Indianapolis, where they had surgery to set the broken bone in their leg.
They expect to be in the hospital until Monday, they said.  They are going to require physical therapy.
Lying in their bed, they said their thoughts are never very far from Reed and their family.
"I loved her," they said. "I feel terrible about what happened."
And they said they have been thinking things over.
"After all of this is done," they said, "I'm not going to look for anybody else until I get my life straightened out.
"She had their whole life planned out for when they were divorced to be with me. Now, it'll never happen."

The video was of a panel discussion for law students interested in becoming clerks, and they were explaining the different experiences gained when working at district courts and appeals courts. Them remarks caught the eye of conservative bloggers who accused them of being a “judicial activist,” although Jonathan H. Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University law school, argued that critics were reading far too much into those remarks.
Republicans have signaled that they intend to put the eventual nominee under a microscope, and they say they were put on guard by Mr. Obama's statement that judges should have “empathy,” a word they suggest could be code for injecting liberal ideology into the law.
Judge Sotomayor has given several speeches about the importance of diversity. But their 2001 remarks at Berkeley, which were published by the Berkeley La Raza Law Journal, went further, asserting that judges' identities will affect legal outcomes.
“Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences,” they said, for jurists who are women and nonwhite, “our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging.”

Them remarks came in the context of reflecting their own life experiences as a Hispanic female judge and on how the increasing diversity on the federal bench “will have an effect on the development of the law and on judging.”
In making their argument, Judge Sotomayor sounded many cautionary notes. They said there was no uniform perspective that all women or members of a minority group have, and emphasized that they were not talking about any individual case.
They also noted that the Supreme Court was uniformly white and male when it delivered historic rulings against racial and sexual discrimination. And they said they tried to question their own “opinions, sympathies and prejudices,” and aspired to impartiality.
Still, Judge Sotomayor questioned whether achieving impartiality “is possible in all, or even, in most, cases.” They added, “And I wonder whether by ignoring our differences as women or men of color we do a disservice both to the law and society.”

They also approvingly quoted several law professors who said that “to judge is an exercise of power” and that “there is no objective stance but only a series of perspectives.”
“Personal experiences affect the facts that judges choose to see,” they said.
Charles J. Ogletree Jr., a Harvard law professor and an adviser to Mr. Obama, said Judge Sotomayor's remarks were appropriate. Professor Ogletree said it was “obvious that people's life experiences will inform their judgments in life as lawyers and judges” because law is more than “a technical exercise,” citing Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.'s famous aphorism: “The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience.”
In a forward to a 2007 book, “The International Judge” (U.P.N.E.), Judge Sotomayor seemed to put a greater emphasis on a need for judges to seek to transcend their identities, writing that “all judges have cases that touch our passions deeply, but we all struggle constantly with remaining impartial” and letting reason rule. Courts, they added, “are in large part the product of their membership and their judges' ability to think through and across their own intellectual and professional backgrounds” to find common ground.

By the end of the week, Roman Abramovich's latest bill for parking in New York City will reach $100,000. And by the time their ship sails, the tab could exceed $150,000.
Mr. Abramovich, the Russian billionaire who owns the Chelsea soccer team in London, also owns the world's largest yacht, the 533-foot Eclipse. The boat is so big that the only place to dock it in Manhattan is at the terminal on the West Side where cruise ships load and unload.
But cruise ships usually stay in port less than 12 hours. The Eclipse has been at Pier 90 since mid-February and intends to stay another month, according to a spokesperson for the city's Economic Development Corporation, which controls the terminal.
Photo
The fee for parking at the terminal is $2,000 a day, said the spokesperson, Patrick Muncie. That may sound steep, but the rate has not risen in more than two years – unlike subway fares or the charge to park a car at a meter in the city.
Providing shelter for the megayachts of Russian billionaires could be a source of significant revenue for the city, which splits the fee evenly with the company that operates the terminal, Ports America.
The Eclipse is reputed to be decked out with three helipads, a submarine and a swimming pool whose bottom can be raised for use as a dance floor. Its construction cost has been estimated at more than $500 million.
In November 2011, the 440-foot yacht Serene parked at the terminal for several days. It was the first personal boat to do so, according to the development corporation. Boating publications have reported that the Serene, whose unusual features include an indoor saltwater pool and a room in which it snows, belongs to Yuri Shefler, whose company distributes Stolichnaya vodka.
The Serene's owner also was charged $2,000 a day, according to the development corporation. But if the city charged by the foot, Mr. Abramovich would be paying $422 more per day for the Eclipse, which has been the biggest private yacht in the world since it was launched in 2010, according to Superyachts.com.
The Eclipse is about two feet longer than the Dubai, a yacht owned by the ruler of Dubai. But soon the Eclipse may be eclipsed by a much larger yacht under construction in Bremen, Germany. That boat, known as Azzam, is estimated to be about 50 feet longer.
It is too soon to know if Azzam will ever be moored in Manhattan. But It's owner, whoever that turns out to be, is unlikely to be a better customer of the city's development corporation than Mr. Abramovich.
The only yacht ever to dock at the city-owned cruise terminal in Brooklyn spent a month there last spring, at a cost of $1,800 a day, Mr. Muncie said. That boat, a 377-foot vessel named Luna, reportedly belonged to Mr. Abramovich, too.
For many Palestinians music is a means of safeguarding and promoting national identity.
By Giles Trendle
It may not be armed struggle, but music is an important weapon of cultural resistance and a means of safeguarding national identity for those Palestinian musicians living inside Israel and occupied east Jerusalem.
"As Palestinians of 1948, we have struggled to stay on our land," says Rim al-Banna, a singer from Nazareth in the Galilee region of northern Israel.
"The mere fact that we have stayed here is itself resistance and endurance. If we did not stay here we wouldn't have had the ability to talk about the Palestinian cause."
"Through my art, I stay here and resist," says singer Reem Talhami. "My resistance is my art, and my art is my war."
'Stranger in my land'
There are roughly 1.4 million Palestinian Israelis living within the so-called 'green line' demarcating the internationally-recognised borders of Israel.
These Palestinian citizens of Israel make up almost 20 per cent of Israel's total population of 7.3 million. In Israel they are termed "Arab Israelis" - not Palestinian citizens of Israel - to separate them from their kin in the occupied territories.
Tzipi Livni, the former Israeli foreign minister who is sometimes cited as a 'moderate', is on record as saying that Palestinian Israelis should not remain in Israel if a Palestinian state is eventually created.
Avigdor Lieberman, the current foreign minister, has in the past described Palestinian citizens of Israel as the "main threat" facing the country and advocated throwing out those who refuse to pledge loyalty to the Jewish state.
"There are almost one-and-a-half million Palestinians living inside Israel," says Tamer Nafar, a singer with the hip-hop group Da Arabian MC's [DAM]. "But I feel like a stranger in my land because the flag that is raised is not mine and the national anthem that is played is not mine. We are Israeli citizens, with Israeli nationality, yet we are still different from the Israelis."
The three members of DAM were born and grew up in the slums of Lod (Lydda), a mixed town of Arabs and Jews 20 km from Jerusalem. The group's most popular song, released in 2001, was called Meen Al-Arhaabi (Who's The Terrorist?). Their lyrics are influenced by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as well as by issues of discrimination and occupation.
Music as a weapon
For Palestinian musicians living in Israel, as well as those in occupied east Jerusalem, music is an important form of cultural resistance against Israel's policies.
"We are faced each day by occupation and the robbery of our land and identity," says Suhail Khoury, a leading musician in the current Palestinian musical scene and the general director of The Edward Said National Conservatory of Music.
"During the first intifada the Israelis recognised the danger of political songs. They realised these songs were inciting the street and fuelling the intifada. For that reason, they started dealing with this music as if it was a weapon."
Khoury recalls being arrested at an Israeli checkpoint for carrying music that the Israelis regarded with suspicion.
"I was driving my car and my music tapes were with me. The Israeli police stopped me at the junction and confiscated my car because it carried 'dangerous substances'. I was interrogated and tortured for 12 days and imprisoned for six months," they say.
Guardians of identity
Many musicians see their art as a means by which they can strive to safeguard and promote a Palestinian national identity.
"Political songs are a means of defence against Israel's attempt to eradicate our national cultural identity," Khoury says.
"Israel has been trying to erase Palestinian folklore, our traditional food, and our traditional clothes and create a cultural identity for itself on the ruins of Palestinian traditions."
Musicians such as Wasim Murad, a Palestinian singer and oud (lute) player, become, in their own individual way, torch-bearers of Palestinian nationalism and guardians of Palestinian identity.
"I had the opportunity to perform at an oud festival but I declined because they [the organisers] refused to state my origin as Palestine," says Murad. "They wanted to write east Jerusalem."
"Palestinian cultural identity is threatened by, and is in danger from, the Israeli state," says Talhami. "There is a methodology towards eradicating this identity. As Palestinian artists, our role is to maintain our inherited identity."
'Personifying Palestine'
Musicians see their music not only as a defence against cultural suppression but as a way of providing a common narrative to unite Palestinians throughout the world, in the absence of a Palestinian homeland.
Traversing borders and boundaries, their music and lyrics reach out to Palestinians from the current internationally-recognised borders of Israel, to occupied east Jerusalem, to the rest of the occupied West Bank, to the Gaza Strip and to other areas of the Middle East and beyond.
"When I sing to the world, I think I portray Palestine through my voice, my singing and my songs," says al-Banna.
"I get a feeling of immense power because I see myself as personifying Palestine when I am performing on stage."
Songs from a Lost Homeland first aired in April 2010.

More news out today from the bad ideas club Texas Legislature: a recently filed bill would require women seeking abortions in the state to first go through a three-hour course on adoption.
But in a fun new twist, the measure was introduced by a Democrat in the state Senate, Eddie Lucio, the only member of their party to vote in favor of the state's sweeping new abortion restrictions.
Advertisement:
Lucio's bill would require the Health and Human Services Commission to develop an “adoption education course” that women would be forced to take, in person or online, before being approved for an abortion. After completing the course, a woman would present a certificate of completion to their doctor. (If they can find one, that is.)
From the text of the proposed bill:
Except as provided by Section 171.102, a pregnant woman may not obtain an abortion unless the woman completes the adoption education course described by Subsection (a) and submits the certificate of completion to the physician performing or inducing the abortion. The course must be completed not more than 30 days and not less than 24 hours before the abortion is performed or induced.
“It is my hope that, when presented with more information on adoption resources and services available, more pregnancies can be carried to term,” Lucio said of the measure. “I am fully aware that this bill, filed on the last day of the second special legislative session, will not immediately pass; however, I intend to continue advocating adoption as an alternative.”

An innovative platform designed to unify cryptocurrency holders in a single destination. This is the main target of Brickblock, the tech startup that has launched its token sale on October 31st 2017.
The company aims to bring a further advancement in cryptocurrency investing. In particular, the emergence of the Blockchain technology, the growth of Bitcoin and of the other forms of cryptocurrency has led to a relentless expansion of the digital currency industry. However, this rise has not been mirrored in and seems to be disconnected from the real-world investment industry.
Given the above, Brickblock has found a specific pathway in order to allow the digital currency industry to further grow by enabling holders of different digital currencies to invest and trade in such real-world assets as ETFs, coin funds and real estate on the Blockchain.
The platform allows users to trade and invest easily and securely, without the challenges associated with such transactions so far, including geographical restrictions, long time to wait, bank account request and cost reduction as in-the-middle intermediaries usually involved are expelled by the process. The use of smart contracts will enable the automatic confirmation of funds transfer from investors to fund managers with the consequent transfer of assets from fund managers to investors also helping to ensure an effective and secure transaction.
Co-founded by Jakob Drzazga and Martin Mischke, the company has made two important steps by 1) releasing the alpha version of the platform on the ethereum blockchain and 2) announcing a partnership with nakamo.to, a Berlin, Germany-based startup to to make the platform the first real use-case on the IOTA's Tangle Network. In addition, to let the project become a reality, talent to the core team has been added, including six full-time developers and key advisors (have a look at the team here).
After raising $1m during a five-day token pre-sale, the company has now announced its public ICO, which will begin on October 31, with a goal of raising the equivalent of USD$50m to continue to develop the platform and release Alpha versions of ETF and coin fund infrastructure and to hire new talent.
Interested people can register for the whitelist to receive exclusive offers during the first two days of the ICO, after which a tiered price structure will kick in.
They recently released an alpha version of their platform to preview the real estate trading functionality.

U.S. Troops Resuming Atlantic Resolve Training in Eastern Europe

U.S. Army troops resumed Operation Atlantic Resolve land-forces training of allied and partner forces this week as 75 Stryker combat vehicles arrived in Eastern Europe, Pentagon Press spokesperson Army Col. Steve Warren said today.
The training will take place in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, Warren added, and continues to demonstrate U.S. commitment to NATO allies.
The Stryker combat vehicles are from U.S. Army Europe's 2nd Cavalry Regiment, elements of which will conduct training in Eastern Europe alongside soldiers from allied and partner nations, Warren said, adding that much of the training will focus on individual and team tasks.
Defense Department spokesperson Air Force Lt. Col. Vanessa Hillman said the training also will include combined, multinational platoon-level exercises and live fires involving a combination of vehicle and foot-soldier maneuvers.
Enhanced Multinational Training
According to Warren, “Since April 2014 the U.S. Army has conducted continuous, enhanced multinational training and security cooperation activities with allies and partners in the region due to increased regional tensions following Russia's illegal actions in Ukraine.”
The Stryker combat vehicle is an eight-wheeled, air- and ground-transportable light-armored vehicle built for the Army by General Dynamics Land Systems. It has a Caterpillar engine, a 310-mile operational range, a 60-mile-an-hour top speed, and armor. Its primary armament is a Protector M-151 remote weapon station with one of two machine guns or an automatic grenade launcher.
Atlantic Resolve training involves about 550 European-based American personnel and 75 Stryker vehicles. The Stryker group is based in Germany.
Elements from the Army 2nd Cavalry Regiment are replacing elements from the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, out of Fort Hood, Texas, that were involved in Atlantic Resolve training before the holiday break. 2nd Cavalry elements will conduct training in the four countries until March 31, Warren said.
“There will be approximately one cavalry troop each in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia,” Warren said, explaining that one cavalry troop has about 20 Stryker vehicles.
Training Regional Allies and Partners
Hillman said that while elements of 2nd Cavalry Regiment participate in Atlantic Resolve, the unit also will conduct a decisive-action, training-environment exercise called Saber Junction.
That exercise will take place, they said, in the German Hohenfels and Grafenwoehr training areas and in the Black Sea region, with U.S. soldiers working alongside those from more than a dozen other NATO and partner nations.
The 1st Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division -- the Army's regionally aligned force for Europe -- is expected to be the next rotational Atlantic Resolve unit when the 2nd Cavalry Regiment's rotation ends.
The Army's ongoing, enhanced training is supported by about $1 billion in funding from the European Reassurance Initiative, Hillman said.
This allocation is designed to enable DoD to continue efforts to reassure NATO allies, they added, and bolster the security and capacity of allies and partners in the region.

After months of delays, the portrait of former Alberta premier Alison Redford was quietly hung in the legislature Thursday morning.
Redford, who resigned from office in March 2014 amid questions about their leadership and questionable spending on travel, asked not to have the typical dedication ceremony.
Instead, they issued a written statement through Speaker Bob Wanner.
"Every picture hanging in the legislature tells the story of the person in the portrait, shaped by Alberta's history at the time they served and the context in which that happened," Redford said. "While the temptation to paint their own pictures and tell their own stories will be hard for some to resist, I instead choose to leave the history of my time in office to be written when time has provided a clearer perspective.
"As the author Robert Morgan once said: 'Distance not only gives nostalgia, but perspective, and maybe objectivity.' "
Redford's portrait was painted by Calgary artist Liela Chan.

As word filtered out that Redford's portrait was up, curiosity drew a crowd of MLAs and legislature staff.
Advanced Education Minister Marlin Schmidt gazed at the portrait, remarking that the whole situation "was really rather sad."
Environment Minister Shannon Phillips said the portrait was "very well done," but wouldn't venture into the subject of Redford's legacy or their tarnished reputation while in office.
"She looks warm," said another person, remembering the day legislature staff poured out of their offices to watch Redford announce their resignation in the rotunda.
Redford is facing a new conflict of interest investigation in the "tobaccogate" issue.
Following a review of the Alberta probe that cleared Redford in 2013 , the conflict of interest commissioner for British Columbia determined a new investigation was required based on information that had since been revealed by CBC News.
The allegations relate to a potentially lucrative tobacco-litigation contract Redford, a former justice minister, awarded to a legal consortium, with which they shared close personal and political ties.
Here is the full statement from former premier Alison Redford:
"I want to genuinely thank my family, my friends and the people of Alberta for supporting me during my time in office serving Albertans. It was a unique honour and privilege that has changed my life, my understanding of myself, others, and of this beautiful province.
"I would like to particularly thank Leila Chan, a talented artist from Calgary and a generous person who was kind enough not only to do a beautiful job on this portrait but also to guide me through the journey of creating an image that tells a story. I would like to take this moment to honour our friend that introduced us, Sandra Durrant, who is no longer with us, but changed our lives forever.
"I have observed that, traditionally, those in political life are inclined to use events such as this unveiling to paint their own picture of how they want to be remembered and what they hope their legacy might be; I am choosing not to do that.
"Every picture hanging in the Legislature tells the story of the person in the portrait, shaped by Alberta's history at the time they served and the context in which that happened. While the temptation to paint their own pictures and tell their own stories will be hard for some to resist, I instead choose to leave the history of my time in office to be written when time has provided a clearer perspective.
"As the author Robert Morgan once said: "Distance not only gives nostalgia, but perspective, and maybe objectivity"."
Xiaomi is preparing to announce the Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus smartphones in China on Thursday, and director of product management Donovan Sung has just shown them off in a set of tweeted photos. There aren't any details on pricing or specs yet, but we can see that both phones have slim bezels and roughly 18:9 screens, in line with many high-end devices released this year.
The difference is that you can expect the Redmi 5 phones to be pretty cheap. Though it isn't the company's flagship line, the Redmi series is very important to Xiaomi, particularly in India. The Redmi 4 and Redmi Note 4 were the two most popular phones in the country, according to recent IDC figures, and have helped Xiaomi catch up with Samsung to claim the title of India's number one smartphone brand.
We don't know how much the Redmi 5 will cost yet, but Redmi 4 pricing starts at 6,999 rupees in India, or about $108. That gets you a phone with a metal build, a fingerprint sensor, a 5-inch 720p display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor, a 13-megapixel camera, and a 4,100mAh battery. Xiaomi recently launched an even cheaper phone, the Redmi 5A, which sells for 4,999 rupees ($78) with a 3,000mAh battery and Snapdragon 425 processor.
Is everyone ready for the all-new Redmi 5 and Redmi 5 Plus? We're launching these two new devices in China on Thursday Dec 7. Giving everyone a sneak preview! #Xiaomi pic.twitter.com/ESbaejpTJV — Donovan Sung (@donovansung) December 4, 2017
If Xiaomi can keep its successful retail strategy up and its Redmi pricing down, these new phones could be a big hit. Stay tuned for coverage when they're revealed in full on December 7th.
Canada's privacy watchdog says that while talks are ongoing, it is not yet satisfied that Bell Canada will bring its targeted online advertising policy in line with privacy legislation.
The telecommunications giant said Tuesday it would change a policy that required cellphone customers to opt out of having their Internet browsing habits tracked as part of its "relevant ads program."
Earlier in the day, Canada's Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) issued a report that denounced the practice and argued Bell should instead give users the chance to opt in to the program. While Bell agreed to other recommendations, it had declined to follow this one, the OPC said.

Bell then said in an e-mailed statement it would comply with the OPC's decision, "including the opt-in approach," and thanked the commission for "clarifying the rules."
After meeting with representatives from the company on Wednesday, however, the OPC said the issue remains unresolved.
"While we cannot comment on the specifics of our discussion today, what I can tell you is that we are not yet in a position where we can confirm that our concerns have been satisfied," OPC spokesperson Tobi Cohen said in an e-mail.
"Discussions to this end are continuing. We will maintain our option to pursue the matter at the Federal Court if a solution cannot be reached to our satisfaction," they continued, adding, "Suffice it to say that it would be premature to say that we have arrived at a solution on the issue of opt-in."
The federal watchdog does not have the power to order private companies to comply with privacy legislation, but said Tuesday it could take the issue to court, noting it hoped Bell would reconsider its position over the coming weeks.
Bell spokesperson Mark Langton said Wednesday the company is "working co-operatively" with the OPC. "Bell is moving to the opt-in approach as confirmed yesterday," they said in an e-mail.
Mr. Langton added the company hopes to see the same rules – requiring opt-in consent to tracking browsing behaviour – apply to international companies such as Facebook and Google that compete for Canadian advertising dollars. However, they said this issue was not a sticking point in Bell's talks with the OPC.

Bell's targeted ad program also faces an ongoing challenge at the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).
(Bell is owned by BCE Inc., which also owns 15 per cent of The Globe and Mail.)
The company first announced the program in November, 2013, prompting the Public Public Interest Advocacy Centre and the Consumers' Association of Canada (PIAC-CAC) to file a challenge with the CRTC over privacy concerns.
Meanwhile, the OPC received a wave of complaints about the program that led it to open its own investigation, which it concluded and publicly reported on this week.
Bell uses the information it gains from tracking its cellphone customers' browsing habits and app use to deliver advertising for third parties aimed at what it believes to be users' specific interests. (The targeted ad program has only applied to wireless customers so far, but Bell has said it wants to expand the initiative to television, Internet and home phone customers in the future.)
This type of "behavioural advertising" has become common on the Internet and the OPC issued guidelines in 2011 to address privacy concerns it raises.
Story continues below advertisement
The guidelines say advertisers must ensure people know they are being tracked, notify them before collecting personal information and give them the opportunity to opt out of being tracked.
However, the OPC determined in the case of Bell's program that an opt-out standard of consent was insufficient and that the company should instead offer users the chance to opt in from the outset. The OPC noted that Bell has access to user information it already collects in order to deliver telecom services.
"Bell is able to track every website its customers visit, every app they use, every TV show they watch and every call they make using Bell's network," the OPC said in a statement on the report.
"When that information is combined with account and demographic information – such as age range, gender, average revenue per user, preferred language and postal code – which the company has long collected, the end result is a rich multidimensional profile that most people are likely to consider highly sensitive."
Two senior Tata Steel executives are among 10 people suspended by the beleaguered company over forgery allegations that have prompted a criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.
The Guardian understands that Mark Broxholme, the managing director of the company's speciality steels and bar business was suspended last November. Andrew Parker, the commercial director of the division, was also suspended and has since left the business.
The suspension of such senior figures within Tata Steel highlights the seriousness of the claims. The investigation is a further blow to the UK steel business, which is battling to survive after Tata announced it planned to pull out of the country, putting 15,000 jobs at risk. The speciality steels and bar business covers two of Tata's biggest sites in Rotherham and Stocksbridge, both in Yorkshire, and employs more than 2,000 people.
Tata's UK steel operation 'under investigation by SFO' Read more
The potential scandal was discovered when an internal audit by Tata found certificates that verify the quality and composition of its steel may have been falsified. The company then informed the SFO about its findings.
The SFO said in a statement on Friday: “The Serious Fraud Office confirms it opened a criminal investigation in December 2015 into activity at Speciality Steels, a business unit of Tata Steel (UK) Ltd. We can make no further comment at this time.”
The documents being investigated cover steel sold to about 500 customers, including BAE, Rolls-Royce, and oil and gas firms. Roll has confirmed it has been contacted by Tata. The safety of the steel is not thought to have been compromised.
Tata is understood to have suspended nine people over the allegations last November and another employee in 2016. Broxholme did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment. Emails to their address are met with an automated response that simply says: “Away.”
The Tata executive has worked for the company and its predecessors – Corus and British Steel – since 1980.  They are a leading business figure in the local community and sits on the board of the Barnsley & Rotherham Chamber of Commerce.
Broxholme has run the speciality steels and bars business since 2011. As well as the sites in Rotherham and Stocksbridge, the division has service centres in Bolton, India and Suzhou and Xi'an in China.
Parker was a commercial director of the business between April 2013 and November 2015 according to their LinkedIn profile. Since December they have been “actively seeking a new challenge”, according to the website. Parker could not be reached for comment.
Tata Steel said: “We won't be commenting on the individuals concerned.”
The allegations have emerged as the government tries to find a saviour for Tata Steel in the UK, which employs 15,000 people and includes the Port Talbot steelworks.
A number of potential buyers have emerged, including Liberty House, which is run by metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, Greybull, the investment firm, and ThyssenKrupp, the German industrial conglomerate. A management buyout is another option, although this would need financial backing from a third party.
However, the scale of the challenge facing any buyer has been laid bare by Ratan Tata, the former chairperson of the Tata group and now head of the charitable funds that control the conglomerate. In their first intervention since the Indian firm announced it was selling its loss-making UK business, Tata said job cuts would be necessary to make the Port Talbot steelworks profitable.
Speaking at a US Export-Import Bank conference in Washington DC, Tata said the “bottom just opened up” at the UK steel operation after Chinese steel exports poured into Europe.
“Right now the problem is that the English facilities are underinvested [and] overmanned,” Tata was quoted as saying by the Financial Times.
They said a potential buyer at Port Talbot would need to “cut back on the size and the scale of the operations and make them profitable”. This would be “extremely challenging” but not impossible.
Christian Awashish knows that history can't be undone.
Nothing will erase the floods that washed away their ancestors' homes, poisoned their drinking water and buried the hunting grounds that had sustained the Atikamekw Nation for hundreds of years.
But a recent legal victory over the federal government has put the Atikamekw within reaching distance of a lucrative settlement and an apology for the cataclysmic damage caused by the construction of the La Loutre dam in 1918.
“I think the federal government has a chance to make amends, to do the right thing,” said Awashish, an Atikamekw Grand Chief. “It's not a perfect solution, it doesn't take away what was done but it's something we can live with.”
Last month, the Specific Claims Tribunal ruled that the federal government failed in its duties to warn the Atikamekw about the dangers of imminent flooding related to the 1918 project. The government did not properly compensate the First Nation for losing land, revenue from traplines and homes during the flood, according to four decisions signed by Quebec Judge Johanne Mainville.
The Mainville rulings mark the first time a Quebec First Nation has won a case before the Specific Claims Tribunal since it was created in 2008. The tribunal was established to deal with alleged treaty violations between the federal government and aboriginal groups.
“When I read the ruling, I almost screamed, ‘Victory!',” said Awashish, whose great-grandfather was an Atikamekw chief at the time of the 1918 floods. “We were realistic about our chances, pessimistic even. We didn't expect to win like that, to win so decisively. In those moments, after the decision was handed down, I thought about my ancestors, my great grandfather, about all these people who never got the chance to fight this in the courts.”
The rulings also concern flooding in the 1940s, the failure by the federal government to provide clean drinking water for the Atikamekw for decades and a years-long delay in creating reserve lands for the First Nation.
The ministry of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development has until June 20 to contest the rulings, but a representative from the government would not say whether it would file an appeal.
“We are currently studying the rulings to determine what approach to take and what should be done next,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to the Montreal Gazette.
In the event of an appeal, the parties could be tied up in court for years. Even if the federal government abides by the decisions, it must sit down with the Atikamekw and negotiate a settlement, which could also take years.
Neither Awashish nor their band council's lawyers would speculate as to the size of a potential settlement, but there's a maximum payout of $150 million in decisions rendered by the tribunal.
I thought about my ancestors, my great grandfather, about all these people who never got the chance to fight this in the courts.”
For Quebecers living in the Haute Mauricie region, the 1918 creation of the La Loutre dam was a much-needed step toward modernity, a sign that progress and industry was making its way north to logging towns like La Tuque and Shawinigan.
But for the Atikamekw, who had thrived in the area for generations, the dam simply meant flooding on a biblical scale.
In historical documents unearthed during the hearings, it's clear the dam posed an existential threat to the 160 Atikamekw settled in the village of Opitciwan — about 700 kilometres north of Montreal. As early as 1912, the provincial government's own studies suggested most of Opitciwan would be submerged if the La Loutre dam were built near the territory.
And yet, in both documentary and oral evidence presented before the tribunal, no one appears to have warned the Atikamekw that they'd be hit with such devastation. As lake water began to overtake the village, families had just enough time to salvage their clothes and blankets.
Lawyers representing the federal government argued that because the dam was a provincial project, Quebec is ultimately liable for the Atikamekw's plight. But the tribunal ultimately rejected those claims, reasserting the federal government's responsibility to look after the well being of Quebec's indigenous peoples.
“The federal government was either aware of the potential for a flood or it didn't know but should have,” said Marie-Ève Dumont, one of the lawyers who represented the Atikamekw. “The information was available, there were many reports on record and ample evidence the government could have consulted. Ultimately, it was clear there would be flooding and not enough was done to mitigate its effects.”
About 20 homes were destroyed, along with the town's chapel and two water wells at the time of the flood. The graveyard where 63 bodies lay would also permanently rest at the bottom of the lake.
Missionaries living among the Atikamekw wrote about rampant disease that followed the floods and of families forced to build shanties with scraps of wood to get through the brutal winters of the early 1920s.
Though the Quebec government promised the people of Opitciwan a shipment of lumber and construction materials to help rebuild their homes, the delivery took years to come. And when the delivery finally came, it didn't include basic materials like doors, windows and hinges.
In a letter to the Quebec government, dated May 1922, one missionary wrote that four people in the village had died, that the village had become swampy, riddled with insects and that the priests feared “another epidemic.”
The town's water supply and nearby fish stocks became contaminated with mercury. Even by 1944, nearly 30 years after the project began, federal inspection reports referred to the Atikamekw's drinking water as “unsafe.”
But perhaps the most significant losses were the traps and other hunting tools washed away in the flood. Because the Atikamekw subsisted on hunting, trapping and fur trading, the disaster posed a threat to their most basic means of survival.
“The ramifications of the flood were huge, devastating even,” said Claude Gélinas, a Université de Sherbrooke professor whose work centres on the history of the Atikamekw peoples. “The inability to fish, to hunt totally upended the Atikamekw's economy. It accelerated a process by which a nomadic people became sedentary and it began a cycle of dependence on government aid.”
It accelerated a process by which a nomadic people became sedentary and it began a cycle of dependence on government aid.”
For Awashish, last month's victory was nearly 30 years in the making.
The Opitciwan band council began building its case in 1988 but was told repeatedly, by federal lawyers, that it had no recourse. It was only after the Specific Claims Tribunal was established in 2008 that the Atikamekw finally got their day in court.
By then, however, many of the elders who were children during the floods of the 1940s had died. Still, four Opitciwan elders testified before the tribunal in 2013 and their testimony weighed heavily in the decision — according to Justice Mainville's rulings.
“It makes me really proud that our elders were heard and that their experience was given such prominence,” said Awashish.
In the event of a cash settlement, Awashish said he'll hold consultations with their community but that some of the reserve's needs are pressing. Opitciwan is among Quebec's most impoverished communities — with unemployment rates frequently floating above 50 per cent, overcrowded living conditions and a badly underfunded school system.
“We want to create an education fund, to get some money in housing, to invest in our children, in our future generations,” said Awashish. “But we're not there yet, we know we still have a long road ahead of us.”
Gélinas says that despite their immense challenges, there's reason to be hopeful about the future of the Atikamekw.
“I'm an optimist and when I look at Opitciwan, I see a young population and children who, if they're given the right tools, can succeed,” said Gélinas. “We've seen plenty of success stories come out of Quebec First Nations and I think we can see plenty more.”

What really goes on in an operating room?
This week, the Annals of Internal Medicine published an anonymous essay recounting two appalling incidents that took place while gynecological patients were unconscious. The medical journal challenged doctors to call out colleagues who behave inappropriately, but so far the response has been polarizing. While some physicians and consumer advocates applauded the journal for shining a light on abhorrent behaviors, some doctors, mostly obstetrician-gynecologists who felt singled out by the essay, have criticized its publication, calling it inflammatory, unsubstantiated and sensationalistic.
The incidents described in the essay are troubling, and some of the details are too graphic to repeat. In one case, a male doctor made a sexual comment while prepping an anesthetized woman for vaginal surgery. In the other, a doctor had just performed a lifesaving procedure on a Hispanic patient who began bleeding after giving birth. While the sedated patient was still in a compromised position, the doctor began dancing and singing a popular Mexican folk song.
In both cases, medical students who observed the behavior were deeply disturbed, but feigned amusement and played along, reluctant to confront a supervisor.
The editors of Annals of Internal Medicine decided to publish the piece as an anonymous essay even though the author originally submitted it to the journal under their real name. As a result of the anonymity, the incidents could not be verified. The journal declined a request for an interview with the author. In an accompanying editorial, the journal editors said they published the essay to encourage physicians to call out colleagues who behaved inappropriately, and that they hoped it would “make readers' stomachs churn,” and “gnaw” at their consciences. They opted for anonymity to protect the identities of the patients involved.
“These are extreme examples, but there is no reason to believe these weren't true events,” said Dr. Christine Laine, the journal's editor-in-chief. “When I said to our 15-plus editorial team to ‘raise your hand if you think this stuff never happens,' nobody raised their hand.”
They said the decision to publish was not easy, but that the editors felt refraining from publishing would, in a sense, make them complicit in the behavior as well.
While it has long been known that doctors sometimes adopt gallows humor to defuse tension or make provocative comments when they think patients aren't listening, it is unusual for a medical journal to highlight such behaviors. Earlier this summer a Virginia man won $500,000 in damages after the doctor was recorded making disparaging remarks during a colonoscopy.
But does publicizing the bad behavior help patients? Not everybody thinks so.
Dr. Mark S. DeFrancesco, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement that in their 31 years of practice, they had “certainly never witnessed activity like this.”
Dr. Sigal Klipstein, chair of the college's committee on ethics, said in a telephone interview that they were concerned the piece would deter women from seeking medical care.
“What was the point of publishing this article?” they asked, adding that since both of the patients received sound medical care and were not physically injured, “No harm was done.”
Nancy Berlinger, a scholar at The Hastings Center who writes about ethical challenges in health care as well as issues of power between junior and senior clinicians, disagrees. “Doctors must be respectful even if a patient is sedated,” they said. And in these cases, they said, the supervising physicians also did harm to the medical students they were responsible for training and mentoring.
“This is the worst thing a role model can do: to suggest that wrong behavior is acceptable, to nudge junior people to be callous and to misuse power,” Dr. Berlinger said. In both cases, the senior doctors made a trainee student complicit in their abuse and “made them feel dirty at an early stage of their careers.”
The anonymous essay prompted one physician blogger to recall their own experience as a medical student who was uncomfortable with the way a physician conducted a pelvic exam on a young girl. The experience, they wrote, still haunts them today.
“Now as a mature woman I would handle it differently,” said Dr. Valerie Jones, a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician.
In their essay, the anonymous author explained that they were prompted to write it after a discussion in a medical ethics class. They asked the students if anything had happened in their clinical experience that they needed to forgive or could not forgive. The ensuing conversation revealed that both student and teacher were haunted by the uncomfortable experiences described in the essay. The teacher noted that they had felt cowed into laughing along with the singing doctor, and it was only when the anesthesiologist in the room yelled at them that it stopped.
“We all need the strength to act like the anesthesiologist in this story,” the editors of the journal wrote, noting that doctors should call out colleagues for inappropriate behavior. They concluded, “We owe it to ourselves, to our profession and especially to our patients.”

A waiter at an IHOP in Georgetown who decided to boost their paltry tip after the customer left the restaurant has ordered up a big plate of trouble.
Richard Barfield is charged with credit card or debit card abuse for giving themselves an unauthorized tip.
According to an affidavit, a woman and their family had dinner at the IHOP at 750 S. IH-35 in Georgetown on August 4, where the bill came to $33.76 including a $2.00 tip.
Two days later, the report says, the woman checked their account transactions and noticed the IHOP transaction totaled $39.76, which they did not authorize. Upon contacting the restaurant, it was discovered the transaction receipt shows an $8.00 tip, and the receipt on file is the customer's copy, not the merchant's copy.
The woman says they completed the merchant's copy, and states they did not authorize the $8.00 tip.
The detective spoke with an IHOP manager, who said that the wait staff is responsible for processing the payments for their tables, and that each member of the wait staff is assigned a user name and password for the register.
The affidavit states that the manager identified the waiter who processed this payment as Barfield.
Barfield was released from custody on a $5,000 bond.

Are you sick of turning every corner to see yet another Starbucks? Perhaps you should move to Denver, Colorado, where the only business more prevalent than the bemoaned Seattle coffee chain are medical marijuana dispensaries. According to The Daily, "glossy guidebooks list nearly 300 locations where Colorado's 125,000 residents who have been prescribed medical marijuana can get their 'medicine.'" Starbucks, on the other hand, has only 266 stores in the Mile High City. Pot has become such a big part of the city's culture that one of its alt-weeklies, the Denver Westword, has even hired a weed critic to, as The Daily puts it, "help [Denverites] navigate the gauntlet of bongs, pipes and vaporizers, or make that essential choice between Super Silver Haze and Purple Passion."

It's almost unthinkable.
A doctor cutting open patients, fiddling around just enough to make it seem like a surgery is happening, and then sewing them back up without addressing the problem. This isn't a placebo surgery experiment. This is what attorneys in multiple lawsuits and now the New York Office of Professional Medical Conduct have accused Dr. Spyros Panos of doing.
Malpractice lawsuits against the orthopedic surgeon, which now have been filed by more than 250 plaintiffs, caught the attention of Sarah Bradshaw at the Poughkeepsie Journal. The Journal is a local, Gannett-owned paper, and a lean operation. So lean that Bradshaw doesn't just do great investigative pieces, they also write the occasional traffic story.
Often doctors behaving badly can get away with it for a while and then get caught without bringing anyone else down with them. In this instance, we may see more heads roll. Dr. Arthur Caplan talked about the case to Good Morning America, which followed Bradshaw's stories and reported on Panos being forced to surrender their license last week. Note that GMA called them “Caplin,” and I've inserted the correct spelling of their name in the quote below.
Arthur [Caplan], the director of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center and a former non-MD representative with the New York State medical licensing board, said they also found it troubling that others besides Panos aren't under investigation. "You can't perform this many suspect surgeries without the cooperation of many other people," they said.
That's exactly right. Bradshaw's reporting points to a list of possible organizations and individuals who, in a perfect world, would be under scrutiny right now.
Mid Hudson Medical Group. Panos was a part of this physicians' group until July 2011 when they were shoved out. They also had served on the group's board of directors. The group wouldn't tell Bradshaw much for a piece they wrote in September 2011.
Mid Hudson Medical Group President Joseph Garvey said Panos was "terminated from our group for not meeting our professional standards.
"We expect all of our physicians to meet the highest standards of integrity," they said. Garvey said the decision to terminate Panos was made by the group's board of directors and was effective in July. They wouldn't say specifically how Panos stopped meeting the groups' standards, but they added, "We became aware of this over the early part of this year."
This could be the case of a doctors' group doing the right thing, and they could all be heralded as heroes in this affair as the legal cases proceed. But it also could be that members of the group knew a lot more than they are letting on. And earlier. No doubt the legal proceedings will reveal more.
The Hudson Valley Center at Saint Francis LLC. Panos performed some of their surgeries here. And, as a result, plaintiffs sued the center along with Panos. But in May 2013, the center dissolved itself, at least complicating the legal process if not absolving the doctors and the hospital that ran the center. Bradshaw wrote:
It's unclear how the change in the center's ownership may impact the pending litigation against the Hudson Valley Center. Court records show the corporation is named as a co-defendant in many of the about 250 lawsuits involving orthopedic surgeon Dr. Spyros Panos, who is accused of malpractice. … One immediate effect on the Panos' lawsuits was reported to the Journal by a Queens attorney representing dozens of Panos' former patients. J.T. Wisell said one of their process servers tried to serve the Hudson Valley Center with legal documents Tuesday, but was informed the center was out of business.
I'll offer more examples of organizations who may be caught in the phantom surgery dragnet in my next post.

Stop.
You know that grossed-out feeling you get when you hear the word “panties?” I won't even wait for you to respond, because I assume that being a normal human being, hearing the word “panties” sends a wave of perviness over your soul and makes you feel like you should be added to the National Sex Offenders Registry. There is a musical equivalent to “panties,” and that is the word “punk.”
“Punk” is a totally stupid word and I feel like I should be thrown in music jail for using it. Not sure who else would be in music jail, but definitely the guy who wrote that “Hey Soul Sister” song and anyone who wears a shirt of the band they're going to see. “Punk” is my least favorite word that also happens to be a word I use approximately 900 times a day, since it's technically the type of music I listen to. I say “technically,” because that's one of the worst things about the word: It's so fucking broad.
Punk, first and foremost, is an ethos or set of ideals, so anything that falls under this gigantic, safety-pinned umbrella gets labeled as "punk." Then, there are all these subgenres of punk, all with equally gross-sounding names. There's hardcore, which confuses people. The first time I told my mom I listened to hardcore music, they said, “No, you don't. That's pornography.” There's also emo, which makes me want to beat myself up for even saying it. And then there's screamo, ska, pop punk, post-punk, grindcore, and a million other subdivisions people made up to make themselves sound interesting on their dating profiles. It's all technically "punk."
This brings up some deep philosophical questions. Questions like “Is punk a musical genre or a state of being?” “Can you define a genre that is inherently anti-definition?” “How the fuck has Anti-Flag been a band for 25 years?” In seeking answers to these questions, I asked for input from my friend Brendan Kelly, a notable punk rocker who has been punk rocking for the last 15 punk years in the punk band The Lawrence Arms (very punk). Take it away, BK: “If Crass is punk and Good Charlotte is punk and Madball and Fifteen and the Misfits and Shelter and the Cro-Mags are all punk (and they all are, because no rules, bro), then it's pretty meaningless ideologically, which means it's just another way to sell something, and ‘ways to sell something' are either lame marketing strategies on one hand, or propaganda the other.” So basically, if everything is punk, then nothing is punk. At this point, I'd like to point out that punk is the only genre of music where this sort of discussion occurs. You never hear fans of motown at each other's throats about what is or is not "motown" BECAUSE THE TEMPTATIONS ARE NOT REAL MOTOWN YOU FUCKING POSER GO BACK TO HOT TOPIC.
Another reason “punk” is such a heinous word is the image associated with it. Most people who are into punk today listen to bands like Dillinger Four and Teenage Bottlerocket and usually dress pretty unsuspectingly in jeans and band shirts. But when casual music fans hear the word “punk,” they think of the ridiculous costumes worn by bands of the late-70s like the Sex Pistols. Newsflash to those people: No one who is into punk today gives a raging fuck about the Sex Pistols. And for the most part, the punks with green liberty spikes, bondage pants, and studded leather jackets have died out. Occasionally, you'll spot a member of this endangered species in the wild and it's like finding a leprechaun. They are mythical creatures who look like they stepped out of a time machine from an era when people gave a shit about Ronald Reagan.
Seriously. Stop.
What say you on this subject of punk fashion, Brendan Kelly? “The idea of calling an anti-establishment, anti-culture movement by a name that invokes fashion and strict dogmas is fucking stupid to begin with. And if your argument is that punk has always been a fashion thing first and foremost, and I would maybe argue this, well then being ‘punk' is no cooler than being a Jersey Shore dago or a ‘rocker' or a ‘hippie.' And being a hippie is the worst thing you can be.” Well put, Brendan. And hey, thanks for dropping in that casual ethnic slur about my Italian heritage.
I feel like we've gotten into some really deep territory on the whole punk/unpunk thing here, so let's just also remember that on a more base level, “punk” is also like nails on a blackboard due to its dumb, non-music-related use. As in Clint Eastwood's, “You feeling lucky, punk?” or whatever it was they said before they started arguing with empty chairs. It basically means hooligan or rascal. I think I'll start telling people I listen to rascal, rock because that is less embarrassing.
Well, since I've just used the word “punk” about a hundred million times, I'm going to go take a cold shower in my clothes for the rest of the day while sobbing along to Rancid's And Out Come The Wolves. Later, punks.
You can know X if, and only if, you are of part identity group Y.
This is the theory of what I will call ‘Identitarian Epistemology.' While generally not articulated in abstract form, this doctrine has managed to infect our political culture. It is the major philosophical justification for dismissing anyone's argument, question, or thought, based on nothing more than their or their identity group. One identity group, so the theory goes, cannot acquire the unique knowledge of another.
Identitarian Epistemology is based upon the following premises:
Being part of identity group Y necessarily involves certain experiences which are unique to that group.
These experiences are a necessary condition for acquiring certain kinds of knowledge.
And therefore:
People not of identity group Y cannot know certain things, which only identity group Y can know.
Being “part of identity group Y” here means being accurately described with a certain identity predicate: “black,” “female,” “gay,” et cetera. There are an infinite number of such predicates because there are an infinite number of ways to qualitatively describe an individual, and to then sort individuals by group based upon common characteristics. However, in our contemporary political culture we generally focus upon the limited number of identity groups within the categories of race, gender, religion, and sexual orientation.
If the identitarian doctrine is accepted, then each identity group has unique epistemic rights – the right to some exclusive body of knowledge specific to one's identity group. A white person's epistemic rights are the ability to know what only white people can know, a black person's epistemic rights are the ability to know only what black people can know, and so on.
Now, let's consider for a moment the practical consequences of this theory for our representative democracy. To be sure, is not necessary that the doctrine of epistemic rights have political consequences, or even that it be a particularly significant doctrine. The question of whether or not only Jews like myself can know the proper way to tell a self-deprecating joke about Jews has relatively few consequences. Epistemic rights only become significant (and potentially consequential) when groups are thought to have large and socially important fields of unique knowledge.
This is of further significance to our political culture when combined with a claim about representation: in order to properly know and act on behalf of the interests of a particular identity group, one must be part of that identity group. On this account, one of a white person's epistemic rights is their or their ability to know the interests of other white people. Given this belief, the identitarian doctrine is not only opposed to American representative democracy, but it necessarily results in perpetual and irrevocable undemocratic rule and group conflict.
In America, we elect leaders to act on behalf of our interests. There are far too many of us for a direct democracy at the highest level of government, so we have a tiered system in which influence diminishes as generality increases. At the level of local government, we can directly represent ourselves, but at the Congressional level we must vote in someone to act on behalf of our common interests.
In order to genuinely represent a constituency, it is necessary that an individual know the interests of their constituents, and that they be capable of acting on their behalf: speaking about them, working to pass relevant legislation et cetera. Any attempt to represent a group when one either does not know the interests of that group, or is incapable of acting on its behalf, is illegitimate. By the lights of the identitarian doctrine, any attempt to represent an identity group of which one is not a member is therefore illegitimate. As a white male, I do not have the epistemic rights to represent women, or black people; and nobody in either of those identity groups has the epistemic right to represent me.
This alone would be contrary to our cultural belief that we can unite under common, albeit limited, interests. If the identitarian doctrine were to be genuinely implemented, then our electoral system would need to be reformed to produce genuine identitarian representation. This could be accomplished by segregating and balkanizing constituencies by race or religion. It could also be accomplished by setting quotas limiting how many people of a given identity group can serve in the upper and lower houses of Congress. Jews, for example, make up less than five per cent of the population and do not have the epistemic rights to represent black or Muslim people. So, if we are to have a government that actually represents the population, the proportion of congressional seats available to Jews must also be limited to five per cent.
But there is an even more insidious consequence. Contemporary ‘intersectional' feminist doctrine holds that identity groups can be infinitely fragmented: a feminism that attempts to represent the interests of women as women is inadequate. Proper feminism must represent the diverse interests of Muslim women, black women, trans women, and every possible qualitative combination.
This is impossible. Nobody shares the entire identity of everyone in a whole group. And yet, based upon the identitarian doctrine, a common-group identity–between represented and representative–is necessary for representation. Each group requires representation from one of its own, but each group can continually splinter into other identity sub-groups, which also require specific representation: Palestinian women cannot be represented by trans women, or by white women, or by black women. If a member of one of these sub-groups attempts to represent another sub-group, this is illegitimate because the representative lacks the requisite epistemic rights. The conflict then is between a system of representational democracy, in which we unite over broadly shared interests, and a group-based representational system, which, due to the doctrine's own premises, requires group conflict and the failure of democracy.
The theory of identitarian epistemology is increasingly a commonplace viewpoint. However, practically, it's important to recognize that someone may espouse this doctrine without articulating all the logical steps of this argument. The identitarian may well repudiate the notion that they believe in the end of our mode of governing and may protest that they have never recommended such a radical objective. Strictly speaking, this may be true. But the end of representative democracy is nonetheless hard-wired into identitarian politics. While the practical consequences of identitarian beliefs may not be fully apprehended by their adherents, the revolutionary logic remains latent and unconscious, awaiting its inevitable moment.

Once relegated to the right-wing fringe, the current era of Islamophobia is bleeding into mainstream politics and quickly becoming a defining leg of the GOP platform. Last night at the GOP presidential debate, political reporter Josh McElveen prodded the GOP field on this issue. Pointing out Herman Cain's refusal to appoint Muslims to their administration, McElveen asked Cain whether “American-Muslims as a group less committed to the Constitution than, say, Christian or Jews?”
Cain recently asserted that, because Islam is more dangerous than any other religion, Muslim appointees should take a loyalty oath to the Constitution. Last night however, Cain walked back their anti-Muslim sentiment which, they said, focused solely on Muslims that “are trying to kill us” and the phantom threat of “Sharia law in American courts.” Mitt Romney firmly rebuked Cain's delusion, stating “of course, we're not going to have Sharia law applied in U.S. courts. That's never going to happen.” Then, without prompting, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich piped in to espouse the loyalty oath and — to justify their claim — pointed to the U.S.' anti-communist paranoia and persecution during the 1940s as effective strategy:
GINGRICH: I just want to comment for a second. The Pakistani who emigrated to the U.S. became a citizen, built a car bomb which luckily failed to go off in Times Square was asked by the federal judge, how could they have done that when they signed — when they swore an oath to the United States. And they looked at the judge and said, “You're my enemy. I lied.” Now, I just want to go out on a limb here. I'm in favor of saying to people, if you're not prepared to be loyal to the United States, you will not serve in my administration, period. We did this — we did this in dealing with the Nazis and we did this in dealing with the communists. And it was controversial both times, and both times we discovered after a while, you know, there are some genuinely bad people who would like to infiltrate our country. And we have got to have the guts to stand up and say no.
Watch it:
The way the government “dealt with the communists” in the 1940s is generally known as the U.S.' second Red Scare. Beginning in 1945, the House Standing Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) conducted hearings of Hollywood actors that led to more than 300 artists — including Charlie Chaplin — being blacklisted and boycotted by the industry. HUAC also subpoenaed several African-American witnesses to testify and denounce All-American football player, lawyer, and actor Paul Robeson “in order to obtain future employment.” Robeson was subject to scrutiny after they made public statements that African Americans would not fight “an imperialist war.” Called before HUAC, Robeson told committee members, “you are the un-Americans, and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.”
Widely considered a dark period of hyperbolic zealotry in American history, it is astounding the former House speaker — a historian themselves — would voluntarily espouse this unbridled paranoia as “gutsy,” let alone appropriate. No stranger to whipping up public paranoia over their perceived infiltration of an outside threat like radical Islam, Gingrich now looks less like a president and more like a senator. Specifically, Sen. Joseph McCarthy.

Ten years ago, a Marion deputy was killed in the line of duty.
Detective Christy Utley with the Marion County Sheriff's Office said the world lost a "friend and a hero" that day.
"We will continue to miss Brandy in many ways," they said.
Utley and the Fraternal Order of Police of Ohio led a ceremony Tuesday morning at Brandy Lyn Winfield's resting place at Marion Cemetery. More than 100 people, including local law enforcement groups and city and county officials, joined the Winfield family and friends to remember them a decade after their death.
"It seems like it happened yesterday, not 10 years ago," Shirley Winfield, Brandy's mother, said as rain began to sprinkle while the crowd dispersed. "I still miss them as much as the day we got that call. It's a rough day."
Brenda Winfield, Brandy's grandmother, said it was tough to come out every year.
"I'm just glad everyone thought so much of him," they said.
"He'll never be forgotten," added Forest Winfield, Brandy's grandfather.
In the early morning of Oct. 14, 2004, Winfield was called to check on an abandoned van stopped in the road on Ohio 423. The last radio message sent to the sheriff's office described a man walking along the road carrying a gas can. When officials did not hear from them for some time, they sent authorities from the Marion Police Department and the sheriff's office to look for him.
Those responders found Winfield in their cruiser with a gunshot wound. The cruiser was upside down in a ditch on Ohio 423. Winfield was pronounced dead later that morning after being taken to Marion General Hospital.
Chaplain Jeff Williams, who led several prayers during Tuesday's hour-long ceremony, said many of the officers have pictures of Winfield in their cruisers to remember that tragic day.
"It's not that we think of Brandy every few years," they said. "We think of them every day."
Winfield's killer, 30-year-old Juan C. Cruz, is serving a life sentence in Toledo. They pleaded guilty to aggravated murder and aggravated robbery in 2005. Their first parole board hearing is scheduled for 2047.
Since Winfield's death, their closest friends founded an annual poker run that has raised more than $160,000 for Marion-area charities. Funds have gone to support Safety City, Relay For Life, and Cops and Kids. The charity also has provided funding to purchase Marion's newest police dog, Six, named after Winfield's cruiser and unit number.
"Through the whole 10 years, we've got this kind of support," Shirley Winfield said. "It's been amazing. Great people in Marion, for sure."

It's generally assumed that NATO member nations are going to import their weapons from NATO arms dealers, which pretty much always means the United States, with a few small deals for Britain and France. Turkey however, is going a different way on air defense, signing a deal to buy a $2.5 billion S-400 system from Russia.
Since the whole rest of the NATO alliance is night and day building up military forces on the Russian frontier, such a purchase is raising more than a few eyebrows, and not just because they aren't going to buy a more expensive alternative from Raytheon or Lockheed.
The deal means Turkey's new air defense system won't be compatible with the rest of the alliance for the purposes of integration, though the S-400 is widely considered among the most advanced in the world. Russia will directly provide two S-400 batteries on the deal, and will also produce two more batteries within Turkey in the future.
This isn't the first time Turkey looked to an alternative supplier outside NATO, as they very nearly bought missile systems from a Chinese company, before the US convinced them not to because the company had sold similar systems to the Iranians.
That Turkey still went outside the alliance may reflect the continued tension with both the US and Western Europe, as well as the Erdoğan government's interest in staking out a more independent foreign policy, as the Russian systems likely won't come with the same restrictions on deployments as a Patriot missile battery.

Greg Oden made a surprising debut for the Miami Heat on Wednesday night and showed how far they have come in their long-term recovery from chronic knee issues.
Oden checked into the second quarter of the Heat's preseason game in New Orleans, the first time they had played in an NBA game since Dec. 5, 2009, a span of more than 1,400 days.
Miami's Greg Oden was back on the floor Wednesday night, their first action in more than 1,400 days. Derick E. Hingle/USA TODAY Sports
On their first possession, the Heat ran a post-up play for Oden, who turned and dunked the ball. They played an eventful 80 seconds of game time in the first half, picking up the basket, two rebounds, a turnover and a foul.
They ended up playing four minutes total in the Heat's 108-95 win against the Pelicans.
"It's been a long time," Oden said. "It's been a long road for me, just to get that off my back, my first step tonight. I'm happy I'm able to walk off this court and I'm able to play another day."
Teammate LeBron James was happy to see them back on the court.
"It was a very special moment," they said. "I have no idea what my feeling would be like, being away from the game for three years. It was like a proud moment, man. I was so excited for them when they got on the court and they checked in -- and their first basket they get a dunk. Can you write it any better? Obviously he's not where they want to be, but the process is going great.
"I can just imagine how excited they were to get back out there. I'm going to have to take a toast for him, man. I ain't no drinker, but I might have to take a shot for him. It was an absolutely great moment."
Comedy Central's “Broad City," which returns tomorrow night, has shown up on every best-of-2014 list worth its salt along with write-ups in the New Yorker, Vanity Fair and the New York Times. Just 10 episodes that quietly aired early last year snowballed into all kinds of buzz for the show. So it's not surprising, perhaps, after expectations were raised so high, that the first few episodes of the second season feel a little tepid. Of the three episodes Comedy Central made available for viewing, the third, “Knockoffs,” airing Feb. 4, was by far my favorite.
To be fair to the show, one of the reasons that it took me until the third episode to feel excited about this season is because “Broad City” is more a state of mind than a TV show. It's got an aesthetic and a worldview that you've kind of got to settle into—one where talking about paper towels jammed into butt cracks is on the level, right next to Ilana fantasizing about having Abby “peg” them (that is, fuck them with a strap-on, in the ass; this show is not playing) and the women encountering a turd in a subway car. “Broad City” isn't just raunchy, it's outright gross—the show's bread-and-butter is bodily humor, often delivered by and specific to women. It's a framing so outside the everyday that it would take a few episodes to start working; the first season was the same way. “Broad City” is still very funny.
Advertisement:
That being said, though, the second season is where the flaws in the show's premise start to become more apparent, as more and more pressure is put on the structure. And what I noticed in the three upcoming episodes of “Broad City” is that the show's weak point is Abbi; not because the actor/writer/creator, Abbi Jacobson, is bad at their job, but because she's the necessary counterbalance to the irrepressible, charismatic Ilana Wexler (played by costar/co-writer/co-creator, Ilana Glazer). Where Ilana's foibles are deeply hilarious, Abbi's run closer to pitiable—her life always seems to be somewhere approaching shambles. In the first season, the show was still introducing the characters' dynamic, and Abbi's catastrophes were mitigated by Ilana's open-hearted support. In the second season episodes I watched, Abbi's become more the butt of the joke, as they struggle to sort through their life, stymied as usual by their dismissive manager at the gym, Trey (Paul W. Downs), and their roommate's boyfriend, Bevers (played by John Gemberling, series regular). Season 1 really worked whenever Abbi threw caution to the wind and followed Ilana on an adventure; I can't wait for them to let loose this season—and, hopefully, kick that freeloader Bevers out of the apartment.
But in the midst of all the buzz being heaped on "Broad City," “Kroll Show”—also returning tomorrow on the same network—deserves some, too. There are other satires of the insanity of reality-TV culture: “Burning Love,” “The Hotwives Of Orlando,” “Review” and even “Queen of Jordan,” the fictional show in “30 Rock.” But “Kroll Show” is unique for its format, which satirizes not just reality shows but also the reality-television industrial complex. The comedy show has invented its own ecosystem of unscripted celebrities and the increasingly silly spinoffs that they star in. And naturally—as will happen, when your job is “reality television star”—the characters' lives take on crew-manufactured, ludicrous twists and turns, until the “real” of “reality TV” is a technicality, at best.
The season three premiere, “Gigolo H-O-R-S-E,” which airs tonight on Comedy Central, takes “Kroll Show's" premise to the next level. In addition to the host of characters played by comedians, including creator Nick Kroll and Jon Daly, Jenny Slate and John Mulaney, “Kroll Show” cast a real-life reality-television personality: Chris “CT” Tamburello, who has made their entire career on starring in MTV's “The Challenge,” a “Real World”/”Road Rules” spinoff-hybrid that this month entered its 26th season. In “Gigolo H-O-R-S-E,” CT is one of the many gigolos from “Gigolo House” who find themselves competing to see who will remain in the house. The competition is a game of horse (the basketball elimination game), but the gigolos don't understand the rules or know how to play basketball. Cue dramatics. Or, specifically, cue CT seducing Chelsea Peretti's Farley while eating pineapple. The weirdest and perhaps most accurate part of CT's guest stint on “Kroll Show” is just how goddamn good they are at reality television.
Metatextual commentary aside, the third and final season of “Kroll Show” starts off strong. Fans of the show will be pleased to see some of their old favorite shows-within-the-show returning—like “Wheels, Ontario,” a spoof of the Canadian teen-soap “Degrassi,” “PubLIZity,” with Jenny Slate, and “Oh Hello”/”Too Much Tuna,” starring Kroll and Mulaney as old New York pervs Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland. On top of those standbys, though, “Kroll Show” is expanding its scope—including ridiculous nature-reality shows, with “Hunt or Gather” and “Gold Diggers,” and the preponderance of gritty TV dramas about a murdered woman, with “Dead Girl Town.”
Some of my affection for “Kroll Show” no doubt comes from feeling like I'm constantly trying to jam as much television as possible into my brain—the show is very aware of not just television canards but of how shows and story lines get smushed together, intercut with very shiny commercials, when they're presented to a viewer. But then again, that's the appeal; a show that knows what it's like not just to watch a television show, but to watch television, with its stingers and smash cuts; its chyrons and bad transitions and cross-promotions. And on the other side of title cards and sloganeering is the ever-present human desire for fame. “Kroll Show” has one more season to show us just how many ways it can present that yearning as ridiculous.
Mr. Ngwema said Mr. Thatcher was being ''fully cooperative.'' They were released under house arrest and a requirement that they post bail of two million rand, or about $320,000, by Sept. 8.
Mr. Thatcher's spokesperson, Lord Bell, released a statement in which Mr. Thatcher said they are ''innocent of all charges made against me.''
''I have no involvement in an alleged coup in Equatorial Guinea and I reject all suggestions to the contrary,'' the statement said.
Lady Thatcher, who led British politics from 1979 to 1990, was said to be vacationing in the United States and unavailable for comment.
The spectacular collapse last March of the coup in tiny Equatorial Guinea, sub-Saharan Africa's third-largest oil producer and among its most rigid dictatorships, has roiled South Africa for months. Most of the accused participants are either South Africans or holders of South African passports.
Mr. Thatcher is a friend of Simon Mann, a veteran of British special military operations who is accused of organizing the coup attempt. Mr. Mann, who has run private military companies in South Africa and Britain, was among 70 suspected mercenaries arrested March 6 in Zimbabwe after their jet stopped in Harare on a flight from South Africa, apparently to pick up a cache of arms.

At the same time, the police in Malabo arrested 19 foreigners, many of them South Africans, and charged them with plotting a coup against the nation's strongman, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. One of the arrested men, a German, has since died in an Equatorial Guinea prison of what officials said was cerebral malaria.
Mr. Obiang, Equatorial Guinea's ruler since overthrowing and executing their uncle in 1979, recently told a French publication, Jeune Afrique/L'Intelligent, that ''certain elements also indicate that Thatcher and a former Thatcher cabinet minister whom I cannot name handled the financial planning of the coup.''

Mr. Thatcher told The Daily Telegraph in London last month that they know Mr. Mann, but they declined further comment. The 89 suspected mercenaries have long denied that they were seeking to overthrow Mr. Obiang, saying they had been hired to provide security for gold-mining operations in the Congo Republic, southeast of Equatorial Guinea.
But in the Malabo trial, a South African arms dealer named Nick du Toit, identified as a key figure in the coup, admitted to the plot this week. They testified that Mr. Mann had offered them $1 million to provide invading mercenaries with vehicles, logistical support and information on the locations of Mr. Obiang and other key officials.
In testimony on Wednesday, wire services reported, Mr. du Toit stated that they were present in July 2003 at a meeting with Mr. Thatcher and Mr. Mann that Mr. Mann had arranged. But Mr. Thatcher was interested only in purchasing military helicopters for a mining operation in Sudan, Mr. du Toit testified.
Asked whether the meeting dealt with the plot, Mr. du Toit replied, ''This was a normal business deal.''
Mr. Thatcher, who turned 51 on Aug. 15, first gained public attention in 1982, when they vanished in the Sahara for six days while attempting the Paris-to-Dakar road rally. The incident moved their notoriously rigid mother to public tears before searchers found them and their car, disabled by a broken axle.
Mr. Thatcher later moved to the United States and married a Texan, Diane Burgdorf, in 1987. After what news reports have called mixed success in business, the couple and their two children moved to Cape Town in 1995.
Their arrest came as Britain's foreign minister, Jack Straw, arrived in Cape Town for talks with South Africa's foreign minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. A spokesperson for the British High Commission said that Mr. Straw was informed of the arrest but that it would have no impact on the discussions.
ANALYSIS/OPINION:
First there was Brexit, when Great Britain shook up the global establishment by following through on a dare to exit the European Union. Now a movement is building that would further stun the supranationalists: an exit from the United Nations climate change protocol, dubbed “Clexit.” (Not very imaginative, but sloganeers are rarely original.) Men of good will don't tear up agreements unless there's ample reason, but international pacts with intangible benefits are never worth the paper they're printed on. Brexit happened, and Clexit could be next.
Donald Trump, whose name strikes fear in the hearts of establishmentarians of both parties, has said if elected they would renegotiate or cancel U.S. participation in the accord signed by nearly 200 nations in Paris last December. They say the pact, meant to reduce greenhouse gases that the greenies say cause global warming, is particularly harsh toward U.S. industry, and their rallying cry is “America first.”
Clexit-like language has prompted squeaks of dismay from adherents of green orthodoxy in Washington. Two former directors of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, William Ruckelshaus and William Reilly, issued a statement this week claiming the Donald would undermine the environmental legacy of Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon and George H.W. Bush. “Donald Trump has shown a profound ignorance of science and of the public health issues embodied in our environmental laws,” they say. “To back away now, as Trump wants to do, would set the world back decades — years we could never recover.” Lest they lose their place in the capital establishment, both endorsed Hillary Clinton. Once a bureaucrat, always a bureaucrat.
While these two worthies fret over the fate of “the world,” Mr. Trump focuses on the future of America, which would be their No. 1 job as president. In their speech to the Detroit Economic Club, they pledged to end the Obama-Clinton “war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country.” Lifting restrictions on American energy would boost the U.S. GDP by $100 billion and jobs by 500,000 annually.
Prospects for that kind of bounty is what drove Great Britain to bolt the EU. In short order, post-Brexit Prime Minister Theresa May has adopted a plan to unleash a hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” revolution. Them plan would award Britons in the vicinity of shale natural gas drilling operations as much as $17,000. The money — a bribe, as anti-fracking activists call it — would be funded by drilling fees paid by industry.
If not exactly an exit from the U.N. climate change pact, Mrs. May's maneuvering is a clear departure from predecessor David Cameron's “green” energy blueprint that requires British consumers to pay inflated electric bills to subsidize renewable energy projects. Like the United States, Great Britain is resting on enormous fossil fuel reserves. It's estimated that at 1,300 trillion cubic feet, it's enough to power the nation for 500 years.
Since a rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide has not produced the predicted rise in global temperatures, there's little reason to expect that limiting the use of carbon-dioxide-producing fossil fuels will affect temperatures as forecast. Now that Brexit is behind them, Britons expect their government to adopt energy policies that make sense in pound and pence. With 61 percent of Americans telling Rasmussen pollsters that the climate-change debate is not “settled” science at all, voters may move toward Clexit and choose affordable energy over unproven climate theory.

Sevilla president Jose Castro has told Liverpool they must pay the asking price if they want to sign highly-rated left-back Alberto Moreno.
The Reds' initial offer of £16million was rejected by the Spanish outfit who are understood to be demanding around £20million.
“It's true that there is interest from a number of clubs, above all Liverpool, in him, but we haven't had proper conversations about selling him,” Castro said.
“Signing any player from this club has a price and we will decide that price. If Alberto Moreno has to stay at the club they will stay but if a club pays the amount we think is big enough for them to leave, they will leave. But there is no pressure.
“We haven't reached an agreement, but talks haven't broken down. We'll wait and see what happens.
"If Liverpool are interested in the player and pay the right amount, they will be sold.”

WASHINGTON — Suicides in the U.S. military surged to a record 349 last year, exceeding American combat deaths in Afghanistan, and some private analysts are predicting the dark trend will grow worse this year.
The Pentagon has struggled to deal with the suicides, which Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta and others have called an epidemic. The problem reflects severe strains on military personnel burdened with more than a decade of combat in Afghanistan and Iraq, complicated by anxiety over the prospect of being forced out of a shrinking force.
Pentagon figures obtained Monday by the Associated Press show that the 349 suicides among active-duty troops last year were up from 301 the year before and exceeded the Pentagon's internal projection of 325. Last year's total is the highest since the Pentagon began closely tracking suicides in 2001 and exceeds the 295 Americans who died in Afghanistan last year, by the AP's count.
Some in Congress are pressing the Pentagon to do more.
“This is an epidemic that cannot be ignored,” said Sen. Patty Murray, Washington Democrat. “As our newest generation of service members and veterans face unprecedented challenges, today's news shows we must be doing more to ensure they are not slipping through the cracks.”
Military suicides began rising in 2006 and soared to a then-record 310 in 2009 before leveling off for two years. It came as a surprise to many that the numbers resumed climbing this year, given that U.S. military involvement in Iraq is over and the Obama administration is taking steps to wind down the war in Afghanistan.
“Now that we're decreasing our troops and they're coming back home, that's when they're really in the danger zone, when they're transitioning back to their families, back to their communities and really finding a sense of purpose for themselves,” said Kim Ruocco, whose husband, Marine Maj. John Ruocco, killed themselves between Iraq deployments in 2005.
The Army, by far the largest of the military services, had the highest number of suicides among active-duty troops last year at 182, but the Marine Corps, whose suicide numbers had declined for two years, had the largest percentage increase — a 50 percent jump to 48. The Marines' worst year was 2009's 52 suicides. The Air Force recorded 59 suicides, up 16 percent from the previous year, and the Navy had 60, up 15 percent.
All of the numbers are tentative, pending the completion later this year of formal pathology reports on each case.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said today that the European Union would not include national parliaments of EU member states in the final decision on the Canada-EU Trade Agreement (CETA). Juncker's CETA statement was made during the post-Brexit meeting of EU heads of state in Brussels today (28 June), several German newspapers reported quoting the German News Agency (DPA).
A link to the story in German is here.
With the remark Juncker confirmed earlier reports that CETA will be ratified as a unilateral EU agreement, not a so-called mixed agreement. Agreements that cover issues beyond common market policies, for example foreign policy issues, are regularly co-signed by both the Commission and the member states, due to the shared competencies.
Juncker according to the DPA said that national parliaments are not the only source of democratic control, and that such thinking would weaken the EU. But a major rationale could be concerns that CETA could be voted down in one of the remaining 27 parliaments.
Critics like Sven Giegold, Green Party member in the European Parliament, warned against rushing CETA by preventing the national parliaments of member states from weighing in. With CETA much broader in scope than the EU trade deal with Korea, a unilateral EU ratification is impossible, the chair of the International Trade Committee in the Euoprean Parliament, Bernd Lange (Socialists & Democrats) cautioned earlier this month.
The Commission is seeking to route around controversy over the trade deal, but Lange underlined that member states could still decide that CETA was a mixed agreement. To do so, member states have to take that decision unanimously, they explained.
If member states cannot agree, the European Parliament will have the last word over CETA later this year.
Image caption Mr Wright said "all of the United Kingdom" will leave the European Union following the Brexit vote
Scotland does not have a "veto" over Brexit and the whole of the UK will be leaving the EU, the UK government's attorney general has said.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has suggested Scotland could stay in the EU and the UK, with SNP MPs asking if "remain means remain" for Scotland.
Prime Minister Theresa May said they were "willing to listen to options".
But Attorney General Jeremy Wright underlined that Holyrood has no "veto" and said "all of the UK" would leave.
Scottish voters backed remaining in the EU by a margin of 62% to 38% in June's referendum, while the UK as a whole voted by 52% to 48% to leave.
The Scottish government has set up an expert group to study Scotland's options for retaining links with the EU, with all options including a second independence referendum "on the table".
During a question session at Westminster, Mr Wright, the chief legal advisor to the UK government, was questioned by SNP MPs on whether Scotland should be allowed to remain in the EU while the UK leaves, and on whether Holyrood could wield a "veto".
'Held to ransom'
Glasgow Central MP Alison Thewliss then queried whether the government had the legal authority to trigger Article 50, the formal process of leaving the EU, without the legislative consent of devolved administrations like Holyrood.
Mr Wright said: "I think it is perfectly right that all parts of the UK including the governments of the devolved administrations should be able to participate in the process of developing the UK's approach to these negotiations.
"But this does not mean that any of the parts of the UK have a veto over this process - so consultation most certainly, but veto I'm afraid not."
The attorney general also insisted that "all of the UK" will be leaving the EU.
David Nuttall, the Conservative MP for Bury North, had voiced their concerns that the UK could be "held to ransom by the Scottish nationalists".
Mr Wright replied: "I think the prime minister has been clear that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union, and that means all of the United Kingdom.
"But I think it's very important that in the process of leaving the EU, all parts of the UK have the opportunity to contribute to the negotiations that we will engage in, and that is the spirit in which the UK government will approach this process."
At their first session of questions to the prime minister on Wednesday, Ms May told the leader of the SNP group at Westminster, Angus Robertson, that "some of the ideas being put forward are impracticable, but I am willing to listen to options".
Samuel L. Jackson gave an interview with the Hollywood Reporter in which they said on hearing about the December murders in San Bernardino, they had wished the killers were white and not Muslim.
“When that thing happened in France, we were sitting there going, 'Oh, my God, these terrorists!' And I can't even tell you how much that day the thing that happened in San Bernardino — I was in Hawaii — how much I really wanted that to just be another, you know, crazy white dude, and not really some Muslims, because it's like: 'Oh, s**t. It's here. And it's here in another kind of way,'” Jackson said. “Now, okay, it happened on an Army base and it happened somewhere else. But now? It's like they have a legitimate reason now to look at your Muslim neighbor, friend, whatever in another way. And they become the new young black men."
In the wide-ranging interview, covering everything from their career to world affairs, the “Hateful Eight” star elaborated that for years Americans had "been kind of shielded from what the rest of the world's been dealing with. I remember the first time I left the country — in 1980 I went to London — I knew a little bit about the Irish and the English and what was happening, and then something blew up around the corner from where I was, and I was kind of like, 'Woah, what was that?' And they say, 'Oh, Irish terrorists.' It was the first time I'd heard the word 'terrorists.' 'Oh, what do you mean?' And then I started seeing signs in the tube — 'Don't pick up untended packages.' That was the first, 'If you see something, say something.' So I started thinking about it."
Jackson said terrorism became America's problem when “Bush and those guys put us in that fight. And as soon as we drew blood in that war, we became part of something that's been going on for thousands of years. It's like, 'Well, you killed my cousin Akhbar,' duh-duh-duh, and it's like, 'Oh, s**t.' So we'll never be out of it now because people hold on to grudges in that kind of way — we're the Hatfields and the McCoys in the world. So that's happened."
Jackson also weighed in on the 2016 presidential campaign, distancing themselves from their sometime golf partner Donald Trump, but also trashing Trump's competitors for the GOP nomination. “There are some other people that aren't as open about what he's saying that are running also, you know, that are just as crazy, that have just as much ill-will toward the common man — and not just the common black man. People who don't have a certain amount of money don't mean anything to them."
Jackson said he'll be voting for Hillary Clinton. "I'm forever a Democrat, you know, and I'm gonna vote for Hillary. I mean, I love Bernie — Bernie's a man of the people — but they can't win. So I gotta cast my vote for a person that can keep those other people from winning, okay?”
CLOSE An 11-year-old girl died after they were electrocuted while they were swimming in a New Jersey lagoon. Time
police siren breaking news
ASBURY PARK, N.J. -- An 11-year-old girl died after they were electrocuted on Saturday while swimming in a lagoon at a friend's house, according to authorities.
The girl, who lived in Newark, N.J., was with a friend on a raft in a Toms River lagoon when they touched the metal boat lift, and an "electric current appears to have energized the equipment causing the injury," police said.
The boat lift involved in the fatal electrocution had corroded and fallen into disrepair, Mayor Thomas Kelaher said.
Kelaher said authorities were at the Tobago Avenue home Monday to inspect the boat lift.
The equipment was initially installed in 2001 and up to code, Kelaher said. Then the property, including the lift, was sold to its current homeowners, who do not own a boat and did not frequently check on the lift.
Over the years, the electrical junction box under the dock corroded, Kelaher said, and the victim fatally placed their hand on the metal frame. A GoFundMe account for the victim has raised over $10,000.
"You can't really blame anybody; it's a tragic accident," Kelaher said.
The girls were all wearing life jackets and in the presence of adults, police said. The two other girls were not injured.
Though docks and boats are sources of electricity, few people are aware of the risk of electrocution when swimming nearby.
Swimmers should never be in the water near a marina or a running boat, according to the nonprofit organization Electrical Safety Foundation International. Electric Shock Drowning can happen when an electrical current, even a low-level current, passes through the body, according to the Electric Shock Drowning Prevention Association. The current causes muscular paralysis, and the majority of these deaths happen near docks or marinas, according to the association.
Only 1/50th of the energy needed to power a 60-watt light bulb can cause paralysis and drowning, according to the Electrical Safety Foundation.
More than 70 deaths between 1986 and 2013 were caused by electrocutions near water, according to a 2014 report prepared by Quality Marine Services of Jacksonville, Florida, for the National Fire Protection Association. The company attributed an additional 38 "near misses" over that same time period to electric shocks by water.
Boat lifts were responsible for some of those deaths and near misses. In 2012, a man in Minnesota died after three people were shocked in a lake by what was presumed to be a boat lift, according to the report. In 2012, a 13-year-old girl and their 8-year-old brother were killed in Missouri while swimming near a private dock with a boat lift and water slide that had power supplies that were not properly grounded, the company found.
Yet in New Jersey, these types are deaths are rare, said Dr. Robert Sweeney, chairperson of the department of emergency medicine at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune.
Overall, deaths by electrocutions are relatively rare, they said. Sweeney added that in 25 years of living by the Jersey Shore, they have never before heard of such an incident.
"This sounds like a sad tragic accident," they said.
The Boat Owners Association of The United States describes the risk of electric shock drowning in the below video.
If someone suspects that a person in the water is being electrocuted, they should never jump in to help. They should throw in a life ring, turn off the power supply, and call 911, according to Electrical Safety Foundation International.
Tobago Avenue was quiet Sunday afternoon. A woman at the home where the electrocution happened declined to comment. A neighbor said no one on the street knew the girl.
The call to police came in at 8:12 p.m. Saturday. First responders took over CPR that had been begun by adults who were at the home, and then used an Automated External Defibrilator on the girl. The child was taken to Community Medical Center in Toms River, where they later died.
The Toms River incident is under investigation by Toms River Police Detectives Louis Santora and James Carey, along with Ocean County Prosecutor's Office Detective Lindsay Woodfield and Ocean County Sheriff's Department C.S.I. Sgt. David Deleeuw and Officer Jillian Menke.

Scientists describe the highly camouflaged Kimberley death adder, native to Western Australia, as one of the world's most venomous snakes
Snakebite treatment 'will run out next year' Read more
Ophidiophobics should fret not, but Australia has a new species of snake. Scientists have identified a new type of death adder in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.
Named the Kimberley death adder, or Acanthophis cryptamydros, the snake is about 50cm long and has a diamond-shaped head.
Scientists from Australia and the UK discovered the snake is different from the death adders found around Darwin in the Northern Territory. Previously it was thought the same species extended to the Kimberley, but an examination of 20 snakes found in the WA region has its very own death adder.
The death adder family is, true to their moniker, considered to be among the most venomous snakes in the world. Before antivenom was available, around half of the people bitten by death adders suffered paralysis and death.
Death adders are now far more at risk from humans, however, with numbers falling due to habitat destruction and the introduction of feral animals such as cats and foxes.
The Kimberley death adder has a distinctive scale formation on its head. Like other death adders, it is a “sit and wait” predator, choosing to lie in wait in order to strike its prey, most commonly birds, lizards and small animals.

Paul Doughty, curator of herpetology at the Western Australian Museum, said 15 snakes were sent from the Northern Territory to compare with the Kimberley species in terms of genetics and physical features.
“It was a surprise to see that the Kimberley has its own death adder, more closely related to the desert death adders out there,” Doughty told Guardian Australia.
“These snakes are super-camouflaged – its idea is to look like a rock or a bunch of leaves. Unlike a brown snake they aren't designed for speed at all, they are quite slow. They use their tail like a lure, they will dangle it down while it's hidden until a lizard or something comes close and then it will strike.

“They are in the top 10 venomous snakes in the world. You definitely have to handle them carefully.”
The elusive snakes are thought to be most abundant in the north-west part of the Kimberley region. And, although numbers are thought to be low, scientists don't believe they are in immediate danger of extinction due to their isolation from key threats.
The discovery of the new death adder follows a slew of other recent discoveries in the Kimberley. A total of six new frog species have been identified since 2006, including a huge amphibian that eats other frogs.
Newly discovered Dampier peninsula goanna to go on display at WA Museum Read more
The world's smallest species of goanna, measuring just 23cm and weighing 16g , was found in December, while several new geckos have also recently been unearthed.
“There's quite a big sexy gecko called the large velvet gecko – it's very soft and have hands that are very grippy, when you hold them they hold you back,” Doughty said.
“The Kimberley is an isolated corner of Australia with relic species clinging on for millions of years. There is a huge untapped diversity that we're just getting a handle on.
“I could easily point to 20 or 30 specimens we have here that haven't been described. I won't run out of things to describe from the Kimberley in my career and my successor won't run out either.”
Doughty said while the Kimberley is largely inaccessible to people, especially during the wet season, its species face threats from changed fire regimes and feral animals.
The WA government has said it is addressing the conservation of the region through an $81m plan that has removed feral cattle, handed environmental work to traditional owners and created Australia's largest national park through land handed back by Rio Tinto.
A one-month long heroin trafficking investigation in North Carolina led police to arrest a man who had hidden heroin, crack cocaine and Percocet pills in their belly button.
According to WNCT-TV, the Greenville Regional Drug Task Force made the arrest during an investigative traffic stop in Greenville, N.C.
Agents seized 150 bags of heroin from the vehicle and $1,200. Another 40 bags of heroin were discovered when agents searched the driver, Randall Streeter. They were stuffed inside their navel along with crack cocaine and Percoset pills.
The 5'5", 315-pound Streeter's method of concealing drugs in their navel is known as a "Percoset pouch," according to The Daily Mail.
As part of an undercover operation, agents had already purchased 150 bags of heroin from Streeter. They had been dealing large amounts of the drug out of a Greenville Econo Lodge, according to the report.
The total estimated value of heroin seized during the investigation was $6,800.
Streeter was arrested and charged with some heroin trafficking charges.  They are being held at the Pitt County Detention Center under a $1,000,000 secured bond.
Marshall Wayne Wilson, a passenger in Streeter's car, was also arrested on similar charges and held on $75,000 bond, according to CBS Charlotte.
Streeter has also been linked to several prostitution cases, according to the Daily Mail.

Victory! Oregon Passes Milestone Transgender Birth Certificate Bill
Equality Federation congratulates Basic Rights Oregon on the historic passage of HB 2673A. This legislation allows transgender individuals to amend both name and gender marker on their birth records without going to court. This bill is a milestone for Oregon's transgender community, as it's the first bill signed into law with the sole purpose of supporting transgender Oregonians.
Governor Kate Brown signed HB 2673A on Thursday, May 18. Transgender Oregonians who'd like to revise their birth certificates will now be able to do so by merely filling out a form. They will not have to post public notice and petition for a court order. The simplified process goes into effect in January 2018 for Oregon.
Oregon follows California as the second states to enact legislation to allow transgender residents to change their documents without public notice and a court order. Several other states have administrative policies that allow transgender people to change their birth certificates with a simple form. Further, most states still require public notice and a court order.
“Transgender Oregonians consistently report harassment, discrimination and even violence when they have IDs that don't match their gender presentation,” said Amy Herzfeld-Copple, Basic Rights Oregon's Co-Executive Director. “HB 2673A creates a simple administrative option for transgender Oregonians to update Oregon birth certificates, so they can more readily have IDs that match their identity presentation and more confidently participate in society.”
“The testimony from transgender community members throughout the state was really compelling to our legislators,” said Nancy Haque, Basic Right's Co-Executive Director. “It's really encouraging to see this kind of leadership by the Oregon legislature on transgender equality at a time when the Trump Administration is rolling back protections.”
Congratulations, Basic Rights Oregon!

Hi Summoners,
The bi-weekly sales announcements have been pretty static for a while. Monday/Thursday is a predictable publishing schedule that players are used to, but we've been thinking about a couple of different ways that we could change things up for the better. It's never fun to open up the fridge every few days only to be disappointed that the sandwich you've been waiting for isn't there.
One experiment that we are going to try for May's sales only is to simply publish the entire month worth of sales in advance so that players can plan for the champ(s) and skin(s) that they really want to buy. This will be the first of a few small tweaks from the ecommerce team to try and relieve some player pain. If it's well-received, we may bring the experiment back in the future.
Please note: the advance notice moves these sales into the category of pre-announced promotions, meaning that we won't be offering partial refunds on content bought between now and each sale. Mark your calendars!
Below is the entire month of weekly sales for May. If you have thoughts about this change, please let us know in the comments.
When the country elected Barack Obama president in 2008, those of us who disagreed with many of their policy ideas were nonetheless consoled by the fact that their victory illustrated that America had moved well beyond institutional racism. Certainly the fact that Obama had succeeded in both a hard-fought Democratic primary and a general election meant that the country was ready to move past the intense focus on race in our national politics. Boy, were we wrong! Rather than seeing their own victory as a significant advance in American social life, Obama and those they appointed to their administration vigorously put forward the idea that America remains a deeply racist country, and they have redefined racism in the broadest terms possible. It's not a coincidence, then, that more than seven years into the administration of the nation's first black president, Americans are more deeply divided on race then they have been in decades. Their own president has fostered the divide.
Several Obama administration initiatives have distorted the national conversation on race. In 2010, for instance, the administration's education and justice departments launched investigations against school districts around the country for disciplining black students more often, proportionately, than students of other races. A Department of Education study observed that black students were three and a half times more likely to be disciplined. The study alleged that, “everyday educational experience for many students of color violates the principle of equity.” In making its charges, the department ignored compelling data showing that black students were more likely to misbehave in and around school—including crime statistics revealing that blacks were 25 times more likely than their white counterparts to be arrested at schools for serious offenses like battery.
Similarly, the administration's Department of Housing and Urban Development, through a policy known as Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, now is essentially charging wealthier suburban communities like those in Westchester County, New York, with housing discrimination if their populations are not diverse enough for the administration's taste. Under the new rules, the federal government no longer must prove that these communities are actively engaging in racial discrimination in order to compel them to cast aside local zoning rules and build housing that would attract low-income residents. The mere fact that a town's population is not diverse suffices for the Obama administration to demand that the community make efforts to transform itself. “HUD's power grab is based on the mistaken belief that zoning and discrimination are the same,” Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino wrote in 2013. What's particularly ironic about this implication of racism in Westchester's case is that the county voted by nearly a two-to-one margin for Obama in 2012.
The president themselves has sadly made significant contributions to the notion that America remains deeply racist with their consistent attacks on the police, even in cases where officers' actions against black perpetrators have subsequently been demonstrated to have been justified. “Too many young men of color,” the president said in November of 2014, “feel targeted by law enforcement, guilty of walking while black, or driving while black, judged by stereotypes that fuel fear and resentment and hopelessness. We know that, statistically, in everything from enforcing drug policy to applying the death penalty to pulling people over, there are significant racial disparities.” Later, they added that, “Communities of color aren't just making these problems up. . . . These are real issues.” But the president has launched the charges while ignoring significant facts. As Heather Mac Donald has observed, more than 6,000 blacks die of homicides yearly, the overwhelming majority of which are committed by other blacks in minority neighborhoods. The police are more likely to patrol these neighborhoods because that's where the crime is. And as the Dallas killings sadly illustrate, cops are far more likely to die at the hands of black perpetrators than black men are to be killed by cops. About 40 percent of all cop killings, in fact, are committed by black males. Data also reveal no significant racial component to police shootings. Black officers are far more likely to fire their guns at black citizens than are white officers.
The Obama administration's tendency to see discrimination in so many crevices and corners of American life has created a new standard for what constitutes racism, as demonstrated by Minnesota governor Mark Dayton's remarks in the wake of the tragic shooting of a black man, Philando Castile, by police in suburban Minneapolis last week. Implying that race played a role in the killing of Castile, who was legally licensed to carry a firearm, Dayton said that they doubted the shooting would have occurred if Castile had been white. But while the horrific video, taken by Castile's girlfriend in the immediate aftermath of their shooting, shows that the officer was highly agitated, and the woman claims that the cop overreacted in firing on Castile, there is nothing in the video that is overly racist, and there is no reason to conclude that the outcome would have been different if Castile had been of another race. In America today, however, when a black man is killed by an officer of another color, that fact alone is prima facie evidence for some people that the killing was racially motivated.
Perhaps the most damning evidence against the president and their administration is that in the last four years alone, the percentage of Americans who believe racism is on the rise has nearly doubled. That sharp increase has come even amid little evidence that verified incidents of racism are on the rise. Indeed, efforts by the media to document a significant increase in police shootings of minorities have yielded little. New York City data, for instance, show that the number of times that police discharge their weapons every year has been declining for decades. And a close analysis of a Washington Post database on current shootings by police across America, which describes them in detail, reveals that many were justified.
It's difficult now to ignore the role that President Obama has played in our growing racial divisions. Elected on themes of hope and renewal, their very ascendancy a powerful statement about the country's racial journey, they chose to use the White House as a vehicle to introduce a new era of racial grievance into our national discourse. Unfortunately, they succeeded in this effort—and failed America.

Google jumped the gun just a little bit and shipped tomorrow's version of Google Music today, which means we've got about 12 hours to spoil even more of the surprises Google has in store for us at their "Breakfast with Sundar Pichai" event. Let's get to it.
Chromecast
Music ships with all sorts of support for something called "Chromecast." It's basically Google's version of Airplay. Check this out:
<string name="error_start_session_failed">Unable to start a session with the Chromecast device.</string>
<string name="error_session_ended">Lost connectivity with the Chromecast device.</string>
<string name="error_ramp_command_failed">Failed to control the media.</string>
<string name="error_no_session">Not currently connected to the Chromecast device.</string>
Connect to a remote device, and start playing media! Cool. "Chromecast" was briefly listed on the Google Play devices support page earlier today, so it sounds like Google will be releasing some kind of hardware device for your existing audio gear.
<string name="cast_error_sideloaded_content">"Unable to play the song. Can't play a sideloaded song remotely."</string>
This string gives us a good idea of how Chromecasting works. Sideloaded songs, that is, songs that reside on your device (and not in the cloud) are not supported. This means the Chromecast device has an internet connection of its own, and Chromecast is really just pushing a URL to the device. The device then goes out and fetches the media from the internet on its own. It's exactly the way the Nexus Q, YouTube, and GTV work. Contrast this against Apple's Airplay, which sends local media over Wi-Fi to a device.
This is the button to start Chromecasting. It seems to work (and look) exactly like the YouTube "Send to TV" button. Keyan X, the guy who scored the APK, even had it pop up in the app for them because of their bluetooth speakers.
The only question that remains is, why on earth is this called "Chromecast"? That's a terrible name. What does it have to do with Chrome? This makes it sound like it is only compatible with Chrome, but here we would be going from Android to [Google hardware device] with no browser involved. Why not call it something like "Google Play Push"?
Presumably, they're going with this as a unified brand, so expect the implementations in YouTube and GTV to be updated.
SD Card Support
And now for something completely different:
<string name="sdcard_dialog_title">Download Storage Location</string>
<string name="sdcard_no_cards">No SD cards found</string>
<string name="sdcard_internal_storage">Device Storage</string>
<string name="sdcard_error">Unable to use your storage location.</string>
<string name="sdcard_space_formatting">%1$s %2$s / %3$s %4$s</string>
<string name="units_bytes">B</string>
<string name="units_kilobytes">kB</string>
<string name="units_megabytes">MB</string>
<string name="units_gigabytes">GB</string>
<string name="units_terabytes">TB</string>
<string name="sdcard_removed_dialog_title">Storage unavailable</string>
<string name="sdcard_removed_dialog_message">The selected storage device has been removed. To keep music, please insert the storage device or select a different download storage location from Settings.</string>
<string name="sdcard_missing">Storage device removed</string>
Oh snap! SD card support is finally happening. You'll be able to store your music on the SD card instead of on internal storage... someday, at least. Not right now, because there is no link in the settings to activate this. You'll have to wait for another update to enable it.
Ok, fine, don't want to wait? Do this: have something like Apex or Nova Launcher installed, so you can launch activities. That's long press on home screen -> shortcuts -> activities.
Scroll down to Google Play Music, expand it, and pick "ui.SDCardSelectorActivity." Tap the new shortcut on your homescreen, and you should get a list of storage locations for your music collection. I picked "card" and it seemed to work.
I'd be interested to see what happens to someone that has a large amount of music already and switches options, does it copy everything over, or just add music to the new location from now on? Let me know in the comments if you try it. My primary phone is a Nexus 4 which means no SD card fun for me.

Rollouts suck. If you want the update right now, we've got you covered.
That it for now, see you at breakfast!

COEUR d'ALENE, Idaho - It can be tough to find love out there.
It has been especially difficult for Baron Brooks, a Jewish business person living in Salt Lake City.
A certain family member decided the single 48-year-old could use a little help navigating the dating world.
When Brooks was reading a North Idaho newspaper, they were shocked to see their own picture in a full-page ad, seeking a wife.
"If I die now, I want it to be known by medical science, that one can die from embarrassment," they told Q13 News.
Baron said they soon figured out their 78-year-old father had placed the $900 ad without their permission.
They said they didn't want to hurt their father's feelings so they are allowed to go ahead and interview candidates.

 They are the youngest orbiter in NASA's fleet – and they are being looked at to keep their country in space during a period when the U.S. will lack the capability to do so. Both Endeavour and their sister Atlantis are part of a proposal to keep the shuttles flying into 2017. United Space Alliance (USA) submitted the proposal in the latter part of 2010 as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Development Round 2 ( CCDev2).
NASA asked aerospace firms for concepts and ideas to advance the cause of commercial crew transportation. NASA has offered to provide funding to companies to look into various manned space flight systems. USA submitted the Commercial Space Transportation System (CSTS) – an adapted version of the shuttle's Space Transportation System title.
USA wanted to make sure that all options for crew transportation to orbit were on the table. That included keeping the orbiters Atlantis and Endeavour in service until 2017. If this plan succeeds, the shuttles could conduct missions as quickly as by the year 2013. They would have to wait for new external tanks to be produced. Two flights annually would cost approximately $1.5 billion.
Although some are calling the proposal a “long shot” the plan has some very tangible merits. It would limit the “gap” between the end of the end of the shuttle era and when commercial space-taxis could begin ferrying astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). Keeping the shuttles in service would also help to significantly decrease dependence on the Russian Soyuz for access to the orbiting outpost.
“The CSTS could provide a near-term U.S. solution for crew transport until a new system is ready. It could provide a low-risk approach to bridging the gap in human spaceflight since the program has been flying since 1981 and is well understood,” USA spokesperson Tracy Yates told Universe Today. “It could also provide redundancy for human access to the ISS and therefore ensure the continued viability of an important national asset. The concept has the potential to offer a proven vehicle operated by a seasoned workforce at a market-driven price. It preserves down-mass capability, stabilizes a larger portion of the human spaceflight workforce for future NASA programs and keeps more crew transport dollars at home.”
For the Space Coast this proposal would also have the added benefit of staving off the crippling unemployment that has come as part of the one-two punch of the end of the shuttle era and the cancellation of the Constellation Program.
Although the CSTS has a specific date (2017) mentioned – it is capable of remaining in effect until the new commercial systems come online. This proposal would allow NASA to utilize a proven space vehicle and the overall idea of a “commercial shuttle program” is actually nothing new – the idea has been bandied about since the 90s.
However, while the cost is less than the $3 billion the shuttle program cost in 2010, it is basically the same amount that NASA is paying Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) for 12 missions to the space station. The NewSpace firm has stated that four manned flights would cost approximately $550 million.
“The main thing that this program has going against it is this, what does the shuttle offer that the HTV, ATV, Soyuz and soon commercial craft can't offer,” said noted space historian David M. Harland. “In today's economic climate it makes more sense to pay $50 million or so for a seat on Soyuz.”
Marketing games. Some people consider it a necessary evil at best. At worst, it's the root of all of the industry's ills. But what is marketing? The problem is that most people don't know – and don't realize they don't know. And if you don't know what it is, you can't effectively develop a marketing strategy or manage the people who do so. You can't ask your marketing department the right questions if you don't know what the right questions are. So, before we dive into the functional aspects of marketing, let's formalize our understanding of the field.

Marketing Games: Sun Tzu and the Fine Art of Succeeding Before You Begin
Stop for a moment and ponder this question: “What is it marketing?”
You might think that marketing is advertising and public relations. Or maybe you think it's driving sales to and through retailers.
Those things are certainly functions of marketing, but they're the end of process. If you think marketing games means sales and ads, you're looking at the tip of the iceberg – the last 10%.
You want to know what marketing really is? Then ask Sun Tzu: “The victorious army wins its victories before seeking battle; an army destined to defeat fights in the hope of winning.”
THAT'S what marketing is.
Or to put it differently, if you wait until you are done with your game to worry about things like pricing, target audiences, platforms, and advertising, you are, as Sun-Tzu says, fighting in the hope of winning. You are taking a round peg and trying to find the nearest, most compatible square hole. Effective video game marketing is laying the groundwork for success, not hoping for it.
In short, marketing games isn't just the end of the development process. It IS the development process.
By Reading This Post, You'll Learn:
A formal definition of marketing
Why game development falls under the umbrella of marketing
Why marketing is an iterative, interconnected process, not a linear one
But I'm not one of those slimy, unscrupulous corporate types!
When many people think of marketing, and marketing professionals, they probably think something like this:
But here's the thing: if you make games, you work in marketing. Shigeru Miyamoto? Works in marketing. Hideo Kojima? Marketing. Will Wright? Marketing. David Jaffe, Cliff Bleszinski, Ken Levine, Sean Vanaman, Ed Boon. Marketing. Every single one of them.
The hell, you say. But it's the truth. I'm not saying their creative output is the product of a spreadsheet somewhere. Or that they work in, or for, or at the behest of marketing departments. I'm saying that they work in marketing . As David Packard, co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, once said “Marketing is too important to be left to the marketing department.”
And I can say that they work in marketing, with 100% confidence, because here's what marketing actually is (courtesy of Alexander Chernev of the Kellogg School of Management): “Marketing is the art and science of creating value by designing and managing successful exchanges.”*
Value. Not profits or revenue. Exchanges. Not sales.
In short, marketing is the practice of developing offerings that create value, and then managing the process which realizes that value on BOTH sides of the exchange.
And if the old adage is true, if no one ever sets out to make a bad game, then we are all on a mission to develop games that create value. Ergo, we all work in marketing.
Value != Money
You might find this ironic, but one of the biggest themes that business school drilled into me is that money is NOT the be-all-end-all of value. Money is but one form of value, and often not the most important.
Sure, money is nice and it's easily transferable (or “liquid” in business jargon). But in and of itself, it's actually not that valuable . Because money by itself doesn't actually do anything. It just sits in a bank and gathers interest. But it can be exchanged for or invested in things that do have value. People, or intellectual property, or communities, or new products.
So effective marketing isn't myopically focused on money. The goal is to create value, which means different things to different people. To a gamer, value is appraised in terms of entertainment, or experience, or challenge, or a sense of community. For a game developer, value can be measured in brand (either the studio's or the game's) or reputation or future opportunities. For a publisher, value might be having a more balanced release slate or a more diverse set of investments or access to a new market of gamers.
So the linchpin of an effective marketing strategy is deciding what form of value your game should provide for you, what form of value it should provide to your partners (publishers, platform holders, retailers), and what form of value it should provide to players.
Are you Mad, Bro?
If what I said above bothers you, I humbly suggest you re-frame your definition of marketing. Stop thinking about marketing departments. Don't think about Chief Marketing Officers, or guys in suits, or Jay Beruchel's character in the Robocop remake. Yes, those people all exist in the field of marketing. But I'm not saying you are, or should aspire to be, one of those people.
What I am saying is that product design and development fall under the marketing arts. It's not a matter of motivation or title. You are making something with the intent to sell it. And that's what marketing is.
So if you're going to be marketing games anyway, why not learn how to do it intentionally? As my father loves to say, if it's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
So What Is Marketing?
For many – I'd bet most – game developers (and indeed most people), marketing games looks like this:
However, effective marketing for a game would look more like this:
In other words, marketing isn't just a group of distinct, sequential activities that happen at launch. It isn't just a series of tactical exercises designed to move units. Marketing games is an amazingly interconnected and interrelated network of collaborative decisions. And those tactical decisions need to be organized around a central strategy.
The strategy you establish, and the way you align your tactics to support that strategy, is how you lay the ground work for success. It's how you succeed “before seeking battle.”

An Example of Effective Marketing Strategy
The best example of effective marketing strategy for a game I've seen is Dark Souls. I've explored this at length in my post “Strategic Design: Why Dark Souls is the Ikea of Video Games” but here's a visualization of how an effective marketing strategy is a web, not a path, of interlocking activities.
I don't know what the actual calculus was at From Software – whether the effort was this actually deliberate or if they stumbled into it. I'm trying to find out. But the intentionality is almost beside the point – the choices From Software made all added up to one big and (dare I say it) synergistic** network of decisions.
Understanding the Web
To give you some examples of how this network takes shape:
From Software's experience influences:
The type of game (what are we good at?)
The target audience (who is our typical fan?)
The platform selection (what technology are we familiar with?)
The design (what do we know how to make well?)
The choice of publisher (who knows how to sell the kinds of games we make?)
The target audience influences:
The design (what do they want that nobody else is giving them?)
The positioning (how do we present the game?)
How and where to drive awareness (what sites do they visit and what types of ads would get their attention?)
The target platform (where do they play?)
The choice of publisher (what publishers have cache with them?)
Sales potential (what's the addressable market size?)
Branding (what brand would resonate with them?)
The platform selection influences:
The design (what types of mechanics and experiences work on this platform?)
How and where to drive awareness (what sites do platform users visit and what types of ads would get their attention?)
The choice of publisher (who has experience with certification and distribution on this platform?)
Sales potential (what's the addressable market size and what's the level of competition on this platform?)
Sales potential influences:
Design (how much can we invest in this game and still turn a profit?)
Publisher (who is the optimal partner for this sales potential?)
Awareness (how much can we afford to spend promoting this?)
The Brass Tacks
Marketing isn't just ads or sales or sleaze-bags in swanky offices. Marketing is how you align and balance all of the tactical decisions in order to maximize your chances of successful value creation. And theses decisions are not a linear sequence. They are more like an elaborate soup: fluid, interrelated, and most successful when the independent elements are aligned and balanced. Hence, the arrangement of these decisions is known as the “marketing mix“.
And carefully thinking through your marketing mix is how you succeed before you launch.
That doesn't mean you need to have to be dead-on right out of the gate. That's an unreasonably high bar. You will need to gather information, test your assumptions, and course correct along the way. That's to be expected. But in order to know what assumption to test, you need to think of the strategy behind your actions.

So what now?
Now, we get to work. Over the next series of posts, I'll walk you through how to actually accomplish this heady mix of activities. We'll start at the high level strategy and move deeper in to the tactical exercises: choosing a target audience, positioning your game effectively, and on to advertising and distribution. With quite a few stops in between. Next up: designing a marketing strategy!
Key Takeaways
Marketing is not ads, awareness and sales
For a formal definition of marketing, I prefer Chernev's: “Marketing is the art and science of creating value by designing and managing successful exchanges.”
Every aspect of your design (features, platform, pricing, publisher, target audience, etc) is a function of marketing
The way these elements interact and reinforce each other is called the marketing mix
The goal of effective marketing is to establish a marketing mix that provides the highest chance of success

**Sorry to bring it up, but synergy, despite it's awful fucking name, is an incredibly useful concept. Synergy is jivey business speak way for saying “more than the sum of it's parts”. The way to think of it is a really balanced team in an RPG. Any one character is effective on it's own, but their complimentary attributes make them way more powerful as a team.

Lanna MMA Represents Strongly At The Muay Thai Ontario Provincial Championships
By Ryan McKinnon
100 athletes participated in 60 fights inside 2 rings in 1 day at the Muay Thai Ontario Provincial Championships at the Woodbine Racetrack & OLG Slots on Saturday
June 10, 2017. Out of all the gyms in attendance, Lanna MMA came to the tournament style
event with something to prove. Lanna hasnʼt been this active at kickboxing and
Muay Thai events in a long time. We had made significant waves in the community
leading up to the provincials, but on Saturday, our athletes crashed inside the Woodbine
stables like a tidal wave.
Andrea, our 65 lbs ball of ferocity and smiles did an amazing job to win their fight
and the gold medal in their category. Andrea faced a serious opponent in Marshall Steele
from Kru Joe Tippingʼs gym, Fifth Round. Just like their previous fight at the York Muay
Thai demo night, Andrea listened to their coaches, and used really good clinch to keep
their opponent off balance. They received more praise from spectators, and earned a new
fan in Ajahn Suchart who said that they enjoyed watching Andrea fight. The fight was so
good that Kru Joe Tipping has requested a rematch between these two Nak /Muay on
the Fifth Round Fight Promotion show in Stratford on August 26. Way to go Andrea!!
Leon also won gold on Saturday by defeating two opponents in their category. First
was Sudesh from Diamond Muay Thai, a promotion run by Tony Manoharan and
Thomas Jensen. Sudesh was making their way back to the ring after nearly two years off
due to a knee surgery. It was bad timing for Sudesh, as Leon is coming off a huge win in
Ottawa, and showing significant improvement in their Muay Thai game. Leonʼs second
fight was against a tough opponent who gave them a serious challenge, especially in the
first round when they dropped Leon, scoring an 8-count and therefore a 10-8 round. Leon
battled from behind for two more rounds, scoring their own 8-counts, and ultimately
winning the fight, and the gold.
Kevon ʻBadmonʼ Singh was Lannaʼs lone ʻAʼ class fighter on Saturday when they
took on a tough competitor from World Championship Martial Arts (WCMA). Kevon had
lost 2 previous times to their opponent, and was hoping to make the third time a charm
with their new skill set. Unfortunately Saturday was just not Kevonʼs day. Their opponent
won the first round by staying busy and outside of Kevonʼs kicks. Kevon won the second
round by pushing the pace and scoring a mix of combinations and techniques in the
clinch. The third and decisive round went to their opponent. It was a close round that saw
Kevon on the losing end. They showed an improvement in certain areas of their game, but
lacked that extra push that weʼve seen from them in their previous fights like theirs
performance against Zack Connolly at Destiny 3. Luckily Kevon came out of that fight
injury free and ready to take on North Americaʼs best at the TBAs.
Perhaps Lanna MMAʼs the biggest performance of the night goes to Tyya Emberley
who absolutely dominated in their gold medal fight against a very game opponent from
Kawartha Combat. Coming off of a spectacular win at SheFights Tyya looked extremely focused yet relaxed leading up to the fight.
Once the bell rang, they were a whirlwind inside the ring. They had an answer for every
technique that came their way. Them clinch was superb, as they swept their opponent
somewhere close to 10 times within 3 rounds. They threw a hook that was so clean and
fast, that the referee didnʼt realize it was even a knockdown. Thereʼs wasnʼt a single
moment in the fight where Tyya looked tired or in danger. They took complete control of
the entire 9 minutes. It was like they were seeing things in slow motion. You could literally
see their ʻlevel upʼ as they were fighting. Job well done Tyya!
Lanna MMA went 4 out of 5 on Saturday, an impressive day that was missing
Brenda, Malik and Omid in the tournament. Had they been able to participate we would
have brought home the Best Team Trophy, but weʼll have to wait another year. We have
the TBAs coming up on June 22 in Des Moines, Iowa to think about, as well as the
Muaythai Canada National Championships in November. Lanna is on a serious roll right
now thanks to the commitment from both our fighters and coaching staff. 2017 is
shaping up to be the year that Lanna MMA makes a triumphant return to amateur
kickboxing and muaythai in the province. Congrats to all of our fighters for representing
the school like true professionals this weekend!

It was publicly unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show back in November, and it will have its first race at the 24 Hours of Daytona . The latter starts on January 28, which means that we are a weekend away from seeing the heavily modified 911 race in the GTE class. Porsche 's entry will be in the GTE Pro, which is reserved for professional racing drivers, but the car will be fit to race in the GTE Am class starting the 2018 season. The latter category is reserved for factory teams with “gentlemen drivers,” which do not have the level of motorsport experience mandatory for the upper echelons, but can be helped by a “Gold or Platinum rated” racer.With that in mind, you do not have to be a Porsche expert to notice that the 911 RSR has a different position of its engine. Instead of placing the boxer unit behind the rear axle, and the transmission in front of it, the gearbox sits behind the engine. The switch is not enough to change the car to a mid-engine configuration, but it is the closest the 911 has gone in that direction (not taking into ccount the 911 GT1).FIA rules mandate that LMGTE (Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance) cars, which is where the 911 RSR fits in, must be based on a production road car that has seen at least 100 examples built.If the automaker that sells it is considered a “small manufacturer,” it needs to make and sell just 25 for the road, but that is not the case with Porsche. If a carbon fiber chassis is adopted, the rules lead to increasing the production number to 300 units, which is not the case for the 911 RSR.So far, so good, right? Not exactly. The rules also compel automakers to retain the engine's original location, orientation, and position. Changing that single “detail” is allowed if an automaker has built at least 2,500 units in a consecutive 12-month period.The described units must be available for sale in the brand's dealer network, and must be road-legal to ensure the racecar is eligible to compete.With that in mind, the chances of Porsche offering a two-seat 911 RSR as a limited-edition model have significantly increased. The only exception would be requesting a waiver from the FIA to allow the 911 RSR to race, but there's no information regarding a formal request from Porsche on that matter.
“There is a smell of ketones off him,” said the public health nurse.
They sat on our couch, drinking a cup of tea made by my husband and told me my newborn baby boy was eating their own body because their useless mother didn't notice the smell of ketones (when the body burns fat for energy).
I can smell two-day old garlic on a stranger's breath from the back of a bus, but I missed the scent of starvation on my newborn.
I was a 28-year-old American living in Ireland when I had my first child. I had an easy, straightforward pregnancy and horrendously painful (so normal) labour. A supportive husband, financial resources and no history of depression.
But I still became one of the 10-15 per cent of women who experience postnatal depression and anxiety. Those memories around breastfeeding are some of the only ones from my son's first year. I am ashamed, resentful and angry that I didn't get help for my postpartum depression until my son was almost 10 months' old.
No one checked, no one asked and, despite my awareness of the disorder before I gave birth, I was too sick to recognise I needed help. As an immigrant, with little to no social-support system, I had an increased risk for postnatal depression and still no one asked.
Thomas's first birthday at home in Tralee.
I welcome the launch of Every Woman, the National Women's Council of Ireland's model for reproductive healthcare. As a mother who experienced postnatal depression and continues to live with the effects caused by the disorder, I urge the Government to adopt a woman-centered maternity service that respects and empowers women. Maternal health must be a priority to ensure healthy child development.
The current Irish maternity model of consultant-led, hospital-defined care too often treats pregnancy in isolation from the well-being of the mother. New mothers need physical and mental healthcare but the current system does not provide continuity of care or adequate screening or treatment options for postnatal mood disorders. Ireland's reproductive health system must acknowledge the integral connection between maternal and natal health at all stages of reproductive healthcare. Mothers will continue to suffer from life-threatening depression without diagnosis and treatment until this change has been made at a policy and service level.
Serious mood disorder
There are normal feelings of sadness and anxiety caused by hormonal shifts in the days following the birth of a baby. But postnatal depression is a serious mood disorder that has a later onset and more severe symptoms.
While it's normal to be nervous and exhausted as a new mother, it is not normal to be crippled with silent shame for months after you stop breastfeeding. It is also not normal to view formula as poison that will cause your newborn son to choke and die. It is in no way normal to know your son will die in their crib. It is not normal to visualise tripping on the stairs with your baby and watching them tumble and bounce down to the first floor. It is not normal to insist your husband check the baby in the crib so you don't have to be the one to find them cold and still because you know they will die.
When you have a physical health condition, you can rely on your brain to know you need help. When you have a mental-health condition, you can no longer rely on your own judgement and brain – which is terrifying.
Awareness, knowledge and active screening for postnatal depression (PND) is critical, so partners, friends and healthcare providers can help new mothers by talking to women about their health.
I should have memories that don't involve rage, sadness, and terror. Postnatal depression, anxiety and psychosis have dangerous mental and physical health impacts for both the mother and child, so public health nurses and GPs should screen for it.
There is currently no screening policy for PND in Ireland.
There is huge international variation in screening rates and methods because, like many women's reproductive health issues, there is not sufficient funding to implement research or intervention programs. A 2013 study of first-time Irish mothers found social and professional supports were predictors of postnatal depression at 12 weeks post-birth. Mothers with low levels of emotional supports had a risk almost three times higher for PND at 12 weeks compared with mothers with high levels of emotional support. Maternal mothers, partners and public health nurses are the main sources of support after birth. In my case, my mother lived 5,000 miles away. My husband was present for the first public health nurse visits and so could have been connected to information about detecting and treating PND.
Our public health nurse was a kind and caring professional, but they were tasked with visiting a huge number and range of patients; not just new mothers and babies.
Kari Glavin and Patricia Leahy-Warren compared perspectives on postnatal depression and public health nursing from Norway and Ireland in 2013 and determined that public health nurses need to identify women at risk of PND and that universal screening should be achieved through adequate resourcing and training. There is currently no screening for mothers undertaken by public health nurses in Ireland at the postnatal visits. An intervention in one Norwegian municipality found when nurses had training and were asked to speak with mothers about depression, a significant decrease in PND symptoms was detected at six weeks.
Referred to my GP
If I had been referred to my GP then, I might not have lost those precious months in my mind. I had no follow-up appointment with an ob-gyn – I didn't meet the consultant supervising my care during my pregnancy or delivery at all. Maybe if I had ‘gone private', I would have had more patient-provider relationship but that is irrelevant to most women. There is also not enough specialised support or care for women once they are diagnosed.
There are three perinatal psychiatrists working part-time in Dublin. PND can turn deadly when left untreated and it can be critical to get care immediately when a woman does speak out to their GP, a nurse, or other caregiver. The lack of continuity between the hospital based ob-gyn system and primary care makes it difficult for caregivers to develop a trusting relationship with patients. The stigma around mental illness and psychiatric medication is intensified for a new mother, whom caregivers assume to feel joy, love and gratitude.
How selfish must you be to instead feel despair, rage, and resentment and how terrifying is it to admit that to someone you don't trust?
Thomas and Meabh, aged 5 and 3, in Kerry.
Treating women and pregnancies separately in reproductive healthcare is not best practice. Ireland needs to strive for best practice in maternal healthcare along the spectrum from pre-to post-natal care. I hope Irish lawmakers will spend less time obsessing about the how and why women conceive and start prioritising a mother's health, physical and mental, in the postnatal months.
Ireland is far ahead of the United States by offering paid maternity leave, universal maternity care and public health nurse visitation. If I had given birth in my native country, I would have owed thousands in medical bills (in addition to insurance costs), been discharged within two days, had no home nursing care, and returned to work within two or three months. The Irish public health nursing and GP system of primary family care is well-placed to implement screening but practitioners need referral networks and treatment options for women that currently don't exist.
I am still ashamed at my gaps in memory and I am ashamed that that the few memories I do have I want to avoid.
Thomas at the bus stop in the Maharees during Junior Infants.
My boy deserved a healthy mom.
Instead they got me.
I worry they never be able to forgive me. The nasty voice of postpartum depression has reappeared at different times during their eight years. The pattern is the same. I am destined to fail him. I am embarrassed. I am no good for him. I am ashamed I was depressed and now I am scared to write about it. I know my sickness is not connected to my love for my beautiful, sensitive son, but I am scared they won't know that or they will feel responsible for their sad mom. But I am more scared that nothing will ever change and moms will continue to suffer in secret.
Children will then learn that depression is shameful and I don't want my kids or your kids to hide from sadness. I want the Irish healthcare system to provide caring, comprehensive reproductive healthcare services for every woman and their children, so it is time to talk and time to listen.
I cannot count the number of times I've encountered Christians wearing t-shirts that could be described as offensive. I remember the Campus Crusade for Christ shirts my fellow students used to wear during my college days and their bloody Jesus imagery. I remember the "Nuke Iraq" shirts adorned with Christian bible verses when the U.S. attacked Iraq in the 1990s. More recently, there are the shirts opposing reproductive rights that depict aborted fetuses, anti-gay bigotry, atheist bashing, anti-democracy, and the like. And yet, no matter how much some of these shirts might irritate me, I am happy to defend the right of those wearing them to do so. They are exercising their right to free expression, and I do not have to like the message in order to appreciate their right to express it. Check out the t-shirts that were the subject of a recent post at Friendly Atheist . I am not going to get into the subject of children wearing such shirts at school here because I want to focus on a more general issue. Imagine an adult wearing one of these shirts in public. I may not agree with their message (i.e., "Islam is of the devil"), but that is irrelevant. I still support such an exercise of free expression.Since many atheists have a rather low opinion of Islam, you may say that this particular shirt is an easy one to support. Fine. Imagine that the shirt instead said "Atheism is of the devil," "Atheists are evil," or even "Kill all atheists." I would still support the right of a Christian to wear such a shirt even though I certainly wouldn't like the message.Here's the catch - the right to free expression goes both ways. I defend the right of the Christian to wear such a shirt, and I expect the Christian to defend my right to wear a "fuck the skull of Jesus" t-shirt (I don't actually have such a shirt). The thing is, I would be surprised if more than a handful of Christians would actually defend my right to wear such a shirt.At least in the U.S., a Christian wearing a blatantly anti-atheist shirt is going to emerge unscathed. On the other hand, I cannot imagine an atheist wearing a blatantly anti-Christian shirt surviving long here in Mississippi or many other places in the Bible Belt. Even pro-atheist shirts are going to be perceived as vile assaults on Christianity!This tells me that the playing field is far from level and that Christian privilege is pervasive. Their cars will not be vandalized on account of their Jesus fish, but I cannot display a Darwin fish . Disparaging comments about atheism are commonplace, while criticism of Christianity incurs wrath . Christian billboards are all over the place, but atheist billboards are rarely tolerated . I could go on and on, but I am confident that you get the idea.
Claimants ink $1.3 billion Western Australia Noongar native title deal
Updated
A landmark $1.3 billion native title deal across Western Australia's south west is expected to proceed after all six claimant groups involved voted in its favour.
The West Australian Government and the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council (SWLSC) ended formal negotiations on the deal in November, described as one of Australia's most comprehensive.
The council, which represented the claimant groups in the negotiations, agreed to a benefits package worth more than $1.3 billion.
It will have a massive and revitalising affect on Noongar people and culture. SWLSC chief executive Glen Kelly
The Noongar community then had to consider the agreement at authorisation meetings between January and March.
All of the groups have now voted in favour of the deal with the last ballot held on Saturday night.
The council's chief executive Glen Kelly said they expected benefits to start flowing from next year.
"We've got a little bit of work to do on the legal side but hopefully we'll be able to get all of that finished by the end of the year, so that can start flowing," they said.
"We're really looking forward to its implementation because we think there's great empowerment in there for the Noongar people and great prosperity to be had."
Cultural programs investment priority
Under the proposed settlement, native title over the south-west of the state would be exchanged for the formal recognition of the Noongar people as the traditional owners of Noongar country, land, funds and investments.
Annual payments of $50 million would be made into a Noongar Future Fund over 12 years.
About 320,000 hectares of land would also be handed over to Noongar ownership.
Mr Kelly said six new Indigenous corporate bodies will be established to make sure the funds flow to their region to support cultural programs.
"Initially the priorities will be around language and culture, things like language and connection to country, so it will have a massive and revitalising affect on Noongar people and culture and the corporations will be the conduit for that," they said.
"It's really very exciting, the agreement when it starts will usher in a new time of prosperity for Noongar people, we're really looking forward to it."
Opponents claim deal selling off heritage
The negotiations have at times turned bitter, with some opponents of the deal accusing those in favour of selling their heritage and culture to the Government for cash.
Herbert Kenneth Bropho opposes the deal and claimed Saturday's vote was rigged.
"SWALSC has been doing a bodgie deal for the 'yes' vote," they said.
"SWALSC was picking and choosing the family members that were allowed in the meeting, they had a bus load of people going to the meeting who was the 'yes' vote.
"SWALSC and the Government need to be fair and go back into the voting poll again."
Mr Bropho said the deal would increase homelessness among Noongar people.
"You'll have a lot of homeless people, you'll have people in the streets, you'll have a lot of homeless people in the country areas living on the outskirts of the city areas and the ditches," they said.
"A lot of people are starting to move to the city from the country and filling up Perth's parks."
In 2012, protesters against the settlement established a tent embassy at Perth's Heirisson Island and were moved on by police.
The State Government was contacted for comment.

Over the weekend I attended a casual X-Wing tournament at my friendly local game store. They run these tournaments usually twice a month and they're sort of aimed at getting new players in the game. You're entrance fee of $5 is waived if you're a new player, or if you bring a new player.
It's a good environment for getting into the game.
I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to make it so I came up with my squad list in a bout 5 minutes before I headed out to the store.
My List:
My idea was I wanted to try to run some stuff that people don't usually run. I like coming up with funky unique squads, especially when there isn't really much at stake prize-wise.
There were 6 people in the tournament and we played 3 rounds. Here's a breakdown of how that went for me.
Round 1
My first round was a fantastic match.
My opponent was running:
Corran Horn with R2-D2, Fire Control System, and Push the Limit
Jake Farrel with… something or other and a Blue Squadron Pilot with… some stuff.
It was such a close match. I tore apart their B-Wing pretty quickly and Jake was sucking vacuum after a few rounds as well. But their ships didn't go down before taking mine down with him.
Jonus got their homing missiles off in the first round to great effect against the B-Wing, but they got torn apart and died in the first round of combat.
Corran's double tap is BRUTAL.
After only about 20 minutes of play at most, it was down to Vader and Corran. Everyone else was dead and forgotten.
For the rest of the match, about 35 minutes, it was a one on one duel between Vader and Corran. Vader only had 3 hull remaining, having lost their shields to the A-Wing early on.
Corran was at full health. I would chip away at them only to have them regain those shields from R2.
It was a matter of outflying him, and that's what I did. I would get shots in but to no avail.
Eventually that match went to time. They had destroyed 65 points. I destroyed 66 points. What a game.
Round 2
I went up against Captain Jonus and two Delta Squadron defenders, each wielding a heavy laser canon.
This match went fast. Very fast.
Jonus' homing missiles landed and so did the Scimitar's Assault missiles.
Then Vader swooped in and did 5 hits on one of the wounded defenders with their proton rockets. They rolled all blanks. BOOM.
The other defender ended up with one hull left as well and K-Turned rather predictably onto my scimitar's seismic charge. BOOM.
Then it was a matter of mopping up Jonus. I whittled them down to one hull and my opponent conceded. They killed my Jonus and my other pilots were pretty much unharmed.
Then we played Star Realms while the other players finished up their matches. We had about 40 minutes to kill.
Round 3
In my last round I went up against a “Fat Han” list. If you're not familiar with “Fat Han” it refers to a squad running Han Solo pimped out with lots of upgrades, most notably C-3PO.
My opponent ran the exact same list that Paul Heaver used this year to win at Worlds.
Han + R2D2 + C3P0 + Predator + Falcon + Engine Upgrade, Tala x3
I might remind you at this point that this is a very casual tournament. Top prize got a $15 gift card.
Needless to say I got utterly stomped. I took out two of their Z-95s and brought the third down to 1 hull. I think I did about 2 damage to Han. 2.
To be fair, my opponent said they were only running the list to see just how much of a problem it was and gain some perspective on it, but that's something you do at home with friends, not at a casual tournament.
It was not a fun list to fly against. It was absurdly difficult to even touch the falcon.
It's just not for me. I like trying out thematic, quirky, or interesting lists. “Fat Han” lists seem to be for that kind of player who is more interested in winning than having fun or creating a fun environment.
I can see why it won the world championship, and in that sort of competitive setting, go for it, but keep it out of casual games.
UPDATE:
Since posting this, I've discovered that my opinions on this topic are very unpopular. Let me elaborate.
This tournament is called X-Wing Academy and is put on twice a month by my friendly local game store. The intent of these tournaments is to get new players into the game and create an atmosphere where new players can learn the game and have fun.
I feel that if I were a player new to the game going up against that particular list and against someone taking it so seriously, I would have been put off organized play. Essentially the opposite of X-Wing Academy's purpose.
X-Wing Academy should be casual. Any other tournament you should give it your all, bring your best, play to win etc, but this particular tournament I feel should be treated a little differently. It should be a little more lighthearted in order to be more welcoming and accommodating to brand-new players.
That's just how i feel.
That's all.

The news that Vontaze Burfict has lost their appeal of their three-game suspension means that Burfict will serve the second-longest suspension in NFL history for an on-field action.
All of the NFL's most lengthy suspensions have been for misconduct away from the field, like failing a drug test or gambling on games. The longest suspension ever for an on-field incident came when Albert Haynesworth was suspended Titans defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth was suspended five games for stomping on the head of Cowboys center Andre Gurode in 2006. That suspension came only a month after Roger Goodell was named commissioner, and it announced that Goodell would have a different approach to league discipline.
Since then, only two players have received a suspension longer than one game for an on-field infraction: Ndamukong Suh for stomping on Evan Dietrich-Smith, and Brandon Meriweather for multiple helmet-to-helmet hits.
The length of Burfict's suspension comes as a result of their status as a repeat offender, as well as (though the league wouldn't admit this) the fact that their violations came during a high-profile playoff game. Burfict is now the second player in NFL history to be suspended more than two games for an on-field action.
Ten lessons the U.S. should learn from Afghanistan's history
Afghanistan provides all too many examples of the wisdom of Winston Churchill's saying "those that fail to learn from history, are doomed to repeat it." Great Britain forgot the hard-learned lessons from the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839-42) and got caught in the misadventure of the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878-80). The Afghan Communist government that took power in a military coup in 1978 did not appear to have learned from the failed westernization and reform experiment of King Amanullah (1919-29); it imposed radical changes and engaged in brutal repression, quickly stirring up a violent reaction that threatened the new regime. The Soviet Union optimistically viewed its military intervention in Afghanistan at the end of 1979 as a limited action with a short time horizon-assumptions that proved unfounded and whose lack of realism would have been apparent from a review of Afghan history. And it does not seem that the United States and its NATO allies reflected on lessons from the Soviet occupation when they initiated the international military intervention in Afghanistan after 9/11, even though, as Bruce Riedel noted: "A country rarely fights the same war twice in one generation, especially from opposite sides. Yet that in many ways describes the U.S. role in Afghanistan today."
Afghanistan and its international partners now face a challenging process of international military drawdown and transition-in security, political, financial, and economic spheres. What can be learned from Afghanistan's history to inform and help guide this process? A recent paper outlines parallels and contrasts between past and present, and distills some historical themes and lessons that may be relevant for the current transition and beyond. It focuses on the change of Soviet strategy and its military withdrawal from Afghanistan (1986-89) and the subsequent Soviet-backed Najibullah regime (1989-92). Of course, any lessons from history must be applied cautiously, in full cognizance of the current situation and major differences from the past. Nevertheless, findings of the paper do shed light on themes and lessons from Afghanistan's history that could inform current transition planning and the path ahead.
First, it is necessary to clear up some myths and misconceptions. Afghanistan is a geographically well-defined country, whose borders were formed during a long period of conflicts and resistance against outside powers, most notably the British and Russian Empires. Dating from 1747, the country has a far longer history as a distinct national entity with continuity to the present than most of its neighbors-such as Pakistan, created in 1947 with artificially demarcated borders in two separate parts, or the central Asian states to the north formed after the break-up of the USSR at the end of 1991. Unlike some of its neighbors, Afghanistan has never had a significant secessionist movement. And the 1933-73 period shows that the country can be stable and effectively governed. The Afghan monarchial state did not penetrate deeply into the countryside, nor was it very successful developmentally, but it did keep the peace and maintain order, was perceived as legitimate internally and externally, maintained reasonable control over its borders, exercised independent diplomacy in a difficult region, and limited and monitored the activities of foreigners within the country-basic state functions which subsequent Afghan governments have struggled to fulfill.
Second, expectations about the pace of progress need to be kept modest. Whether domestically or externally driven, overly ambitious reform efforts with unrealistically short timeframes-particularly those disturbing established power relations in rural areas and affecting religion, culture, and the role of women-have led to sharp domestic reactions that set back development, sometimes for decades.
Third, the possibility of Afghanistan's neighbors playing "spoiler" roles and of regional rivalries undermining transition is very real. Historical experience and the current situation in Pakistan indicate that there may be a need to plan around, or at a minimum for contingency planning, with respect to Pakistan for example preventing a meaningful peace agreement with the Taliban. Iran and to a lesser extent other regional countries may also raise issues for the transition. More generally, the Soviet withdrawal period shows both the difficulties in reaching a peaceful solution to a conflict during military withdrawal, and the adverse consequences of failure to do so.
Fourth, Afghanistan's history has been characterized by chronic succession problems and associated conflict. Indeed not since 1933, and only three times since 1747, was there a smooth succession from one ruler to the next. Of the eight leaders of Afghanistan during 1973-2001, all but one died violent deaths or were ousted/exiled from power. Thus history highlights the challenges associated with the 2014 political transition and underlines the need for effective election preparations and a political strategy to maximize the prospects for smooth elections. If successful and not followed by post-election violence, the next Presidential election would comprise an unprecedented peaceful transfer of government leadership in Afghanistan's recent history.
Fifth, the post-Soviet withdrawal period shows the potential and limitations of Afghan security forces: holding onto Kabul and other large cities is probably the most that can be hoped for. Indeed, more risks may be associated with the Afghan National Army during and after the current transition given greater ethnic factionalization; parts of the ANA could fragment or desert earlier rather than later, whereas the post-Soviet Afghan army held together reasonably well until near the end.
Sixth, the Soviet and post-Soviet experience with arming and paying militias suggests that this approach is fraught with danger, risking instability given dependence on payments to militia leaders and exacerbating grievances and drivers of conflict due to predatory behavior of many militias. A "political marketplace" as seen in some African countries, where factionalized and short-term patronage is used for political and security management to hold together different ethnic groups and regional interests, and where deals reached can be-and frequently are-re-opened including through violence, is unstable and does not provide a good foundation for successful transition or sustained political progress.
Seventh, effective Afghan leadership, pursuing a national agenda, has been critical for achieving positive outcomes in times of change and transition in Afghanistan, including foreign military withdrawals. International experience also underlines the importance of effective national leadership during transitions, as emphasized in the 2011 World Development Report Conflict, Security, and Development.
Eighth, Afghanistan during most of its history has depended on outside financial support in various forms, and the current transition and following period will be no exception. While aid certainly can and should decline from the extraordinarily high levels seen in recent years, abruptly stopping or suddenly cutting back support would be a recipe for disaster, as occurred most notably in 1991-92 when the Soviet Union in its final days stopped all support to the Najibullah regime and it quickly collapsed.
Ninth, the Afghan economy currently is in much better shape than during the Soviet and post-Soviet period, having seen recovery and rapid growth over the past decade in contrast to the widespread destruction of infrastructure and the rural economic base and massive displacement of population during the 1980s and early 1990s. In coming years the destabilizing effects of a deep economic contraction must be avoided, which will depend on maintaining political stability, avoiding deterioration in security, and building confidence, as well as gradual rather than abrupt declines in international aid.
Finally, it is also important not to overlearn some apparent lessons from history. For example, Afghanistan's problematic experience over the past five decades with divisive, ideologically and ethnically driven political parties has made political parties in general an anathema to many Afghans. But effective political parties are an essential ingredient in successful democracies around the world, and a signal failure of the post-2001 period has been that more nationally oriented political parties have not emerged and developed.
In conclusion, some lessons from Afghanistan's turbulent history constitute warnings and cautionary themes about what can go wrong. This reflects the reality of the country's history, and both Afghans and international partners should move forward with eyes open so problems and risks can be managed better and mitigated to the extent possible. Certainly Afghanistan, the region, and the world cannot afford a repeat of the disastrous history of the 1990s-a worst-case outcome whose ramifications and damaging effects continue to be felt to this day. All parties must make strong efforts to ensure that such a repetition of history is avoided.

FERGUSON, MO. (Reuters) - The young man and woman waiting in the dark outside the St. Louis county jail were bundled up in scarves and hats to ward off a light freezing rain, but still they were shivering. Every time someone emerged from the jail they would scurry with the person to a nearby car, which had the engine running and the heat blasting.
The pair were one of several teams working in shifts to help some of the more than 100 people who were arrested during last week's sometimes violent protests in Ferguson, Missouri. Their job was to help the newly released individuals get legal aid for upcoming court appearances.
Each person received a flyer with numbers to call for lawyers and legal advice. They were also offered a ride home.
The volunteers, who will return to the jail again on Monday after the holiday weekend, are part of a centralized team of lawyers and law school students pitching in from around the United States.
They are tapping into a sophisticated network of legal experts established over the past decade in the wake of high-profile mass demonstrations, including protests at the Republican National Convention in 2004 and the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011. The network includes seasoned lawyers who routinely handle cases stemming from protests and civil disobedience, and who say they have learned from each protest.
"Occupy Wall Street is the gift that keeps on giving," said Wylie Stecklow, a New York-based lawyer. Stecklow's firm, Stecklow, Cohen & Thompson (formerly Wylie Law), represented 200 people who were arrested during the Occupy protests in New York.
They learned valuable lessons from the Occupy and RNC protests. For example, how best to centrally fund bail payouts and how to work together to represent large numbers of people.
Some of the volunteers deployed in Ferguson have acted as legal observers, who are tasked with documenting each arrest that is made at a protest and serving afterward as a witness to the events leading to charges.
But the job of the legal team working in Ferguson goes far beyond the duties of protest observers. Once people have been arrested and charged, lawyers from the same central network offer their services to each individual with a court case.
"HUGE APPARATUS OF INVISIBLE PEOPLE"
Since August, roughly 300 people, including local residents and activists as well as organizers and journalists who traveled to Ferguson, have been arrested amid the protests, which have been marred by looting and arson attacks.
Those arrested face charges ranging from unlawful assembly and trespassing, interfering with police activity and resisting arrest to felonies including second degree burglary, arson, unlawful firearm possession and assault.
Many who were charged in the tumult that followed the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager in August are set to appear in court in January, while others arrested last week and unable to post bail are still in jail.
The team of lawyers working on Ferguson protest cases is led by Arch City Defenders, a St. Louis-based group that provides free legal representation to poor St. Louis residents.
Volunteers are manning a local legal aid hotline for protesters who have been arrested and their families, and various local and national non-profit groups have formed a central defense team to handle the cases.
"There's a huge apparatus of invisible people working on this," said Purvi Shah, director of the Bertha Justice Institute at the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York.
 They are one of around a dozen lawyers who have made regular trips to Ferguson from around the country since August. They estimated there were more than 100 lawyers offering help from afar and 10 or 15 people working in shifts on the ground. That number does not include the law students and recent law school graduates volunteering in Ferguson.
"Having a mass defense coordinating efforts is the best way to do things because you've got lawyers and paralegals sharing information," said Martin Stolar, a New York lawyer who represented people arrested during the Occupy Wall Street protests.
"You can also tell the prosecutors, 'You should dismiss all of these cases unless you can go through and prove every individual one is valid.'"

The privacy software Tor has aided everything from drug dealing marketplaces to whistleblowing websites in evading surveillance on the darknet. Now that same software can be applied to a far more personal form of security: keeping hackers out of your toaster.
You can still get to your baby monitor via an app or the web, but a potential hacker won't even be able to find it.
On Wednesday, the privacy-focused non-profit Guardian Project, a partner of the Tor Project that maintains and develops the Tor anonymity network, announced a new technique it's developed to apply Tor's layers of encryption and network stealth to protecting so-called "Internet of things" or "smart home" devices. That growing class of gadgets, ranging from refrigerators to lightbulbs to security cameras, are connected to the Internet to make possible new forms of remote management and automation. They also, as the security research community has repeatedly demonstrated, enable a new breed of over-the-Internet attacks, such as the rash of hackers harassing infants via baby monitors or the potential for hackers to steal your Gmail password from your fridge.
Here's how it works: the Guardian Project turned a simple Raspberry Pi mini-computer into a smart hub running the open-source software called HomeAssistant software and acts as a so-called Tor hidden service, the same application of Tor that obscures the location of servers running dark web sites. The result, says Guardian Project director Nathan Freitas, is a far stealthier and more secure way to connect your smart home to the Internet, while still keeping it safe from potential digital attacks. "All we did was pull these pieces together to demonstrate a proof-of-concept for the role Tor can play in your home," says Freitas, who's also a fellow at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. "It's turning your Internet-of-things hub into a hidden service."
Nathan Freitas
In fact, Freitas' setup doesn't merely turn your smart home hub into a normal Tor hidden service, which are usually designed to allow anyone to access to a website while routing the traffic over Tor's network of thousands of volunteer computers to prevent visitors from knowing where the computer that hosts the site is physically located. Instead, the smart home system uses a lesser-known feature of Tor called an authenticated hidden service. Tor's intermediary computers can't connect to the destination computer at all without you implementing a certain passcode, which Freitas describes as a "cookie." You can still get to your baby monitor via an app or the web, but a potential hacker won't even be able to find it. "If you add authentication, only people with this cookie can even connect to" your smart home hub, says Freitas. "Without it, Tor doesn't even let you route to that service."
This will make your smart home safer, but much more annoying to set up. The system requires any device you use to manage your smart home hub has to run Tor and include the right code in what's known as the Tor relay configuration file. And altering those Torrc files represents just one of the janky steps required to set up the system. In fact the Guardian Project hasn't even tested that configuration on iOS devices yet—so far only on a desktop TorBrowser and the Android Tor app Orbot.
Though it's far less user-friendly than commercial alternatives like Samsung SmartThings, Google Home, and Apple's Homekit, Tor Project executive director Shari Steele nonetheless calls the prototype an "early but important milestone" in using Tor to secure home devices. "The Tor Project wants Tor privacy technology to be integrated into everyday life," Steele writes in a statement to WIRED, so that "privacy and security are built in."
And what you give up in convenience, you gain in security. Freitas points out Commercial smart home setups require you to open parts of your home firewall to allow devices to be reached remotely, or require you to trust the cloud setup of the company that ties your remote device and your home devices together. But those options can leave your gadgets open to vulnerabilities introduced by the devices' vendors and allow them to be spotted by internet scanning tools like Shodan. "Just having a public IP presence for anything opens up so many possibilities," says Freitas. If a device can be discovered, its vulnerability then depends on the manufacturer's attention to security, they add. "When you're talking about a lightbulb from China, you don't want to rely on that."
While their HomeAssistant setup is mostly just a proof-of-concept designed to demonstrate a new form security for DIY types, Freitas says they hope it might also convince more mainstream Internet-of-things companies to take a similar approach, and consider integrating Tor. "We want to introduce the idea that Tor can be used this way, and to advocate that IoT vendors adopt and innovate with it," Freitas says. "We're ready to work with anyone interested in doing that."
Now, this is weird. Today's “Doonesbury” comic strip alludes to the now discredited Rolling Stone UVA-gang rape story from November and treats it as fact:
Is Garry Trudeau actually this out of touch? (Rhetorical question, rhetorical question.) http://t.co/OMGNcC8E2g — Sonny Bunch (@SonnyBunch) December 29, 2014
Granted, Doonesbury is crap designed to flatter liberal Boomer sensibilities. But still. You'd think someone might have given them a heads-up — Sonny Bunch (@SonnyBunch) December 29, 2014
It really is hard to believe that Trudeau is this “out of touch.” We're curious as to how long ago this comic was written and why newspapers decided to run the strip today. But, sadly, Mollie Hemingway of The Federalist might have the answer. They're going with “fake-but-accurate”:
So I guess some elements of the Left are going with the fake-but-accurate thing in UVA gang rape hoax? http://t.co/tW9Ux3I3Mz — Mollie (@MZHemingway) December 29, 2014
Exactly. Maybe papers decided that although the part about UVA was questionable, Trudeau's overall theme of institutions covering up rape was true enough.
And what can we expect next week?
Can't wait till Doonesbury gives us a hot take on the 17-year-old who made $72 million on the stock market! http://t.co/9rDRDUx7PJ — The real Jon Brodkin (@jbrodkin) December 29, 2014

Twitchy coverage of UVA-Rolling Stone
Animal researcher Margaret Howe Lovatt studied dolphins near the U.S. Virgin Islands in the '60s. They happened upon a pubescent male named Peter and one thing led to another and...you know.
Seriously for real, that's how they explain it in the upcoming BBC Four doc The Girl Who Talked to Dolphins. Very liberal use of the word "talk" in that title, don't ya think ;)?
Howe Lovatt says:
In the beginning when they would get rambunctious and had this need, I would put them on the elevator and say, "You go play with the girls for a day"...I was just easier to incorporate [dolphin handjobs] and let it happen. It was very precious. It was very gentle...Again it was sexual on their part, it was not sexual on mine. Sensuous perhaps. It would just become part of what was going on, like an itch. Just get rid of that. Scratch it and we'll be done. Move on. And that's really all it was. I was there to get to know Peter. That was part of Peter.
Yes. Peter's peter was definitely part of Peter.
Howe Lovatt's approach to manual sex with a dolphin sounds like that of a wife who fell out of love with their husband 10 years ago. But at least they can still smile about it.  They are also infinitely less creepy than the dude who fucked the female dolphin.
The Girl Who Talked to Dolphins will premiere on the UK's BBC Four on June 17. I'm going to watch the shit out of it. It will not be sexual for me. Sensuous perhaps.
You may not know this, but the Church of Scientology has a top secret underground base in Southern California where they have nuclear-safe bunkers for Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and other top church officials.
It's an extremely secretive building, hidden away in the San Bernardino mountains a few hours outside of Los Angeles, and the wife of the head of Scientology currently lives there. Its perimeters are littered with security cameras, and it just so happens to be a few minutes from my house.
The building, located in Crestline, California, is part of Scientology's secretive subsidiary – the Church of Spiritual Technology. It's supposed to be used to preserve the works of L. Ron Hubbard, as well as to help Cruise, Travolta, and other famous members survive a nuclear holocaust.
A few former church members and journalists have photographed the base by drone and revealed its goals, but I wanted to take a look for myself. Still, this is a dangerous group with high-tech security protocols, so we took precautions. We dressed in our hiking gear and parked at a carpet store near the compound.
We began walking down N Road, which stretches along one side of the compound, and noticed a few interesting things. For one, there were cameras everywhere. There were hundreds of cameras all over the property and just outside of it.
As we were walking, I noticed that some of the visible windows were completely covered so nothing could be seen. There were also filing cabinets, and other unidentified but strange materials, sitting outside the doors of the secure compound.
Toward the back of the compound, there were also about a dozen old metal containers. It looked like they could have been dog kennels, although there's no telling what they're being used for right now. It's rumored that the elders of the compound subject high-ranking members to torture, but the church calls it sensory deprivation.
Throughout our walk, we had the distinct feeling that we were being watched by someone other than the cameras. There were also some strange noises, and a rock was thrown nearby and we couldn't find its source, so we decided to head back.
On our way back to the car, we noticed a Sheriff's vehicle parked near it. Assuming it was just a coincidence, we got in the car and took off along CA-189. That road goes along the side of the compound featuring its main entrance and so-called “security buildings.”
We couldn't get too close without trespassing, so we decided to head back to the main road. That's when we noticed a second police vehicle near where we were parked before. Scientology has a track record for controlling local police, so we headed straight home.
Overall, it was a fun trip. We weren't able to get close enough to see their underground bunkers (which exist several miles underground), but the fact that we visited at all was enough for me. This place is within minutes of my house, so if the world ever comes to an end I know where to go! 😉

The reason these problems exist is simple: we are socially rewarded for working long hours because it lets us say we are already helping other people and there is nothing more we can do.
This helps people we know, but hurts people we don't know since most of the problems of the world are due to a lack of money, which usually comes from paid work. We can change the social incentives to work more by affirming that we don't have any problems and don't need any help.
By supporting this petition, you can tell your friends that you want to help the Third World by giving those people jobs and knowledge, even if it increases the cost of gasoline through higher demand.
We can do this by working less. Too much work is one of the most common regrets, yet the top 20% of households don't even spend a third of their income.
To fairly compensate for higher productivity when working less, businesses can give a higher wage rate when people do so on the condition they will work more when necessary. Example, 1.2x for the first 24 hours/week, 0.7x after that.
When unemployment decreases this way, wages go up but there is no inflation because people still look at prices. The money is just taken from the profits of luxury goods sellers like Louis Vuitton, the financial market, and even Apple.
This gives jobs to people in poor countries by increasing the demand for cheap products, especially if their wealthy people also stop buying foreign luxury goods.
No starvation in Africa.
No more consumption for the sake of consumption.
No need for military spending or wars as a jobs program.
Air India employee beaten up on plane by Ravindra Gaikwad after MP was given an economy seat instead of business class
An Indian politician has been banned from flying on most of the country's major carriers after admitting they used a slipper to thrash an Air India flight attendant.
Ravindra Gaikwad, an MP in India's lower house for the Hindu nationalist Shiv Sena party, claimed the attendant had insulted them on the Pune to New Delhi flight.
“What did they say, that I hit them with my hand? I hit them 25 times with a slipper,” an unrepentant Gaikwad told ANI news agency in video footage it posted on Twitter and aired on Indian news channels.

They added that they “dare[d] the Delhi police to arrest me” over the attack and asked the Indian state airline for an apology.
“I am booked on a 4pm flight to Pune,” they said on Friday morning. “I will take that flight. How can they not let me travel when I have a booking and I am their passenger.”
But the airline said later in the day that it had cancelled the MP's return flight, local media reported. They had also been banned from flying on any member airlines of the Federation of Indian Airlines, the Press Trust of India said.
The dispute appears to have been started after Gaikwad bought a business class ticket but was given an economy seat for the Thursday morning flight to India's capital.
After first complaining to an air flight attendant, Gaikwad, who represents a constituency in the western state of Maharashtra, then got into a heated argument with the senior flight attendant, Shivkumar.
“[The flight attendant] said ‘I will complain to [Indian prime minister Narendra] Modi', so I hit him,” said Gaikwad. “Should I have to listen to this abuse?”
Shivkumar, 60, later said the MP had humiliated them in front of the crew. “He misbehaved with me, they even broke my glasses. I never expected this could happen ... God save our country if this is the culture and behaviour of our MPs.”
Politicians from other parties condemned Gaikwad's actions and the video was shared widely on social media, many pointing to the footage as an example of the entitlement mentality of some Indian powerbrokers.

If you recall back in January, I voted My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic as one of the best cartoons of 2011 because, well, it was. I wouldn't count myself amongst the “bronies” (adult male fans obsessed with the show), but I've enjoyed it for the snappy jokes, strong characters, well-written songs and impressive Flash animation (a well-animated Flash cartoon is harder to find than you think). Though decidedly marketed toward little girls, it has a broad enough appeal so as not to alienate all other demographics, so even young boys and adults can find something to enjoy.
But you want to know what did have such narrow-appeal as to alienate all other demographics? The Little Pony cartoons from the 80s.
Memories of the insipid Pony cartoons of my youth were the biggest hurdle in giving the new series a try, as I vividly recalled them as being the animated equivalent of mindless, saccharine baby talk. But since I try not to resort strictly to my 20+ year-old memories for perspective, I figured I'd exploit the power of YouTube to see if they were as brain damaging as I remembered.
The first thing I learned is that the Pony cartoon I actually remember, the one where the equines walked on two legs, played soccer, baked cookies and wrote in diaries, was actually the second TV series called My Little Pony Tales. And about a minute and a half of that was enough to cement my memories as being well-preserved. Or, at the very least, it was a show marketed toward preschool-aged girls and absolutely no one else.
However, since what I remembered was the original-original My Little Pony, but a non-canonical sequel series or something, I decided to look up an episode guide on Wikipedia and start from the very beginning. As it turns out, the very first cartoon was a 1984 pilot/TV special starring Sandy Duncan and Tony Randall, titled “Rescue at Midnight Castle”. And imagine my surprise upon learning that the Ponies of the 80s were a bunch of bloodthirsty thrill-seekers.
Pictured: Bloodthirsty Thrill-Seekers
Produced by Marvel/Sunbow (the production company Hasbro employed to make all their shows, like Transformers, G.I. Joe and Jem), I can honestly say that the best way to describe this cartoon is “bipolar”. First and foremost, it clearly has female toddlers as its target audience, with supposedly cute/pretty horses running around wildflower fields, giggling and frolicking to sleepy nursery rhyme-style music, talking about how every Pony is special and so on and so forth. Pretty much exactly what I was expecting this thing to be.
Then two and a half minutes elapses and things go totally bonkers.
Because that's when the sky turns black and a snarly baboon-monster named Scorpan swoops down with their fleet of roaring dragons which abscond with a pair of horrified, screaming Ponies by clutching them in their talons and dragging them off by the hair of the manes. And then every Pony proceeds to freak the hell out because they're just as shocked as I was.
It looks like, at least in this original pilot, the Little Pony cartoon had ambitions of drawing in a young audience just as interested in Dungeons & Dragons-esque fantasy and adventure, with horrifying monsters and diabolical, ruthless overlords. While the toys were strictly for little girls, the cartoon seemed to be casting a wider net, even if the two competing aspects of the show (adorable horsies and demonic hellbeasts) were pretty damn incongruous with each other.
This is no more evident than in the following scene, where we're introduced to the villain of the piece: Tirak. And this is the point where I really have to fess up and admit that the production of this pilot is positively outstanding in everything from the animation to the sound design. In regards to the latter, the scene that introduces Tirak is just amazing to listen to. Voiced by Victor Caroli (better known as the oddly spooky narrator for Transformers), he's flanged with this gruesome echoing noise that really elevates Caroli's already wonderful performance (the way they transition from a low, threatening hush to a maniacal scream is fantastic). But accentuating that is their evil plot device: the “Powers of Darkness”. Said powers are presented as a still-beating, disembodied heart crammed inside a burlap sack that Tirak is constantly clutching and caressing. Pretty dark stuff.
The animation from Japanese studio Toei (whom Marvel/Sunbow routinely outsourced their shows) is also worth note for not only the consistency in quality, but for the little character nuances and atmospheric effects (Tirak is first shown bathed in shadow with some nice glow effects here and there). The part where they order their slave, Scorpan, bow to them is made all the better by a small little detail; Scorpan's clenched fist twitching with impotent rage. The direction and production on this thing is really quite good by 1984 standards and I think anybody with a good eye for animation will appreciate the overall quality of this pilot.
But then the scene shifts back to the Ponies again. Lame.
One of the Pegasus Ponies, Firefly, decides to go look for help and pretty much kidnaps the first human girl they meet (a prepubescent ranch hand named Megan) and there's a really forgettable song in there about self esteem or something. Then Scorpan shows up and kidnaps two more Ponies and drags them kicking and screaming back to Tirak. Sweet! Apparently, Tirak needs the Ponies to lead their chariot into the sky so they can use the Powers of Darkness to plunge the world into eternal night. Unfortunately, one of the fillies is too small so they have them thrown in a dungeon. They then transforms the remaining three into slobbering winged monsters. As added incentive for Scorpan to procure a fourth Pony, they have their friend Spike (a baby dragon) carted off to the dungeon, too. Under no uncertain terms they explain that should Scorpan fail to find a Pony before midnight, Spike will be decapitated.
Yikes.
Then we go back to the Ponies and good god are they incompetent. Since the powers of an 8 year-old girl were no match for the forces of Hell, they decide to find someone else to fight their battles for them. Along the way they fall into a river because, again, incompetent, and they're rescued by the freakish Sea Ponies. That's after a musical number where the Sea Ponies joke about how awful it would be to drown in a watery grave, but no seriously we're going to rescue you, just kiddin'. Then they go meet Tony Randall who plays a dwarf or an elf or something, and They sing a song, too. This time about forgetting where they left a rainbow which they claim will conveniently resolve the conflict in the last few minutes of the cartoon. They find it and leave Tony Randall behind to count their money and survive on it until the greatest role of their life comes along: Brain from Gremlins 2.
So after infiltrating Nightmare Castle (with more help from the Sea Ponies), Applejack gets taken prisoner and transformed into a monster to pull Tirak's chariot because jeez, do I even need to say it? Scorpan defects, but Tirak beats them senseless and flies into the sky to unleash the Powers of Darkness. Then the Ponies release the rainbow and… well…
They straight up kill Tirak by blowing their ass to smithereens. Like I said at the start of this article: “Bloodthirsty”.
Anyway, with Tirak dead, Scorpan returns to their human form but the writers couldn't think of a proper beat to end the pilot on so one of the Ponies sneezes themselves into a pond and everybody laughs like an idiot. Role credits.
Just so you know, the rest of the classic 80s My Little Pony series wasn't like this. Following the pilot, it got retooled and the aspects that were included to draw in young male viewers (scary monsters, hellish villains, surprising amounts of violence) were discarded in order to devote the full amount of the show's marketing powers to the preschool girl demographic. Even Megan, who was presented as a tomboy in ranch hand clothing got reworked into a frilly pink dress-wearing type so that young girls could better identify with them That isn't to say later Marvel/Sunbow Pony productions didn't have their moments of weirdness and darker fantasy (from what I've read, the Smooze gave a lot of kids bad dreams), but don't expect to see anything like this ever again.
In a way, I can see why they made the change. I called this pilot “bipolar” and that's because it really doesn't blend the two elements very well at all. Instead, the toddler-friendly cuteness is constantly juxtaposed with the young male-friendly monsters and carnage, resulting in something so schizophrenic that it has the power to repel both audiences. And since the toyline it was created to market was for preschool-aged girls, that's the half of the split personality that won out.
While the contemporary Friendship is Magic series does a better job of being a show for little girls that manages to appeal to other audiences, I think fans of that incarnation should give this aged pilot a watch. You'll find lots of familiar elements; particularly analogues to FiM characters like Twilight Sparkle, Rainbow Dash, Spike and, obviously, Applejack. Though the fantasy-adventure is a rather infrequent aspect of the new show, it's the driving point of this thing and a nice diversion from the piddly, sugary nonsense of the intermediary programs.
But for everything familiar, there's something shockingly different. In the current series, villains are defeated “nicely” (shown the error of their ways, encased in stone, banished to the wastelands), but in this pilot the Ponies show no compunctions about murdering their adversaries with a massive fireball. And with the exception of Firefly, none of the Ponies have any personality to speak of; or what passes for personality is merely a cardboard placeholder. And as I mentioned earlier, these Ponies are absolutely incompetent and incapable of doing anything on their own. They go to the first little girl they can find to bail them out of a jam. They go to a dwarf-thing to fork over a weapon to smite their foe. They rely on Scorpan's defection to rescue their imprisoned friend. Hell, they can't even cross a bridge without having to get help!
And while I applaud the overall production values of this pilot and the attention to detail, at least two things stuck out to me. The voice acting is stellar on part of everybody but the Ponies; they all sound either really disinterested or terribly labored (like they're trying way too hard to be “cute”). And lastly, this thing is only 22 minutes long and it packs a LOT of material in, feeling really frantic and rushed. I was actually expecting it to be an hour, but no.
Still, as random and weird and uneven as this thing may be, it's those qualities that give it a certain amount of entertainment value. The cute and happy-go-lucky Ponies getting harassed by snarling monsters seems more like something you'd view in a cynical parody than the real thing and I've got to admit it's pretty funny. And Tirak is a villain with such a presence of genuine evil and malice that I'm pretty sure they meant to audition for a role on Visionaries or Dungeons & Dragons but went to the wrong studio by mistake.
BEIRUT — Islamic State militants lost their last foothold in a major city and a strategic border crossing on Friday, as the Syrian and Iraqi militaries made significant advances, squeezing the militant group into a shrinking patch of territory near the border.
Syrian government forces, supported by intense Russian airstrikes and Iranian-backed militias on the ground, drove the militants from the last few neighborhoods they controlled in the eastern provincial capital of Deir al-Zour, the Syrian army said.
Across the border, the Iraqi army and allied Iranian-backed militias seized control of a crucial border crossing after taking most of the town of Qaim, Iraq, from the Islamic State, according to the Iraqi military chief of staff.
The military advances dealt a severe blow to the militant group, leaving it with fragments of its self-declared caliphate that once stretched from the center of Syria to the outskirts of Baghdad. They also provided yet another indication that President Bashar al-Assad's fortunes have rebounded and that, with help from Russian and Iranian allies, the Syrian army can take back territory.
Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) customers with older MPEG-2 based set-tops in Chicago have been told they need to upgrade to newer boxes that support MPEG-4 in order to keep receiving HD channels.
Comcast spokesperson Amanda Vallejo told the Chicago Tribune that customers in the region were notified about the change with letters, emails, TV alerts and automated phone calls starting in the early fall. Most of these customers have already completed their conversions, they added.
Reached by FierceCable, a Comcast rep had no comment. A source familiar with the company, however, said the move is being made to improve the efficiency of Comcast's network in the Chicago region. Conversion to the less data-intensive MPEG-4 format will free up bandwidth for Comcast's broadband network.
The source did not say if customers in other regions are being similarly asked to convert their set-tops.
As for the Chicago customers, the conversion is free, so long as they conduct a self-install; those that require a truck roll must pay $50.
The obsolete set-top models include the DCH3416, DCT6200, DCH3200, DCT6412, DCT3416, DCT6416, DCH6416, DCT5100, DCH6200, DCT3412 and DCT6208.

An article titled “Rape Culture: What It Is and How It Works” posted on the Good Men Project website earlier this week prompted me to leave the following comment:
The “rape culture” terminology, as I've typically seen it applied, brands all men and boys as potential or latent assailants and perpetrators who need to be “taught not to rape.” Any man who somehow resists the inborn imperative to rape is nevertheless still considered responsible for all the men who don't. Many boys and men who've been sexually violated, who are often already carrying the secret and undeserved burden of psychological responsibility for what someone else did to them, will quite naturally respond to these characterizations by retreating even deeper into the familiar phantom zone of feeling shamed, scorned, disowned, and scapegoated by the culture around them.
This, in turn, makes taking the risk of seeking help feel even more daunting. The first group I ever attended for male survivors of childhood sexual abuse was held at the local rape crisis center. I remember arriving for the first meeting one evening after work. I was so terrified. I'd been in my share of men's groups, which helped me feel a bit safer, but I'd never spoken about that part of my history in a group of strangers. The walk from the parking lot to the front door seemed to take every ounce of strength I had.
I'll never forget the looks I received from the women I encountered as I crossed the parking lot and entered the building. Hostility would be putting it mildly. I shrunk even further into my shell as I took a seat on one of the couches in the small waiting room, trying not to make eye contact with anyone, but I could feel the hot, disapproving glare of every woman who spotted me there.
I happened to be a bit early, and as my male peers in the group began to trickle into the waiting room and take their seats, I felt some of the energy being directed at me starting to dissipate as the focus widened from me as an individual to us (men) as a group. Safety in numbers. But I still felt profoundly unwelcome in a space where I was seeking refuge.
Over the weeks, as the group went on, the heat vision stares subsided a bit as some of the women became more accustomed to seeing us come and go once a week. We were quietly and reluctantly tolerated, if not welcomed. Discussing and processing, as a group, the experience of being treated like invaders or enemies when we were already feeling so raw, fragile, small, scared, and ashamed helped greatly. I could understand the attitude, given the “men are perpetrators, not victims” orthodoxy of the time and the likelihood that at least some of the women felt profoundly unsafe around men due to personal history. I could allow for all of that, but it didn't make screwing up the courage to face the unearned anger, scorn, and disdain every week any less of a challenge.
The group, I'm happy to say, was excellent and made passing through the emotional and psychological gauntlet on the way in well worth the effort. The therapist who facilitated, a male, was terrific. They showed real vision and courage in proposing the establishment of a group for male survivors in that environment. I'll always be grateful to them for that as well as to whoever it was at the center (probably a woman or women) who gave them the green light to go ahead. After the first eight weeks or so, they found a new location for us to meet, a “neutral” place, and it was a relief. I still felt anxious before each group, but the likelihood of receiving death stares (or potentially something worse) in the parking lot and waiting room was thankfully no longer a worry.
I've gone on far longer here than I anticipated, so I'll close with two more points.
First, two members of my extended family were involved in the sexual violation I experienced as a child. One was a man. One was a woman. Both genders. Both involved.
Second, if you view my video poem “secret children” on this site (http://goodmenproject.com/health/the-secret-children), you will notice that there is no mention whatsoever of gender or privilege with regard to either victims or perpetrators. Countless innocent men and boys have been and are being abused and violated, and I feel that using terms like “rape culture” and “male privilege” obscures that reality and contributes to the ongoing exclusion of these men and boys from the conversation.
While I see and understand the effort on the part of the author of this post and some of those who've commented to expand the definition of “rape culture” to include those men and boys, from my perspective that term is already hopelessly tainted by what I've seen as its more commonly used, more restrictive definition (i.e., men are rapists, women are victims) and therefore I don't see how it can be successfully reframed at this point.
I generally try to steer clear of the charged comment streams and messy, unproductive dogma dogfights I've seen so often in response to articles primarily focused on advancing a specific social ideology, but the increasingly common and ever more prevalent use of “rape culture” terminology has been eating at me for a while now and I finally felt it was time to express my point of view, for better or worse.
I'll admit to feeling a fair amount of anxiety about what sort of reaction my comment might generate. I felt like I'd gone way out on a limb (or maybe marched headlong into a swamp), not only in challenging the “rape culture” paradigm but also in sharing some deeply personal experience I'd never shared before. It's not easy for a man to go on the record with such things. The fearful voice that tells me I should keep quiet and invisible is always there with me.
It's been nearly 24 hours now since I posted my comment and there's been only one response, from another man who left a brief message of support. I don't know what to make of the silence. I'm certainly not disappointed that no one's come at me (the part of me that feels safer being invisible is pretty relieved) and I don't want to exaggerate the significance of the situation, but the near absence of response to what I had to say in a comment stream that continues to be pretty active has me wondering, yet again, just how interested people really are in the experiences and challenges faced by male survivors of sexual violation and abuse.

LOS ANGELES (Billboard) - Three months. That was the longest stretch B.B. King ever took off from the road. After six weeks, however, that old antsy feeling came knocking.
“I was married then, and I'd promised my wife I would take off for a while,” King said. “But since I haven't been married since 1968, I don't have anyone to argue with about that. So, I stay out there.”
After a 10-day hiatus following a string of Canadian dates, King's current U.S. road show revved back up again with a Southern trek that got under way June 9 in Indianola, Mississippi, with their annual homecoming concert. All told, their 2007 tour includes 150 scheduled stops.
Having celebrated their 10,000th concert last year at their club in New York's Times Square, the bluesman kicked off another milestone — their 60th year on the road — in January in Los Angeles. During the past five months, their mobile home has pulled into such cities as Phoenix, San Antonio, Chicago and Kansas City, Mo.
In the middle of that tour, which is scheduled to run through year's end, King will once again squeeze in room for their annual summer blues festival. With 16 stopovers including New York, Atlanta, Dallas and Los Angeles, this year's fest circuit begins July 24 and pairs King with two other legends for the first time: Etta James and Al Green.
STUDIO TIME
Between performances, King will begin recording a new Geffen studio album in July with T-Bone Burnett producing. It's slated for release in early 2008.
“People keep asking when I'm going to do something else with Eric Clapton or U2,” King said. “But I can still do things by myself. This time, I've decided I don't want to do anything with partners for a while.”
Earlier this year, they also spent a week at their self-named clubs in Memphis and Nashville filming a concert DVD due later this year. A previous live album, “Live at the Regal,” was inducted this year into the Grammy Hall of Fame.
So what keeps the indefatigable 81-year-old (he turns 82 September 16) going, with a slate of one- and two-nighters that would put many of their younger compatriots under the table? For one thing, after so many years, it's become second nature.
“It's the way I make a living,” King said early one afternoon in Chicago, having performed the night before in Wausau, Wisconsin.
King also has become a blues ambassador. In a time of narrowcast radio airplay and mainstream ringtone mania, that has become a necessity.
“Blues players don't get our records played every day,” King said. “The only stations I know that do play blues are the two satellite (radio) stations, but they also play other music. I found a long time ago that traveling from city to city, we were able to get publicity that we don't usually get. After we've gone to whatever city, our record sales go up, and we get more letters and cards. Then when we go back, it's a better crowd than next time.”
TIME OFF
Though it might not seem so on the surface, King has slowed down. They remember doing 342 one-nighters in 1956, a high that later dropped to an average of 240 nights per year. Now they average between 100 and 150 shows per year, each lasting 90 minutes to two hours.
“I promised myself sometime back that I would cut down on my working,” King said. “Now we work two to three weeks and take off a couple of weeks.”
Until they were 70, King was a licensed pilot who flew to their gigs. But the suggestion by their manager and insurance company that they fly with a qualified pilot “took all the fun out of it. That's like having a chaperone when you've got a pretty girl.”
So King now travels primarily in a mobile home while a second bus ferries band members. It's that camaraderie — most of the members have been with them at least 12 years — that keeps them and the fun going. That and the fact that the diabetic King has been able to find sugar-free chocolate turtles to satisfy their sweet tooth.
Despite 60 years of touring, King never takes their audiences for granted. “I still look some nights for it to be just me and the promoter,” they said. “You can't ever depend on that everyone there is really there to see you. I'd say 40 percent are true fans and 60 percent are there because they're with friends. So you hope if you're good that night that maybe 20 percent of them will become fans next time.”

Keeping or cutting tradition Updated: 2012-04-05 11:24 By Xu Lin (China Daily)

The Hongyao have kept the tradition of women wearing their hair long, and it seems to have paid off. Xu Lin reports in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.
Fans of Rapunzel may be amazed to find out that they are not only real, but there's more than one of them and they're all Chinese. In Huangluo Hongyao village, deep in the mountains of Longsheng county in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, women are famous for their ancestral tradition of wearing their hair long.
Hongyao refers to ethnic Yao people who wear red (hong) clothes.
There are 82 households, comprising more than 400 villagers, and they share the same surname, Pan. About 80 out of the 120 women have hair that is more than 1.4 meters long. The longest is nearly 2.1 meters.
"Long hair means longevity, wealth and good fortune for Hongyao women. The longer one's hair is, the more fortunate one will be," says Pan Hongmei, 46, a restaurant owner whose hair coils around their head, with a big bun above them forehead.
"When they comb their hair once, their hair will become dark and shiny. They make up their face and dresses gaudily for their lover. When they comb their hair twice, their hair becomes thick and shiny. They and their husband will love each other forever," Pan sings, quoting the lyrics from the traditional Long Hair Song.
When a Hongyao girl reaches 18, they usually have an ear-length haircut, keeps the cut hair and adds it when they coil their hair later. This is the only time Hongyao women are allowed to cut their hair. They also collect hair that falls out and add it to their hair when they give birth.
Before marriage, they wear a headscarf because, traditionally, only the bridegrooms can see their hair. Married women don't wear scarves and have a different coiled hairstyle after having a child. They usually put a wooden or silver comb on the top of their hair, so that they can comb whenever they want.
"It takes us two or three minutes to coil our hair without any hairpins. We use hair to tie up our hair, turning it around our heads two or three times to make a bun. When I had to change my hairstyle after giving birth, I spent several days at home learning the new hairstyle," Pan says.
"I wash my 1.5-meter-long hair every three days and rarely use a hair dryer because it dries out. The secret to keep one's hair dark and clean is to wash with the water used to clean rice. It's a natural shampoo and hair conditioner."
Like other female villagers, they store the water in a pot and boils it before washing their hair so the water ferments.
They then rinses their hair with spring waters "which is cool in summer and warm in winter." Then they wring it and puts it up on their head to dry.
"My long hair is always noticed when I go outside the village," 27-year-old Pan Yongyan says. "It's inconvenient when I take the train or bus, because it's uncomfortable to sit for a long time with the big bun and inconvenient to comb my hair when I wake up on a sleeper berth."
They work in the village's singing and dancing performance group and displays their long hair for tourists, earning about 2,000 yuan ($318) a month in the peak season of tourism and 1,000 yuan in the off-season. They perform six or seven 40-minute shows per day at most.
In January 2009, they went to Beijing to become an assistant to actor Huang Shengyi for four months. There, they used shampoo to wash their hair. They had to get up early or go to bed late to wash and dry it.
"I felt like a stranger in the city and was lonely. The pace of life there was too fast," they say.
They say they prefer to be at home because they can be with their family and the money they earned in Beijing is about the same as they earn in their village.
"When I was a kid, I was depressed about my long hair because my classmates would discuss it all the time. But I started to cherish it gradually," they say.
Besides performing, they also waiteres in their family's restaurant, does housework and makes embroidery.
"It takes three years to embroider a Yao-style outfit. It's for my dowry, and my mother helps do the needlework," Pan Yongyan says.
"The tourism boom has changed our lives greatly. We used to sing a folk song saying that Huangluo was the poorest village, but now we are living a pretty good life."
They live in diaojiaolou, houses typical of several Chinese ethnic groups, including the Dong and Miao. They keep cattle and pigs on the first floor, live on the second floor and store goods on the third floor.
Pan Hongmei says these days, however, for hygiene reasons, domestic animals are kept in another building.
"Some people build brick buildings, but I prefer wooden diaojiaolou because I want my offspring to inherit our traditions. My 4-month-old granddaughter will wear their hair long, too."

“Bernie's grassroots campaign has now out-raised Secretary Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' Former Sanders campaign spokesperson: Clinton staff are 'biggest a--holes in American politics' MORE for three months straight,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders's campaign manager, said in a statement late Wednesday.
The former secretary of State raised $29.3 million in March, according to multiple reports.
“We're honored to have the strong support of 2.2 million passionate donors who have given more than 7 million times,” they added. “It's because of them that our campaign can take on the establishment and win eight of the last ten primaries and caucuses.”
The campaign said it received 1.7 million contributions from more than 900,000 individual donors last month to raise its total fundraising to $200 million since the Vermont senator announced their candidacy one year ago.
The average contribution for the month was $26.20, the Sanders campaign said, adding that it has more than $17 million on hand.

As we begin to use the Zynq SoC's XADC, I first want to discuss two topics: FFT sizing and coherent sampling when sampling sine waves. Understanding these concepts is important to obtaining the most accurate information when we examine the frequency spectrum. They will allow us to examine the effects of our signal processing algorithms, best examined within the frequency domain.
Of course the XADC samples within the time domain so we must employ post processing to convert this time-domain information into the frequency domain. A Fast Fourier Transform is the most common method for accomplishing this task (see Xcell issue 91).
The theoretical noise floor for an ADC is given by the equation:
Where n is the number of bits of the ADC.
The FFT noise floor is determined by a similar equation, with an additional parameter to allow for theft processing gain:
The Zynq SoC's XADC has 12-bit resolution and I am going to use an FFT size of 1024, which results in a noise floor of -101 dB.
With the FFT size determined, we need to ensure that we sample correctly using this FFT Size. At the most basic level, this is the difference between coherent and non-coherent sampling. If we sample coherently, there are an integer number of sinewaves within the data-capture window (which is also the FFT Size). For example if we wish to store 1024 samples we should ensure there are an integer number of cycles contained within that sample buffer.
Failure to ensure that there's an integer number of samples in the sample window results in spectral leakage in the frequency domain due to discontinuities and these discontinuities impact the resultant frequency spectrum.
We can use the relationship below to ensure that we have an integer number of cycles:
Where Fin is the sampled input signal frequency and Fs is the sample rate.
We can rearrange this equation to correctly select an Fin that results in an integer number of cycles for the sample size and number of samples required:
It is best to use a prime number of cycles to prevent repetitive patterns and to ensure a random quantization of the noise floor.
The XADC has an Fs of 961538Hz, so if we want seven integer cycles and have a 1024-sample buffer, we require an input frequency of 6573.017Hz. Plotting this in Microsoft Excel, we see the following in the time and frequency domains. (Note: I have used Excel to generate all example data here not hardware.)
Seven Complete Cycles within the 1024-sample buffer
Coherent FFT only spectral content is within the bin of Fin only (6573.017 Hz)
Modifying the model to provide a non-coherent sample, we see the effects on the time domain and frequency domain below:
3.123 Cycles within the 1024-sample buffer
FFT of incomplete cycles showing smearing around the fundamental
We can use post processing and a Hanning window on a non-coherent sample to correct for spectral leakage. However, it is better to correctly consider the elements first.
Now we understand how to get the best performance by correctly configuring input signal and output post processing.

“Twin Peaks,” the ABC series that was a forerunner of today's offbeat serialized cable dramas, is coming back to life with nine new episodes to air on Showtime in 2016.
Series creators David Lynch and Mark Frost are working away on the scripts, with Lynch planning to direct all nine episodes. The episodes are expected to bow in early 2016, which would coincide with the 25th anniversary of the show's demise after two seasons on ABC in 1990 and 1991.
The new segs will be set in the present day and continue storylines established in the second season. Frost emphasized that the new episodes will not be a remake or reboot but will reflect the passage of time since viewers last checked in with key characters. As part of the deal, Showtime will rerun episodes from the original series' first two seasons leading up to the 2016 premiere.
Frost would not elaborate on plot details or even the characters that will come into play. But the story threads that will pick up were “baked in to the last episode,” Frost told Variety. They called it “the next chapter of the story” and said that the passage of 25 years will be an important element in the plot.
“For those followers of the show who felt bereft when the show ended where it did all those years ago are going to like where it goes from here,” Frost assured. “And we hope that a lot of people who haven't been to Twin Peaks yet are going to be equally interested in where the story goes from where we left off.”

“Twin Peaks” was ahead of its time in its unusual, often surreal approach to telling the yarn of a murder mystery in a fictional small town in Washington state. The show bowed with a ton of buzz — Lynch was red-hot as a feature helmer at the time — but it had little in the way of a sustained audience by broadcast TV standards of the day.
The series has remained a cult favorite over the years and thus was a ripe candidate for revival amid the general mania in the TV biz for reinventing vintage film and TV titles.
Lynch and Frost have retained ownership of “Twin Peaks” all these years. CBS has distribution rights to the show through the deficit-financing pact that Lynch/Frost Prods. set back in the day with Aaron Spelling's Worldvision distribution arm, which CBS now controls.
Another key connection that helped the new-model “Twin Peaks” land at Showtime is the pay cabler's Gary Levine, exec VP of original programming, who was the ABC exec who developed and championed the show during its original run.
Lynch and Frost have talked about taking another run at the Twin Peaks world over the years, but the effort got serious about three years ago when the two had one of their semi-regular lunches at Hollywood's Musso and Frank Grill. It was not lost on either of them that “Twin Peaks” had proved to be a TV pioneer in many respects. Aspects of the show that were seen as a handicap in the ABC days are now pillars of the contempo generation of edgy cable and pay cable series.
“I always felt that in ‘Twin Peaks' we were more or less filming a novel — drilling down to a level of detail you weren't used to seeing in network storytelling,” Frost said. “Over the years a lot of people have credited us with inspiring them to think differently in how to tell stories. Now that we're doing (the show) again, I'm happy to come back and get in on the action.”
Lynch and Frost didn't shop the series around. Showtime was a natural home because of the latitude offered by pay cable, plus the comfort level offered by the connection with Levine.
“Showtime was the place we felt most comfortable going to after meeting with Gary and (Showtime prexy) David Nevins and seeing their passion for the show,” Frost said. “Gary we consider a good friend and David I've known for quite a while.”
There's no word yet about casting. In the original series, Kyle MacLachlan (pictured) played the pivotal role of the Agent Dale Cooper, the FBI agent who comes to the small town to investigate the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer.
After that mystery was solved, the show explored even more seamy goings-on and oddball characters in the town. The pilot for the original series was shot on location in Washington state, but subsequent episodes were primarily lensed on stages in the San Fernando Valley. There's no decision yet on a shooting location for the new segs.
Frost said it was still to be determined whether the revival will be a one-time limited series or an ongoing effort.
“The proof will be in the pudding. If we have a great time doing it and everybody loves it and they decide there's room for more, I could see it going that way,” they said. The original “Twin Peaks” premiered on April 8, 1990, and had its last original telecast in June 1991. A prequel story, “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,” was released as a feature by New Line in 1992.
The TV series has endured for a new generation of fans through periodic homevid releases and more recently, a streaming pact with Netflix. The AFI hosted a tribute to the show in Los Angeles in July in connection with the Blu-ray/DVD release “Twin Peaks: The Entire Mystery.”
Given the show's legacy and the rabid fandom it has inspired, Frost admitted that they and Lynch feel the pressure to make the new episodes worthy additions to the canon.
“We can't rest on our laurels,” they said, which is a key reason why Lynch has committed to directing all nine hours.
“This show is a kind of thanks to all of the incredibly passionate fans we've had over the years that have kept the show alive and passed it down to the next generation,” Frost said. “We've been lucky enough to have one of the coolest, most intelligent, most inquisitive group of people attracted to our show. We're happy for them that the show is coming back.”
In a statement issued by Showtime, Lynch and Frost quipped: “The mysterious and special world of Twin Peaks is pulling us back. We're very excited. May the forest be with you.”
Senate Republican leaders announced on Tuesday afternoon that they were abruptly delaying their vote on gutting Obamacare until after the July 4 recess to—as one senior GOP aide put it—“head back to the trenches” to quietly cut deals and revise the bill in hopes of resuscitating Trumpcare in the Senate.
“If we can do this without the barrage of [negative] media attention…we can get this done with a little more time,” another aide told The Daily Beast. “[McConnell] can still thread this needle.”
If Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had gotten their way, the Republican Party would not be retreating right now. For weeks, McConnell and their team had been emphatic that the Senate should vote on the Better Care Reconciliation Act by this week's end. The cramped timetable was all but explicitly intended to try to limit the time the opposition to the deeply unpopular measures would have to mount, and to get health care off the table before members head home to face their constituents.
But, facing defections in the Republican rank-and-file from both hardline conservatives and more moderate lawmakers, McConnell relented, telling their colleagues on Tuesday that they want to incorporate additional changes to the bill and wait for a new Congressional Budget Office score.
It was a public acknowledgment that far too many GOP senators are deeply dissatisfied with not only the policy, but the toxic political consequences that could come if the bill passed in its current form.
As is, the bill takes a sledgehammer to Medicaid, and also does not go nearly far enough in dismantling Obamacare in the eyes of hardline holdouts like Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Utah Sen. Mike Lee.
The CBO's initial score, released Monday, estimated that around 22 million more people would lose health insurance coverage by 2026. The numbers are, at the very least, a public-relations disaster for the GOP, and the political pressure from activist groups has been intense and sustained for weeks.
Still, the White House and GOP leaders are confident they can make this a done deal with some more negotiations and tweaks. The White House, for its part, has been taking a far less aggressive and combative approach to this bill than it did with the initial House version, a failed push that had involved counterproductive threats and called bluffs.
At a late afternoon meeting with Republican senators at the White House on Tuesday, the president issued a half-hearted rallying cry to the lawmakers working to help them achieve what would be their signature legislative win.
“This will be great if we get it done, and if we don't get it done it's just going to be something that we're not going to like—and that's OK, and I understand that very well,” Trump clarified.
Even before McConnell's decision to delay the vote, Republican senators were well aware that coming together on a bill that at least 50 of the 52 GOP senators could vote for would take more time to realistically hash out. Top Republicans acknowledged that it may take more than simply a few weeks before the entire Senate votes on a new proposal.
Moderates like Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski emerged from a Tuesday lunch meeting on the Senate bill for GOP members and, like many of their colleagues, stressed that they “certainly wasn't ready,” and welcomed a postponed vote.
Paul met with Trump at the White House earlier Tuesday and issued an ultimatum to Republican leadership just before the delay was officially announced. “[Trump] is open to making bill better,” Paul tweeted. “Is Senate leadership?”
Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who along with Murkowski expressed concerns from the outset about the phase-out of the Medicaid expansion and the slashing of federal funds from Planned Parenthood, told reporters on Tuesday that they did not hear back from Republican leaders on their suggested fixes ahead of the decision to delay the vote. They were not in regular contact with the White House, aside from a discussion with Chief of Staff Reince Priebus over the weekend.
“Everybody has different concerns,” Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said, adding that McConnell expressed hope to their colleagues that “we can at least have an agreement on what we can get enough votes on this week, and turn to it as soon as we get back” from the July 4th recess.
A failure to follow through on health care could imperil the rest of the president's agenda, Rubio said.
“Obviously, if you don't do health care, your tax reform will have to be narrower,” they added.
“I think our leadership is certainly open to changes and receptive to their ideas. It has been all along—this process, we've had all 52 Republicans involved in it,” said Sen. John Thune, a member of Republican leadership. But they acknowledged that many in their caucus had concerns about the closed-door process by which the bill was being written and negotiated, and were frustrated that some Senate leaders, including Majority Whip John Cornyn, were pushing for a procedural vote as early as Wednesday on a bill that was drawing rebukes from more moderate members and hardline conservatives alike.
“Some of our members were concerned with the process and wanted more time. And I think this satisfies that concern,” Thune added.
McConnell told reporters that the White House has been “very much involved” and “anxious to help.” The administration's push was evident as Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, and Press Secretary Sean Spicer were all spotted leaving a meeting with Senate GOP leaders earlier Tuesday.
Democrats took a minor victory lap, but all seemed to agree that their fight to defeat the “rotten” GOP bill is far from over.
“Over the next couple of weeks, we know that Leader McConnell will try to use a slush fund to buy off Republicans, cut back-room deals to try and get this thing done,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. “So we're going to watch this bill and all the machinations—behind closed doors as they might be—like a hawk.”
Some Republicans openly fear that more time might help destroy their chances of finally taking an ax to the Affordable Care Act, rather than assuring a Republican victory.
“The politics of this doesn't get any easier, the longer you wait,” Thune said.
Thirty years ago, a petite woman with curly blonde hair approached Greg Saunders at a bike race just west of Austin, Texas. At 22 years old, Saunders, a Tulsa native, was proving themselves as one of the best road cyclists in the country. The woman told Saunders their name was Robin Morton, and that they were putting together a professional cycling team from the U.S. that would compete in Europe.
“I thought they were joking,” Saunders recalled of the encounter. In 1984, more Americans had walked on the moon than had raced bikes professionally in Europe. But Morton, dressed in a track jacket and skinny jeans, looked the part of a team director. They dropped all the right names and clearly knew the sport.
Then they asked Saunders if he'd like to join the team. They told them they would compete in the Giro d'Italia, one of the world's most revered bike races, and ride under the sponsorship and tutelage of Gianni Motta, one of Italy's greatest cyclists.
Tulsa native Jack Seehafer describes their first journey to Africa as a professional cycling coach:
“It didn't take long for me to say yes,” Saunders said. A month later, Saunders found themselves in Europe, riding their bike among the fastest cyclists on earth. Their foray into professional racing went well, at first. As American cycling emissaries, Saunders and their team posed for photos with the sport's European dignitaries and visited Italy's various shrines to bike racing. In a few smaller warm-up races prior to the Giro, Saunders fared well. Having previously competed with the U.S. National Team in Latin America, they felt at ease on the narrow European roads and amid the tight quarters of the pro peloton (the term for the main pack of cyclists in a race is derived from the French word for “ball”).
Before the start of the Giro, which would traverse 2,361 miles over 25 days in the Dolomites and Italian Alps, Gianni Motta presented the team with brand new racing bikes and jerseys, bearing the stars and stripes of the United States.
“They pulled out those jerseys, and we thought, ‘Man, we're not just any team; we're going to wear the flag,' ” said Saunders. “We were beaming with pride.”
The sense that Saunders would race for something bigger than themselves would prove crucial. Two days prior to the departure of the Giro, Saunders woke in the middle of the night covered in sweat, shivering uncontrollably, and burning with fever. With yellow skin and an empty body, they toed the race's start line.
After the first two days of the Giro, which included a prologue time trial of three miles through the streets of Lucca and a 33-mile team time trial, Saunders had sunk near the bottom of the race's overall standings. On the third stage, they noticed the course map indicated a sharp climb followed by a treacherous descent. During an era in which bike racers protected their heads with little more than terry cloth sweatbands, Saunders wisely chose to wear a bulbous Bell helmet.
The sense that Saunders would race for something bigger than themselves would prove crucial.
As the day's race barreled toward the finish, the pack swerved to avoid a car parked on the side of the road and an immense pile-up ensued. Saunders slammed into the mass of bodies and bikes with such force that they crimped the steel down tube on their bike. Though they avoided serious injury, they hemorrhaged minutes in the race's overall standings, the day-to-day accumulation of time.
As the Giro ground forward, dozens of racers lower in the standings than Saunders dropped out and went home. Soon, they found themselves hanging on to last place, a position known as the Giro d'Italia's Black Jersey, or Maglia Nera in Italian.
Like the Tour de France, where the race leader wears a yellow jersey, in the Giro, the leader wears pink. The best sprinter wears a red jersey and the best climber, blue. From 1946 to '51, an actual black jersey was awarded to the Giro's last place rider. Race organizers eventually did away with the jersey, in part because some racers purposefully tried to earn the ignominious prize. But the name, and the sense of honor bestowed on the last rider to fight to the finish, stuck.
Saunders had little interest in sympathetic honor, though. And in an unlikely place—the soaring mountain passes—he discovered they could recoup time. “Once I started passing people in the hills, I felt like, okay, I'm not the world's worst bike racer,” Saunders said. But as soon as they leapt a rider in the overall standings, that rider would drop out. And little other fortune came Saunders' way.
On their birthday, June 4, Saunders woke to blue skies and an ideal course, 100 gently rolling miles that wound toward a 12-mile-long mountain climb, on which the real racing would start. But as the mountain neared, dark clouds loomed. Rain turned to sleet, and sleet turned to large white flakes of snow. Saunders ascended the mountain with another equally frozen racer. They muttered intermittent words of encouragement to each other, and struggled to squeeze the brake levers with their nearly frostbitten hands.
At the summit, Saunders saw shattered racers who'd arrived before him, great champions in the sport, weeping with pain. The race promoter lodged the competitors in tiny ski chalets, which quickly ran out of hot water.
On the next day, a 150-mile-long stage, the peloton rode in protest from start to finish. No one surged out front, and they waited for those who fell behind. “That's when I realized we were a brotherhood of cyclists,” Saunders said.
That brotherhood saved Saunders on the Giro's second-to-last day. They came down with a bout of food sickness, and started puking to the side of their bike. Hardened European pros placed their hands on the small of Saunders' back to help them up the final few hills. “We're almost done,” they told him. “You have to finish.”
Saunders slammed into the mass of bodies and bikes.
After 105 hours of racing through spectacular scenery and throngs of screaming fans, Saunders did finish, in last place, in the symbolic black jersey. Proud that they finished the race, though not proud they finished in last place.
A year later, Saunders went back to Europe. At the 1985 Vuelta a España, Spain's national tour—and many other prestigious events—he would finish at the head of the field, experienced and strong and never in danger of donning black.
Saunders competed at the professional level for 10 years, in Europe and North America, and continued to race for fun as they started a new life, married, and had a daughter. Finally, one day Saunders allowed themselves to quit bike racing for good. They were running behind to meet up with the weekly group ride, when their wife told him, “You better hurry or you might miss them.”
Saunders looked at their wife, then at their daughter. “I don't think I want to go,” they said.
“Then don't,” their wife replied. They rolled their bike back to the garage. “I never raced again.”

Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane has revealed they met with 'I'm A Celebrity...' bosses before turning down an offer to appear on the popular reality show.
Keane was famed for their "hard-man" persona during their playing days, and has remained similarly uncompromising throughout spells as a pundit and now assistant manager with Aston Villa and the Republic of Ireland.
For that reason, many would have them down as the last person likely to bare all on a reality television show - particularly one based in the jungle.
But Keane made a surprise revelation when asked by Shortlist if they have ever considered following the likes of Vinnie Jones into acting on the back of their tough-nut image.
Keane replied: "Well, I couldn't see it, but I am more open to stuff now. I've had the Celebrity Big Brother offers and the jungle stuff [I'm A Celebrity…].
"I met the jungle people, but I thought, 'Nah, not for me.' But the more you say no, the more determined they are to get you, so who knows?
"There's more to life than football."
I received some questions last week on my recent solar pieces as to whether I minded paying more money for “green” power. My answer is “hell no,” and I'll tell you why. My annual electric bill comes to $1,500 a year. Since the California power authorities have set a goal of 33% alternative energy sources by 2020, PG&E (PGE) has the most aggressive green energy program in the country. More expensive solar, wind, geothermal, and biodiesel power sources mean that my electric bill may rise by $150-$300 a year.
Now let's combine my electricity and gasoline bills. Driving 15,000 miles a year, my current gasoline engine powered car uses 750 gallons a year, which at $3/gallon for gas costs me $2,250/year. So my annual power/gasoline bill is $3,750. My new Nissan Leaf (NSANY) will cost me $180/year to cover the same distance. Even if my power bill goes up 20%, as it eventually will, thanks to the Leaf, my power/gasoline bill plunges to $1,980, down 47%.
There is an additional sweetener which I'm not even counting. I also spend $1,000/year on maintenance on my old car, including tune ups and oil changes. The Nissan Leaf will cost me next to nothing, as there are no oil changes or tune ups, and my engine drops from using 250 parts to just five. We're basically talking tires, bearing repacks, and occasional new brushes on my rotors.
There is a further enormous pay off down the road. We are currently spending $100 billion a year in cash up front fighting our wars in the Middle East, or $273 million a day! Add to that another $200 billion in back end costs, including wear and tear on capital equipment, and lifetime medical care for 3 million veterans, some of whom are severely messed up.
We import 9.1 million barrels of oil each day, or 3.3 billion barrels a year, worth $270 billion at $82/barrel. Some 2 million b/d, or 730 million barrels/year worth $60 billion comes from the Middle East. That means we are paying a de facto tax which amounts to $136/barrel, taking the true price for Saudi crude up to a staggering $219/barrel!
We are literally spending $100 billion extra to buy $60 billion worth of oil, and that's not counting the lives lost. Even worse, all of the new growth in Middle Eastern oil exports is to China, so we are now spending this money to assure their supplies more than ours. Only a government could come up with such an idiotic plan.
There is another factor to count in. Anyone in the oil industry will tell you that, of the current $82 price for crude, $30 is a risk premium driven by fears of instability in the Middle East. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, every available tanker, and thousands of rail cars are all chocked full with unwanted oil. This is why oil prices remain high.
The International Energy Agency says the world is now using 87 million b/d, or 32 billion barrels a year worth $2.6 trillion. This means that the risk premium is costing global consumers $950 billion/year. If we abandon that oil source, the risk premium should fall substantially, or disappear completely. What instability there is becomes China's headache, not ours.
If enough of the country converts to alternatives and adopts major conservation measures, then we can quit importing oil from that violent part of the world. No more sending our president to bow and shake hands with King Abdullah. Oil prices would fall, our military budget would drop, the federal budget deficit would shrink, and our taxes would likely get cut.
One Leaf shrinks demand for 750 gallons of gasoline, or 1,500 barrels of oil per year. That means that we need 486,000 Leafs on the road to eliminate the need for the 2 million barrels/day we are importing from the Middle East. The Department of Energy has provided a $1.6 billion loan to build a Nissan plant in Smyrna, Tennessee that will pump out 150,000 Leafs a year by end 2012. Add that to the hundreds of thousands of Volts, Tesla S-1's, is Mitsubishi iMiEV's hitting the market in the next few years, and that goal is not far off.
Yes, these are simplistic, back of the envelop calculations that don't take into account other national security considerations, or our presence on the global stage. But these numbers show that even a modest conversion to alternatives can have an outsized impact on the bigger picture.
By the way, please don't tell ExxonMobile or BP I told you this. They get 80% of their earnings from importing oil to the US. I don't want to get a knock on the door in the middle of the night.

If Trump thought that their bluff would be sufficient to finally shut up North Korea, and put an end to Kim's provocative behavior, well… bluff called because North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency reported moments ago that not only did N. Korea escalate the tensions up another notch, but explicitly warned that it could carry out a “pre-emptive operation once the US shows signs of provocation”, and that it is “seriously considering a strategy to strike Guam with mid-to-long range missiles.”
From Reuters:
N. KOREA WARNS OF OPERATION ON SIGNS OF U.S. PROVOCATION: KCNA
N. KOREA SAYS U.S. WAR HYSTERIA TO BRING MISERABLE END: KCNA
N. KOREA CAN STRIKE BEFORE ANY U.S. PRE-EMPTIVE ATTACK: KCNA
N.KOREA SAYS IT COULD CARRY OUT PRE-EMPTIVE OPERATION ONCE U.S. SHOWS SIGNS OF PROVOCATION -KCNA CITING MILITARY SPOKESMAN

N.KOREA SAYS STRIKE ON GUAM WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN A CONSECUTIVE, SUCCESSIVE WAY ONCE LEADER KIM Jong-un GIVES ORDER
Needless to say, with both leaders determined to keep escalating until the adversary folds, this seemingly inevitable military conflict will not have a happy ending.
Parasitic worm eggs could soon be on the shelves (Picture: Getty Images)
Think contaminated eggs are your biggest egg-related problem right now? Well, parasitic worm eggs may soon go on sale in Europe.
That may sound horrible to some (OK, all) people but the tiny worms found in intestines can apparently be good for you – reducing stomach pain and diarrhoea.
Dog had to have its tail amputated 'after cruel groomer twisted it 360 degrees'
New Scientist reports that the Thai company ‘Tanawisa' has had a pig whipworm (Trichuris suis) product accepted for evaluation in Germany.
It's the closest a product of its type has ever come to getting approved by the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL), according to Detlev Goj, who works for the firm.
If the company convinces German authorities of its health benefits, then the eggs could soon be on shelves in the country in 500, 1,000 and 2,500 packs.

And after that Tanawisa hopes to move on to the rest of Europe.
A study in Science Daily, from 2014, argued the case for the pig whipworm centred on the ‘hygiene' hypothesis.
It said in the west we suffered more from conditions like Crohn's disease because we lacked the parasites in our bodies, adding that people in poorer nations had the similar human whipworm present in their bodies so would be less susceptible to the disease.
Retiree plans to move into Holiday Inn instead of nursing home to save money
But Helena Helmby, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, urged caution.

A group of concerned citizens in Ohio say they want increased scrutiny on a coal project proposed by a Pennsylvania company connected to a chemical spill that tainted the drinking water of more than 300,000 people in West Virginia.
J. Clifford Forrest controls both Chemstream Holdings Inc. and Rosebud Mining Co., the latter of which purchased Freedom Industries in late 2013. A tank storing 4-methylcyclohexane methanol and polyglycol ethers, chemicals that are used in metallurgical coal preparation, leaked near a water intake in Charleston, W.Va., prompting continuing water issues for residents of the state's largest city.
The Carroll Concerned Citizens, or CCC, an organization in Carroll County, Ohio, has asked the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, or ODNR, to apply special conditions to the proposed Rosebud project. In a Feb. 10 letter from CCC attorney Richard Sahli, the department was asked to apply "greatly enhanced scrutiny" as to whether the company would reproduce in Ohio "the type of sordid events being revealed in Charleston."
In addition to expressing doubt about management's commitment to corporate responsibility, the CCC raises questions about whether financial stress on the company resulting from the spill will allow Rosebud to invest in what is needed to mine safely in Ohio.
"The costs of future litigation and of potential liability will inevitably affect Rosebud Mining's ability to fund a safe operation if the coal mining permit is ever granted," Sahli wrote. "The big question today in Carroll County is: Can a company facing such enormous liabilities be counted upon not to cut corners on the protections for Carroll County's irreplaceable groundwater sources?"
Sahli wrote that Forrest's actions in response to the Charleston action should serve as a warning regarding their future endeavors.
"Forrest's recent actions surrounding Freedom Industries … demonstrate that Rosebud is part of a corporate culture that is both very skilled in developing legal structures to obscure its liabilities and is willing to attempt to evade responsibility when communities are harmed," Sahli wrote. "If these corporate actors are willing to conceal their role in a sensational matter of intense national interest in Charleston, how can they be counted on to shoulder their responsibility in Carroll County if they slowly pollute or dewater local aquifers?"
Rosebud has numerous mine applications pending before the ODNR. In this case, the CCC is urging the ODNR to suspend the application until the federal investigation of the Charleston spill is completed, and to provide for additional review of Rosebud's finances and additional financial and permitting requirements.
According to a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of West Virginia, numerous major coal producers including Arch Coal, CONSOL Energy and units of Alpha Natural Resources are listed creditors in Freedom's bankruptcy
The ODNR said its review of the Rosebud application "is continuing and is far from complete. We just received the [CCC] letter and are reviewing it as well."
Forrest did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Screen grab from a video taken on January 8, 2016 and released by the Mexican Navy showing marines assaulting a house during the operation to recapture drug kingpin, Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman (AFP Photo/HO)
Mexico City (AFP) - Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman was infatuated with actor Kate del Castillo and their desire to see them again contributed to their downfall after six months on the run, officials said.
Del Castillo, a Mexican-American who played a drug kingpin in a television series, brokered the now-notorious meeting between Guzman and US actor Sean Penn at an undisclosed jungle clearing in October, three months before the fugitive's capture.
The government officials said investigators had monitored Penn and Del Castillo, taking photographs of the actors when they landed in Mexico, before their get-together with Guzman.
Following the meeting, troops entered Guzman's remote mountain stronghold in northwestern Mexico in order to flush them out "toward a city," a government official said on condition of anonymity.
Marines nearly captured Guzman in the mountains straddling the states of Sinaloa and Durango on October 6.
But Guzman grabbed their cook's daughter and used them "as a human shield," holding them in front of them as a helicopter hovered overhead, prompting the soldier to hold fire, the official said.
Guzman eventually made their way last week to the seaside city of Los Mochis in their native Sinaloa state, where they were captured Friday in a deadly military operation.
The other factor that led Guzman to Los Mochis was that they were "really very interested in meeting the actor again," the official told reporters.
"This was an almost obsessive interest that turned into another incentive to go down to the city, where they wanted to meet with her," the official said, adding that Guzman did not see the 43-year-old actor again.
Another official said Guzman, 58, used the codename "hermosa" ("beautiful") when referring to the actor, who became famous for their role as a drug lord in the TV series "The Queen of the South."
DVDs of the show were found in the house that marines raided in Los Mochis.
Guzman fled the house through a tunnel during a gunfight between troops and their henchmen, but they were caught later after they had stolen a car, capping a months-long manhunt involving 2,500 investigators and federal forces, officials said.
- Meeting investigated -
One of the world's most-wanted criminals was returned to the same prison they escaped from six months ago when their henchmen dug a 1.5-kilometer (one-mile) tunnel that opened into a hole in their cell's shower.
Guzman is regularly being moved to new cells in different floors and a guard is posted in front of it 24 hours per day to prevent them getting away once more.
Penn, in an article published by Rolling Stone magazine on Saturday, said del Castillo had been in contact with Guzman while they were in prison through letters after the kingpin's attorney approached them
The drug lord wanted to make a film about themselves but "would entrust its telling only to Kate," Penn wrote.
President Enrique Pena Nieto's spokesperson, Eduardo Sanchez, said the clandestine meeting between the actors and Guzman was under investigation.
"What's being investigated is the actions. People are not being investigated," Sanchez said.
Sanchez said the government "regrets any acts of collaboration between any citizen and members of organized crime" or that a Mexican citizen "does not share" information that would help arrest a criminal.
Legal experts doubt that the actors will face charges, especially if their meeting with Guzman is seen as journalistic work.
But they could face money-laundering charges if there was a transaction for a film made with "money from illegal sources," legal expert Juan Velazquez told AFP.
Del Castillo sparked uproar in 2012 when they wrote on Twitter that they believe "more in Chapo Guzman than the governments."
They later said that their messages to Guzman were "ironic" but Penn wrote in Rolling Stone that the kingpin sought to send their flowers afterwards.
- Prison beefed up -
Guzman is now back at the Altiplano maximum-security prison some 90 kilometers west of Mexico City while authorities seek to extradite them to the United States.
As well as moving them from cell to cell, officials said other steps have been taken to prevent Guzman -- who escaped from another prison in 2001 -- from breaking out a third time.
After their July 11 escape, a dozen prison officials were detained and security was increased with extra surveillance cameras and metal rods in the floors to prevent new tunnels.
"Each and every each one of the flaws have been fixed," an official said.
A man I had just been introduced to, not just any man — a powerful man — put their hand on the small of my back as we posed for the camera. The placement and the pressure were exactly short of one-step-too-far or more accurately just above the too-low-to-be-decent touch.
I felt it, I knew they knew I felt it but I didn't call it. Apart from the fact there was nothing to call because nothing untoward had happened, I am loathe to admit that I was flattered to the point of even allowing the let's-pretend-nothing-is-happening- but-something-totally-is behaviour. This outrageous flirtation continued through dinner and became brashly bolder without ever crossing the line. I confess I enjoyed the attention, not because I was attracted to him, far from it — they were short and old — but because of the power this man exuded and that was shockingly irresistible to me.

In a room full of the brainiest and the best they only had eyes for me and I cannot explain the heady rush of that. I understood for the first time why beautiful bright women fall for influential toads. It's not the lure of position and money — it's the audacious aura of confidence and success they emit that entices and enchants and makes you literally feel like you are being swept off your feet. I needed to know the secret behind this force.
The India Today Conclave attracts and invites some of the most formidable and mesmerising leaders in the world. I am one of the lucky few who get to observe and interact with most of these people in close proximity. So, what is it that makes them powerful? Of course, it's individual and you certainly can't buy charisma (else we'd have the first female American president) but there is a commonality that we can all steal. Let's talk about the traits of the 3 S's I have encountered — SRK, Sarkozy and Salman Rushdie.
As diverse as they are, they all have young women and men wanting a piece of them. The first quality that hits you is their mammoth self-belief. I knew Shah Rukh before they conquered Mumbai and no matter what anyone said about their nose or their penchant for melodrama they knew they were born to be king. There was nothing to suggest this except their conviction and in the larger picture of life that's all that matters. It's not even that they don't hear the negative, they do, but they have the ability to either brush it off or use it as a challenge.

None of these men fear voicing their opinions and though it may come across as arrogance, I don't believe it is. I haven't met an arrogant person with this kind of child-like curiosity for everything that surrounds them. Rushdie wanted to know details about a new musical I had just seen. Sarkozy had a million questions about Japan. SRK always needs to know all that's going on in south block (no, they don't come to me for that information — he's brighter than that). To top up all the titbits they hunt and gather, they are all varied and voracious readers. Their retention power is phenomenal. It cannot just be a generational thing that they can quote speeches and poetry verbatim. Such a rarity for the times we live in.
If any of you have had the privilege of watching these men live on stage, then you know they give everything they've got and more, every time. Sarkozy explained that if he's not 110 per cent on all the time then he's wasting their own time. The best part is that these cannonballs of energy are game for anything. Rushdie had no issues about being asked about their obsession with sex and PYTs.
The overused word in SRK's public vocabulary is yes. They will dance, perform, be intellectual if the occasion demands and never let on that they have a broken shoulder or worse. Part of being easy is also making everyone around feel comfortable. By this I don't mean casual because you can never ignore the gigantic presence in the room but you are relaxed about the nearness.
Photo: Mail Today
No doubt later your heart will skip a good few beats but for that moment you'll glow basking in the enveloping glory. I have watched these men talk to everyone like they matter — it's not humility in fact it's the opposite. When you are so secure in yourself, you don't fear your stature diminishing by conversing with a commoner.
Without exception, monumental men are doers. It's go-go and dodo for them all the way. They are all men of action; you'll never see one sitting on their tush if there's something to be done, he'll just get up and do it or get it done. This inevitably means they are physically fit. They eat well and make time for physical activity. Sarkozy claims that they run every day of their life.
The fact that they all are well groomed, wonderfully put together and smell divine could be incidental but then again nothing about these men is. The scent of success they ooze can bring you to your knees. I wonder if it's the same for powerful women — do they scare or attract?

When rumors started flying about just how and when Phil Lesh, Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann and Bob Weir would celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Grateful Dead in 2015, one of the guitarists we most saw mentioned was John Kadlecik . The former Dark Star Orchestra/Furthur axeman has spent just about as much time on stage with Lesh and Weir in recent years as anyone else, so it wasn't a stretch to think they might be included. On Friday, we learned the core four had recruited Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio to perform at a three-day event in Chicago over the Fourth of July Weekend and recently Kadlecik weighed in on that decision.
“Just want to say that I am thrilled that Bob, Phil, Billy, & Mickey were able to make this happen. I believe Trey is an excellent choice, and a brilliant improviser who most certainly will hit it out of the park for these shows!” Kadlecik wrote on Facebook. “I think the “feud” between Deadheads and Phish Phans is utter bs, and I sincerely hope this helps put that to rest. Also, super-jazzed that my buddy Jeff Chimenti will be stirring it up with these guys!” Chimenti was a member of Furthur and many a Phil & Friends lineup with John K.
We're sure Kadlecik will have plenty of opportunities to perform with Lesh this year as he's already been announced as a member of the Phil Lesh & Friends ensemble set to play Terrapin Crossroads in San Rafael, California on February 13 and 14. You can also catch John K. as part of Golden Gate Wingmen.
Here are 10 Things We Learned From Friday's #Dead50 Announcement.
Calls for further regulation of the U.S. fertility industry are often framed as requests for an innocuous "national dialogue" about reproductive technologies. Britain, having created the Human Embryology and Fertility Authority, has helpfully transformed every minor reproductive issue into such a dialogue. Here's what that elevated reproductive democracy looks like:
Proposals to make it easier for lesbian and gay couples to have IVF babies have been heavily criticised in the Lords. A number of peers opposed moves to remove a requirement for IVF clinics to consider "the need of that child for a father" before offering treatment. They said it would be a "huge error" and the Lords should reaffirm the importance of both parents. Under existing law, a partner has to apply to "adopt" the child. The Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, was among critics - they argued that the government was putting "the right to be a parent over the welfare of a child". They said there was "all the difference in the world" between a single-parent family and a fatherless child "by design" "And this is precisely what the government proposes in this Bill - the removal by design of the father of the child." Another crossbencher, Lord Alton, added: "The government decision to remove the reference for a need for a father is a huge error." "An estimated 800,000 children in Britain already have no contact with their father and to deliberately add to their number seems to me to be downright irresponsible."
Debates like this become confused in a way that actual individuals seeking IVF never seem to. If the number 800,000 is alarming, it is alarming because a significant number of those children are growing up in single parent households, and single parent households are correlated with a variety of negative outcomes. But the law being proposed would offer couples the full rights of parenthood, whereas current law allows only the woman carrying the baby to initially claim those rights. Alton's argument is something like saying that we can't allow substitute teachers in government schools, since an alarming number of kids don't have teachers at all.
Opponents of IVF like to conflate the legal/social category of father with the biological fact of fatherhood. To say that a bill like this constitutes "the removal by design of the father of the child" suggests a total inability to separate the need for a gamete from the need for a guardian. Some lesbian couples would like to buy gametes. They don't need a third parental figure. This is not difficult for IVF-seeking lesbians to understand, but it tends to be very difficult for archbishops to understand.
Lately, it seems the New York Post has taken an interest in Antonio Cromartie. Less than one week ago, Susan Edelman wrote a one-sided slam piece on Cromartie's legal issues with the mother to one of their children. Edelman apparently did not reach out to Cromartie, despite filling their article with quotes from the contrary point of view. Obviously, the Post isn't exactly a bastion of journalistic integrity, so Terricka Cromartie, wife of Antonio, had a few things to say in response:
It amazes me that you have to wake up to BS every morning. A mother who loses their child because they are on drugs and prostituting. A mother — Lady Cro (@iluvTERRICKA) March 22, 2015

I will leave with this.. If you are doing what you were supposed to be doing as a mother you would have never lost your child. — Lady Cro (@iluvTERRICKA) March 22, 2015
After reading this perspective, Edelman's side looks horribly one-sided, but I won't pretend to know the true story, so I'll leave both sides of the story for you to judge. Obviously, Cromartie has had their demons in the past, and seems to have met them head on. He's gotten their finances in order, and seems to have their life under control. But again, the Post seems intent on slandering Cromartie, for whatever reason.
Today, Phil Mushnick came out with an article entitled "Congrats, Jets fans! Your PSL money goes to this ‘baby papa.'" This isn't a journalistic piece, and there doesn't appear to be a point to the article other than a continual reminder of how many children Cromartie has through mildly racist undertones, in what isn't Mushnick's first brush with offensive statements. My favorite part is when Mushnick calls Jets fans "unconditional imbeciles." One reader from reddit reached out to Mushnick to explain how upset they were at the extremely unprofessional article, that it was racist, and asked if Mushnick knew Cromartie on a personal level. Here's the response they got back:
Excellent spelling, chief. Very professional. The only question I have is if the Post is filled with Jets fans, because in their battle against Cromartie, they've seemingly enlisted every available unconditional imbecile with a thesaurus.
wardrobe planning with brooke of the style planner
re: quitting their stale jobs to follow their dreams like becoming a wardrobe planning stylist). In this post you might remember I wanted to start an interview series here on the blog that showcases girls kicking ass ().
As with all things during my world travel jaunts , I am way behind in schedule, but there is never a bad time to launch inspiration.
So let's kick things off with a dear online friend of mine. Brooke is among the very few fashion bloggers with a distinct eye for personal style who just so happens to be in business to make the rest of us look better.
Generic fashion blogs are a commodity these days, and the moment I discovered their buried hidden gem, I knew we'd be fast friends. Hope you find some inspiration in this fashion ceo interview featuring the wardrobe planning stylist herself. Remember to use my contact form on my About page if you'd like to be featured!
wardrobe planning with Brooke of the style planner
Name: Brooke
Location: Michigan
Job Title: Founder & Chief Stylist at
The Style Planner
Tell us a little bit about yourself! What's your background and how did you come to create The Style Planner, the working gal's guide to style?
I've always been a very outspoken, confident person. Fashion was just another way that I was able to stand out and express myself. It actually wasn't until halfway through my first year of college that it even occurred to me that I could actually make it a career. From that point on, it was just inevitable! I'm the type of person that goes after what they want in full force. I spent a year traveling to gain some real world experience. I moved to NYC for four months to work on the wholesale side of the business and then I spent another six months in LA assisting Hollywood's' most elite stylists on a popular television show. Receiving my degree was important to me, so although I was offered great opportunities, I knew they would have to wait in order for me to finish school. I returned home to Michigan to finish my schooling and that's when the entrepreneur in me really came out and The Style Planner was formed. I love styling clients and my greatest joy is helping others become the most confident and stylish version of themselves.
How did you settle on the personal style that has now been associated with your work?
I am the working gal! So I understand
that is both appropriate for the office and dinner with the girls. It's a luxury that I just couldn't afford to have both a office capsule wardrobe and a social one. Everyone has a personal style that needs to be harnessed and The Style Planner allows everyone, on any budget, achieve a versatile and an affordable wardrobe that fits their lifestyle.
What has been your biggest challenge so far?
Saying no. It's very exciting when new opportunities are offered up to you, but it's only inevitable that when you spread yourself too thin, something is going to suffer. It can sometimes be hard turning down great opportunities, but your number one priority is your business. So, although networking is a must there has to be a limit to what you take on.
What is the best lesson you have learned along the way?
Stay true to yourself. It is so easy to compare yourself and your business to other, more successful ones. And it is just as easy to mimic what they are doing. I think the best lesson I have learned has been, to just be you! You will attract those readers or clients that appreciate what you have to say or the work you do. Not everyone is going to agree with you or want to work with you, but staying true to yourself will be what allows you to stand out, be credible and remain current.
Take us through your day! What does 24 hours in your shoes look like?
Lots of multi-tasking and wearing many hats! I'm currently working two full time jobs so I'm a finance associate by day and stylist by night. I start my day at 7am, catching up on emails, checking social media sites, planning my day and enjoying a cup of Jo. I start my day job at 9am and spend the day at the office. I'm usually spending any downtime networking on social media and returning emails to clients. I'm home by 6pm, usually toss something quick and easy together for dinner, say hello to my love and hop back on the laptop. I'll usually spend my evenings styling my online clients and catching up on my favorite blogs. It's definitely a balancing act, but I absolutely love connecting with such great women!
Do you have any apps, tools or tricks that keep your organized and stress-free?
Pen and paper. I'm an avid list maker and enjoy the act of being able to cross things off my list as I accomplish them. It keeps you motivated when your feeling overwhelmed. I also have a notepad that I take with me every where. It houses everything from ideas, client notes to business information. I'd be completely lost without it!
Which person, brand or company do you most admire the most and why?
For my clients I favor Express. It's seriously a one-stop shop! From office attire to a social wardrobe, they have quality products at affordable prices. My clients are looking for style on a budget, that is versatile enough for all aspects of their life. Express is always on the list of stores we visit during the majority of my client sessions.
Give a shout out: Is there anyone in your life that has stood out to you as being extra supportive?
I'm very fortunate to have such a great support system of both friends and family. I've always been a dreamer and my friends and family have always encouraged all my dreams. As of late, I definitely have to give a shout out to my boyfriend. We live together so they have witnessed my melt downs and is always so supportive and encouraging. They really are the reason why I decided to really go full force with my business.
When you're not rocking the world with your talented self, how do you kick back and relax?
I'm actually quite the home body. A few sweets, candle lit and the latest episode of Dateline or Shark Tank and I'm one happy gal. I have absolutely no shame in spending all day in bed!
What advice could you give to someone who is starting their own blog/product/start-up?
Be patient and get comfortable just 'being' in your business. At the beginning, you are of the few, if not the only, person that sees the big picture or ultimate "vision" of your new venture. And not everyone responds as eagerly as you would like, so patience and consistency are definitely key.
If you had a life mantra it would be,
" Life is too short to wear boring clothes. "
In five years I hope to be continuously expanding my network. Every client I work with is such an inspiration. There is something very exciting and influential about witnessing success as it's happening, or on the cusp of it's break through. I absolutely love it, it's why I do what I do.
MLG recently announced a $20,000 StarCraft 2 tournament for North American players sponsored by the blu-ray [1] release of the 2013 Hollywood film, an adaptation of Orson Scott Card's popular science fiction novel of the same name.
The film features a protagonist who fights against overwhelming odds to save earth from an alien race known as the “buggers.” The tournament's announcement comes at an especially relevant timing given the current state of Terran despair and the race's near-extinction in Korea's GSL.
Note: Spoiler above.
“Humans vs buggers in Ender's Game really seems like TvZ,” said Reddit user [MLGnoscope] who had seen the movie. According to reports, the fan actually purchased a physical ticket and attended the film in person instead of acquiring it illegally online like everyone else.
MLG also reported that Ender's Game swept all award categories at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, which translated into an unprecedented organic CPM award growth rate of infinity percent (∞ %). The festival was held in MLG CEO Sundance Giovanni's posh New York City 4 bedroom 2 bath upper west side apartments with nearly all of MLG's staff in attendance.
“We hope that all fans help support the tournament,” said an MLG representative. “Please turn off ad-block, buy a Blu-ray player, and then buy the Ender's Game blu-ray disc.”
“This movie should really resonate with the StarCraft community,” said MLG Vice President and frequent gym participant Adam Apicella. “Ender's Game has Terrans fighting Zerg, but most importantly it has no Protoss at all.”
[1] “Blu-ray” is a storage format where the user must possess a physical copy of the media on a plastic 120mm by 1.2mm disc, similar to the now obsolete DVD and CD formats once popular before broadband internet. The user must also possess a “Blu-ray player” which can read and display the disc to a television.
A viral National Rifle Association (NRA) television commercial features country music star Charlie Daniels warning terrorists that Americans are fighters who — together with the NRA — stand as “freedom's safest place.”
During the 60-second commercial, Daniels intimates that the American spirit is not well-reflected in President Obama and that Obama and “his weak-kneed Ivy League friends” may give would-be attackers the wrong idea; their weakness may actually give terrorists a false sense of security.
The commercial debuted at NRA meetings this weekend, where it drew a sizable reaction from the audience.
So Daniels warns that terrorists who do not fear Obama ought to fear the American citizen and particularly American citizens aligned under the banner of the NRA.
Daniels says:
To the ayatollahs of Iran and every terrorist you enable, listen up. You might have met our fresh-faced, flower child president and their weak-kneed Ivy League friends, but you haven't met America. You haven't met the heartland, where the people will defend this nation with their bloody, calloused, bare hands, if that's what it takes. You haven't met the steelworkers and the hard rock miners or the swamp folks in Cajun country–who can wrestle a full-grown gator out of the water. You haven't met the farmers, the cowboys, the loggers, and the truck drivers. You don't know the mountain men who live off the land or the brave cops who fight the good fight in the urban war zones. No, you've never met America. And you ought to pray you never do. I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.

We've kind of been waiting for this all season from the Detroit Tigers: The run.
After beating the Indians for the second night in a row, they've increased their winning streak to 10 and increased their lead over the Indians to 5 games. Monday's ninth-inning defeat was a devastating blow for Cleveland but Tuesday's 5-1 loss was tough as well, with Justin Masterson, their best pitcher, facing Justin Verlander, who entered the game with a 4.61 ERA over their previous nine starts, including a bad 37/28 strikeout-to-walk ratio. It looked like a good matchup for the Indians.
Masterson had one bad inning -- the Tigers scored five in the fifth, a rally started when Ramon Santiago was hit by a pitch and finished off when Masterson nemesis Don Kelly hit a three-run homer. But Verlander was the story of the night, with perhaps their best game since April, allowing four hits in eight innings with no walks and seven strikeouts.
Verlander and pitching coach Jeff Jones have apparently spent a lot of time studying video in search of some sort of mechanical flaw that might explain Verlander's struggles. Verlander said they altered their motion to the plate a bit. "The adjustment that I made obviously made not just a little impact but a pretty big impact," they said. "Everything I've been searching for I was able to find it today. That's a huge stride in the right direction."
"That's the Justin Verlander we know," said Jim Leyland.
Maybe the biggest positive was that Verlander's fastball averaged 96.1 mph, their highest per-game average this season and well above their season average of 92.3. Their command had obviously been a big issue -- five walks their last start -- but they threw 75 of 112 pitches for strikes.
The Tigers have allowed just 13 runs during this 10-game winning streak, the first team, according to ESPN Stats & Info, to allow fewer than 15 runs in a 10-game win streak since Billy Martin's 1981 A's. In fact, in winning 14 of 15, Tigers starters are 12-1 with a 1.71 ERA. What's interesting is that during that stretch they've been striking out fewer batters, ranking just 21st among major league rotations in strikeout percentage since July 21.
As for the Indians, they've now lost 11 of 14 against Detroit. They still have two more games in this series -- Doug Fister versus Danny Salazar today, Max Scherzer versus Zach McAllister tomorrow -- and need to win both to get back within breathing distance of the division lead. But I get the feeling this is the series where we'll look back and say the Tigers wrapped up the division title. Whether this leads to a tough stretch for Cleveland, we'll see; at least 12 of their next 15 games after this series are against the Angels and Twins.
Story highlights GOP senator's tweet about White House being an adult day care center wasn't far off the mark, writes Michael D'Antonio
It reflects the frustration many Americans feel with President Trump, D'Antonio writes
Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book "Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.
(CNN) In the end, Donald Trump finally pushed Sen. Bob Corker to the point of exasperation, frustration and exhaustion felt by vast numbers of Americans who despair of the President's behavior. "It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center," tweeted Corker, referring to their fellow Republican as if they need constant minding. "Someone obviously missed their shift this morning."
Corker was provoked by early Sunday morning statements from Trump. who said, via Twitter, "Senator Bob Corker 'begged' me to endorse them for re-election in Tennessee, I said 'NO' and they dropped out (said they could not win without my endorsement)." Trump also said Corker asked to become secretary of state but, "I said 'NO THANKS.'" They also said Corker "didn't have the guts" to seek re-election in 2018.
The capital letters suggest the tweets came straight from the President. They love capital letters. But the timing and content are more important indicators of authenticity. Trump's social media outbursts are more vivid on weekends, when he's likely home alone.
And true Trump tweets resonate with a tone -- "guts" and "begged me" are classics -- that makes it seem like they don't quite understand where they are, or what is required of him. (Never mind that Corker's chief of staff, Todd Womack, challenged Trump's account of the facts: "The President called Sen. Corker on Monday afternoon and asked them to reconsider their decision not to seek re-election and reaffirmed that they would have endorsed him, as they have said many times.")
The fact that Trump could conduct stream-of-consciousness carping from the confines of the same White House that had been occupied by the likes of Lincoln, FDR and Ronald Reagan suggests that they may not be aware of their surroundings. As they tweet about TV shows, we can see that their mind is too often fixed on matters beneath a president. And when they do focus on something important, like national security, they indulge in silliness about the "Rocket Man" (Kim Jong-un) or praises himself: "Wow, Senator Luther Strange picked up a lot of additional support since my endorsement."

Ever wondered what it would be like to be black? (If you are black, just go with it.)
It's fair to guess that you have. It's human nature to fantasize about being anything we aren't: president, an astronaut, a rock star. (And rest assured, as Dave Chappelle and the Wayans have suggested in TV and film, many black people do daydream about being white.)
What to stream now
But fantasizing about being black is a whole 'nother thing. Because it implies being suddenly able to play spades, rock cornrows, give a "Sup" head nod to strangers and really feel Jay-Z lyrics and generally be cool and exotic and soulful and - let's go ahead and be really honest - have a perceived level of danger attached to your being that not being black does not afford. Yet the very notion of being able to "try on" black identity - particularly in our PC, frequently volatile racial environment - sounds highly insensitive and taboo, which is exactly whv It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia's Season 12 premiere episode "The Gang Turns Black" is pretty brilliant.
2016 was the blackest year in television
If you've watched the show even once during its 11 seasons, you know that the demented, anti-social but lovable freaks Mac (Rob McElhenney), Charlie (Charlie Day), Dennis (Glenn Howerton), Frank (Danny DeVito) and Dee (Kaitlin Olson) have done some really offensive things: get people in recovery drunk, use a baby to get money, make terrible rape jokes, mock addiction and much, much worse. They're very well the most deplorable people on television. And thank goodness for them. As the show premieres Season 12 Wednesday, we're reunited with the monumental a-holes we can't help but love — people who let us explore the shadow selves we never get to indulge in real life by fighting strangers, taking drugs in the middle of the day and yes, becoming black for a day.

In the Season 12 premiere, the gang is sitting around watching The Wiz when a freak storm sends a surge through an electrical blanket and Shazam! (or perhaps more appropriately, TaDow! ) they're all black. They spend the rest of the episode trying to figure out how and why, as well as exploring and discovering what being black is actually like. Without spoiling too much, Frank is thrilled to be able to use new language like "Fo sho" and, naturally, the "N-word"; as you'd expect, there's a run in with police (a few, actually) and singing and dancing.
Obviously, this is a premise fraught with landmines, even for a show that's pulled off blackface without backlash. But it works. It's quite funny, mostly because their new identities allow us to swim in the thick, uncomfortable muck of the ways we think (and overthink) about race. Having gone from white to suddenly black, they have to figure out what kind of black they are; they're stumbling to figure out their credit standing, if they know their fathers, if they have a criminal record. (It only enhances the irony and humor that these horrible white people are broke criminals with awful family histories.) Obviously, all their "legitimate" questions are based on ignorant, stereotypical generalizations, but in watching them wrestle with them and their own reactions to their own prejudices, we witness the head-spinning, tail-chasing confusing logic we all endure while fumbling over what's okay and not okay to ask, say and, in effect, think.
Better still that the "lesson" they're looking for never comes. It's just a messy, confounding and ridiculous trip that ends, as so many Sunny episodes do, in appalling violence with them basically learning nothing. The episode is risky, to be sure. But despite its illusion of being ribald, the premiere has a dirty secret: meticulous, thoughtful commentary, cleverly snuck in between low-brow antics. If anything doesn't work, it's the singing; doing this highly meta work as a musical feels like a slight cop out, a way to dial down the searing, awkward exposition unfolding so rapidly. It's a winner though, and a great way to kick off yet another season of totally inappropriate insanity.

Can I Afford That?
I've been forced to think about this question a lot lately. If I have to borrow money in order to pay for something, can I afford it, really? If I have to borrow $30 to buy dinner for my family or even $300 to get new brakes, doesn't that mean that I can't afford it?
If you are thinking about spending $3,000 for a new flat-screen TV or $30,000 for a new car, but you have to borrow the money, that means that you are probably not in a good financial position to buy those items. In other words – you can't afford it!
It's really not that hard of a concept to get a hold of. If you do not presently have the money to pay for something, then you can't afford it! In case you are wondering, my view of this doesn't change with a mortgage. Borrowing $300,000 to “buy” a house, means that you can't afford that house right now!
I know that people will talk about all the benefits to having a mortgage (pride of ownership, tax deduction, and even using it as a debt consolidation loan), but to me those are secondary issues that take away from the bottom line.
If you don't have the money to pay for something and you have to borrow money (and pay interest) in order to buy it, then you can't afford it! This is a simple concept, but many people will file for bankruptcy in the near future because they couldn't get a hold of it. Many of us will continue to borrow and spend – hoping for unrealistic salary increases, asset appreciation, and even government intervention to bail us out!
I feel I must make something clear at this point…I do not have a problem with someone who has the ability (read: money) to pay for something outright, but they are purposefully incurring some debt because they are using their cash for investments from which they stand a reasonable chance of earning more than they are paying out in interest. Trying to leverage your money in order to wisely increase your investing gains is something that can be analyzed, calculated, and managed (of course, that doesn't mean there aren't risks involved).
What I am talking about is the constant need for everything to be financed in this country! You can finance a house, car, education, stove, sofa, computer, and practically anything else that you wish to buy. This means that people no longer look at whether they can truly afford something, but only if they can get by with monthly payments!
The biggest problem (besides feeding an already unfettered since of entitlement among most people) with all of this is that all of this debt is backed by depreciating assets (cars, furniture, electronics, etc) or things that no longer have any value (such as meals, old clothing, vacations, and a worthless degree in a subject you'll never use)! Most people are not even in a position to sell their assets and pay off their debt!
In order to overcome this, we must learn to live below our means and think about more than our immediate desires! Debt consolidation is only an answer once you have taken care of the real problem! The same goes with any other type of hardship program or bailout you may receive.
In the end, it takes a change in thinking to stop this epidemic.

Sayyida Farideh Mostafavi Khomeini (Persian: فریده مصطفوی خمینی‎; born 1943) is an Iranian female religious scholar and Ayatollah Khomeini's youngest daughter.[1]
Farideh Mostafavi studied Islamic studies at home as well as in several maktabs of Qom in the 1970s. Remarkably, they began their formal ḥawza education in the women's section (Dar al-Zahra) of Ayatollah Shariatmadari's hawza Dar al-Tabligh. Ayatollah Shariatmadari was later a major opponent of Khomeini during the 1979 revolution, although Shariatmadari had saved Khomeini's life in the 1960s. Mrs Mostafavi later studied at Maktab-e Tawhid and completed their studies at Jamiat al-Zahra in Qom. They now teach at Jamiat al-Zahra and has been a member of the board of trustees of Jamiat al-Zahra since 1990.
Mostafavi used to run a charity, together with other women, called Moasseseh Davazdah-e Farvadin, which built a public bath for women in Qom and ran sewing and cooking classes.[2] They were also one of the co-founders, together with Fatemeh Tabatabai, the daughter in law of Khomeini's, of the Jamiat-e Zanan-e Jomhuri-ye Islami, the Society of Women of the Islamic Republic.[3]

THE QUICKEN LOANS ARENA erupted immensely when Stipe Miocic plunged Alistair Overeem into unconsciousness. Four months before this eruption, Miocic had defied all the odds and won the UFC Heavyweight championship in the hostile environment of Curitiba.
Stipe Miocic talks possible match with Cain Velasquez,
Their campaign for firefighters, dream fight and more
And as the referee raised their arm high under the bright lights of the Quicken Loans arena, they were enjoying their first title defense and that too, in the comfort of being in their own backyard.
The historic title win and defense of Miocic has been one of the major talking points of the Cleveland's sporting resume of 2016. The city that had the infamous ‘sports curse' completely turned the story upside down this year and Miocic feels that it's a team effort.
Stipe Miocic: It was a team effort. I got it done in Brazil and defended my title in Cleveland. The Cavs won the NBA championship. The Cleveland Indians went to the World Series. The Monsters also hoisted a championship. It is a great time to be a Clevelander!
Another name that has been crucial to Cleveland is LeBron James. James led Cleveland Cavaliers to their first ever NBA Championship win earlier this year and Miocic crossed paths with the basketball icon when they showed up at the World Series to support another team from the city: The Cleveland Indians.
Stipe Miocic: Lebron is a great guy. It was awesome to hang with them at the World Series together and support not only the Indians, but the city of Cleveland. I was able to go to the Cavaliers ring ceremony and then walk across the street to watch the Indians in the World Series.
While 2016 has been a year to cherish both in memory and the history books, Miocic assures that their journey towards being a legendary Heavyweight performer in the UFC has only started.
Stipe Miocic: I will defend my title and enter the heavyweight elite, becoming the only heavyweight to successfully defend the title twice.
One major factor that could help them reach their goal will be their confidence. Unlike some of the other champions in UFC, Miocic notes that they would not pick their opponents and it's this same confidence that they point out as the reason.
Stipe Miocic: I am confident in my skills and will put on a performance regardless of my opponent. I will continue to successfully defend my title, regardless of opponent.
Developing such courage requires years and years of training, hard work, and of course, a team that support you to the core.
Stipe Miocic: Great coaching staff and team [has been crucial]. They put countless hours of prep and training in with me. I wouldn't be where I am today without them.
Going back to their journey inside the octagon, the next title defense of Miocic could be decided after UFC 207 where Cain Velasquez will face off against Fabricio Werdum in a potential title eliminator. When quizzed about their prediction for the fight, they had the following to say.
Stipe Miocic: I don't pick fights. Cain lost to Werdum at UFC 188. It will be really exciting to see these guys fight again. They are both incredible fighters. I am excited to watch this fight!
Miocic might be open to face any challenge that comes their way, but a good portion of the MMA community has been buzzing about a potential fight between Miocic and Cain.
Stipe Miocic: Cain is a great striker and excellent wrestler. But I am as well. It will be a great fight.
While Cain Velasquez vs. Stipe Miocic is a dream scenario for the fans, as far as Miocic is concerned, they also have a dream opponent.
Stipe Miocic: Mirko Cro Cop.  They are an incredible fighter and someone I have always looked up to. They actually beat me up on my most recent trip to Croatia this past month! HAH!
The success that Miocic enjoys inside the octagon and the goals that they have for their future, however, has not stopped them from being a superhero outside it. Just like all the other firefighters that make lives safer around the world, Stipe is passionate about helping others and they have no plans of stopping this.
Stipe Miocic: I am still an active full time firefighter. Being a firefighter is who I am and always will be. I am extremely passionate about helping others and will continue to do this as a firefighter. It is tough to balance while training for a fight, but I wouldn't trade it for the world. I am actually running a campaign currently for the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation. I am donating $8.00 a shirt to the Foundation. $1.00 for the 8 years I have been a firefighter
Finally, when quizzed about their feelings for India, Miocic had this to say:
Stipe Miocic: India is definitely on my list of places to visit. It is an awesome country with so much history and culture. I hope at some point I can experience everything this country has to offer. I got married this past year and still haven't had a chance to go on a honeymoon with my wife. Maybe we can head to India for a few weeks!
We might have to wait till 2017 to see Miocic fight again and possibly make history by defending the Heavyweight title twice, but for the time being, you can support their noble cause of helping the firefighters here: www.encyte.me/stipe.

Venezuelans are crying out for freedom and respite from the hellhole—where girls as young as twelve are forced to prostitute themselves in order to avoid starvation— that Maduro, following in the footsteps of their predecessor, has built, but those cries will no longer have any voice: Maduro's extra-constitutional “National Constituent Assembly” has usurped power from the elected Venezuelan congress—the last and only governmental body held by the opposition. Maduro's dictatorship has formalized absolute power over the country, and over the people, including the silencing of any dissent.
Like any other dictator worth their authoritarian salt, they have either imprisoned the opposition who will face treason trials in kangaroo courts, or they have sent assassins to murder those who have escaped.
While the Venezuelan people are suffering and starving, Maduro now seeks to sell their country out to Russia for a pittance and enough support to remain in power. For a regime that prided itself on pushing out foreign control and bringing ownership back to “the people”, the de facto overlordship by Russia would be the highest of ironies if it weren't so predictable.
Everything Maduro and Chavez claimed to be fighting against is exactly what they've achieved by their own tyranny. As is oft said, a government powerful enough to give you everything you want is powerful enough to take everything you have, and Venezuela has become the perfect example of that.

In the age of big data and disruptive technologies, we can unlock the potential for government to think smarter and engage with businesses, civil society, and citizens in new ways to achieve meaningful social impacts.
The Administration, along with state and local governments across the country, has been working to develop new tools and approaches that are ushering in an era of government innovation and delivering better results. Last week at the White House, the Domestic Policy Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of Management and Budget, and the U.S. Digital Service hosted leaders representing all levels of government as well as academics, community organizations, philanthropy, impact investors, and technologists who are advancing a series of new tools that are helping government to drive better outcomes.
Cecilia Muñoz addresses leaders gathered at the White House to discuss innovative approaches to help government drive better outcomes.
Together, the Administration and these leaders are championing new innovations that can effectively achieve the outcomes that citizens want and deserve, including:
What all these programs have in common is that they are bringing new solutions that can better, more reliably, or more quickly achieve the results citizens want and deserve. In short they are been created to deliver better outcomes.
A Challenge and an Opportunity for Innovation
Government social service funding can sometimes be over-focused on compliance, with an emphasis on tracking spending and prescribing processes that service providers must follow rather than calling for the outcomes we'd like them to achieve. Focusing on compliance alone or, for example, an overemphasis on tracking spending rather than outcomes, may obscure our goals, discourage innovation and thereby inhibit progress. That is why this Administration has taken several steps to help shift to a greater emphasis on outcomes and to encourage innovation.
Each of the innovative approaches noted in the bullets above addresses this core challenge and drive to outcomes in different ways: New technologies enable faster and more reliable services and information sharing. Funding innovations are enabling government to pay for outcomes rather than compliance and process. Evidence-based policy efforts are identifying the interventions that are best at achieving outcomes. Better use of data and application of data science is enabling us to understand and track outcomes in ways that were not previously possible. Place-based initiatives are breaking the compliance silos in community enabling them to more holistically drive to outcomes communities seek.
Beyond these areas, we've set new, government-wide policies to better emphasize outcomes. These include: requiring each major Federal agency to focus their strategic objectives on outcomes; annually assessing agency progress using the best available evidence; and reforming grants management regulations to encourage programs to incentivize grant recipients to focus on outcomes, while taking a risk-based approach to guarding against waste fraud and abuse.
A New Framework for Government Innovation: The Outcomes Mindset
Last week's event we took stock of our progress across these individual areas of innovation noted above (evidence-based policy, place-based initiatives, data science, civic tech, procurement innovation, performance, etc). Participants identified ways these new tools can and are complimenting one another, and thereby achieving even better results.
We also discussed a new framing that is the common connector among all of these approaches: a core focus, central to the DNA of each, on achieving better outcomes.
By doing more to adopt an outcomes mindset, government will be better positioned to achieve results, remove barriers to progress, and to move the needle on communities' biggest challenges. The innovations highlighted above, and others, offer new tools that make this vision more achievable than ever. We can use these strategies to transform public sector policy making and spending to advance the programs that deliver increased social impact.
By focusing more intentionally on desired outcomes, leaders from across government and the social sector are already identifying and using the twenty-first century solutions that can transform service delivery and strengthen citizens' connection to government.
Transitioning to an outcomes mindset will often represent a challenging shift for government. Achieving this systems change will not be easy, but in the different initiatives noted above, we have helped lay the groundwork for a government that has the procurement, data, and technical tools to measurably improve outcomes in communities across the country.
Announcements and New Commitments
This important work continues to gain momentum. The Administration, along with several organizations taking part in last week's convening, announced new commitments that promote an outcomes mindset. You can read about them here.
The Administration will continue to build on this momentum and to work with partners at all levels of government and beyond so that we can be better, more reliably, and more quickly achieve the results citizens want and deserve.

The British Prime Minister Theresa May has arrived in Canada on Monday, September 18, with the row between Boeing and Bombardier on their agenda. Sputnik spoke to an expert who said the dispute could "escalate."
Boeing claims huge Canadian government subsidies allowed them to sell a new fleet of planes at substantially less than the market price.
​But David Collins, a professor of international economic law at City University of London, said the case smacked of "double standards."
"It's a bit rich of the United States to say that Canada is subsidizing Bombardier, because the US has been doing the same for Boeing for years," Professor Collins told Sputnik.
"Lots of industries are subsidized. The convention is that everybody is doing it and you just turn a blind eye to it. Now there is a worry that this could escalate," they added.

Later this year, the United States International Trade Commission is due to announce whether it believes the Canadian plane manufacturer Bombardier is in breach of anti-dumping legislation.
"The maximum fine should be no more than the amount of the injury sustained by Boeing. They are not supposed to be punitive like anti-trust fines," Professor Collins told Sputnik.
But if Bombardier and Canada feel hard done by, they could they hit back at one of the many US industries which has been subsidized or it might encourage other countries to ignore the convention of "turning a blind eye" to state subsidies.
Clip of me on the BBC this morning talking about potential aircraft subsidy dispute between the US and Canada https://t.co/q5S4CYaMHv — David Collins (@davidcollinslaw) 18 September 2017
​Professor Collins said there were huge up-front costs involved in the aircraft manufacturing industry.
"The research and design is so expensive, so governments can depict it as having research and innovation elements," they told Sputnik.
Professor Collins, who is themselves Canadian, said Bombardier had been receiving "massive subsidies" from governments for years.
"Even when I was a boy it was happening. It's based in Quebec, which carries a lot of political clout, a bit like Northern Ireland does at the moment in Britain," they told Sputnik.
Bombardier owns several factories in Northern Ireland and recently announced 4,500 job losses, and Mrs. May will be raising the issue when they meet with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this week.
They have already lobbied US President Donald Trump about the dispute, which stemmed from Boeing crying foul over Bombardier's sale of 75 of its CSeries mid-range jets to Delta Air Lines.
Boeing claims Bombardier sold the planes for US$19 million each, despite them costing around US$33 million each to build.
It said they could only do this because they received huge subsidies from the Canadian government.
In 1989, Bombardier bought the Shorts aircraft factories in Northern Ireland and the Unite trade union, which represents workers there.
"Bombardier benefited from state investment from the UK, Canada and from Invest NI all of which was entirely lawful and legitimate — a fact that the UK government should clarify," said Davy Thompson, Unite's regional coordinator.

​"Boeing's attempts to link this public investment to the allegation of unfair competition are unsustainable, indeed, in the case of the sale of planes to Delta Air Lines which has been raised, Boeing did not even make a bid. Prime Minister Theresa May is reported to have had a phone conversation with President Trump on the matter but it is our understanding that the President can have no input into this decision," said Mr. Thompson.
"What is needed is for the Prime Minister to phone the head of Boeing and direct them to end their corporate bullying. The UK government is the second largest purchaser of Boeing products. These present ample leverage to end this damaging course of action," they added.
Fire has broken out at a building used as a Catholic chaplaincy at the University of Kent.
Crews were called to the building on St Thomas Hill in Canterbury at 2.30am today, with four engines used to tackle the blaze.
No-one was in the building at the time, and around 20 firefighters were used to tackle the blaze.

The fire started on the first floor of the three-storey building, which measures around 30ft x 30ft.
A building safety officer has been at the scene assessing how safe the building is, and firefighters were still there early this morning.
Mark Jacobs, 40, of Glen Iris Avenue, witnessed the fire.
They said: "When I heard some noise outside I thought it might have been a fox near the bins.
The aftermath: the university building is badly damaged by fire. Picture: Mark Jacobs
"So I looked out at about 2.40am and there was this brilliant orange light with flames shooting into the sky.
"The fire service were already there by then and they were excellent. They had it under control very quickly and were containing the flames.
"They also got a big rig up so they could put it out from above.
"The firefighters obviously knew what they were doing so we weren't that frightened."
Kirsty Galling had just finished their shift as a door supervisor at the Venue nightclub on the university campus when they came across the fire.
The 32-year-old, of Suffolk Road, Spring Lane, photographed it with their new iPhone 6.
They said: “It was quite an impressive sight in a funny way, with flames shooting up.
“They were going from side to side. As I went back to my other half's office in Wincheap, I passed more fire engines so I knew it was a serious one and then later they shut off the road.”

On Wednesday of this week, we reported that a source familiar with Ambassador Stevens' thinking said in the months before their death, Ambassador Stevens talked about being worried about what they called the never-ending security threats in Benghazi.
We also reported that the ambassador specifically mentioned the rise in Islamic extremism, the growing Al Qaeda presence in Libya and said they were on an Al Qaeda hit list. The information for that report, like all of CNN's reporting, was carefully vetted. Some of that information was found in a personal journal of Ambassador Stevens in their handwriting.
We came upon the journal through our reporting and notified the family. At their request, we returned that journal to them. We reported what we found newsworthy in the ambassador's writings. A reporter followed up on what we found newsworthy, as I said, in the ambassador's writings.
The outspoken developer of Super Meat Boy, Edmund McMillen, wrote on the official developer blog that they intend to port the game over to iOS devices.
In the post, McMillen promises that the game will not be "a shitty port."
Originally released for the PC and the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the game, now renamed Super Meat Boy: The Game, is being reworked with a new interface to support the iOS's touch screen interface.
"Sadly, there was no way of doing this without the game becoming a pile of garbage, Super Meat Boy is a twitch platformer with precision controls, there was no way in hell this would work on a touch screen with buttons all over it, Super Meat Boy isn't a game we want to make a sub-par version of just to cash in…"
"So, we decided to totally remake the whole game instead, from the ground up!"
McMillen posted the first ever screenshot for the new game, which you can see below:
Not many foods contain more saturated fat than cheese. And the average American consumed 33 pounds of it in 2010, three times as much as they or they did in 1970. From fast-food restaurants to the school cafeteria, cheese is ubiquitous — slathered on pizza, layered atop burgers and poured over nachos. Yum!
So what if the obesity rate among adults rose from 14.5 percent in the early 1970s to 35.7 percent in 2010? Only a dietary killjoy would harp on the possible connection between cheese consumption and the nation's obesity epidemic. Only a nanny-stater like New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg would suggest that the government do something about it.
If people want more cheese, that's between them and the free market, right?
Well, no. The summation of individual choices can have big costs for everyone. Obese people cost health insurers $1,429 more per year than the non-obese do, according to the National Institutes of Health.
Also, the Golden Age of Cheese was not purely the result of individual choices. It reflects decades of pro-cheese U.S. agriculture policy. I am not making this up. The nation's cheese binge is a case study in the broader dysfunctionality of federal farm legislation, the latest iteration of which is being debated in Congress.
Yes, there are real social trends at work, too. An aging population consumes less milk as fluid and more in solid form; a wealthier population can afford a richer diet, including cheesy dishes eaten at restaurants.
But the country's appetite for cheese also reflects U.S. policy.
Since the New Deal, Washington has tried to protect dairy farmers through price supports and production controls so arcane that only specialists can understand them.
As a 2004 Agriculture Department report explained, the net effect of dairy programs is to prop up fluid milk prices even when producers make more of it than people want to drink — leaving plenty of excess to dump on cheese manufacturers.
“Thus, consumers see lower butter and cheese prices and higher fluid milk prices than would appear in the absence of the programs,” the USDA found.
Not surprisingly, fluid milk consumption has stagnated while cheese consumption has grown. Of the 188.9 billion pounds of milk produced in 2008, some 82 billion were sold to cheesemakers, according to the USDA.
On top of those warped incentives, the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 authorized the Agriculture Department to collect a fee from all dairy farmers and turn the money over to a corporation known as Dairy Management, which promotes consumption of cheese and other dairy products.
Dairy Management's annual budget is about $140 million, some of which it has spent to encourage Domino's and other fast-food chains to develop menu items containing more cheese. With Dairy Management's aid, mozzarella, most of which goes on pizza, has become the fastest-growing component of U.S. cheese consumption, accounting for a third of all the cheese we ingested in 2010.
In short, the federal government has put its big thumb on the scale in favor of cheese-eating. This is undoubtedly good for the large, specialized milk producers that increasingly dominate the industry, but it is not obviously in the interest of — well, anyone else.
House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) was not far off in calling the U.S. dairy program “Soviet-style.”
Nor was they incorrect to suggest that the farm bill under discussion would keep the government in the business of manipulating prices and supply, and might make matters worse.
Boehner, of course, is a Republican, but support for farm subsidies is a regional, not partisan, issue, with dairy-state Democrats and Republicans alike lavishing constituents with taxpayer-funded largess.
Many recoil from the prospect of Bloombergian dietary prohibitions. They should spare some outrage for the far more numerous and expensive things government does to encourage consumption of foods that people might not choose to eat or produce in current quantities, if prices and production were left up to the free market.
When you think about it, the whole trillion-dollar farm bill amounts to a vast federal subsidy to this country's sugary, starchy, cheesy diet, filled out with grain-fed beef, pork and chicken.
I love candy, pizza and hamburgers as much as the next guy. I just don't see why businesses that profit by supplying that diet deserves an advantage over potential innovators and competitors. Still less do I see why they should get that advantage at taxpayer expense.

It is a bit late into this new year, being that we're already in the second month, but we are now cycling the Community Promotion Ads for 2017!
What are Community Promotion Ads?
Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.
Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?
This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:
the site's Twitter account
cool events or conferences
anything else your community would genuinely be interested in
The goal is for future visitors to find out about the stuff your community deems important. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are relevant to your own community's interests, both for those already in the community and those yet to join.
Why do we reset the ads every year?
Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.
The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.
How does it work?
The answers you post to this question must conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored.
All answers should be in the exact form of: [![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2] [1]: http://image-url [2]: http://clickthrough-url Please do not add anything else to the body of the post. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments. The question must always be tagged with the magic community-ads tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.
Image requirements
The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.

MANILA, Philippines - After citing youthful lapse of judgment, the lure of travel abroad, and the prize money, Mark Joseph Solis now says that poverty drove them to lift someone elseâ€™s photo and submit it as their own to a contest sponsored by the Chilean embassy in Manila.
They have not returned the prize money of $1,000, and issued an appeal that they be allowed to keep it.
In an interview with GMA News TV, Solis explained that they only wanted help ease their familyâ€™s financial problems.
â€œHirap din sa buhay, minsan gusto mo rin ng bagong gamit kahit papano, minsan kapos sa tuition, in fact ngayon hindi pa ako nakakabayad ng tuition ko sa UP (Life is hard, sometimes you want new things, sometimes you lack tuition money, in fact I havenâ€™t paid my UP tuition yet).â€
Solis, along with their mother Amelia, showed the news crew their modest rented home, which they are also renting out to other people to augment their income.
However, netizen Maricris Valte, who used to work with Solis, urged the fact-finding committee of the University of the Philippines (UP) to conduct a lifestyle check.
â€œWatching Mark Solisâ€™ interview on GMA News TV, where they claim that money problems forced them to resort to misrepresenting himself. I want to puke! Iâ€™ve seen their house in Las PiÃ±as and the venue of the GMA-7 interview doesnâ€™t look anything close to their house. They have more expensive gadgets than I have! I challenge the fact-finding committee of UP to investigate their and their familyâ€™s lifestyle,â€ Valte posted on their Facebook account.
When asked to elaborate, Valte told The STAR that Solis used to work in a project that they were managing and that they rode in the same service car that ferried them from their home in Las PiÃ±as to their seminar venue in Tagaytay.
Valte also disputes Solisâ€™ claims that they led the research arm of the Philippine Society of Public Administration (PSPA). â€œHe was contracted for my project Dec. 1, 2012 and unless this is where they spent those times that they were absent from work, there is no way that they could have been â€˜leadingâ€™ the research arm of PSPA. I recommended the pre-termination of their contract effective March 8, 2013.â€
Another case of misrepresentation, Valte pointed out, is the political science thesis of Solis titled â€œAccountability Deficit and Electoral Violence: The Case of Civilian Volunteer Organizations in Shariff Aguak, Maguindanao,â€ which received a mark of 1.25, reportedly the highest in their class.
â€œAs Dr. Maria Ela Atienza of Pol Sci dept said, there is no undergraduate thesis in Pol Sci, unless you belong to a 5-year BA-MA Honors program (and Mark did not belong to this program). In such case, you get a grade of P or F for your thesis, with no numerical equivalent,â€ Valte said.
Meanwhile, University of the Philippines president Alfredo Pascual yesterday said they share the outrage felt by everyone over the issue involving graduate student Solis, who won in a photo essay competition by submitting a photo lifted from the Internet.
â€œI would like to assure the public that the UP administration is treating this matter very seriously. I share the outrage felt by everyone,â€ said Pascual in a statement.
â€œUpon my instructions, the UP National College of Public Administration and Governance (NCPAG) has formed a fact-finding committee to establish the circumstances and chronology of events as well as the digital footprints related to this issue and to recommend measures to be undertaken to ensure that justice is served,â€ they said.
UP NCPAG dean Maria Fe Mendoza said the fact-finding committee is composed of a senior faculty, a junior faculty, and a student representative.
Solis, a graduate of political science in UP, is currently enrolled in their first semester at the UP NCPAG for their masters degree.
â€œWe share the indignation of many people who find the action of Mr. Solis profoundly deplorable. Let us allow due process to take its complete course,â€ UP-NCPAG said in a statement.
Earlier, UP vice president for public affairs J. Prospero de Vera said the three-person fact-finding committee was given until Oct. 4 to submit its recommendations.
â€œThe fact-finding committee, after the appraisal of the facts, will say whether (or not) they think there are violations of university rules and regulations,â€ said De Vera.
As regards requests posted on the Internet asking the university to withdraw the political science degree granted to Solis, De Vera said UP could not just decide on the matter without giving them due process.
â€œThere is a process involved as far as taking back degrees because that is given by the Board of Regents,â€ said the vice president.
â€œThe board will have to act on it based on a complaint, based on an investigation, and based on the use of due process through the student disciplinary tribunal,â€ they said.
UP Diliman chancellor Caesar Saloma had said the university is currently in the process of revising its student rules and regulations.
Saloma said the 2012 Code of Student Conduct â€“ a draft of which was released on the UP website â€“ is still under consultation and has yet to take effect.
The present one in effect is the 1998 rules and regulations on student conduct and discipline.
Section 1 of the 1998 rule states that â€œstudents shall at all times observe the laws of the land and the rules and regulations of the university.â€
The Cultural Center of the Philippines, partner of the Chilean embassy in the Calidad Humana project, yesterday issued a statement deploring Solisâ€™ act of plagiarism.
â€œHis action becomes even more shameless when they personally received their prizes from Ambassador Roberto Mayorga during the celebration of the National Day of Chile,â€ CCP said. â€œWe understand that Mr. Solis will be living in the shadow of their shame.â€
The Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPPAP) likewise said that their own investigation is underway and that if Solis is proven guilty the reward will be recalled â€œwithout prejudice to the filing of civil and criminal cases if warranted by circumstances.â€ â€“ Janvic Mateo, Jose Rodel Clapano, Verns Joven
Newcastle are reportedly pursuing Manchester City teenager Cameron Humphreys.
According to the Daily Mail, Newcastle United are in the race to sign Manchester City's teenage defender Cameron Humphreys.
The Magpies have swooped to sign Georginio Wijnaldum and Aleksandar Mitrovic from PSV Eindhoven and Anderlecht respectively this summer, whilst another Anderlecht star is also poised to join Newcastle, with Chancel Mbemba awaiting work permit clearance.
Away from that, new manager Steve McClaren may look to add more new faces - and Manchester City's Humphreys is certainly a surprise name.
The Magpies may need new options at centre back but 16-year-old Humphreys is one for the future, despite impressing for City during their pre-season fixtures.
According to the Daily Mail, Newcastle are ready to make an offer for Humphreys, with the defender able to sign a professional contract at the end of August.
They could face competition from Everton and Manchester United though, with a number of Premier League clubs seemingly keen to sign Humphreys.
A talented young centre back with the potential to develop into a Premier League player, Humphreys' impressive displays during pre-season have put them on the radar of a number of clubs - and Newcastle will be hoping that they choose them over their Premier League rivals.
Birmingham City FC risk upsetting supporters and the local community after it emerged that the club will play host to the annual conference of a highly controversial political party.
‘Justice for men and boys (and the women who love them)' was founded by Mike Buchanan, who is still the party's leader. Buchanan had previously formed ‘The Anti-Feminism League' and the ‘Campaign for Merit in Business'. The party's principal aim is to alter what it perceives to be the exploitation of the human rights of men and boys by a state that privileges women and girls.
To say there is a sinister undertone to the party is an understatement. Links from the ‘j4mb' website include pieces titled '13 reasons women lie about being raped' and '10 reasons false rape allegations are common', with the underlying claim that sexism causes far more harm to men and boys than to women and girls.
Buchanan and members of their party handed out leaflets before Birmingham City's home game against Aston Villa on Sunday, and a news item on their website announces that the party conference in 2018 will be held at St Andrew's Stadium. Buchanan is a known Birmingham City fan, and is seen in the video wearing a club shirt with their name on the back and carrying a club football.
In a YouTube video Buchanan is shown around St Andrew's ahead of the conference. They explain that they will be able to post whatever messages they see fit on the club's LED screen looking out onto the pitch as part of the conference arrangement, reiterating that later in the video.
“Here we are at the home of the Blues,” Buchanan says. “That fits for a men's conference. Blues for boys and pink for girls, just as nature intended.”
Amongst the points in Buchanan's detailed manifesto is criticism for the public funding of women's domestic abuse organisations such as Women's Aid and the claim that the state is disadvantaging males in 20 areas including abortion, education, sexual abuse, domestic violence and divorce.
On Tuesday, Buchanan spoke on BBC Radio Nottingham on the subject of allegations of sexual harassment of women in the workplace, and their views were emphatic:
“I spent 30 years in the business world and never once came across an example of women claiming to be sexually harassed. This is women claiming to be sexually harassed, not who have been harassed. If we believe them we are basically saying that men are guilty. “There are some very unattractive women, including some politicians, who claim sexual harassment. Their claims are not credible. Perhaps they are fantasising. “It's usually unattractive women who claim to have been sexually harassed and it is simply not right. If she's more attractive she'll get more attention from men so they won't need to claim things It's simple.”
The news may come as a shock to supporters given Birmingham City's excellent record in campaigning for equality. They are the only English Football League club working towards the Premier League Equality Standard Advanced Award for commitment to equality, but there are valid questions to answer as to how playing host to a political organisation with such controversial views on women's rights fits in with that aim.
The club stresses on its website that it has a ‘shared duty to safeguard the longevity of the business, provide a high standard of service to our existing fans whilst nurturing the next generation of supporters'. The hope is that they are not fully aware of the views of the organisation that is intending to use its facilities for is annual conference.
‘Birmingham City Football Club's aim is to confront and eliminate discrimination, whether by reason of race, colour, nationality, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, age, ethnic and national origin, disability or gender reassignment,' a statement on their website reads. This is a sad step backwards.

Aston Villa's much-loved Restaurant VMF will close forever in a month's time despite a five-year tenure which has seen it win a host of awards.
The Villa Park restaurant closes its doors for the final time on July 19 – despite occupying the lofty position of Birmingham's seventh best-rated restaurant on Tripadvisor.
A club spokesperson said VMF was a five-year project and was closing as it had run its course.
However, it marks a skills blow in one of the city's biggest pockets of deprivation as the restaurant was largely run by apprentices from under-privileged backgrounds who both prepare and serve the food.
VMF - Villa Midlands Food - was established in October 2010 as a training restaurant, offering a way into the hospitality sector for young people living within a ten-mile radius of the stadium who are not in education, employment or training (NEETS).
It was reportedly a pet project of multi-millionaire owner Randy Lerner who has now put the club up for sale.
When it was established, Mr Lerner told the Post senior officials at the club felt morally obliged to put something back into the community.
They said they wanted to demonstrate a "sustainable commitment" to the Aston neighbourhood and the idea of a training restaurant was born.
They said at the time: "VMF is a very visible aspect of what the Aston Villa philosophy is all about. We firmly believe that our football club should be a central pillar of the local community.
"We now have a high calibre restaurant which provides young people from the local area the practical skills and experience to have a rewarding career in hospitality. This is good for both the club and for future generations."
The VMF project saw apprentices spend two years with Aston Villa Hospitality and Events, working toward a level two NVQ Diploma in Hospitality Services with Walsall College.
While learning the ropes in food preparation and service, the trainees are encouraged to muck in at Villa's allotment plot just over a mile away in Brookvale Road, growing seasonal produce to be used in the kitchen.
The restaurant has received a substantial haul of awards in its first three years, including the top gong at the Football Hospitality Awards as well as a Green Apple Environment Award.
When it was established, it became the first hospitality training establishment to be set up by a football team and served up to 50 covers.
It is presently rated the seventh place in Birmingham on Tripadvisor with 265 out of 324 reviews handing out five stars.
In the pre-Snowden age, considering that you were being spoken to by a household item was enough to have you committed to correctional facilities -sponsored reprogramming.
In their new novel, Nowhere to Hide, the journalist Glenn Greenwald describes how the NSA contractor and they turned whistleblower put their telephones with the batteries disconnected to thwart spooks' skill to control telephones remotely as mics in a deep freezer. But what would occur if the refrigerator was listening to your own words?
Hipsters Build NSA Surveillance Tribute in NY
Two American artists at the moment are taking that notion into a rational decision. Using just a credit card-sized Raspberry Pi computer, a mic and a WiFi card hacked into a lightbulb fitting, and a piece of open source software hosted at Github, they've installed a listening device at an undisclosed place in Manhattan, ny, and linked it to your Twitter web feed.
“There are many ways this could be executed, some completely free of charge,” says Brian House, a 34-year old artist living in nyc, who co-created the job with Kyle MacDonald. “Our variant prices between $50 and 100 as it contains a Raspberry Pi and a mic.”
House describes how it operates. “The apparatus always records 10-second snippets of sound, analyses the for prospective voice content, and sends assuring file to Mechanical Turk for transcription. The system then posts these transcriptions to Twitter.”
The transcriptions of the Twitter web feed they are at times at others oddly touching, and cryptic; but consistently intensely voyeuristic.
How do you feel about mass surveillance?
Would all these phrases' speakers feel to see their words recorded such as this? How would you feel live and to have your private conversations overheard -tweeted? Feel the exact same manner about Tempora, or Prism, XKeyscore?
Stripped of circumstance, these remarks might cause you to consider over a world where there's no solitude, nor any anticipation of its ramifications. It reifies the belief that someone someplace within an office in Utah, Virginia or Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, is listening to your every word. That is not paranoia; that is the modern surveillance state, say the artists, who considered a live sound stream but settled on text.
The artists say: “The ability to dissect and comprehend text can also be the basis for the international surveillance machine. As soon as you have something that's searchable, knowable, you may make forecasts and judgements from it – and that is where the risk is. That notion of making the real world searchable in realtime is the basis for Conversnitch.”
Its objectives, they say, are to play notions around politics and technology. “Binaries like public/private, physical/digital, human/automated are being completely reconfigured at the minute, which is quite definitely a political problem.
“The secret installation of Prism and other applications is an obvious breach of democratic principles, and it requires a rethinking of the way in which a free society must work within an age when data-generating technology is thus incorporated into regular life.”
The artists say they'd “definitely” collaborate with authorities if they heard someone admitting to some serious offense or plotting a terrorist incident, but what do they think of the ethos of releasing code and info which may help individuals spy on their buddies, coworkers, or partners? “Since time immemorial there have been all kinds of creative ways to do that,” says House. “Releasing the code is a prompt to other artists to iterate on the notion, and it presents how simple something like this can be setting up, hopefully creating some essential reflection.”
The government must tighten up requirements that allow Canadian employers to hire low skilled temporary foreign workers and do a better job enforcing the rules of the program, an expert in the issue says.
"The issue is how seriously are they taking that enforcement and how much are they actually doing it and what happens when they actually do do it," said Naomi Alboim, chair of Queen's University's School of Policy Studies.
The federal government has expanded its investigation into McDonald's use of temporary foreign workers following CBC's Go Public reports over complaints about the use of the Temporary Foreign Worker program at a franchise outlet in B.C.
Now, some McDonald's employees at some Alberta franchises are complaining that local workers are getting shortchanged to accommodate temporary foreign workers.
Alboim said the temporary foreign workers' low-skilled pilot project, introduced by the Liberal government in 2002, has since "grown quite astronomically and that's the group that is pretty vulnerable.” Those who fall under that category include workers in the hospitality and food sectors.
Alboim says the program is problematic. There is no transition to permanent residency status for low-skilled workers, unlike workers in the Live-In Caregiver Program. As well, low-skilled temporary foreign workers are tied to a single employer, single location, with little mobility and very little enforcement, they said.
"And the question is, is it really true that there aren't people already here in Canada — whether permanent residents or Canadian citizens or students or young people — not available to do those jobs?"
Many Canadian employers support the TFW program, arguing they need these workers to fill job vacancies. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, recently told CBC News that many Canadian employers feel that temporary foreign workers have a better work ethic than Canadians and that there are some jobs in some regions that Canadians do not want to do.
But Alboim said there are many Canadians who are underrepresented in the workforce who could be trained to do these jobs.
“If employers would invest more into working conditions, improving wages, would there be more people willing to do this work?”
Employers who want to hire temporary foreign workers must get approval from the government by applying for a Labour Market Opinon (LMO).
"A positive Labour Market Opinion will show that there is a need for the foreign worker to fill the job you offer and that there is no Canadian worker available to do the job," according to the Citizenship and Immigration website.
But Alboim said the LMO process is far too easy for employers.
The applications are approved without asking employers pointed questions about their wages, working conditions, how far afield have they looked for workers and what could they do to make their jobs more attractive, Alboim said.
“They don't do that to a significant enough degree, in my opinion, so the employer get [approved] LMOs who should not get LMOs."
Alboim said the rules need to be tightened and that the "hiring of temporary foreign workers should be the last resort."
"So there should be both a stronger set of requirements placed on the employers before they get the LMO and the LMO should be conditional on employers meeting other conditions in order for them to get it.
"And there should be enforcement to ensure that the employers are actually meeting the obligations and conditions attached to the issuance of the LMO."
Arthur Sweetman, professor of economics at McMaster University, said they believe the success or failure of the whole program hinges on the Labour Market Opinion.
"And my sense is that the LMO has not been as effective a tool in protecting Canadians as it might have been,' they said.
They said while they couldn't comment on the specific cases in B.C or Alberta, the LMO process in general may not be as thorough as it could be.
And they said it's difficult to know whether cases that do get media attention are the norm.
"The government has been sufficiently opaque that I don't think we know if there's any systematic trouble or not. My suspicion is that there is, but we simplydon't have the evidence one way or another."
Sweetman said there needs to be a much more transparent LMO process that would include the government posting statistics on a quarterly or half-yearly basis. They said the government should also post the number of temporary foreign workers coming into what regions of the country and what types of jobs they are doing.
The AFL-CIO's Richard Trumka comes out swinging against the NAFTA-style Colombia trade deal and its Assassination Stress Tests, rightly suggesting that, “we have no doubt that if 51 CEOs had been murdered in Colombia last year, this deal would be on a very slow track indeed.”
Oh, snap.
Good for the AFL-CIO for coming out here. Below is Trumka's whole statement opposing the deal:
We are deeply disappointed that the Obama Administration has signaled that it will move forward to submit the proposed U.S.-Colombia Trade Agreement to Congress for a vote in the near future. In our view, the situation in Colombia remains unacceptably violent for trade unionists, as well as for human rights defenders and other vulnerable populations. In addition, Colombian workers face enormous and indefensible legal and practical hurdles in exercising their rights to organize unions and bargain collectively.
We appreciate the efforts of the Obama Administration to negotiate a separate Action Plan with the Colombian government to address some of the concerns we have raised over many years with respect to human and labor rights for workers, murders of trade unionists, and impunity for the perpetrators of violence. We understand that the proposed Action Plan lays out some important benchmarks in terms of increasing the level of protection for workers, addressing some flaws in the labor code, and improving enforcement of labor laws.
However, the Action Plan does not go nearly far enough in laying out concrete benchmarks for progress in the areas of violence and impunity, nor does it address many of the ways in which Colombian labor law falls short of international standards. There is no guarantee that the terms of it will in fact lead to a reduction in violence, and no backup plan to delay implementation if the violence and impunity continue. Furthermore, the Action Plan is a stand-alone agreement, not connected to the benefits conferred in the trade agreement. Once the trade agreement is ratified by Congress and implemented, the U.S. government will have no leverage whatsoever to enforce its terms in the event that the terms are not implemented as agreed.
The Colombian government has failed in enforcing the rule of law and protecting the safety of its citizens as they exercise their internationally recognized human rights to form unions and bargain collectively. These problems are deeply ingrained and longstanding, and they cannot be solved by commitments on a piece of paper. Concrete progress on the ground with respect to violence, impunity, and labor law reform needs to be demonstrated over a sustained period of time.
Colombia remains the most deadly nation in the world in which to be a trade unionist. In the past 25 years, more than 2,850 trade unionists have been murdered in Colombia. Last year alone, 51 trade unionists were murdered, an increase over 2009. Six trade unionists have been murdered so far this year, including two in the past week. The conviction rate for union murders and other violence is in the single digits, and even where prosecutions have occurred, many perpetrators have been charged in absentia and are still on the loose. Union density in Colombia is below 5 percent, and even fewer workers can exercise their right to bargain collectively. We have no doubt that if 51 CEOs had been murdered in Colombia last year, this deal would be on a very slow track indeed.
We are consulting closely with our union counterparts in Colombia and will continue to consult with the Obama administration about the terms of the Action Plan and its implementation. But, on the basis of the information provided to us at this time, we remain strongly opposed to the Colombia trade agreement.
Couple arrested for allegedly assaulting children with sticks
April 26, 2013
Lompoc police arrested a man and their girlfriend for allegedly assaulting three children with a wooden stick last month. [KCOY]
Ramon Garcia Jr., 28, and Veronica Sanchez, 30, were allegedly hitting two boys and one girl with a stick near the Jack in the Box on H Street on March 31.
Officers booked Garcia into Santa Barbara County Jail on three counts of assault with a deadly weapon.  They are being held on $100,000 bail. Sanchez, was arrested on one count of assault with a deadly weapon.
The police investigation and the subsequent arrest was based on a report by the three juveniles who said they were struck by a man with a wooden stick, similar to a broom handle.

(CNN) The Southeast picked up the pieces on Monday after deadly tornadoes tore through the region, killing more people in one weekend than in all of last year, and officials called out for the federal government to urgently help their devastated communities.
At least 41 reported twisters ravaged the Southern states over the weekend, killing 19 people and destroying homes, CNN meteorologists reported. At least six people were believed to be missing in Georgia, including a 2-year-old boy who was caught in the tornado in Dougherty County, officials said.
Tornadoes were reported in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina. In 2016, tornadoes left 17 people dead across the country.
Three weather-related deaths also were reported in California and one person died in Pennsylvania, increasing the total nationwide to 23.
Chris Cohilas, the chairperson of the Dougherty County Commission in southwestern Georgia, said storms slammed their county early this month and these latest twisters compounded the agony.
They implored the Federal Emergency Management Agency to get "boots on the ground" to help the community since the storms on January 2 and warnings of more to come. So far, they said, FEMA has not been responsive and they aired their frustrations with the agency.
"To get caught up in the bureaucratic red tape at a time of this amount of human suffering is disgraceful," they said at a news conference on Monday.
"I would ask that President Trump take some significant steps to cut through the bureaucratic red tape and to get us some people on the damn ground."
In an email, FEMA said the agency "is doing initial assessments of damages in Georgia today, including a flyover." At the request of Georgia officials, FEMA will start federal and state preliminary damage assessments for individual and public assistance this week, the agency said.
FEMA representatives were also recently deployed to emergency centers in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and Florida to support the response, and teams are on standby if needed, officials said.
Piercing screams
The barreling twisters left people stunned and communities devastated. They reminded
one survivor in Georgia of a scene from a horror movie.
"All you hear is people screaming, 'Help me, help me,' " said AJ Miley, a resident of the Sunshine Mobile Home Park in Georgia, according to CNN affiliate WSB-TV.
Devocheo Williams, also at the trailer park, said they saw people "tossed through the air," the TV station reported
"All I saw was a little girl flown up and thrown in a ditch. Three seconds later, the trailer got picked up off the ground and landed on top of the mother and son," Williams said.
When the howling winds subsided, the landscape across the Southeast was dotted with overturned cars, debris and scores of damaged mobile homes.

Rain on the horizon
The storm that hit the Southeast turned into a nor'easter as it headed up the Eastern seaboard overnight into the morning, with strong wind gusts of 40-50 mph expected overnight, said Taylor Ward, a CNN meteorologist.
Isolated hurricane-force gusts of more than 75 mph were likely in parts of the Northeast, including Long Island, New York and Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
Ward said heavy showers were expected along the coast overnight Monday into Tuesday, with up to three inches of rain possible.
Interior areas of the northeast into New England could see up to 10 inches of snow, Ward said.
On Monday, the weather caused flight delays at airports from Washington to New York and flooding at the New Jersey Transit Hoboken train station, which also flooded during Superstorm Sandy.
Train delays were reported in New York and New Jersey due to coastal storm conditions and downed power lines. The National Weather Service also issued a coastal flood warning for Southwest Suffolk County, New York, east of Manhattan, through Tuesday morning.
The severe weather caused comical sights, like a discarded Christmas tree blowing in the wind through the streets of Manhattan.

Deadly Georgia storms
Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal has declared a state of emergency for 16 counties, and they said the state will seek federal assistance to help storm-stricken areas. Fifteen people were confirmed dead across the state.
Five people remained missing Monday from Sunshine Acres, a community of about 60 mobile homes some 200 miles south of Atlanta, Adel Mayor Buddy Duke said.
Officials on Monday released the names of seven victims from the mobile home park: Alexis Livingston, 18, Adrian Mays, 38, Lawansa Perry, 41, Mary Cantrell, 62, Jamie Walters, 33, Amanda Rowe, 41, and Joe Deskins, 36.

Cohilas said the confirmed death toll in Dougherty County of four people was sure to rise.
"I know that I was up in the chopper as we were helping look for a 2-year-old child that had been swept away in the tornado," Cohilas said, CNN affiliate WJXT reported.
Albany, Georgia, a city about 180 miles south of Atlanta, was also recovering on Monday. The severe weather destroyed a trailer park there.
Severe storms left damage in south Georgia along Interstate 75 between the towns of Adel and Hahira.
Fatal tornado in Mississippi
Preliminary damage assessments conducted in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, on Saturday showed a tornado packed winds reaching between 136 and 165 mph.
It killed four people and injured more than 50 people in Forrest County, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency reported. Most damage was near the cities of Hattiesburg and Petal.
Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency. In Alabama, 15 counties reported storm-related damage.
West Coast warnings
In California, where a winter weather system has unleashed torrential rain and strong winds, Gov. Jerry Brown late Monday declared a state of emergency across 50 counties, including the cities of Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento and San Francisco. The move allows local officials to seek recovery money to repair damage from flash flooding, erosion, mudslides and debris flows.
Early estimates indicate losses in the tens of millions of dollars, according to the declaration.
Two people were missing off the coast of Pebble Beach, the US Coast Guard said Monday. Officials said they suspended search efforts indefinitely pending "any new information." The search was stopped due to deteriorating weather conditions.
Coast Guard Ensign Courtney Hanson said one of the missing is male, and the other is female. Both are Chinese nationals.
In northern California's Mendocino County, a 125-foot-tall oak tree fell into a single-story apartment, killing a 36-year-old woman on Saturday morning, Capt. Pete Bushby of the Ukiah Valley Fire Authority told CNN.
A massive oak tree in Mendocino County, California, fell into a single-story apartment killing a 36-year-old woman, officials said.
Deaths reported in San Diego County
In Ocean Beach, one of two women rescued from the waters died Saturday night, Joe Amador, spokesperson for San Diego County Fire-Rescue Department told CNN on Monday.
A large wave had swept both away just after sunset, Amado said. A bystander tried to save both but could only rescue one of them in the rough waters. A 23-year-old died.
Witnesses told CNN affiliate KFMB the two women were walking along Ocean Beach trying to get a close look at the waves when both were pulled into the water.
"They were like right in front of us ... and then all of a sudden, they were gone," Janice Ambrosiani said. "It's not like they were way down in an area where they shouldn't be."
Ambrosiani's friend was the bystander who plunged into the water and rescued one woman.
"She just couldn't move. I tried to get them to stand up and they couldn't and then they fell and I fell with her, and another wave hit us," the man said. "I ran back out to try and save the second one but they got too far away and the waves got real big."
Authorities in San Diego County were also working to recover the body of an adult from a swollen creek, San Diego Sheriff's Department spokesperson Ryan Keim told CNN on Sunday. Rescuers are also searching for a child in the creek.
A death in Philadelphia
In Philadelphia, a 60-year-old man in a car sales lot was struck and killed by a sign from the lot that the wind knocked off a wall shortly before 1 p.m. on Monday, Philadelphia police said. They died at the scene.
Indian men's compound archery team has brought the country to shame after failing to turn up for a bronze medal play-off match in the World University Games, which prompted the Archery Association of India to order a probe into the matter.
According to the communication manager of the World Archery Chris Wells, the men's compound team comprising Gurwinder Singh, Kanwalpreet Singh and Aman was not present at the start of the match against Italy at 10 am local time in Gwangju, South Korea.
As per the World Archery rules if a team is not present at the start of a final match then that game is forfeited.
Expressing shock at the incident, AAI secretary general Anil Kamineni said they are writing to the team as well the organisers to get into the root of the matter.
"This does not concern AAI as the team is sent by the Association of Indian Universities. But many India archers were part of the team so we're probing the matter," Kamineni told PTI.
He, however, rubbished reports that claimed the archers were busy sightseeing.
"At 10am in the morning they cannot go sightseeing. Moreover, most of them are senior archers and they know their responsibilities."
Indian coach Jiwanjot Singh, however, has blamed it on equipment malfunction.
"Gurwinder's bow string broke and none of the archers were carrying a spare bow. So we had to send a guy to the team hotel and get a bow from the girls. We reached the competition venue exactly two minutes after the reporting time but the officials did not give in to our request," Jiwanjot was quoted saying in the media.

After six months in the White House, President Donald Trump is on course to be the least popular president at this point in their administration since the advent of modern polling.
But negative perception of the president hasn't improved their former opponent's standing in the eyes of the public.
A Bloomberg Politics poll released Tuesday showed Hillary Clinton with a 39% approval rating, 2 points lower than Trump's approval rating in the same poll. It was Clinton's second-lowest approval rating since Bloomberg started tracking them in 2009. The poll was conducted July 8-12 among 1,001 adults and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
It is normal for former candidates to experience rehabilitation in the polls following a presidential campaign — Clinton experienced the phenomenon during their tenure as secretary of state, and their 2016 primary opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders remains one of the most popular politicians in America.
But the Trump White House and conservative media outlets have remained in campaign mode against the former secretary of state, who has criticized Trump for misleading Americans with "alternative facts" and knocked policies like Trump's budget and their healthcare plan.
Trump has repeatedly blasted Clinton since the election, making vague, unproven claims that their campaign violated laws.
But in follow-up interviews, Clinton voters who participated in the Bloomberg poll said their negative feelings about them didn't have anything to do with them losing the election.
Bloomberg noted that voter comments "often reflected the ongoing angst among Democrats about how best to position themselves against Trump and Republicans in 2018 and beyond." Some voters commented that they liked Sanders better than Clinton and wished they had been the Democratic nominee.
Chris Leininger, a 29-year-old insurance agent from California, told Bloomberg that Clinton was "hard to like" and noted that they thought Sanders had a better story to tell voters.
"But I don't blame them for Trump," Leininger said. "There were a lot of factors that fed into Trump becoming a president and they were just one of them."
And a significant portion of Clinton's own voters said they didn't like them More than 20% of Clinton voters Bloomberg polled said they had an unfavorable view of them

The 'booze bra' that can hold a whole bottle of wine... just don't wear it with a white shirt
Wine rack: The bra, which can hold 750ml of drink, is popular with New Jersey students
It's certainly one way to boost your cup size - but a new bra that can hold a whole bottle of wine is unlikely to find much favour with bar and pub owners.
The 'Wine Rack', which holds 750ml of drink and comes complete with a straw attached to the watertight tubing inside the cups, can inflate a girl's chest by up to two sizes.
The bra, which is produced by New Jersey retailer BaronBob.com, has proved popular with students during the U.S. state's recent heatwave.
'They are leakproof and are totally water tight or booze tight as the case may be,' said store owner Paul Krasulja, 38.
'The drinking tube has a stop start button which is siphoned off from the tubing around the bra.
'Fully filled, the bra is imperceptibly increased by two sizes.
But the bra should not be considered lingerie, they added. 'It is for partying and drinking.
'The only thing is that some girls will give off the wrong impression at the start of a night and deflate as the evening goes on.'
Boost: The 'Wine Rack' can increase a girl's cup size by up to two sizes
Mr Krasulja's company is known locally for selling a wide variety of products including edible G-strings.
The 'Wine Rack' bra is a successor to the firm's 'Beer Belly' - a similar product for men, which can be worn around the stomach.
Hi Backers!
We've been hard at work getting a patch ready for the game.
Here's the schedule:
1.01 - Landing this upcoming Monday, fixes textual issues reported from Steam/Nutaku/Denpasoft versions.
1.02 - Is expected to come out on the 27th, supplementary patch for 1.01 that will be fixing and tracking down any crash bugs. As well as any other textual issues reported.
1.0x - Sometime in April, final fixes before physical copies get printed.
We don't expect a delay in 1.01 however 1.02 and 1.0x may or may not make those deadlines depending on the complexities in some of the fixes required.
OSTs/Drama CD/Artbook have no release date just yet, we're focused on getting a stable release of the game. Our next update will have a poll asking about shipping preferences, mainly waiting for all physical goods to be ready or ship things out as they get done.
When Pope Benedict XVI commented this month that condom distribution isn't helping, and may be worsening, the spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa, they set off a firestorm of protest. Most non-Catholic commentary has been highly critical of the pope. A cartoon in the Philadelphia Inquirer, reprinted in The Post, showed the pope somewhat ghoulishly praising a throng of sick and dying Africans: "Blessed are the sick, for they have not used condoms."
Yet, in truth, current empirical evidence supports him.
We liberals who work in the fields of global HIV/AIDS and family planning take terrible professional risks if we side with the pope on a divisive topic such as this. The condom has become a symbol of freedom and -- along with contraception -- female emancipation, so those who question condom orthodoxy are accused of being against these causes. My comments are only about the question of condoms working to stem the spread of AIDS in Africa's generalized epidemics -- nowhere else.
In 2003, Norman Hearst and Sanny Chen of the University of California conducted a condom effectiveness study for the United Nations' AIDS program and found no evidence of condoms working as a primary HIV-prevention measure in Africa. UNAIDS quietly disowned the study. (The authors eventually managed to publish their findings in the quarterly Studies in Family Planning.) Since then, major articles in other peer-reviewed journals such as the Lancet, Science and BMJ have confirmed that condoms have not worked as a primary intervention in the population-wide epidemics of Africa. In a 2008 article in Science called "Reassessing HIV Prevention" 10 AIDS experts concluded that "consistent condom use has not reached a sufficiently high level, even after many years of widespread and often aggressive promotion, to produce a measurable slowing of new infections in the generalized epidemics of Sub-Saharan Africa."
Let me quickly add that condom promotion has worked in countries such as Thailand and Cambodia, where most HIV is transmitted through commercial sex and where it has been possible to enforce a 100 percent condom use policy in brothels (but not outside of them). In theory, condom promotions ought to work everywhere. And intuitively, some condom use ought to be better than no use. But that's not what the research in Africa shows.
Why not?
One reason is "risk compensation." That is, when people think they're made safe by using condoms at least some of the time, they actually engage in riskier sex.
Another factor is that people seldom use condoms in steady relationships because doing so would imply a lack of trust. (And if condom use rates go up, it's possible we are seeing an increase of casual or commercial sex.) However, it's those ongoing relationships that drive Africa's worst epidemics. In these, most HIV infections are found in general populations, not in high-risk groups such as sex workers, gay men or persons who inject drugs. And in significant proportions of African populations, people have two or more regular sex partners who overlap in time. In Botswana, which has one of the world's highest HIV rates, 43 percent of men and 17 percent of women surveyed had two or more regular sex partners in the previous year.
These ongoing multiple concurrent sex partnerships resemble a giant, invisible web of relationships through which HIV/AIDS spreads. A study in Malawi showed that even though the average number of sexual partners was only slightly over two, fully two-thirds of this population was interconnected through such networks of overlapping, ongoing relationships.
So what has worked in Africa? Strategies that break up these multiple and concurrent sexual networks -- or, in plain language, faithful mutual monogamy or at least reduction in numbers of partners, especially concurrent ones. "Closed" or faithful polygamy can work as well.
In Uganda's early, largely home-grown AIDS program, which began in 1986, the focus was on "Sticking to One Partner" or "Zero Grazing" (which meant remaining faithful within a polygamous marriage) and "Loving Faithfully." These simple messages worked. More recently, the two countries with the highest HIV infection rates, Swaziland and Botswana, have both launched campaigns that discourage people from having multiple and concurrent sexual partners.
Don't misunderstand me; I am not anti-condom. All people should have full access to condoms, and condoms should always be a backup strategy for those who will not or cannot remain in a mutually faithful relationship. This was a key point in a 2004 "consensus statement" published and endorsed by some 150 global AIDS experts, including representatives the United Nations, World Health Organization and World Bank. These experts also affirmed that for sexually active adults, the first priority should be to promote mutual fidelity. Moreover, liberals and conservatives agree that condoms cannot address challenges that remain critical in Africa such as cross-generational sex, gender inequality and an end to domestic violence, rape and sexual coercion.
Surely it's time to start providing more evidence-based AIDS prevention in Africa.

Even as a kid, I was never one to make a snowman or anything else out of snow. I always saw a good snowstorm as an opportunity to stay in and play video games all day. Well, while I doubt that will ever change, I do appreciate the amazing things that people make out of snow, in this case, a Dalek snow sculpture!
Unfortunately, I don't know who created this very impressive Dalek snow sculpture but they must have spent quite a bit of time on it to get that much detail on it. This Dalek will EXTERMINATE any enemy snowmen, although I would really like to see it go up against the Darth Vader and R2-D2 snow sculpture I posted last winter

Nuclear engineering and materials science are distinct but related fields. Newly appointed Battelle Energy Alliance Professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering Ju Li will straddle the two, as they apply their groundbreaking research into atomic-scale materials behavior to a broad range of challenges, including energy storage, waste management and reactor materials.
To a large degree, says Li PhD '00, the difference between their scientific and engineering efforts comes down to time scales.
“My work involves theory and modeling of materials behavior under high mechanical stress and sometimes high temperatures,” they explain. “When you work at the scale of atoms and electrons, you think in terms of picoseconds and femtoseconds. But for engineering systems, you need to predict behavior over years, or even thousands of years for nuclear waste treatment. My primary interest is in extending the time scale of our physical models to the engineering scale.”
Over the last decade, Li has established themselves as a leader in developing and applying computer simulations to gain greater understanding of fundamental nanoscale mechanical and transport properties of materials. Their pioneering cross-disciplinary work has coupled continuum mechanics (in which materials are modeled as continuous masses rather than discrete particles) with meso- and atomic-scale dynamics, and has had a broad impact on the understanding of how materials behave under extreme conditions.
These scientific achievements have helped create a clearer sense of how microstructures evolve over time when exposed to stress, heat, and radiation, and have led to fundamental advances for a range of engineering challenges. These include development of new structural materials for fission and fusion reactors, better-performing battery electrodes, and improved fuel cell components. Other applications have included aerospace materials, as well as the process of vitrifying nuclear waste into a stable glass matrix.

World's largest snowman was set in 2008 in Bethel, Maine. Olympia SnowWoman, the world's largest snow(wo)man is created by Jim Mann and their crew at Mt. Mann Jewelers. The SnowWoman stood 122 feet 1 inch (37.21 m) in height, weight: 13,000,000 lbs. of snow, and was named Olympia Snowe.
The previous record was also a snowman built in Bethel, Maine, in February 1999. The snowman was named “Angus, King of the Mountain”. It was 113 feet 7 inches (34.62 m) tall and weighed over 9,000,000 pounds (4,080,000 kg).
The World's Smallest ‘snowman' was created by Dr David Cox, a member of the Quantum Detection group at the laboratory. Well, it looks like a snowman, but this minuscule model — about a fifth the width of a human hair — is not made out of snow. It's constructed of two tiny tin beads that are usually used to calibrate an electron microscope, and welded together with platinum.
To celebrate the start of the last season, and to promote their newest ski resort, the Galtür region in Austria built Europe's largest snowman. The 53 foot tall snow sculpture is called Emil, and stands at the bottom of their new kiddie slopes. The Ski resort used to be a collection of various challenging slopes, but for 2009, designers divided things into 6 different zones and renamed the area “Silvapark”.
Overall it took 5 days to build this monster, which stands at over 16m tall (53 feet), looks across the Paznaun valley in Tirol Austria. Galtur is right beside Ischgl, perhaps a better know skiing resort.

What may be the most interesting aspect of the anti-ACTA movement is that the most widespread and loudest opposition, as well as the most effective, isn't in the, or other countries traditionally considered strongholds of democracy and freedom. Instead it is in areas where oppressive dictatorships ruled until late in the 20th century.For most people in theand more powerful European nations, widespread censorship is something of an abstract concept. In countries controlled by theafter World War II the situation is much different. Many people in these countries grew up in an environment of state controlled media, no free speech, and rampant government corruption.We have already seen organized protests in, where several members of Parliament also staged a protest of their own. Last weeksuspended the ratification process pending a more thorough analysis. The Warsaw Business Journal quotes Tusk saying In thefollowed suit yesterday, withdrawing ACTA from the parliamentary ratification process. According to the Czech news service ČTK, Necas said They added,Since then the country's data protection authorities have released a statement critical of ACTA. An English translation from Česka Noviny reads TheAmbassador to, who signed on their country's behalf, even issued a public apology , saying it was irresponsible. They also criticized government officials who apparently tried to make them a scapegoat for their ACTA support.But the strongest reaction to ACTA may come from, where the populace was already demanding the resignation ofover alleged corruption. Boc resigned, but not before being asked about ACTA last week. According to the Romanian news site Nine O'Clock, they claimed ignorance about the circumstances surrounding their government's signing.That's not good enough for Social Democratic Party (PSD) President, a former member of Emil Boc's cabinet before an alliance between their parties fell apart. Today they asked the Romanian government for an explanation. Ponta also noted that when a new coalition government including PSD takes power, ACTA enforcement will be suspended.In addition to all these protests, there are some EU members who have chosen not to sign ACTA at all. The five countries declining to sign ACTA includeand, who were also under Soviet control during the Cold War. Another is, which the Soviet Union literally and figuratively divided in two with the
You started out a month ago with one of the short hikes we recommended, just to see what hiking was like. Maybe you walk in your neighborhood and wanted to see how it translated to a walk in the woods. Maybe you were burned out by the gym — the tedium of the stationary bike, the manic drive of the aerobics instructor — and wanted to try a new way of being active. Maybe you read or saw “Wild.”
Whatever the reason, you liked it. And you were intrigued by the idea of going more than two or three miles, so you checked out our batch of medium-length hikes, hikes of between four and seven miles. An hour or so on the trail is one thing: Do I have what it takes to hike for an entire morning or afternoon? you wanted to know. You did one of those hikes and when you reached the end, you were of mixed feelings: you were tired, no doubt about it. But you also wanted to keep going.
That's where we are today, with five long North Carolina hikes that live up to the name: a full day's worth of hiking. These are hikes of 8 or more miles, hikes that will challenge, but reward you emotionally, spiritually and, as your muscles will attest when you try to get out of bed the following morning, physically. Unlike those achy reminders from the gym, though, these will make you want to get back on the trail as soon as possible and push your muscles all over again.
Once you've done these hikes, then what? We don't intend to leave you hanging. The statewide GetHiking! program offers hikes on a regular basis, hikes that are lead from the rear so no one needs to worry about being left behind. The program includes a weekly e-newsletter with hiking tips and resources, a recap of our most recent adventures and details on upcoming hikes. We also offer tips and resources on hiking, as well as information on our various GetHiking! programs. You can find all this information starting here.
Pilot Mountain Loop (Grassy Ridge, Grindstone, Ledge Spring and Mountain trails)
10.6 miles
Pilot Mountain State Park
Pinnacle
If you've ever tried to visit Pilot Mountain on a gorgeous weekend in the spring or fall, you know what an ordeal it can be dealing with the traffic and parking. Now picture having nearly the entire mountain to your lonesome no matter how nice the weather. The masses drive to the summit, you, now an accomplished hiker, can hike to the top using a series of four trails that circle this quartzite monadnock rising 1,400 feet above the surrounding countryside. The trails are challenging, but they expose you to a lesser-known and significantly more peaceful side of Pilot Mountain. And the 1.6-mile diversion on the Ledge Spring Trail near the top means you won't miss out on the great views for which Pilot Mountain is known. Before you discovered hiking, your car earned the summit of Pilot Mountain. Now, the glory is all yours.

Company Mill/Sycamore Loop
9.7 miles
Umstead State Park
Raleigh
This popular distance hike takes you from the most heavily hiked section of the park — the first mile of the Company Mill Trail down to Crabtree Creek — into the less-visited heart of the park. After crossing Crabtree Creek, drop the masses and head left. Hike upstream for a quarter mile, then head upland for a mile or so, crossing the bike & bridle trail and continuing through rolling Piedmont forest. Midway, a connector takes you across Sycamore Creek where you pick up the three-mile loop portion of the Sycamore Trail. The mile or so passage along Sycamore Creek is like hiking the mountains after a rain turns this normally placid creek into a rollickin' & roilin' river; passage over a 75-foot bluff, courtesy a long-abandoned quarry, offers a rare, for the Piedmont, sense of dizzying elevation. The trail returns via the previously unused portions of the Sycamore and Company Mill loops, with the final mile on the popular stretch you started on. The stone bridge between the Company Mill and Sycamore trails makes a nice lunch stop.

Uwharrie National Recreation Trail (northern end)
8.2 miles
Uwharrie National Forest
Asheboro
Live in the Piedmont and don't want to spend the day driving to the mountains for a mountain hike? This 8.2-mile stretch in the heart of the Piedmont will convince your legs, at least, that you are in mountainous country. The Uwharrie Mountains are a relict range with peaks once topping 20,000 feet. Today., they barely top 1,000 feet, but you'll find at least one of those peaks on this hike. Starting from the gravel lot trailhead off gravel SR 1134, hike north over terrain that lets your legs warm up before throwing climbs in your path. The ascent up, over and down Jumping-Off Rock less than two miles in is the most challenging part of the hike. After crossing Flint Hill Road, continue north through a wooded valley, then begin the climb up Little Long Mountain, which offers the best mountain-top views in the Uwharries. Catch your breath here and enjoy the view before continuing on to King Mountain, at 1,020 feet the highest spot on the Uwharrie Trail. The last two miles is mostly downhill.

Tanawha Trail
13.5 miles
Blue Ridge Parkway
Grandfather Mountain
You might think that a trail paralleling the Blue Ridge Parkway would be a fairly straightforward and mellow stroll. Ha! Make that a half “Ha.” The southern portion, heading north from Beacon Heights, probes the rocky east flank of massive Grandfather Mountain. Though the trail is well marked and easy to follow in that regard, it takes on a good deal of quick ups and downs, followed by a more prolonged up at Rough Ridge, an exposed outcrop with great views. After Rough Ridge, the trail changes complexion, winding through a mature spruce and hemlock forest before entering a flat area peppered with meadows, then a walk along (and in) Boone Fork Creek before concluding at Price Park.

Sam Knob Loop
8.0 miles
Shining Rock area
Blue Ridge Parkway
Weather aside, you can all but guarantee cementing your love of hiking with this hike, which ranges from 5,000 to 6,000-plus feet of elevation. From the easy-to-access Black Balsam parking area off the Blue Ridge Parkway, pick up the trail at the gate near the latrine (which you should not go in) and head west through an open meadow. A spur trail takes you up to Sam Knob for stellar views; return and head down to Flat Laurel Creek, which you follow past several falls up to US 215. There's a brief walk along the shoulder before picking up the Mountains-to-Sea Trail headed east through rock outcrop and a black balsam forest. Drop down through more of the same on the Little Sam Trail, which returns you to Flat Laurel Creek and its namesake trail. Return to the trailhead through wetlands, meadow and open mountain scenery.

Amir Rubin, CEO of Sixense, the distributors of the Razer Hydra controller and manufacturers of the wireless STEM controllers, which have been described as enabling a 3D mutli-touch interface and will could become the first “mouse of VR.”
Amir talks about how the intention of Sixense is to create presence in VR by bringing your body into VR in an intuitive fashion. They talk about the differences between a physical-based solution like the STEM controllers versus using gesture controls with a camera-based system.
They talk about the history and timing of the Razer Hydra, and how it was a tough sell to convince developers that this paradigm shift was needed for interacting in 3D spaces — especially before virtual reality came along. They talk about the challenges faced with shortages of the Hydra and how they've been supporting exciting VR projects.
They talk about the modular design of the STEM controllers, and how developers will be able to bring all sorts of different peripheral objects into VR by using the STEM pack component.
Amir then goes into what first inspired the creation of Sixense, and how they wanted to be able to provide VR training experiences where the technology didn't get into the way, and that people could have as much immersion and presence as possible in order to tap into their deeper intuition. They believe that almost every experience in reality could be improved with virtual reality, and they want to help bring that sense of immersion and presence to people through Sixense technologies.
Finally, they talk about the lessons learned from the failed VR revolution of the 90s, and how that has influenced the collaborative mindset that Sixense has as well as others within the VR community. He'd like to help make the VR revolution happen this time around, and help provide incredible educational and training experiences as well as allowing people to step out of reality and have boundless entertainment experiences where they can live out their wildest fantasies.
Reddit discussion here.
TOPICS
0:00 – Intro Sixense proving presence in virtual reality. Presence requires bringing your body into VR. Partnering with Razor Hydra. Working on the wireless STEM controllers.
1:36 – Timing of Razer Hydra and being out of stock. Not manufactured by Sixense. Providing Hydras to exciting VR development projects. Hydra designed to enable people working with 3D applications as “3D multi-touch” technology. It was nice to have, but hard to convince developers. Valve was supportive, but Hydra was hard technology to justify adopting before VR. Carmack's contribution to resurgence of VR. Hydra became the mouse of VR. Creating a wireless version with STEM, and the stoppage of manufacturing of the Hydra
5:29 – Modular design of the STEM System controllers – Three components: STEM base. STEM controllers with lots of buttons and joystick controller. STEM pack that can be attached to other objects to get 6 DOF control with them. Trying to make it as simple for developers as possible.
8:04 – How do you see the difference between VR input differences between camera-based gestures and controls with physical buttons? Camera-based gestures can be great if line of sight and you have an intuitive use case. But simulating using objects in VR doesn't work as well because it's not natural. Sixense sensors and input devices in order to be able to use your intuition rather than learning a new sign language. Power of bringing hand and eye coordination into VR. Sony & Oculus using a combination camera and physical controllers. Sixense SDK supporting other 6 DOF controllers like Sony Move and Intel RealSense camera for perceptual computing.
11:28 – What was the inspiration for the creation of Sixense Entertainment? Amir was inspired by VR in the 90s. Saw how much gear that military soldiers had to wear to have their VR training exercises. General wanted to have soldiers have a VR experience without mentioning all of the technology that was getting in the way. Creating a system that's 100% experience delivery where the transition between reality and virtual reality is seamless and fast. Focusing on the consumer VR version, and wants to create VR training experiences where you forget about the VR tech and easily forget reality and step into a fantasy world and experience all of the experiences you want to. Don't worry about the constraints of technology because it breaks VR immersion.
15:01 – What is driving you now? Is it a business desire or is there something in VR that you want to experience? Reality isn't as good as as it should be. VR can improve on nearly everything we have in reality. Step into entertainment experiences and transform into a character and live out your fantasies. Explore resort vacations with their family. Go anywhere together in with your family. Everything that you need to can come to you digitally.
17:11 – How have you seen the VR industry evolve since you've been involved with it? Learn from the failures of the 90s. The technology was not there yet, but the business execution was also lacking from too much competition and not enough collaboration. He's seeing a lot more collaboration this time around from Oculus to the open collaborative mindset of Sixense. Can't support professional applications. Focusing on the has market at the moment. Integrating with the Sony SDK. Sixense wants to collaborate with other hardware manufactures and distributors.
19:57 – What is the ultimate potential for virtual reality? Every use case of reality can be improved by virtual reality. Education and training implications are huge.

Manufacturing has seen a dramatic downturn in Australia, particularly in the automotive sector. So how do we keep this trend from continuing? As the great Billy Hughes said "science will guide the manufacturer into greener pastures", and CSIRO has a plan - we're talking sensors, data analytics, robotics, automation, 3D printing and augmented - or virtual - reality.
The Advanced Manufacturing Roadmap, was written in collaboration with industry, government and researchers, and identifies major growth opportunities and what manufacturers need to do to achieve them.
"The Advanced Manufacturing Roadmap is the compass that guides our excellent science to deliver the breakthrough innovation needed to re-imagine Australian advanced manufacturing," CSIRO Chief Executive Dr Larry Marshall said. "Australian science can turn disruptors and increased globalisation into opportunities for value creation right here at home".
The roadmap spells out how manufacturing is becoming increasingly global, with integration into international value chains vital. Over the next 20 years, Australia's manufacturing industry must evolve into a highly integrated, collaborative and export-focused environment that provides high-value solutions.
The sector needs to focus on pre-production activities such as design, research and development; as well as value-adding services, sustainable manufacturing and low volume/high margin customised products.
CSIRO Manufacturing Director Dr Keith McLean said this would require significant technological innovation by public and private research communities.
"The industrial landscape is changing fast. We need to start evolving with it," Dr McLean said. "Australian manufacturing has a strong, high-tech future. Australian manufacturers must transform their businesses by investing in new knowledge, skills and practices."
The roadmap calls on Australia's research and manufacturing sectors to increase their collaboration and alignment with each other.
It also urges manufacturers to place a greater focus on participation in global value chains, improve their ability to attract and retain staff with skills in digital literacy, leadership, customer interface and STEM capabilities, increase the gender, age and ethnic diversity of their workforce and improve business-to-business collaboration.
"Industry needs to lead this transformation. CSIRO has the expertise, experience and business network to help guide them," Dr McLean said.
The Advanced Manufacturing Roadmap is the first in a series of Roadmaps being produced by CSIRO, each aligned to the Federal Government's Industry Growth Centres. You can download the roadmap here.

How have you been celebrating National Bourbon Heritage Month? Probably by drinking a lot of whiskey, plus the usual parades, fireworks, sending roses to all the people you threw up on, etc. So although this weekend is the final weekend of Bourbon Month, I want to show you how to make bourbon an even more integral part of your life all year long. No longer should you feel limited by the amount of bourbon you can drink, because you can also be eating it in every meal, including breakfast. Tie on your apron, here comes a bunch of ideas!
BOURBON FOR DESSERT
Bourbon can become a staple of your daily diet, but you should build up to this slowly and deliberately. Start with something easy and obvious: dessert. Fruit loves bourbon, so macerate pitted cherries, diced pears, figs, raspberries or pineapple in bourbon and spoon them over vanilla ice cream. Put the fruit and liquor in a clean jar with nutmeg, allspice or a bit of vanilla bean and keep it in the refrigerator.
Have you mastered pie crusts, and do you feel confident enough to add a great new skill? Pastry cream is both easy (I promise, take a deep breath!) and impressive. At the end of this recipe, where they suggest liqueur, use bourbon instead — and lots more of it — at least a full ounce. It's Bourbon Month! You want boozy cream! Prebake the crust (like a tart, no sides), then give it a layer of your bourbon pastry cream, and just before serving top with slices of soft fruit like peaches or bananas. (If you have a blowtorch, now is your chance to use it.)
If you haven't mastered pie crusts (or don't want to) I might suggest you learn to make choux paste first. It is exceedingly simple — easy to memorize even — and is the basis for gougères, the world's greatest appetizer. But cheesy, wonderful gougères are a topic for another time. For now we are keeping things sweet, and you can use choux paste to make puffs to fill with your bourbon pastry cream. Things are getting a little French around here, non?!
Here's one big, overarching tip on dessert: just about anything that calls for vanilla can be improved by adding a tablespoon of bourbon.
BOURBON FOR DINNER
Okay, so you've got bourbon covering your sweets, but it's not yet part of your ordinary weeknight dinner. I'm gonna be honest here: if you're a vegetarian, you should skip this part. Seared meat with bourbon pan sauce is your flexible recipe for getting whiskey at suppertime. I don't think this would work with tofu, but correct me if I'm wrong. Here we go:
1. Heat the oven to 400F, and take out an oven-safe skillet (big enough for all your meat).
2. You can use a pork chop, a thick steak (not skirt or flank, which are great for grilling, not searing), or a chicken breast. Salt and pepper both sides generously. For purposes of this recipe, I'm going to assume you're making two pieces. There's not much measuring involved, so you should be able to easily modify this recipe for your needs.
3. On the stovetop, heat the pan on a medium-high burner. Lubricate with a bit of butter and canola oil. The butter will melt, then foam, then subside.
4. Add the first piece of meat, wait 20 seconds, then add the second. (This is so you don't cool the pan.) At first, they will stick to the pan. After a minute or two they should come loose. Flip them over. After another minute or two, put the whole thing in the oven.
5. Here's where I hope you have some cooking sense. How long you leave the meat in the oven is up to you — it depends on the meat you're using and how well-done you like it. Anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes. Use the Finger Test for Doneness.
6. Remove the pan from the oven and replace it on the stovetop. Put the meat on a plate. Add some more butter and oil as well as a diced onion. Cook that onion while you scrape the meaty residue off the pan. When the onion is nice and soft, sprinkle a tablespoon of flour or cornstarch over it. Stir it so the fat and flour mingle thoroughly.
7. Throw in some minced herbs. With the bourbon flavor, I lean toward rosemary, sage or tarragon. Mint, maybe, if this is for a Kentucky Derby party? Use as much as you like. A tablespoon or two is probably right.
8. Whiskey time! Pour in a cup of bourbon. Turn the burner up to high. Bring it to a boil. When you see it noticeably reducing, then . . .
9. Add a cup of hot stock. Beef stock if you're making steak, chicken stock if you're making pork or chicken. If there are meaty juices on the plate with the meat, pour those juices into the pan too. Boil it all together until the liquid is reduced by about half and it looks syrupy and delicious. Optional: You can put the meat into the saucy pan at this point, especially if you're worried it may be undercooked. (Asking yourself, “Hmm, are these ‘meat juices' or straight-up blood on that plate?”)
10. I would definitely serve this with sweet potatoes!
Oh my gosh, here you are digesting the equivalent of two or three shots of bourbon, and you don't look like a wino, you look like a genius!
Now that your addiction (jk!) has transferred from the bottle to the burner, I have one more dinnertime idea for you that is dramatic and easy: get some shrimp and set those beauties on fire. More specifically: sauté some shrimp along with diced bell peppers and green onion in butter, then add a couple of shots of bourbon, let it get hot (you need to smell the vapor), and light it with a long match or lighter (that's what's happening in the very top photo). After a few seconds (but before all the booze burns off), blow it out or extinguish with a lid. Alton Brown has a recipe like this that they serve over grits. Baked beans would also be good.
BOURBON AT BREAKFAST
At this point you have achieved a daily partnership with bourbon, even as Bourbon Month fades in your memory. As in any deepening relationship, you're probably going to be seeing more of each other in the morning. Can you have bourbon for breakfast? Yes, bourbon is ready for this next step.
In fact, once you're emotionally ready to be someone who has bourbon for breakfast, the technicalities of it are very simple. You can braise your bacon in cider and bourbon like this guy did; braise a big piece and you can fry it up bit by bit to enrich many breakfasts. Craving pancakes? Add a splash of bourbon (and some blueberries!) to the maple syrup as you warm it on the stove or in the microwave. Flavor whipped cream with a teaspoon of bourbon to top waffles. You can certainly make bourbon jelly. Making jelly is no different than making Jell-O shots in a jar, and anybody can do that. (Here's some guidance.) Enjoy it on biscuits. A little piece of fried chicken would be pretty nice on those biscuits, too.
So what kind of bourbon should you buy to achieve culinary glory? I'm not one of these crazy bourbon fanatics. I have a simple palate, and I think Evan Williams makes very serviceable bourbon. One of the fanciest restaurants I know uses the Evan Williams green label (i.e., the cheapest one) to make a Perfect Manhattan that is very nice. Plus, the green label is available on a plastic bottle, which is lighter to carry home from the liquor store.

There were two things about the latest Lord's Test on which everyone could agree. One, it's a lot more fun watching England win at cricket than it is to talk about cricket administrators . And secondly, those new England cricket jumpers are bad and wrong.
Cricket is locked in a struggle between its past, in the form of expansive, grand Test cricket, and the future, in the shape of short, noisy, Twenty20 matches. Many believe that the game's very soul is in the balance. And the cricket sweater worn by England's players in the last match is an emblematic battleground in this culture war.
What on earth were those new monstrosities sported by our boys at Lord's? The top part of the sweater has a smooth effect, bringing the already unnecessarily large sponsor's logo into sharper relief. It makes the sweater look like it has a bib layered on top. Some of our players, Joe Root for instance, are pretty young and fresh-faced, but this is taking things too far.
You don't have to be the stereotypical gin-soaked retired colonel to despair at why they felt the need to “update” (i.e. mess about with) a classic item.
The traditional cable knit cricket sweater was a fashion icon for a breed of men who wouldn't know a fashion icon if it gave them a fish-paste sandwich and a pint of IPA. It was warm, the better quality ones repelled the rain, a bit, and you could wear it under a jacket afterwards and look somewhat smart as well as sporty. As long as people hadn't seen you play cricket in it.

As a cricketing kid, I liked the way that great, impossibly exotic cricketers from all over the world – Imran Khan, Viv Richards – wore the same thing that my mum got me from our local sports shop. It felt like a unifying garment that linked the child player and the club amateur and the international star. It was ours.

• Bad amateur cricket is brilliant, and here's why
For generations of recreational cricketers it provided not just protection from the elements when standing shivering on the boundary praying that the ball wouldn't come their way, but also a link to childhood.
There aren't many garments that you can wear at both ten and 45 years old. In fact, it's best not to try. Skateboarding dads, I'm looking at you. But the cricket jumper looks equally alright on a kid or a middle-aged chap, and there's something profoundly comforting about that.
When I wear a cricket jumper, I have a link back to the days when I wasn't creaky and a bit fat and I could run about and dive around.
It's one of the few garments that I feel truly comfortable in, and we blokes of middle-age don't feel very comfortable in our garments very often at all. England cricket has dropped a sweater clanger: bring back the authentic cable knit!
Bernie Sanders speaks during a campaign rally on March 7, 2016, in Dearborn, Mich. | AP Photo Sanders sues Ohio secretary of state over young voter eligibility
Bernie Sanders' campaign filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday against Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, accusing them of trying to bar young voters from participating in the state's March 15 primary.
Specifically, the Sanders campaign alleges Husted is unlawfully blocking 17-year-old voters from casting ballots next week. The suit says Husted's action would not only “arbitrarily discriminate” against young minority voters but also violate the due process and equal protection provisions of the 14th Amendment.
“It is an outrage that the secretary of state in Ohio is going out of their way to keep young people — significantly African-American young people, Latino young people — from participating,” Sanders said in a statement.
Ohio permits 17-year-olds who will turn 18 before the general election to vote in primaries. In December, however, Husted published a revised election manual that ruled such voters ineligible during the primary.
Sanders has staked their campaign on driving young people and other less-regular voters to the polls.
“I want to do everything that I can to encourage people to participate,” Sanders said Tuesday before a flight from Michigan to Florida. “Unfortunately, in the state of Ohio there is an effort by the secretary of state to do exactly the opposite.”
Prognosticators did not give the Devils much respect heading into this lockout-shortened season.
Their trip to the Stanley Cup Finals last year, you'd be led to believe, was either a fluke or Zach Parise took all the magic with them when they left for Minnesota.
But perhaps this Devils team was shortchanged by the experts. While it is far too early to tell, there are some who believe it may be better than last season's squad, and that's saying a lot.
The Devils have a chance to open a season with a 3-0 record for the first time since 2002-03 and for only the second time in 16 seasons if they can emerge with a victory over Alex Ovechkin and the Washington Capitals tomorrow night at the Prudential Center.
“I don't see a reason why we couldn't get to the level of last season,” goalie Martin Brodeur said. “We have most of the same guys and a similar system. We've made a minor tweak here or there. I think everybody is on the same page.
“We've played two teams—one young team and one that is tough to play—and we were able to handle them pretty good. It's early to tell because we didn't face everybody yet but I think we feel comfortable playing against anybody.”
Here are five good reasons why these Devils might be better than the 2011-12 version:
1. A second season under Pete DeBoer: The players are familiar with their system and they believe what they say.
“I think experiencing the success we did last year put some confidence in everyone,” captain Bryce Salvador said. “If we play the game plan we can have success with it. Whatever that success is, we'll see. The most important (lesson) from last year was when we all stuck to the system we got rewarded.
“It doesn't matter what system you play. It could be the best system or the worst system. When everyone buys in and you have success with it, it becomes the best system.”
As in the lockout-shortened 1995 season.
“Think about it,” Brodeur pointed out. “In 1993-94 we had a season to learn the system under Jacques Lemaire. The next year we were used to it and we were able to do what we did. This is a similar situation. We just learned a system and now most of the guys are used to it. It's good, I think, especially in a short season.”
2. Travis Zajac: Sure, Parise is gone. But Zajac (two goals in two games) is healthy and signed to a new long-term contract extension.
“He's been great,” DeBoer said. “We missed them last year when they were out for the entire season. He's a motivated guy. Contracts don't motivate Travis. They love to play. They really missed the game, I think, last year.”
There is a reason he's the first-line center.
“He's a really good player. Lou (Lamoriello) is a hockey guy. You don't reward a guy here on a gamble,” Brodeur suggested. “The best players on your team, the smartest players to a certain extent, are the guys who play center. So when you are missing a guy like that with a big body, knows how to do things well and wins faceoffs, it's a big advantage to have them back.
“Last year we played without them for a long time. When they came back, it's funny how we were so steady. Wingers do have responsibilities, but the centerman is the guy who really carries the load offensively and defensively. If they don't win that draw to start the play, we're playing defense.”
3. A deep, experienced corps of defensemen: They look better on the ice than on paper. One key is that Marek Zidlicky, acquired late last season, is here all year.
“Every team has great ‘D' men,” Salvador said. “If you're in the NHL, you can play the game. What we see on our team is the chemistry we have with each other. Half the battle is being comfortable with your role.”
4. A taste often wets the appetite: Coming two wins away from the Cup is a motivating factor for this team.
“We haven't even played our best hockey. We've found ways to win early on,” Zajac said. “It helps that this group of guys was together last year. Also, we didn't end the season the way we wanted, but it was a successful season. It gave us a taste of the Finals. You realize how exciting it is and you want to get there again.”
5. The restless GM: Lamoriello often makes a key trade at the deadline and this year will be no different. But that's April 3. Right now the Devils are looking for a start that will disprove the non-believers.
“I felt I knew what we had,” DeBoer said of this squad. “There were some intangibles there that I didn't have a handle on: How good condition we were going to be in? How quickly could we get up to game speed?
“With the number of returning players and the buy-in to the system I knew was going to be there. To these guys' credit, they came back in fantastic shape and really have answered all those questions. We have gotten ourselves, I think, on track as quickly or quicker than a lot of teams. That's why we've been successful early.”

The President and CEO of the Ottawa Hospital admitted the NCC's selection of Tunney's Pasture as the site for a new Civic Hospital came out of left field.
"I'm surprised, because we did have some concerns (about the site) and it wasn't one of our top choices," said Dr. Jack Kitts.
The Ottawa Hospital's independent review of possible sites found that Tunney's Pasture would cost far too much to knock down buildings and prepare the land, didn't have enough space for future expansions, and was too far from the Queensway.
Kitts won't say whether they'll accept the NCC's decision.
"We need to study the options," they said.
Kitts said that time is of the essence, noting that, at this point, "Ottawa's 21st century hospital" won't be ready before 2025.

The lovely-looking restaurant and bar The Breslin begins lunch service tomorrow, and co-owner Ken Friedman (The Spotted Pig) is planning on serving alcohol despite objections from the Masjid Ar-Rahman mosque across the street. Earlier this month the mosque's leaders called a meeting with Friedman at The Ace Hotel, where The Breslin is located, and asked, "Can you move the bar?" Friedman's response makes us want to hurry over to The Breslin right now for a dram of Laphroaig to show our support (and drown out the voices):
I laughed. And the guy said, "Oh, you think that's funny?" And I said, "Yeah, that is funny, that is really funny, because we're not going to move the bar just because you discovered we're serving booze." Can you name one restaurant in New York that doesn't serve booze? I said, "This is the United States of America and we'll do whatever the fuck we want." They said the mosque had suggested it couldn't control the behavior of "a few bad eggs"; i.e., we could get a brick through our window.
Friedman notified police of the threat, but just to show he's not a hard-hearted man, that it's not all dollars and cents, they agreed to put a curtain over the windows so devout Muslims wouldn't be corrupted by the sight of infidel inebriation. But the curtain hasn't arrived yet, so over the weekend they actually taped paper over the windows to hide a gay wedding. A volunteer at the mosque says city law forbids serving liquor within 200 feet of a place of worship and that "not more than 200 feet is between the mosque and the bar."
But Ace Hotel developer Andrew Zobler tells The Observer, "The law is clear that in order for that to apply it has to be an exclusively dedicated house of worship, and at their space they have both residences and a restaurant, so basically, because of those uses the law allowed there to be a bar within 200 feet. Everyone was aware of that when the liquor license was granted." And Friedman adds, "They can threaten, but they can't really stop us." Yeah, heh, what are these devout, pissed-off Muslims gonna do?

Standard linear interpolation is just lerp(t, a, b) = (1-t)*a + t*b . You should already know this. At t=0 we get a, at t=1 we get b, and for inbetween values of t we interpolate linearly between the two. And of course we can also linearly extrapolate by using a t outside [0,1].
Past
The expression shown above has two multiplies. Now, it used to be the case that multiplies were really slow (and by the way they really aren't anymore, so please stop doubling the number of adds in an expression to get rid of a multiply, no matter what your CS prof tells you). If multiplies are expensive, there's a better (equivalent) expression you can get with some algebra: lerp(t, a, b) = a + t*(b-a) . This is the first of the three tricks, and it's really well known.
But in this setting (int multiplies are slow) you're also really unlikely to have floating-point hardware, or to be working on floating-point numbers. Especially if we're talking about pixel processing in computer graphics, it used to be all-integer for a really long time. It's more likely to be all fixed-point, and in the fixed-point setting you typically have something like fixedpt_lerp(t, a, b) = a + ((t * (b-a)) >> 8) . And more importantly, your a's and b's are also fixed-point (integer) numbers, typically with a very low range.
So here comes the second trick: for some applications (e.g. cross-fades), you're doing a lot of lerps with the same t (at least one per pixel). Now note that if t is fixed, the (t * (b - a)) >> 8 part really only depends on b-a, and that's a small set of possible values: If a and b are byte values in [0,255], then d=b-a is in [-255,255]. So we really only ever need to do 511 multiplies based on t, to build a table indexed by d. Except that's not true either, because we compute first t*0 then t*1 then t*2 and so forth, so we're really just adding t every time, and we can build the whole table without any multiplies at all. So here we get trick two, for doing lots of lerps with constant t on integer values:
U8 lerp_tab[255*2+1]; // U8 is sufficient here // build the lerp table for (int i=0, sum = 0; i < 256; i++, sum += t) { lerp_tab[255-i] = (U8) (-sum >> 8); // negative half of table lerp_tab[255+i] = (U8) ( sum >> 8); // positive half } // cross-fade (grayscale image here for simplicity) for (int i=0; i < npixels; i++) { int a = src1[i]; int b = src2[i]; out[i] = a + lerp_tab[255 + b-a]; }
Look ma, no multiplies!
Present
But back to the present. Floating-point hardware is readily available on most platforms and purely counting arithmetic ops is a poor estimator for performance on modern architectures. Practically speaking, for almost all code, you're never going to notice any appreciable difference in speed between the two versions
lerp_1(t, a, b) = (1 - t)*a + t*b lerp_2(t, a, b) = a + t*(b-a)
but you might notice something else: unlike the real numbers (which our mathematical definition of lerp is based on) and the integers (which our fixed-point lerps worked on), floating-point numbers don't obey the arithmetic identities we've been using to derive this. In particular, for two floating point numbers we generally have a + (b-a) != b , so the second lerp expression is generally not correct at t=1! In contrast, with IEEE floating point, the first expression is guaranteed to return the exact value of a (b) at t=0 (t=1). So there's actually some reason to prefer the first expression in that case, and using the second one tends to produce visible artifacts for some applications (you can also hardcode your lerp to return b exactly at t=1, but that's just ugly and paying a data-dependent branch to get rid of one FLOP is a bad idea). While for pixel values you're unlikely to care, it generally pays to be careful for mesh processing and the like; using the wrong expression can produce cracks in your mesh.
So what to do? Use the first form, which has one more arithmetic operation and does two multiply, or the second form, which has one less operation but unfavorable rounding properties? Luckily, this dilemma is going away.
Future
Okay, “future” is stretching a bit here, because for some platforms this “future” started in 1990, but I digress. Anyway, in the future we'd like to have a magic lerp instruction in our processors that solves this problem for us (and is also fast). Unfortunately, that seems very unlikely: Even GPUs don't have one, and Michael Abrash never could get Intel to give them one either. However, they did get fused multiply-adds, and that's one thing all GPUs have too, and it's either already on the processor you're using or soon coming to it. So if fused multiply-adds can help, then maybe we're good. And it turns out they can.
A fused multiply-add is just an operation fma(a, b, c) = a*b + c that computes the inner expression using only one exact rounding step. And FMA-based architectures tend to compute regular adds and multiplies using the same circuitry, so all three operations cost roughly the same (in terms of latency anyway, not necessarily in terms of power). And while I say “fma” these chips usually support different versions with sign flips in different places too (implementing this in the HW is almost free); the second most important one is “fused negative multiply-subtract”, which does fnms(a, b, c) = -(a*b - c) = c - a*b . Let's rewrite our lerp expressions using FMA:
lerp_1(t, a, b) = fma(t, b, (1 - t)*a) lerp_2(t, a, b) = fma(t, b-a, a)
Both of these still have arithmetic operations left that aren't in FMA form; lerp_1 has two leftover ops and lerp_2 has one. And so far both of them aren't significantly better than their original counterparts. However, lerp_1 has exactly one multiply and one subtract left; they're just subtract-multiply (which we don't have HW for), rather than multiply-subtract. However, that one is easily remedied with some algebra: (1 - t)*a = 1*a - t*a = a - t*a , and that last expression is in fma (more accurately, fnms) form. So we get a third variant, and our third trick:
lerp_3(t, a, b) = fma(t, b, fnms(t, a, a))
Two operations, both FMA-class ops, and this is based on lerp_1 so it's actually exact at the end points. Two dependent ops – as long as we don't actually get a hardware lerp instruction, that's the best we can hope for. So this version is both fast and accurate, and as you migrate to platforms with guaranteed FMA support, you should consider rewriting your lerps that way – it's the lerp of the future!

Summary for Moms:
Based on the 1962 comic book character and Norse God of the same name, Thor follows the titular God of Thunder (Chris Hemsworth) as they are exiled to New Mexico by decree of their father Odin (Anthony Hopkins). Stripped of their hammer, their powers, and deemed ‘unworthy', Thor must learn to tame their hubris with the help of astrophysicist and professional love interest Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). If they succeed, Thor will be able to return to their home realm of Asgard, hopefully before their fiendish brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) completes their scheme to steal Odin's throne.
Review:
I was worried about showing my mom Thor. Out of the Phase One Marvel Movies, it has the toughest job, especially when watched by someone who has no experience with the source material. Thor needs to tell the story of a conflict between nearly invincible Norse Gods in the magical far away realm of Asgard, and simultaneously meld it seamlessly with the realistic, down-to-earth mechanics of the world introduced in Iron Man. People mark Guardians of the Galaxy as being the MCU's biggest risk, but I think Thor was its first big challenge. It's a pretty out-there concept, so, selling this to my mother seemed like it was going to be tough.
Before starting the movie, I asked my mom what they knew about Thor. They said they had no idea who they are, except that they featured in a few of the bedtime stories they read to me as a kid. That was a good start, at least, even though I don't remember being read any Thor stories. (“Thories”? There's a joke there. I'll workshop it and get back to you.)
Thor had a lot going against it, but the end product is far better than it has any right to be. While the plot meanders a bit — shoehorning in of Agent Coulson and SHIELD for the purposes of bridging the worlds — the story is simple, but compelling and well carried by the performances. Except maybe Natalie Portman, who doesn't really seem to want to be there (which I think is the case).
The story is what appealed to my mom the most, they thought it was simple and easy to understand. Which I think works both for and against the movie. It's not a very demanding narrative, and, as a result, some of the action beats, specifically Thor vs. The Destroyer, felt a little tacked on. They quickly forgot it once it was dispatched.
Overall, however, I think my mom enjoyed the moral of the story more than the story itself. How Thor grows from rushing into things hot-headed and “being unwise”, to the end where they learn that a “good leader has to be wise, listen, keep people safe, and treat them equally”. It seems like they like movies where the heroes learn to be good people.
Thor‘s cast has a great chemistry that makes the whole ridiculous premise believable and, more importantly, fun, while putting forward memorable performances, including those of the side characters. Despite not knowing any of the characters, my mom maintained that “all the actors were perfect for their parts”. They were happy to recognize Anthony Hopkins playing a good character, but was clear to note that they hated their (Oscar winning) performance in Silence of the Lambs because it was, yes, “disgusting” and they didn't know why they had to play a “monster”. They regret watching that movie.
The standout performance of this film is, of course, Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston with such delightful relish that it's easy to see why he's the MCU's only real recurring villain so far. Mom enjoyed their performance as well, and was impressed with how they were always 10 steps ahead of everyone else. Hiddleston sold the layers of the characters so well that even I was surprised with the reveal of their true plan near the end of the movie since I hadn't watched it in years.
As I said before, Thor is our first step into the weirder, mystical side of the Marvel universe, and so deserves credit for palatably introducing the world of Asgard to the MCU. For someone who was raised entirely on Hindu gods and myths, my mom accepted the Nordic explanation of things very well, and stated that “it's all the same mythology” and that we “all have the same stories”. It's a touching moment of multi-cultural acceptance, even if the culture she's accepting is pure alabaster white.
However, I'm not really sure if they truly understood the relationship between Asgard and how it connects to Earth, because, really, I'm still not sure I understand it. I said Thor introduced it palatably, but not necessarily clearly. Even after 2 Thor movies and 2 Avengers movies, I'm still unsure about the specifics. Is Asgard another planet? Another dimension? Is it in the same dimension but just in a mystical magic… area? What's going on there? Maybe someone can help me out here, but it doesn't negatively impact the movie at all, so I'm not too bothered.
Is Thor the best Marvel Movie? No, not by a long shot. Other than Loki, there is nothing completely outstanding about it. But it hits on many levels, becoming much more than the sum of its parts and making it too fun and engaging to dislike. And my mom enjoyed watching it, and isn't that really the point of this blog?
Thor 2 on the other hand… well, we'll burn that bridge when we come to it.
Mom Rating (Out of Five):
Miscellaneous Notes:
Mom didn't realize Jane Foster was played by Natalie Portman until the credits rolled.
At the beginning, my mom thought Loki was playing it too cool, so they knew something was up, even though they didn't know their history. Very sharp, mom.
For someone who doesn't like comedy, they really liked the fact that they kept hitting Thor with their car.
After the movie ended, they went on a nice rant about how they think the “Marvel People” are very good and “wise” people, and that they really know how to tell a story.
Despite a whole article's worth of brainstorming, I still don't have anything better for you than “Thories”. I'm so thorry.
Post-Credits Sequence:
Mom was surprised that Loki was back in the mix and was actually interested to see what came of it. I remember being confused at the end of this scene as to whether or not Loki was controlling Stellan Skarsgard or not, and they had the same issue. Unfortunately, it's still not very clear to either of us. And despite the fact that we hadn't yet seen the Tesseract in any prior movies, they recognized it as the box that the Phase One Blu-Ray set came in. “Oh, it's that thing!”
Now that she's used to the concept of a Post-Credits Sequence, they thought it was a “very smart idea” to get people to watch the credits all the way to the end so that all the people who worked on the film get appreciated. Which is nice.

A man has been charged after officers found 13 grenades, a handgun and ammunition during a search of a Scarborough home Wednesday night, Toronto police say.
The live grenades, found inside a house on Canlish Road near Birchmount Road and Lawrence Avenue East, are in possession of the police.
The grenades are not military relics, though 12 of them are said to be military training grenades that were being contained in a hard plastic case. The Canadian Armed Forces told CBC the grenades are not from the Canadian military.
The man, 30, of Toronto faces 15 charges including but not limited to:
Possession of a restricted firearm without a licence
Possessing dangerous weapons
Possession of an explosive substance
Toronto police say they found several grenades, guns, drugs and ammunition in a search of a home overnight in Scarborough. (Tony Smyth/CBC) A search warrant was executed at the home after 5:25 p.m. and the search was carried out under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, police said. There were toys on the front lawn during the search and neighbours said children live there.
When officers entered the home, they found the grenades and handgun. Police left the home and called explosive experts to the scene to have the grenades removed.
The search of the home prompted the evacuation of houses on either side. During the search, residents forced to leave their homes stayed warm on a TTC bus that was brought to the scene.

"We got a knock on the door about quarter to 11, telling us that we had to evacuate, something about there was a bomb in the area. We haven't been told much since then," Platts said.
Platts, who has lived in the area all their life, said they had to start work at 6:30 a.m. and was not happy about being forced out of their home.
"We haven't been told what was in the house or anything like that," they said. "I am pretty upset about it, absolutely."
They said their children were upset, as well.
"They are pretty frightened right now. I'm sure a lot of people in the neighbourhood are. It's a very quiet neighbourhood. I've never seen this happen ever before."
Officers from the Toronto police Emergency Task Force also helped in the search.

Const. Allyson Douglas-Cook, spokesperson for Toronto police, said there is no threat to public safety.
"At this point, there is no danger to anyone in the area," they said.
“Ain't nobody ever gonna be free.”
In this environment of violence and corruption and death, power and allegiances may shift, but one thing remains constant: the environment, one that is restricting and cruel, unrelenting and indifferent to the plights of its inhabitants. All empires eventually crumble, and what's left is the need for survival; what's left is the question of whether you can make peace with the inevitability of your mortality.
Over the course of the season, we've seen a Nucky Thompson who wants to go legitimate, who wants to leave a legacy for themselves and be admired to no end. However, we're now also seeing a Nucky Thompson who slowly loses everything, who is betrayed and hurt, who is left reciting “Song of Hiawatha” and fighting people in a dive bar after they find out about Sally's death. Sally's mortality reminds them of their past, of their decision to–in a scene that really makes a case for these flashbacks' necessity–turn over a young Gillian Darmody to the Commodore. Here, we see their point of no return, the point at which they truly become the Nucky we know today, the Nucky who's left knocked out in the street.
Because, after all, this isn't really a tale about Nucky's redemption; it's a tale about Nucky trying to quench the steady flow of guilt that's built up over the years. They offered money to Chalky last week and offers money to Joel Harper this week, stating that it's “for me”, and we see that this is a selfish man through and through. In the end, it's simply all about him. They had family to cling onto with Mabel, but we know that they die and that they are left with nothing but empty power. “You start at the bottom. You don't have a choice. Get yourself ahead. What else can you do?” Nucky tells the women at the bar, but the real essence of their situation is encapsulated by their bitter “For what though, huh? For what? No one talks about that!” What is their purpose? What kind of man will they die as?
For Nelson Van Alden and Chalky White, they die in as “nice” a way as you can die in this show. Van Alden, whose frustration has been building up since they became Mueller, finally explodes, embracing their identity as the man they were as they have their hands around Al Capone's neck. They know that there's no way out, that he's in for, so they do what he's been wanting to do for a while now. “I AM NELSON KASPAR VAN ALDEN. I am a sworn agent of the United States Treasury, and I swear by Jesus, our lord, that JUSTICE will rain down upon you as if it is my last–” This is a heartbreaking, cathartic, and even humorous, moment, and Michael Shannon is perfect in their final scene.
We get a contrast of Van Alden's explosion with Chalky's quiet acceptance of their fate, with the inevitability hanging over the scene involving him, Narcisse, Daughter, and Althea. Michael Kenneth Williams is brilliant when it comes to conveying a range of emotions amid a largely stoic character, and this is their crowning achievement in a series full of great performances. Him listening to the recording is a beautiful, beautiful moment, and the shot of them straightening their jacket and smiling before he's shot is marvelously done by the production team and by Williams. Chalky was already on a suicide mission, but when they come face to face with their past, with the idea of love, they decide to find meaning in that love rather than in revenge.
Valentin Narcisse walks away unharmed, but who's truly the free one here?
GRADE: A
OTHER THOUGHTS:
– “Your wife told you to rob Al Capone?”
“We were having troubles at home.”
“…I can vouch for that.”
-Hmm. Is that Tommy Darmody with Mickey?
-The sound of the needle on the blank part of the record is used over the credits. It's a great choice.
-Great casting with the young people all around, especially Eli and Nucky.
– “Call me what you will. I never pretended to be your friend.” Last week, Nucky told Chalky that they were friends.
-The final scene of the series is of Van Alden and Richard Harrow–both alive again–seeing each other's faces, then high five-ing and skipping off into the sunset as they flip off everyone around them (everyone around them is dead).
-Van Alden technically ends up succeeding, as Mike D'Angelo now has the ledgers; Al Capone will soon be in jail. Van Alden also ends up essentially taking a bullet for Eli.
-So, this is one of the best episodes this show has produced. My all-time favorite is still “Two Imposters”, but this comes incredibly close.
-Two more. I'm excited.

Learn a wonderfully simple algorithm that teaches as much about Python as it does about mathematics.
Why do this?
You'll learn ancient wisdom about numbers and their factors.
This is a great way to see how Python deals with Boolean operations.
While at the same time, see the danger of putting everything into one line.
We're about to go back to the year 300 BC. A time when much of the world looked like the cover of the LED Zepplin album Houses of the Holy. This is the time of Euclid; mathematician, Greek geek and founder of all things geometrical.
The problem that Euclid's algorithm solves is easy enough to understand: what is the largest common divisor of two integers? Take the numbers 100 and 80, for example: what's the largest number that divides into both?
You can make some assumptions about what that number might look like - it's going to be even and less that 40, obviously, and maybe more than 20 - but to get any closer is going to require a brute-force approach. Does 25 work? No. 30? Nope. Looks like it might be 20 then, as this divides into both and it doesn't look like there can be a higher number.
How about if the two numbers were 50 and 60? It's not obvious what the common divisor might be for these two, which introduces more guesswork. Or what if the numbers were 123456 and 654321?
Adding and subtracting
For all the non-Euclids, the most basic algorithm may simply halve the smallest number and then start counting down, checking whether the new number divides into both.
It will work OK for small values, but it's obviously a computationally expensive approach that will become unrealistic very quickly. There has to be a better way, and that's where Euclid comes in.
Euclid discovered that if you compare the smaller number with the difference between the smaller and the larger number, 50 compared to 10 in our second example, and then carried on doing the same comparisons, smaller compared against the remainder of the previous subtraction, until you could continue no further, the previous remainder is the largest common divisor.
For the numbers 50 and 60, here's what happens:
60 - 50 = 10
50 - 10 = 40
40 - 10 = 30
30 - 10 = 20
20 - 10 = 10
10 - 10 = 0
So the largest common divisor between the numbers 50 and 60 is 10. Try it for yourself. It may get a little longwinded - you could easily see that the solution was going to be 10 in the previous example, for instance, but it always works regardless of how big the numbers are you choose.
The next question we should be asking is, why? The solution is to do with common divisors, the group of numbers that can be equally divided into both of our values. The common divisor of a (assuming a is the largest number in the pair), is also a common divisor of a - b (assuming b is the second number).
In the first line of our previous calculation, that's the number 10 (60-50). 10 has its own set of devisors - 1,2, 5 and 10, and this process of subtraction doesn't change the set of common divisors. This makes sense because when you subtract the difference you are subtracting a number that shares the common divisors of both numbers.
It might help if you think about this in terms of reversing the calculations with addition:
10 + 10 = 20
20 shares the common divisors of 10, because we've just doubled it. 20 + 10 = 30.
Each addition sharing the same common factor that we started with, until... 50 + 10 = 60.
We now have our original two values, and you can see where the common divisors came into the equation and how the reversal of this reveals them. The next job is to put this idea into code, and you should be able to see that we're on the verge of replacing our numbers with variables anyway, so we just need to add some logic.
We're going to use Python for this example, as it's installed on virtually everything - from the Raspberry Pi to Apple's OS X and your Linux distribution. If you've not used the Python interpreter before, just type python on the command line and make sure you follow our syntax and indentation exactly.
Here's the Python code:
def euclid(a, b): return b and euclid(b, a%b)
Woah! Those two lines of code do what we've just spent 700 words trying to explain! If this is your first foray into Python, we'll try to take it as slowly as we can, starting off with what we've just created.
def euclid(a, b):
defines a function called euclid that takes two arguments: a and b. These values are the same two values we were using before in our explanation. If you've just typed this into Python, you can type euclid(100,140) to execute the function:
euclid(100,140)
The interpreter will spit out the answer, which in this case is 20.
Now let's look at what the function is doing, one word or character at a time. return is how functions are halted when retuning results from an evaluation. If this line were return 1234 , the output from the function would always be 1234 . But that doesn't include any evaluating, which in our example, is done with the remainder of the line. The next character is b , our second number, followed by the word and .
Boolean operators
In programming terms, and is a Boolean operator. With most other programming languages, for an evaluation to be true both sides of a Boolean and need to be non-zero.
(1 and 1) is true, for example, whereas (0 and 1) is false, and those languages would typically return a 1 for true and a 0 for false.
Python is slightly different in the way it handles return values because it packs more features into a single operation. If the first value is non-zero, it will return the second value from the evaluation.
If it's false, it will return the first. Here's a simple function definition and the output from the interpreter to show you what we mean:
>>> def andtest(a,b): ... return a and b ... >>> andtest(1,2) 2 >>> andltest(0,2) 0
This facility gives you the same output you get from other languages - if both values are non-zero, you'll get a non-zero value returned, which is effectively the same as (1 and 1) = true.
If either the first or the second values are zero, these will be returned, effectively making (3 and 0) = false. But you get more because you get the value of the second number for free, and this is how our code is working.
But there's another trick immediately afterwards - recursion:
euclid(b, a%b) or a
The second argument to the first and evaluation calls the function again from within itself. That's the recursion part. The arguments for this second call of the function are the second value itself and the remainder of a division between the first and second number.
This remainder of a division, otherwise known as a modulo operation, is a different method to the one we outlined earlier. It's the same theory, only made more efficient.
This is because equal divisions of the lower number into the higher number - such as 5 into 28 - help us to fast forward a few steps without losing the common divisor.
28%5=3, which is because 28 divided by 5 = 5, with a remainder of 3. You get the same result as the remainder from the subtractions we were doing earlier, only without all the effort:
28 - 5 = 23 23 - 5 = 18 18 - 5 = 13 13 - 5 = 8 8 - 5 = 3
But when will this recursion stop? When will the function stop calling itself and start returning values back up the chain? That's where the final or a comes into play, and it's an evaluation connected to the earlier and statement.
In most programming languages, an or evaluation will only return true if one or the other of the arguments is true - so (1 or 0) would equal true, but (0 or 0) would be false. In Python, you get better value from the same statement because it returns the first value if it's false and the second value if its not. Here's another quick example from the interpreter:
>>> def ortest(a,b): ... return a or b ... >>> ortest(1,2) 1 >>> ortest(0,2) 2
If the evaluation of the recursively embedded function returns zero, the and evaluates the value of a against the value of b, effectively returning the next to last value for b before the final evaluation returned 0.
That's exactly the same result we got when we first worked out Euclid's algorithm manually, but it's quite difficult to imagine.
To make things clearer, here's some pseudo code for what happens when we call the function with the values of 60 and 50, showing each recursive step on a line with a number and the values Python is calculating. When a value is finally returned, we change the line number with the returned value inserted into the evaluation so you can see what's happening and how we step back through recursion to the final number:
a = 60 b = 50 1: 60 and euclid(50, 10) or 60 2: 50 and euclid(10, 40) or 50 3: 40 and euclid(10, 30) or 40 4: 30 and euclid(10, 20) or 30 5: 20 and euclid(10, 10) or 20 6: 10 and euclid(10, 0) or 10 (RETURNS 10 ) 5: 20 and 10 or 20 (RETURNS 10) 4: 30 and 10 or 30 (RETURNS 10) 3: 40 and 10 or 40 (RETURNS 10) 2: 50 and 10 or 50 (RETURNS 10) 1: 60 and 10 or 60 (RETURNS 10)
You can test the logic of that comparison yourself without the recursive element:
>>> def eval(a,b,c): ... return a and b or c ... >>> eval(20,10,20) 10
The end result is the product of thousands of years of thought - a concise algorithm that performs a useful operation, all on a single line, while at the same time teaching a little about how Python maximises functionality with its Boolean operations (and also makes itself quite difficult to read in the process).
Nearly 300 members of Congress have signed on to a declaration reaffirming their commitment to "the unbreakable bond that exists between [U.S.] and the State of Israel", in a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The letter was sent in the wake of the severe recent tensions between Israel and the U.S. over the prior's decision to construct more than 1,600 new housing units in East Jerusalem, a project it announced during U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's visit to the region.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took advantage of their trip to the United States this week to try to mend the rift with the Obama administration, but they were greeted with cold welcome by the White House.
Netanyahu also met during their visit with members of Congress, who welcomed them with significantly more warmth.
The letter from Congress expresses its "deep concern" over the U.S.-Israel crisis, and emphasizes that lawmakers had received assurances from Netanyahu that the events leading up to the recent tensions would not be repeated.
Letter from members of Congress
Dear Secretary Clinton:
Keep updated: Sign up to our newsletter Email * Please enter a valid email address Sign up Please wait… Thank you for signing up. We've got more newsletters we think you'll find interesting. Click here Oops. Something went wrong. Please try again later. Try again Thank you, The email address you have provided is already registered. Close
We are writing to reaffirm our commitment to the unbreakable bond that exists between our country and the State of Israel and to express to you our deep concern over recent tension. In every important relationship, there will be occasional misunderstandings and conflicts.
The announcement during Vice President Biden's visit was, as Israel's Prime Minister said in an apology to the United States, "a regrettable incident that was done in all innocence and was hurtful, and which certainly should not have occurred." We are reassured that Prime Minister Netanyahu's commitment to put in place new procedures will ensure that such surprises, however unintended, will not recur.
The United States and Israel are close allies whose people share a deep and abiding friendship based on a shared commitment to core values including democracy, human rights and freedom of the press and religion. Our two countries are partners in the fight against terrorism and share an important strategic relationship.
A strong Israel is an asset to the national security of the United States and brings stability to the Middle East. We are concerned that the highly publicized tensions in the relationship will not advance the interests the U.S. and Israel share. Above all, we must remain focused on the threat posed by the Iranian nuclear weapons program to Middle East peace and stability.
From the moment of Israel's creation, successive U.S. administrations have appreciated the special bond between the U.S. and Israel.
For decades, strong, bipartisan Congressional support for Israel, including security assistance and other important measures, have been eloquent testimony to our commitment to Israel's security, which remains unswerving.
It is the very strength of this relationship that has, in fact, made Arab-Israeli peace agreements possible, both because it convinced those who sought Israel?s destruction to abandon any such hope and because it gave successive Israeli governments the confidence to take calculated risks for peace.
In its declaration of independence 62 years ago, Israel declared: "We extend our hand to all neighboring states and their peoples in an offer of peace and good neighborliness, and appeal to them to establish bonds of cooperation and mutual help with the sovereign Jewish people settled in its own land."
In the decades since, despite constantly having to defend itself from attack, Israel has repeatedly made good on that pledge by offering to undertake painful risks to reach peace with its neighbors.
Our valuable bilateral relationship with Israel needs and deserves constant reinforcement.
As the Vice-President said during their recent visit to Israel: "Progress occurs in the Middle East when everyone knows there is simply no space between the U.S. and Israel when it comes to security, none. No space."
Steadfast American backing has helped lead to Israeli peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan. And American involvement continues to be critical to the effort to achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
We recognize that, despite the extraordinary closeness between our country and Israel, there will be differences over issues both large and small.
Our view is that such differences are best resolved quietly, in trust and confidence, as befits longstanding strategic allies. We hope and expect that, with mutual effort and good faith, the United States and Israel will move beyond this disruption quickly, to the lasting benefit of both nations.
We believe, as President Obama said, that "Israel's security is paramount" in our Middle East policy and that "it is in U.S. national security interests to assure that Israel?s security as an independent Jewish state is maintained."
In that spirit, we look forward to working with you to achieve the common objectives of the U.S. and Israel, especially regional security and peace.
Sincerely,
STENY HOYER ERIC CANTOR

"If you can't eliminate injustice, at least tell everyone about it."
Nobel Laureate and human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi begins their book, The Golden Cage: Three Brothers, Three Choices, One Destiny, with this famous quote from Iranian sociologist Ali Shariati.
It is also how Ms. Ebadi has chosen to live their life, even if it means self-imposed exile.
“In Iran, human rights activists are either in prison or they are incommunicado, meaning no one can talk to them and it's basically impossible for them to have any activity. Unfortunately at the present time, a lot of people ... are afraid to talk. This is why I've remained outside Iran, and work for Iran from where I am,” says Ebadi, who moved to London after Iran's contested 2009 presidential elections. “If something happens in the world, it has to be told so that others will find out about it. It must be known by the world.”
Ebadi, a prominent critic of the Iranian regime, has lived abroad ever since accusations of fraud in the 2009 prompted unprecedented dissent, and the government cracked down hard.
But despite their animosity towards Iran's government, the Iranian human rights lawyer and activist says that the harsh economic sanctions currently imposed against Iran have been misguided. Intended to pressure Tehran into making concessions on its controversial nuclear program, the sanctions are achieving more harm than good and failing to weaken the Iranian regime, according to the Nobel laureate.
“I do not agree with sanctions that hurt people,” says Ebadi in a phone interview a day after April 14 talks between Tehran and the international powers known as P5+1 about Iran's nuclear program.
Though talks ended on a positive note, with negotiations slated to continue in Baghdad on May 23, Ms. Ebadi claims it's too quick to predict if and how Iran's nuclear negotiators will ultimately follow through.
“We have to see what the results are. Up to today, they've always used negotiations to buy time. In this regard, we have to wait for the second round of negotiations.”
No. 2 country for capital punishment; crackdown on dissent
But while the bulk of international attention on Iran is focused on its nuclear program, human rights violations in the Islamic Republic often go relatively unnoticed.
In 2011, Iran executed more than 360 people, making it the No. 2 country for capital punishment after China, with nearly nine times more executions than the US, according to the Guardian.
Since Iran's disputed 2009 presidential election, the Iranian government has engaged in a broad crackdown on journalists, political opposition figures, activists, and students. As of late 2011, 49 journalists and bloggers remained in prison, and lawyers seeking to represent rights activists have faced mounting pressure from security authorities, with a number of prominent lawyers currently facing stiff prison sentences or long-term bans from practicing law, according to a 2012 Human Rights Watch report.
Three of those lawyers – currently imprisoned on charges of acting against national security – cofounded the now-banned Defenders of Human Rights Center with Ebadi.
Ebadi is seeking to leverage their international credibility to increase American awareness of human rights violations in Iran during a tour of US cities they launched last week in Minneapolis.
Ebadi became Iran's first female judge in 1969, during the tenure of former monarch Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. After's Iran's 1979 revolution, the institution of the Islamic Republic brought with it the demotion of all female judges, including Ebadi. Rather than work in a lower position in a court they once presided over, they chose to retire early from the Iranian judiciary and did not practice law again until 1992, when they received a permit to open their own legal practice.
In 2003, they became both the first Muslim woman and the first Iranian to win a Nobel Peace Prize for their legal work in advancing the rights of women, children, and refugees in Iran.
Women have limited rights in personal matters such as marriage and inheritance. A woman needs the permission of a male guardian to marry, and once married needs their husband's written permission to travel outside the country. They also have limited child custody rights.
Call for constitutional change
Today, the Iranian lawyer and activist says that for Iran to become truly democratic, both the Iranian Constitution and the country's judiciary system, which is heavily controlled by the clergy, must change.
Speaking by phone Sunday from Minneapolis, where they kick-started an eight-city lecture tour, Ms. Ebadi said the Islamic Republic's unique system of clerical rule, in which Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acts as “Guardian Jurist” with final say in all matters of state, must also be amended.
In a democratic, secular Iran, a Supreme Leader, would have no role in governance, says Ebadi. “The Constitution and the legal structure of the judicial system must be changed. When I speak about a secular democracy, naturally I am speaking of the separation of church and state and religion from government,” they say.
But they are quick to add that the decision to amend Iran's laws must be made by the people themselves in a free and fair vote, and expressed hope that Iran's transition towards democracy and free political participation can be achieved peacefully.
How Ebadi differs from Green Movement leaders
Ebadi's call for change in Iran's Constitution differs from the views of prominent affiliates of Iran's so-called Green Movement, such as former president Mohammad Khatami and opposition figures Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, who have all called for the Islamic Republic to “return” to Iran's post-Revolutionary Constitution, which they claim the current regime has violated.
But differences of opinion such as This is exactly the point of a democracy, says the Nobel laureate. “That is the way it is. People have different views,” they say.

“The Green movement isn't an ideological movement. It's a civil movement. And all of those who are unhappy with the present government can be part of it, even if they have different political views. They just want to improve the situation,” they say.

Not one country in the world has successfully eliminated its gender gap, according to a recent report from the World Economic Forum (WEF). But while the scope of gender inequality has narrowed in some countries, in other countries women continue to severely trail men in economic participation, educational attainment, political empowerment, and even basic health outcomes.
The WEF's 2014 Global Gender Gap Report measured disparities between men and women in 142 countries. In the worst-scoring nations, economic and educational opportunities, as well as political representation and health outcomes, were far worse for women than for men. Yemen, the worst country, has been the lowest ranked nation in the report since 2006, when the WEF began measuring gender inequality. Based on the WEF report, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 10 worst countries for women.
The countries with with the worst gender inequality consistently failed to give the female residents the same access to educational opportunities that they gave to the male residents. In many of these nations, disparities were clear as early on as primary school. For example, in Chad, just 55% of school-aged girls were enrolled in primary school, among the worst rates in the world and far worse still than the 71% for boys. Côte d'Ivoire, Pakistan, and Yemen also had large disparities in enrollment.
Beyond just enrollment, literacy, perhaps the most critical educational outcome, can differ widely by gender in many of these nations. In Mali, for instance, just 25% of women were considered literate, versus 43% of men. Similarly, Chad had female and male literacy rates of 28% and 47%. The low rates of female literacy in these nations are not just problematic for gender equality, but also for a country's development, given the critical role the ability to read and write well plays in fostering a skilled workforce.
Women in countries with extreme gender inequality do not hold office to the same degree that men do. In each of the 10 worst countries for women, men accounted for at least 80% of ministerial positions. Similarly, women accounted for more than 20% of parliamentary positions in only one of these nations, Pakistan.
The opportunities for economic participation also differed widely between men and women in the world's worst-ranked countries. In fact, in many of these nations, men are at least three times as likely to participate in the labor force as women. Syria is the most extreme example of this, with 76% of men in the labor force versus just 14% of all women.
Further, working women in these countries frequently earned far less than their male counterparts. In the case of Iran, women earned an average of less than $5,000 annually. Men with jobs, on the other hand, earned more than $26,000 per year. Similarly, in Lebanon, men earned more than $26,000 per year, versus $7,106 for women.
24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 10 nations that received the worst score in the World Economic Forum's (WEF) 2014 Global Gender Gap Report. The WEF graded each country based on its score in four key areas: economic participation and opportunity; educational attainment; health and survival; and political empowerment. Each area consisted of multiple variables. Countries scored worse by each variable when the gap between men and women for that measure was the widest. All WEF figures represented the most recently available data. Figures on Human Development Index Scores are from the United Nations Human Development Programme, and are as of 2014.
Seeking to disrupt the $10 billion airport car rental business, FlightCar, a sort of Airbnb for airport rentals, allows travelers leaving town to make their cars available for those who are visiting. The startup, which launched its service at San Francisco International Airport just a few months ago, is hoping to open for business in a number of other markets over the course of the rest of the year. To do that, it has raised a $5.5 million Series A round, with a number of high-profile investors, including General Catalyst, Softbank Capital, Airbnb founder and CEO Brian Chesky, as well as Ryan Seacrest's Seacrest Global Group.
Other investors in the round include Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, Posterous founder Garry Tan, Auctomatic founder Harj Taggar, Justin.TV founder Emmett Shear, former Expedia CEO Erik Blachford, First Round Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz. The new funding comes on top of $590,000 in seed funding from Y Combinator and SV Angel that it had received prior to its initial launch.
FlightCar's service works like this: Travelers drop their vehicles off at one of the FlightCar lots at an airport where they are available. Incoming visitors can then rent these vehicles at lower rates than they would find at airport rental chains. If a car is rented, the vehicle's owner is compensated with gas cards equal to up to $10 for each day a car is rented. If not, the vehicle's owner gets free parking, which by itself could save them up to $18 a day in long-term parking.
Cars must have been made by 1999 and have fewer than 150,000 miles to be listed. But FlightCar provides a free wash for all cars that are listed on its site. For travelers, it also provides a valet service to and from the airport for when cars are picked up or dropped off. Most importantly, the service is backed by a $1 million insurance policy for both owners and renters.
According to FlightCar co-founder Shri Ganeshram, the new funding will be used to hire some new engineering and design talent, and to speed up launching its service in new markets. Next up will likely be Boston, as Ganeshram is relocating to the Cambridge area, where they hope to recruit FlightCar's new employees.
The founding team behind FlightCar, which also includes Rujul Zaparde and Kevin Petrovic, is still young. The three were just 18 years old when the company was founded*, and so they believe they will have better luck recruiting engineering talent that's closer to their age, straight out of MIT, than to compete for new employees in Silicon Valley. In addition to SFO and Boston's Logan International Airport, Ganeshram says the team hopes to have operations at two or three other airports by the end of the year.
With its list of investors, it should be well positioned to tackle the problems that come with running a peer-to-peer business in the travel space. After all, Chesky, Ohanian, and Blachford, as well as some others, should all be able to give some insight into how to connect with consumers as well as improving the quality service of a peer-to-peer business model.

Amy Oyler and their daughter Kat go on many science adventures as part of Kat's homeschooling educational program. Amy writes up their experiences on their blog, The Scientific Mom. Here's are some excerpts from one of their recent adventures, Baking with Geology!
BAKING WITH GEOLOGY!
Back in April, Kat and I began our big geology project. We learned a lot about the geological history of Arizona and even took our lessons to the field!
The Earth's crust is divided into four major layers: the crust, the mantle, the outer core, and the inner core. The crust is approximately 5-30 miles thick, being the thinnest at the oceanic layer (up to 5 miles thick) and the thickest at the continental layer (up to 30 miles thick). The mantle is approximately 1,800 miles thick and is made up of not-quite-solid not-quite-liquid rock. The outer core is approximately 1,400 miles thick and made up of liquid iron and nickel. The inner core is approximately 900 miles thick and made up of a solid, incredibly dense ball of super hot iron and nickel.
Now these are all pretty basic things that we read when learning about the layers of the Earth, but what does it really mean? How do you get a grasp on those distances, those layers, and what that even looks like? For this question, we had to get in the kitchen and make ourselves a cake!
A LAYER CAKE OF EARTH
Our layer cake was inspired by this recipe, given by the Department of Earth Sciences at Clemson University, South Carolina.
Materials Needed:
This is where you get to have fun and be creative! Think about the layers of the Earth and what they are made of. Where can you find liquid rock? What about rock that is flexible and plastic like? Where can you find fossils? Maybe you can play around with adding fossils into the layers of your cake for your kids to dig out. Whatever you decide, be prepared to have fun and get MESSY!
Sponge cake mix (or any sturdy cake mix) and the ingredients needed to prepare it Small cake ban or bread pan (we used a bread pan) Non-stick cooking spray Newspaper or foil to cover your work surface with Something to use as a liquid layer (we used both icing and butterscotch pudding) Food coloring Something to act as rocks and bedrock (we used nuts) Something to use as dirt (we used cookies)
Procedure:
Prepare your cake batter according to the directions on the box. Pour a thin layer (approximately 1/2 inch in your bread pan. If you choose to do so, you can add a few drops of food coloring to color your layer. Bake your half inch cake at the temperature that is recommended in the instructions for your cake mix. We baked ours for 10 minutes, using the toothpick test to make sure it was done. When your cake is done, dump it on to your work surface and add another half inch layer of batter. Color this if you choose, and bake it again for approximately 10 minutes (or until done). Repeat until you have 3 layers of cake. Now it's time for decorating! One of these layers will be the inner core, another will be the mantle, and the final layer will be the crust. It's up to you to decide what goes in between all of it! Color your frosting, add pudding, add some chopped nuts or marshmallows for your rocks and fossils. Get creative and get messy!
The final step of course, will be the most fun, as you and your kids get to dig into this gigantic cake of Earth!

The Las Vegas Stadium Authority will get its first look at the details of the financing of the 65,000-seat domed football stadium when it meets Thursday.
Clark County officials will later conduct a high-impact project hearing on the development.
The Clark County Commission, meeting as planning and zoning overseers, was to delve into details of parking, traffic, water, sewer, drainage and emergency services on Wednesday. However, county spokesperson Erik Pappa issued a statement Monday afternoon saying that commission would instead examine the issue at its Sept. 6 meeting.
Nevertheless, on Thursday, the nine-member authority is expected to receive specifics on the four-pronged construction financing package.
The stadium has been billed as a $1.9 billion project that includes $750 million in public funding to support bonds paid off with a 0.88 percentage-point increase in a hotel room tax that ranges between 12.5 percent and 13.4 percent.
In addition to the public funding, the Raiders have three potential funding sources: personal seat licenses sold to season ticket holders, a loan from Bank of America and a National Football League stadium construction loan program.
The Raiders haven't submitted materials to the authority in advance of Thursday's meeting, so it's unclear how much detail will be provided on dollar amounts.
The authority isn't scheduled to act on the leasehold mortgage agreement this month and will likely take it up in September. But authority members are scheduled to receive a report on Bank of America's ability to step in and assume the rights as the leasehold mortgagee should the Raiders fail to meet their loan commitments.
“It's a general presentation on how the deal itself is going to be structured and how the public knows there is sufficient financial security to ensure that the Raiders can fulfill their obligations under the agreements as required by Senate Bill 1,” said Jeremy Aguero, a principal for Applied Analysis, the Las Vegas company serving as the authority's staff. “That presentation and those findings are specifically required by the legislation.”
Included in the discussion will be direction from the authority board about what specific information it wants as part of a formal resolution when it votes on the financial package.
Thursday's agenda also will include progress reports on drafting the personal seat license agreement, a non-relocation agreement and an overall status report on the project.
The authority also is expected to consider whether it wants an owner representative or compliance officer designated as the point person for stadium construction. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority has an owner representative designated for its $1.4 billion Las Vegas Convention Center expansion and renovation project.
New details about the stadium have emerged in documents filed with the county. Plans indicate the building would be 225 feet tall with 10 levels, not including a catwalk servicing lighting and equipment and a transparent roof.
Correction: This story has been updated with the correct date of the meeting of the Clark County Commission.

When people have enough to eat, they often start thinking about the finer things in life: Laphroaig, Lamborghini – and what language they speak to their children.
Mao Zedong thought mother tongues were a luxury that communism could ill-afford, so they tried to impose a common language: everyone had to wear Mao suits and speak Mao's Mandarin. Teachers were forced to teach in it, and children were forced to speak it, even on the playground. Dialects such as Shanghainese – a language all but unintelligible to Mandarin speakers – was taken off the radio, television and out of the schools.
But now, after decades engaged in the single-minded pursuit of materialism, Shanghai is beginning to show interest in things other than money – such as the 700 year old language of its forebears. When Sina Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, recently asked whether local dialect should be used on public transport in Shanghai, 3m people weighed in on the topic. Some 75 per cent supported the local language.
In the past few weeks alone, Shanghai Airlines has started broadcasting in Shanghainese on several routes on a trial basis; as have some city buses; and at least one local primary school has given children the green light to speak patois on the playground, for the first time in a generation.
The older generation never stopped speaking vernacular: almost every Shanghainese old enough to have worn a Mao suit still speaks it when given the choice. But those born in the 1990s tend to have a tenuous grasp of it – often because their parents thought it was more useful to learn English. Those born this century hardly speak it at all. Though it is the mother tongue of at least 10m people – more than 10 times as many as speak Basque or Welsh, for example – Shanghainese is in danger of dying off.
Grandfather Shen Quanfa, 70, is delighted to find themselves listening to the language of their childhood on their daily ride on the 785 bus. “Fewer and fewer people can speak Shanghainese,” they say in heavily-accented Mandarin.
Their face beams with pride as a recorded female voice says “exit the bus from the rear doors please,” and other sweet nothings in Shanghainese.
Playground politics
But if there are 10m people in Shanghai who speak the vernacular, there are at least another 10m who do not – and most of them do not want to.
Shanghai's people, and their language, are not wildly popular – even among other Chinese. Viewed as rude and pushy by foreigners, they are the Asian equivalent of New Yorkers – no one many likes them but other Shanghainese. It does not help that they always seem to be shouting at each other.
Thus many immigrants to Shanghai – who dominate the city's white collar professions – consider the vernacular pride movement either unnecessary or unwelcome.
Fang Xumeng does not speak the local lingo, though they came to the city at age six. “Shanghai is already very xenophobic,” they say as they stroll through a subway tunnel, arm in arm with a friend. “That impression will just be strengthened if they broadcast in Shanghainese,” they say, referring to a proposal that the city's metro system also introduce the vernacular.
Whose idea is this anyway? Not the government's, says Qian Nairong, professor of linguistics at Shanghai University and a leading light of the pro-dialect movement. They say local government is divided between those who want to protect the lingua, and those who are afraid that Beijing will not like it.
The pro-vernacular forces are hardly proposing to launch a separatist movement: Mr Qian just wants children like their seven year old granddaughter to be allowed to speak the dialect at recess. But Beijing may think what happens on the playground today will happen in politics tomorrow: they unlikely to sanction a Republic of Shanghai anytime soon.
Demolition mayor
So Shanghai's words may be getting some protection soon – but the same may not be said of its architectural history. Just as the bus company was launching Shanghainese broadcasting, the city's mayor was pledging a dramatic acceleration in the “remodelling of old districts” – also known as putting money before culture. Some habits die hard.

Going in-depth and breaking down the Cincinnati Bengals offensive line following two major departures.
The offensive line was once the strength of the Cincinnati Bengals. It took a major step back last season however, and could be an even bigger problem in 2017. With the departures of Kevin Zeitler and Andrew Whitworth, the Bengals could be in trouble.
Given that we're in the dog days of summer with no NFL football, the offseason calls for an assessment of the team. We've been going position-by-position and looking at each group thus far.
This time, we dive into the offensive linemen.
Offensive Linemen
*Russell Bodine (1,060 snaps; 77.7 OVR, 63.6 Pass Block, 75.5 Run Block)
*Clint Boling (942 snaps; 77.0 OVR, 84.7 Pass Block, 55.9 Run Block)
*Cedric Ogbuehi (680 snaps; 39.4 OVR, 35.5 Pass Block, 55.9 Run Block)
*Jake Fisher (300 snaps; 43.5 OVR, 42.5 Pass Block, 52.7 Run Block)
*Andre Smith (182 snaps; 39.3 OVR, 41.6 Pass Block, 38.7 Run Block)
Eric Winston (279 snaps; 59.5 OVR, 50.3 Pass Block, 70.5 Run Block)
Trey Hopkins (10 snaps; 50.6 OVR, 60.0 Pass Block, 45.5 Run Block)

* = expected starter | 2016 Pro Football Focus grades in parenthesis
Throughout the recent playoff runs for Cincinnati, their offensive line has stood as a key strength. Football Outsiders rated them as No. 4 in pass protection in 2011, No. 3 in 2013, and No. 5 in 2014. 2012-14 saw the Bengals stand as the No. 11 run blocking unit every year by the Football Outsiders metrics, and 2015 had them leading the entire league as a unit. 2016 was a step down. They ended up being passable in run blocking, but plummeted in pass blocking efficiency.
That's immediately evident in the number of sacks allowed. From 2011-15, they were a top eight team in sacks allowed four times, giving up no more than 30 sacks three times and never giving up more than 32 in those years. The only year where they didn't was 2012, a season which looked similar to their 2016 blocking performance. That season, they gave up 46 sacks — seventh-most in the league.
That 2012 unit was on the upswing amid recent changes, however. Andre Smith just finished the best season of their career. Whitworth was in the midst of yet another high-end season in a career full of them. Zeitler has a good start to what would be a Bengals tenure filled with highly-graded seasons. Clint Boling improved massively from their rookie year to be at the positive level he's held onto to this day. Kyle Cook was a decent-quality starter in the middle and would go on to give the team another year of competent play before Russell Bodine eventually replaced him.
There's little from 2016 that points to much positive movement ahead in that same vein.
Zeitler's departure leaves an unanswered hole at their vacated right guard spot, and Whitworth's leaves another at left tackle. The right tackle spot is just as bad off, with nobody stepping up there last year and little being done to help it this offseason. Boling and Bodine are capable guys at left guard and center, respectively, but having them stand as the best of a unit isn't a good sign for an upcoming season.
This is where the inherent penny-pinching ways of Cincinnati owner Mike Brown really hurt their franchise. He's loosened the purse strings a bit more than they used to (this guy once flamed out on signing Warren Sapp because of allegedly messing with the incentive/guarantee structure of a contract), but even with plenty of money on the cap in recent years he's still been reluctant to sign even their best players before they go elsewhere, even when there isn't a replacement plan in place.
Zeitler and Whitworth are perfect examples.
Zeitler definitely got expensive (five years, $60 million, $31.5 million guaranteed), but this is a top-level player at their position (only six guards outperformed their 87.1 PFF grade, and they were top-10 in both pass blocking and run blocking grades). Those are the guys you pay a premium for!
If cost was really that big of a problem (and with the salary cap leaving them plenty of millions to work with for them coming into the offseason, it's a weak argument), the team should've made a better effort to sign them prior to or even during the season.
Whitworth was a bit more defensible, but barely so. He's 35, with 11 years of games on their body. The deal they signed with the Rams gives them $33.75 million ($15 million guaranteed) over three seasons. That is a major investment for an aging player. Even the best fall off at some point, and the older someone is the more likely that reality sets in.
Without him, however, this team has no capable options in place. Ogbuehi and Fisher were brought in a couple seasons ago to prepare for this exact scenario, but neither has been even slightly passable in their opportunities. With how long Whitworth was with the team (and seemingly on good terms with them as well), it wouldn't be stretching the imagination to see them come back if offered something halfway decent.
Cincinnati seemed to have no interest in them returning, though, and their stalwart tackle (who PFF graded as high-quality or excellent in nine of their 11 seasons so far, including a 91.3 rating last season) moved on. With the high-end veterans gone, Cincinnati is left with a couple decent starters and a cavalcade of awfulness to dig through in hopes of fielding a workable five-man unit.
Bodine should be fine as the starter in the middle for at least one more season, and Boling is a decent player one their left side. Those other spots have so much left to be determined unfortunately, and none of these options should plausibly be expected to do well based on what we've seen to this point.
Start with the tackles. Looking at what they have, the likely path would have Ogbuehi on the left and Fisher on the right. Both have been dramatically bad in their two season so far, so expecting even one of them to take over and succeed in such an important role would be a bad gamble. Relying on both to do so at the same time is a laughable farce.
What other choice do they have at this point, though? Their only other options are even worse. Andre Smith was given the boot after their production fell off a cliff in 2014 and 2015; he's only become more of a liability since, and injuries are a major worry too. Winston was an okay run blocker last season, but their pass blocking was awful (though it must be said, it still graded better than the other three options…somehow). He's also 33 and hasn't had a good season in four years.
Move on to the right guard spot, and it isn't really a better outlook. T.J. Johnson did okay as a run blocker in 2016, but atrocious pass blocking limits their potential effectiveness in a starting role. Trey Hopkins has only 10 snaps to their name (and they weren't good). Past that are a ton of names who either haven't ever lined up for the team (Redmond, Westerman) or were just added as UDFAs (Perkins, Stanton).
Smith actually stands to be their choice so far at guard apparently, but while positional switches have prolonged the usefulness of careers before there is no reason to expect it will be some cure-all in fixing their (or Cincinnati's) problems.
This is like trying to build a house out of twigs and debris. Unfortunately, it's all the Bengals have left themselves with, so they have to make some determination with what they've got available.
I think when it comes down to it, they'll stick with Ogbuehi at left tackle, Boling at left guard, Bodine at center, Smith at right guard, and Fisher at right tackle. That'd be the easiest path, but I think it wouldn't be their best one. There are a couple possibilities I'd prefer to see them attempt instead.
The first would be trying one of either Redmond or Westerman at guard in the place of Smith. Neither has shown anything yet, but that could be a good thing in this case. While we don't know if they're good, we aren't assured as of yet that they are bad. Smith is an aging, ineffective, injury-prone individual switching to a new position. It's grasping at straws to hope they can magically return to effectiveness at this point in their career.
Westerman is a guy who elicited comparisons to Alex Mack coming out of college, and was said to be able to potentially play at any interior spot. Redmond was said to be a fluid mover with good field intelligence. Late-round guards have found places in starting lineups often in this league, and those profiles point to a much higher ceiling than what Smith would do. Plus, if either works out they could be a long-term solution rather than a last-ditch stopgap.
The other possibility would be moving Bodine from the middle to that right guard spot. They played some guard in college so it wouldn't be completely new to him, and it would immediately raise the prospects for that position. The center spot would be vacated to do this, but the Bengals may be better suited to handle a change there. Cincinnati did just add a center in the draft in Dielman. Westerman and Redmond both were discussed as being able to possibly slide to center in the leadup to their draft too.
Comparing this with the other possibility, we end up with either a choice between Redmond, Westerman, or Dielman at center or Smith, Redmond, or Westerman at right guard. Of those, the former has a clearly better collection of potential for growth and longevity.
At the end of the day, none of these are all that exciting though, and the Bengals have nobody to blame but themselves for this outcome. When they look back on another season where they allowed 40+ sacks and got their quarterback and runners clobbered, they'll certainly regret leaving their blocking cupboard so bare.

HGTV abruptly called off a new reality show featuring twin brothers who have organized prayer rallies against LGBT and reproductive rights and compared same-sex marriage to Nazi Germany.
“Flip It Forward,” which was scheduled to premier in October, was supposed to feature David and Jason Benham as they helped families buy, repair, and sell real estate.
The twins will “leverage their good-natured sibling rivalry to help families find a fixer-upper and transform it into the dream home they never thought they could afford,” the network said in a press release announcing nine new series for next season.
But the cable network, which is owned by Scripps Networks Interactive, announced it had dropped plans for the show less than two hours after Raw Story called seeking comment about the twins and their political activism.
“HGTV has decided not to move forward with the Benham Brothers' series,” the network announced Wednesday afternoon on its Facebook page.
David Benham led a prayer rally, Charlotte 7:14, organized with their twin brother outside the 2012 Democratic National Convention to protest “abortion on demand,” “no-fault divorce,” “pornography and perversion,” “adultery,” and “demonic ideologies” taught at public schools and universities.
“(Meanwhile), the church sits silent and just builds big churches,” David Benham told conservative Christian radio host Janet Mefferd. “We are so complacent, we are so apathetic and we are very hypocritical in the church, that's why the Bible says judgment begins in the house of God.”
They also told Mefferd they worked to pass North Carolina's Amendment One, which bans same-sex marriage and civil unions.
“When Amendment One passed I realized the only three counties in North Carolina that actually voted against the amendment were Charlotte, Raleigh and Asheville, our three cities,” they told Mefferd. “So we had all the rural areas and all the suburban areas but we lost all the cities. So I felt like, OK, it's time that we have a citywide church service of repentance and that's the reason that we decided to do it right in the heart of Charlotte the night before the DNC.”
David Benham serves on the board of the anti-LGBT Coalition of Conscience and has referred to Muslims as “the enemy attacking” America.
“The difference between Islam and Christianity: Islam takes life and enslaves it,” they said. “Christianity lays its life down and sets you free.”
The brothers are the sons of Flip Benham, leader of the abortion-clinic protest group Operation Save America, which split from the militant anti-abortion group Operation Rescue in the late 1990s.
The elder Benham baptized Norma McCorvey – the plaintiff in the landmark Roe v. Wade decision – and protested outside mosques while shouting “Jesus hates Muslims” and blamed the Democratic Party for promoting a “culture of death” that caused the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado.
Flip Benham was convicted in 2011 of stalking a Charlotte, N.C., abortion provider and sentenced to 18 months probation.
In a 2012 blog post on Operation Save America's website, David Benham compared the fight against marriage to opposition to Nazi Germany.
“If evil is being accepted and appreciated at the national level, aggressive Christian men must lead the charge against it,” David Benham wrote. “In the late 1940s England realized this truth with Neville Chamberlain's Policy of Appeasement and the Nazi regime. Chamberlain thought they could somehow ‘appease' the fuehrer, yet Winston Churchill aggressively stood against this policy and proclaimed that they must kill Hitler and destroy the regime in its entirety. It wasn't long before Chamberlain's ‘politically correct' policy fell flat on its face, and Churchill – the more aggressive man – took the reins and joined America in defeating the beast.”
David Benham also suggested in the Christian Post that support for marriage equality was the result of psychological issues.
“For the men on the other side of this vote, I'll say a couple of things: You'll never find the love of a father in the arms of another man,” they wrote. “The emotional hurt that you've experienced can only be healed through a life-giving relationship with the very one that created you.”
Watch this profile of David and Jason Benham posted online by CBN-TV:
"We need to be fairly relentless about defining who our enemies are," the former House speaker said. | Getty Gingrich calls for deportation tests of everyone with a 'Muslim background'
Newt Gingrich, one of the final candidates vying to become Donald Trump's running mate, called for testing “every person who is of a Muslim background” to determine whether they “believe in sharia” in response to Thursday's attack in Nice, France.
Hours after Donald Trump declared that the attack in Nice constituted “war” against France and the United States, the former House speaker cast the struggle more broadly, saying: “Western civilization is in a war.”
Story Continued Below
Gingrich then suggested that those who failed a test and were found to be adherents of “sharia law” should be deported from the country. The highly charged proposal echoes Trump's controversial idea to institute a religious test for immigrants entering the country “until we figure out what is going on.”
Speaking to Fox News, Gingrich insinuated that such a test would weed out Islamic State sympathizers.
“We need to be fairly relentless about defining who our enemies are,” they said. “Anybody who goes on a website favoring ISIS, or Al Qaeda, or other terrorist groups, that should be a felony, and they should go to jail. Any organization which hosts such a website should be engaged in a felony. It should be closed down immediately.”
Gingrich also took sharp aim at President Barack Obama, arguing that their alleged reluctance to fight terrorism more aggressively is partly to blame for the Nice attack.
“This is the fault of Western elites who lack the guts to do what is right, to do what is necessary, and to tell us the truth, and that starts with Barack Obama,” Gingrich said.
The vice-presidential hopeful also scoffed at any notion that the United States isn't able to eradicate a group of ““medieval barbarians” such as ISIS.
“I am sick and tired of being told that the wealthiest, most powerful civilization in history, all of Western civilization, is helpless in the face of a group of medieval barbarians who, for example, recently burned 20 young women to death — burned them to death because they wouldn't have sex with them,” they said.
Asked about Gingrich's comments Friday morning on CNN, Trump campaign chairperson Paul Manafort said they hadn't seen the exchange.
“Maybe they said more. I don't know the context,” Manafort said. “Here is the point. The point is the country has serious problems dealing with terrorism, both domestic and international. Leadership is failing.
“And Donald Trump is going to take a holistic approach to how we focus on these things, and not going to allow disparate activities in the communities to define everything. Whether it is in the Muslim communities, Italian, my hometown, or other communities, they are saying we have to have leadership cognizant of the problems going on in the country, and we have to make sure that people coming into the country are known for who they are. Not just wholesale allowed in,” they continued.

The video that showed a passenger being forcibly removed from an overbooked United Airlines flight had many wondering what “volunteer” actually means.
In fact, searches for the word “volunteer” spiked 1900% on Merriam-Webster's online dictionary Monday after United Airlines removed a man from a flight after “one customer refused to leave the aircraft voluntarily,” according to the airline.
Merriam-Webster defines “volunteer” as “someone who does something without being forced to do it” — contradicting United's use of the term following the incident.
“After our team looked for volunteers, one customer refused to leave the aircraft voluntarily and law enforcement was asked to come to the gate,” the company said in a statement Monday morning.

In a separate statement, United CEO Oscar Munoz apologized “for having to re-accommodate these customers.”
Typically if flights are overbooked, airlines will offer vouchers and incentives for passengers to volunteer to take another flight to their destination.
In the case of Sunday evening's United Airlines Flight 3411 from Chicago to Louisville, passengers had already boarded the plane and no one was willing to volunteer for the switch, passenger Audra Bridges told the Courier-Journal. United officials then randomly selected four passengers to switch flights to make way for four United employees who had to catch a flight in Louisville.
A man who was randomly chosen refused to leave their seat, claiming they were a doctor and had patients to see Monday morning. Three security officials then came on board, pulled them from their seat and dragged them through the aisle of the airplane.
The incident sparked outrage online and after United released its statement, many questioned if the airline understood what the term “volunteer” meant:
Munoz, the CEO of United Airlines, said the company will review the incident “with a sense of urgency” and also plans to speak to the passenger who was removed from the plane.

Welcome to a new mix series here at the PsyAmb podcast. This week I would like to present to you a selection of long psychedelic ambient tunes. I never really mix long tunes into my regular mixes here. Well, nothing over 10 minutes in length anyway. That's all about to change as I think there is just too much good music in my collection to ignore. So here we have volume one is a series of mixes that will concentrate of awesome tunes that travel over the 10 minute mark.
We begin today with the track that put Ott on the map - "Jack's Cheese And Bread Snack" from their now classic debut album " Blumenkraft ". Ott has of course gone on to bigger and better things but this track was absolutely mind blowing for me when I first heard it.
Next is a track from Saafi Brother's dubby debut " Mystic Cigarettes " which I sold my kidney to get a copy of back in 1998. Well, not exactly but I was so desperate to get it after hearing tracks from it that I remember driving hours across town to a mysterious record store that claimed to have a copy for sale. They did indeed and I was then in a Mystic Cigarettes listening binge for weeks on end. Subsequent albums never lived up to the promise of the debut unfortunately.
After the Saafi Bros we get into a long tune from Loop Guru's 1994 album " Duniya ". When I say long I mean looooong - this one clocks in at over 20 minutes of hypnotic ambient trance so pull up a comfortable seat for a while. I kind of lost track of Loop Guru around the early 2000's so I'm not sure if they are still producing.
Next is an interesting track from and equally interesting side project of Graham Wood of Infinity Project fame. In 2003 Graham teamed up with Tony Stapleton to release " Puffed Up " and album what was essentially trance music across varied styles. However it did include this 17 minute monster as the closing track. Personally I wished they followed up with more like the closing track but they never released a follow up anyway.
The mighty Doof provides the next long player - "B
alashwaar Baksheesh" from the original Eclipse compilation " Eclipse : A Journey Of Permanence & Impermanence " released in 1998. The album is surely one of the greatest compilations to come out of the UK ambient trance scene of the late 90s.
No long play mix could be complete without one of Ishq's expanding takes on universal consciousness. Here is a incredible song from the fantastic album " Sama " of a few years ago. This track builds and builds into a whirling sandstorm of epic proportions. Fabulous stuff.
We then take another look at some late 90s ambient trance off the Tip.World catalog with "Under Mount Kailash" by Process ( Sean Williams / Benji Vaughan ). This of course is off the classic " Mystery Of The Yeti Part 2 " which is essential listening for anyone into psychedelic ambient music.
One artist who are never shy to explore a longer tale is ethno ambient trance producer Makyo. Makyo has been going strong since the mid 90s and recently released the awesome "Purnima Remixed" which you can read a review of here . Today's track comes from their 2001 album " Yakshini ".
Next up is a track from another great early UK compilation " Liquid Dub Vol 7 ". There were actually no previous releases i.e Vol 1 - 6 so maybe the album title refers more to the fact that it contained 7 tracks, the first of which is this huge tune by "Industrial Suicide Tribe". IST were one of Simon Posford's many short lived collaborations back around the late 90 to early 2000's. This one featured the work of the brilliant Mad Sheer Khan
We finish of this long track mix with an track from one of my all-time favorite lesser known groups. Amaruvision released just one album, 2000's "Light Energy Performance". A mix of trance and tribal music it captured my attention from the start. It's a real shame they didn't go on to release anything else.
So we reach the end of another journey into the sounds of psychedelic ambient trance. I hope you enjoy this one - its a nice look back at some classic psybient music. I have a few more of these long play mixes sorted out so expect to see a few more over the coming months.
Cheers ...
Share. Love in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Love in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
Since it began in 1997, the Fallout franchise as a whole has influenced countless developers, and it's base concept and gameplay stands the test of time. The premise of a world destroyed by nuclear war is grim, but was handled with the perfect darkly comedic tone by original developers Black Isle Studios, which was carried on by Bethesda in Fallout 3. That sense of atmosphere is one of the reasons we enjoy exploring the wasteland so much. With the newest entry in the Fallout series on the way, we thought we would take a look back and talk about why we love it so much. Here's the Top 10 reasons we love Fallout.
Number 10 - The Music
Exit Theatre Mode
Music plays an important role in any game, but the soundtrack that plays through your PIP Boy's radio as you're wandering the wasted lands of Fallout 3 and New Vegas has a lot of character. Fallout 3 utilizes the charisma of post-apocalyptic DJ Three Dog to keep you immersed in the world while exposing your ears to innuendo-laden tunes from the past that fantastically set the tone of your adventure. The themes of the haunting tracks focus on family, love, and loss, while New Vegas uses classic tunes that scream Las Vegas to tie the world together. Before that, Fallout 2's intro used “A kiss to build a dream on” continuing the tradition of using a classic tune to set the mood. The original Fallout also used unsettling ambient tracks that kept you on the edge as you fought for xp or explored new sights. We love that music plays such a huge part in your overall experience of Fallout.
Number 9 - The Characters
Since the original Fallout, character design has been incredibly important. Fully animated character faces and voiced dialogue weren't common in 1997, especially not when the characters react differently based on what you've done or what statement you choose as a response. Not only that, but their designs are also superb, and yet again help immerse you in this bizarre twisted world. That's carried forward into Bethesda's games. Be it the ghouls, mutants, humans, or vault dwellers, each face you encounter has a different persona written all over it. Diversity does not seem to be a problem in this crazy crazy place.
Number 8 - The World
Exit Theatre Mode
The world you explore is a character in itself. There's not a single set piece in Fallout that isn't fully realized and designed to fit into the larger narrative. Each of the vaults you encounter have stories of their own to tell, and often, there are clues about how things went horribly wrong. The open world may look desolate at times, but finding a mysterious burnt-out village or a run-down grocery store is incredibly exciting because there's always something interesting happening around every corner. Not to mention the iconic locales like Megaton from Fallout 3 or The Hub from Fallout 1. No matter where you go, you're bound to find surprises.
Number 7 - The Casting
Fallout has always had a talented set of voice actors at their disposal. Be it Ron Perlman delivering the introductory monologue of every game, or singer Wayne Newton playing Mr. New Vegas, there's never a shortage of talent delivering those iconic lines to your character. Liam Neeson even played your father in Fallout 3, and was the driving force behind the main quest line. No matter which Fallout you're in, the acting is superb and littered with unique characters throughout the lands. Some will make you laugh, others will make you cry, and that ability to so often evoke an emotional response is why we love meeting them.
Number 6 - The Story
Because you have a degree of control over the outcome of each Fallout game, the stories stand out as special. At the end of New Vegas, you had the option to align with one of the factions, or end the story on your terms. Even the original Fallout showcased the power of choice allowing you to fight, blow up, or convince the Supermutants' Master to commit suicide at the end. Besides the main story, there are also branching storylines for sidequests you'll encounter that are sometimes even more powerful. For example, in Fallout 3, the choice to destroy Megaton in exchange for a fancy room is a controversial decision that stuck in many players' minds. Those memorable choices are the reason we love to play out these stories again and again.
Number 5 - Companions
Chances are high that you'll make a friend or two during your time in the post-apocalyptic world, and we wouldn't have it any other way. Dog Meat, your trusty canine friend, is a staple of the franchise, but there are other favorites like Fawkes, Lily Bown, Rex, Sergeant RL-3 and all the others are all just as memorable. No matter who you ended up with, their banter and reactions were usually welcome, or at the very least their ability to carry large quantities of junk that you can sell later. We love you guys, even if you get in the way from time to time.
Number 4 - Weapon Design
Fallout's weapons are amazing! We love the way these weapons look and feel, be it the experimental Mirv that fires eight projectiles at once for massive overkill, the Alien Blaster that you can randomly find while wandering, or Euclid's C-Finder, which rains down power from the heavens. Even the smaller armaments make you feel all powerful by evaporating your opponent into ash… that said, there's one thing that really sells their power which we'll take a look at in our Number 3 entry...
Number 3 - V.A.T.S.
Exit Theatre Mode
The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, or V.A.T.S., is my personal favorite gameplay element in the series. It allows you to pause the action and plan your attack with deadly precision. Not only that, but you get to sit back and watch the action unfold after you hit the execute button that begins a short movie which usually ends with a gory mess. It even comes in handy for strategy, as shooting a deathclaw in the leg with a slow dart can give you plenty of time to pick away at their health while you stay out of reach of the sharp parts from which they get their name. We're excited to see what new spin Bethesda puts on VATS for Fallout 4.
Number 2 - Easter Eggs
There are pop-culture references to movies, TV, and even their own games littered throughout the Fallout world, and it's one of the best experiences when you catch one of these amazing Easter eggs. For example, Sugar Bombs are a reference to Calvin and Hobbes' favorite cereal. A robot in Fallout 2 will repeatedly say “I'm sorry Dave” a clear reference to 2001: A Space Odyssey. There's even a little bit of Star Wars in New Vegas that you can discover as you stumble across two skeletons named Owen and Beru, a.k.a. Luke Skywalker's aunt and uncle. There are countless more where those came from, but one of the biggest reasons we love Fallout is because it all works in this wacky wasteland.
Number 1 - Taking itself seriously
The fact that you can still laugh in a world filled with death, cannibals, ghouls, and mutants is a testament to Fallout's designers' ability to write compelling, interesting, and evocative questlines. For example, in the original Fallout you could set your intelligence so low that you couldn't communicate with anyone except for simple grunts, but you could still beat the game! Harold the ghoul and Bob the tree are fan favorites because even though they've got a pretty miserable existence, they have a mostly positive outlook on life… even if they are kind of crazy. Even Fallout 3's good ol' Moira Brown will send you on a messed-up quest to finish an interesting book, or will maintain their cheery attitude after you destroy their hometown of Megaton and leave them ghoulified. The entire world is so well written that certain quests can bring a tear to an eye, but for the most part it's just a ton of fun to explore.
Well, that's 10 reasons we love Fallout. Do you have a Fallout memory you'd like to share? Let us know about it in the comments below and for more on pip boys and ghouls you're already in the right place. IGN.

We told you yesterday about the third-party self-defense shooting at a Knoxville, TN convenience store.
18-year-old armed robber Tamon J. Stapleton stormed into the the Breadbox and forced the female employee behind the counter and towards the register at 2:30 AM with a gun to their head. One of the employee's male friends happened to be in their car in front of the Breadbox. They retrieved their legally-owned pistol from their car and ran into the store, firing a single shot that struck Stapleton in the head, killing him.
Believe it or not, Stapleton's mother Joy is now demanding homicide charges be filed against the man who defended the clerk from their violent thug of a son:
The teen just graduated from Austin-East High School. From their mother's point of view, things were getting better. “I don't care what they say about Tamon's juvenile charges, the past is the past,” said Stapleton. They plan to fight for charges against the shooter, but police say the case is closed. “If the store clerk had killed them I would have felt different,” said Stapleton. “But because that man came into the store and killed them as they watched this robbery go on…he was not in danger. They could have dialed 911 and then went in to the store. But they didn't, they just automatically went into the store and shot my son in the head.”
No, Joy. That's not how any of this works.
The article makes very clear that Tamon (and presumably their accomplice, Pumbaa) had a very long and violent juvenile criminal record, starting with six arrests as a 14-year-old. They didn't even learn anything after being shot previously in 2014.
The problem, Joy, is that your son was a danger to society for a very long time.
The problem, Joy, is that your son was a violent human predator on a fast track to murdering someone.
The problem, Joy, is that you are part of a culture that fails to raise your children with any respect for civility, decency, or hard work.
Do you want to find the culprit in your son's death, Joy Stapleton?
Find a mirror, and stare at it very hard.
Former UFC bantamweight champion Holly Holm will open as a slim betting favorite over Germaine de Randamie in the UFC's inaugural featherweight title fight on Feb. 11.
Holm (10-2) will open as a minus-130 favorite to defeat de Randamie (6-3), who opens as a slight plus-100 underdog. The 145-pound female title fight will headline UFC 208 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.
Lines were provided by Nick Kalikas of MMAOddsBreaker.com.
"Holm was a champion boxer, while de Randamie was a multiple-time champion kickboxer," Kalikas said. "Holm is looking to bounce back from a two-fight losing streak and, personally, I think she'll need to use all the tools in their game -- not just them striking.
"De Randamie is just as good of a striker as Holm, if not better, and they possess more finishing power. Holm is the more popular fighter due to their victory over Ronda Rousey, and more public action is expected to come their way, so I'm opening them as a slight favorite."
Holm won the UFC's 135-pound title by knocking out Rousey at UFC 193 in November 2015.  They are 0-2 since, with losses to Miesha Tate and Valentina Shevchenko.
Holm has already stated they hope to win the 145-pound title and then return to 135 pounds to reclaim their old belt, which is now held by Amanda Nunes. They have been favored in all three of their appearances since defeating Rousey.

The Chinese decision to build and dispatch a hospital ship is a leaf right out of the US Navy's soft power playbook.
Every day for a week in early September, US Army soldiers travelled the same 10-mile route between Kinshasa's dilapidated Grand Hotel and the hilltop Congolese military training base overlooking the Democratic Republic of Congo capital. The Americans probably didn't realize it, but the wide, smooth, freshly-paved avenue they used, so incongruous in a city of potholed and unpaved roads, had recently been constructed by a growing rival—China.
The US soldiers were in Congo to help train up their counterparts in the Forces Armees de la Republique Congolese—the Congolese army. The two-week training exercise, organized by the three-year-old US Africa Command, was meant to extend Washington's influence in this rare mineral-rich but unstable Central African country. But Chinese road engineers had already been to Kinshasa to do the same on Beijing's behalf, using somewhat more subtle means.
That China and the United States are in a race to gain sway over countries possessing vital natural resources, not only in Africa but across the developing world, is hardly news. But the scene in Kinshasa—US troops speeding down a Chinese-built road—underscores the differing strategies Washington and Beijing have tended to pursue. While it has fallen on the US military to lead the country's forays into Congo and other mineral-rich nations, most notably Iraq and Afghanistan, China has traditionally preferred underwriting infrastructure projects. Indeed, Chinese engineers are a fixture in developing country outposts as remote as Chad and Somalia.
Yet while the two powers approach the question of influence from different starting points, they are also increasingly overlapping in the way they develop their soft power—particularly in the use of their navies. Both countries have increasingly embraced hybrid military-humanitarian missions that could become more prominent as the US war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down.
Indeed, even as these conflicts raged over the past decade, the US has also been pioneering and developing large-scale soft-power missions, deploying military and civilian medical personnel, engineers and instructors aboard warships and airlifters across Latin America, Africa, the Caucuses, South-east Asia and Oceania. And, after a period of observation and study, China has begun copying the US approach.
Beijing's mimicry represents a tacit endorsement of the US efforts, and also coincides with similar initiatives taking shape in other wealthier nations, including Japan and the Netherlands. The United States has made sure to play an important supporting role in Tokyo's and Amsterdam's initial, modest soft-power missions, with Washington having long viewed soft power as an ideal venue for international cooperation.
Hospital Ships Ahoy!
The most visible soft power instruments are the high-tech hospital ships belonging to the US Navy and the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). In late August, the Chinese ‘Ship 866,' a recent, reduced-scale copy of 20-year-old US hospital ships Comfort and Mercy, embarked on their first major cruise, sailing the Indian Ocean for three months delivering free medical care and training in Djibouti, Kenya, Tanzania, the Seychelles and Bangladesh.
LANSING, MI -- Michigan will extend spousal benefits to some 300 same same-sex couples who were wed on a single day last year when the state's gay marriage ban was temporarily lifted. Republican Gov. Rick Snyder announced Wednesday that they will not appeal
, set to take effect Thursday, requiring the state to recognize marriage licenses issued to same-sex couples on March 22. "The judge has determined that same-sex couples were legally married on that day, and we will follow the law and extend state marriage benefits to those couples," Snyder said in a statement. The legal recognition for those same-sex couples comes as the U.S. Supreme Court
to gay marriage bans in Michigan and other states. Snyder welcomed that review. "I know there are strong feelings on both sides of this issue, and it's vitally important for an expedient resolution that will allow people in Michigan, as well as other states, to move forward together on the other challenges we face," the governor said. A federal judge initially struck down Michigan's gay marriage ban last year, leading several county clerks to open their doors the following day to issue marriage licenses to gay couples who lined up for the historic opportunity. Attorney General Bill Schuette filed an emergency appeal, and the ban was quickly reinstated. The same-sex couples who were married in March "acquired a status that state officials may not ignore absent some compelling interest," U.S. District Court Judge Mark A. Goldsmith wrote last month as they issued their opinion and injunction. "...In these circumstances, what the state has joined together, it may not put asunder." Michigan couples who are legally married can file joint income taxes, adopt children together, enjoy pension benefits and more. In conjunction with the governor's decision not to appeal the federal injunction, spokesperson Dave Murray said Snyder sent word "to all cabinet members directing them to work within their departments to implement the change and extend all necessary benefits and legal recognitions" to the effected couples. Marsha Caspar and Glenna DeJong of Lansing, two of the plaintiffs in the marriage recognition case brought by the ACLU of Michigan, were wed around 8 a.m. on March 22 and are believed to be the
in the state. DeJong, speaking with MLive, said they were pleased by the governor's decision to recognize their marriage but noted that they and their wife are now part of "an exclusive 300 member clubs." "We don't want to be a member of that club," they said. "We want to be part of an inclusive club that includes everybody, all the same-sex couples that want to get married. We've won this little battle, but now it's on to the larger battle before the Supreme Court." Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum, who wed Caspar and DeJong in Mason, applauded Snyder for making what they called "the right decision" to recognize the marriages and afford "these couples the rights they deserve, like all other families under the law. "This is a critical step forward in our fight to secure the freedom to marry for all Michiganders," Byrum said in a statement. Michigan voters approved a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage in 2004, but state and national polls suggest a changing mood in the electorate. The nation's highest court will soon consider whether the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires states to license same-sex marriages or recognize those legally performed elsewhere.

Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE is bustling on a sunny, January day. A few doors down from a natural juice bar greens and purples peek out over the top of a newly constructed building. Bryan Conner's 2011 mural “Nurturing Community” is now barely visible. The two-story building the piece is painted on once faced an empty lot. Now only the edges of the mural are visible, covered by the offices of a construction company.
“Nurturing Community” isn't just some elaborate vandalism. The piece was commissioned by a city program called MuralsDC, founded in 2007 when then-D.C. Councilmember Jim Graham decided public funds would be used to cover up unsightly graffiti. D.C.'s Department of Public Works (DPW) was allotted $100,000 annually to cover up illegal paintings with sanctioned murals.
After two years as a pilot project, the cleaning effort was put in the hands of Nancee Lyons, MuralsDC's coordinator. By the end of 2016, 60 murals had been painted. But things have changed. In the decade since MuralsDC launched, development in D.C. has rapidly shifted the city's classic look and feel. The facades that were once supported by brick and mortar are now adorned with sleek glass and steel. And as construction continues to boom all around the city, it's becoming increasingly difficult to find space to paint. “It dawned on me that a lot of new buildings really didn't have wall space,” Lyons says.
But even if a mural should find a home, it has to fight to survive. Down the street from “Nurturing Community,” one piece was feeling the effects of old age. It was one of MuralsDC's earliest projects, titled “Many Voices Many Beats One City,” which depicts old-school concert posters for acts like D.C. great Chuck Brown. Darrow Montgomery
Cory L. Stowers, one of the mural's designers, has been an artist and graffiti teacher for two decades. Recently, the work had begun to show its age. The colors were sun-bleached, and the paint was chipping. Stower has been refurbishing and reimagining it. “For many of the murals, they only have a lifespan of 10 years,” they say, “especially considering the transition that D.C. is in.”
Stowers began their career painting in the U Street corridor and then taught art to young students. He's been working with MuralsDC since the beginning. At the start, Stowers found themselves in an unfamiliar position: Working with the city was unusual for a man who had spent their years crafting graffiti. But as the years passed, development has affected both their graffiti and murals. Many of their early works in Northwest have disappeared, existing only in photographs.
“There's this communal aspect to the creation of murals,” they say. “It's our contribution to the city. It almost feels like that contribution gets devalued when a work is built over, or the building is destroyed, or even when it's just painted over. It's kind of like that contribution has been wasted because it's no longer there.”
Moreover, the murals appeal to a bigger audience. When it comes to their graffiti, only they and other graffiti artists relate to and appreciate them, they say. But when it comes to murals, each work connects with thousands of people on a daily basis.
“I think the level of connectivity that people have when it's a mural—it's a connection that greatly outweighs the connection they have with graffiti. It's a bigger loss [when it's gone].”

It's a sense of community that Dr. Perry Frank found themselves attracted to decades ago, in 1996. Frank had been living in Washington for 20 years when they realized how many murals were appearing on the the city's walls. Frank viewed these pieces as a kind of puzzle.
“I had been looking at the murals going up in D.C. and thinking, ‘Who did that? What does it mean? Who are they for?' There was very little information about it at that time.”
So they created a place to document the city's mural history: D.C. Murals: Spectacle and Story, a website they still maintain.
Darrow Montgomery One of the earliest murals in town, and one of the first Frank catalogued, was painted on the campus of Howard University in 1968. At the time, protests and student activism energized the campus. The Vietnam War and the Civil Rights Movement had created a desire for more relevant curriculum at Howard. In this climate, art prospered and grew, and that first piece, “Fine Arts,” remained on campus until 1980.
Around the same time, D.C.'s Latino art scene was erupting. “Un Pueblo Sin Murales” is one of the earliest and most recognizable pieces to come out of the era. Devious-looking men gamble in the corner, standing in stark contrast to the surrounding musicians and dancers. The painting, situated on Adams Mill Road NW, has a title featuring some wordplay. Literally, the title means, “a town without murals,” but also suggests, “a town without morals”—perhaps referring to the difference between the gamblers and the dancers.
Frank chronicles the long-eroded murals of yesteryear—pieces lost to construction, repainting, and growth—on their website under a section called “mural graveyard.” It's kind of a grim and ominous title, but they say development and change are forces that shouldn't be feared or demonized. “[A mural] helps commerce because it is an attraction,” they say.
Frank thinks that there should be regulation protecting murals just as regulations protect historic buildings and facades. They don't want the lack of space to become an issue, and she'd prefer to make sure that the art that exists is preserved and maintained.
“Let us not make it a fight between development and art and make it worse than it really is,” they say. “Let's try to come together around this.”
Lyons also tallies their losses. They have a PDF document of the murals she's commissioned that have been destroyed or affected by construction. It's a challenging position they find themselves in: She's trying to find places for art—and making sure public funds are put to good use—but they also have to contend with the fact that murals are impermanent by nature. (Lyons says they require all of the murals they commission last for at least two years.)
“[Murals] mirror the fact that the city and life are always changing,” Lyons says. “It's the reality that we have a changing cityscape, but I would like to see those [murals] that are intended to last be restored periodically so that they can be appreciated by the public.”
Darrow Montgomery
The preservation and future of D.C.'s murals isn't only in the hands of government. In fact, both Frank and Lyons have been in independent discussions with developers about putting murals in when they build, and in 2015, that started to happen.
Nearly two years ago, JBG Companies—a large, regional developer that owns retail, residential, lodging, and office space across D.C., Maryland, and Virginia—began putting murals on its properties. Since then, the company has commissioned at least two dozen murals.
“We really are trying to set a tone for a project and to show the commitment to the building owner and the community,” says Brian Coulter, a managing partner at JBG Companies.
One of the most unconventional projects JBG commissioned was a mural inside its parking garage at its corporate offices in Chevy Chase. According to Coulter, it was a way to make something mundane more exciting and welcoming.
“People drive underground and then typically kind of scurry to find the elevator to get out of the garage to get where they're going,” they say. “We started thinking, ‘There's probably something we can do to improve the arrival experience for visitors when they come into projects or people who are working and living here.'”
The main idea is to create interest and vitality. Coulter says people remembering or noticing their murals is a way to have a positive impact in the community. He, however, disagrees with Frank and doesn't think there is a tangible benefit to putting these murals up. Their company isn't only building in locations with public art, like a mural.
“The projects are advancing and being built, and the incorporation of public art into them isn't what's causing the advance of the project in the first place,” says Coulter. “To me it's a feature, it's something done to bolster and improve the overall execution, but it's not the reason for being of the project”
It's “placemaking,” they say. “People like nice things. People like nice environments” Darrow Montgomery
But that placemaking doesn't always make room for murals. A well-known work on Massachusetts Avenue NW was partially covered by an apartment complex built for JBG. It was a piece by D.C. artist G. Byron Peck dedicated to writer and abolitionist Frederick Douglass. The last remaining visible parts of the piece were covered by sheets of metal. JBG no longer manages the property.
Peck describes their relationship with development companies like JBG as “complicated.”
“It hurts more to walk by a mural being destroyed by backhoes and sledgehammers,” Peck says. “For me it's a rather painful process to witness it. It's rather depressing. But then you say, ‘well I'll just make more murals.'”
Peck has lost many of their pieces to development and time. Still, he's a fan of JBG's mural program. Any art, they say, is good art.
“As long as they don't tear up one of my murals to put one of theirs up,” Peck says. “I wouldn't want to cover up beautiful architecture with a mural if it's not justified.”
Peck has also created murals for JBG—the same company that covered up their work—in Silver Spring.
Coulter asserts that JBG's end goal is the same as that of any other public art project: to better the general community experience. But it's also making Lyons' job a little harder, because they can't find space for them art.
Lyons annual budget of $100,000 for commissions has not changed during the entire decade of the program's existence. Each year, they try to put up or refurbish approximately eight different pieces. The only thing that changes each year is how that money is spent. But the question of spending the same amount of money to potentially create fewer murals does not worry Lyons. “I have found that the construction in the district has not allowed for a lot of wall space, but that doesn't mean things are going to change,” they say.
In addition to repainting and reimagining existing murals like Frank desires—and as Stowers does—artists are exploring methods to ensure the survival of specific pieces of art. A famous portrait of Duke Ellington by Peck, for example, was painted on removable panels. The panels are expensive, made of thin concrete, and the piece is splayed onto slabs with expensive paint that weathers well.
Darrow Montgomery
Unfortunately, the whole process is incredibly costly, and, in the case of Peck's piece, the original structure that held the portable mural can no longer handle its weight. Now Peck is working on printing a large-scale, digital recreation of the piece, but finding a large enough facade to hold it is proving difficult.
“A mural has a better impact on the community when it's sizable,” Lyons says. “The smaller a mural is, the artist's design sometimes gets lost.”
And this concerns them because, for an artist, having a canvas to fill is everything.
“I'm hoping that now it's not a marker for things turning back in the opposite direction,” Lyons says of the way the city's architecture has changed. “It's hard to get really good artists if you don't have really good wall space.”
Lyons says she's discussed asking developers to add mural space to their buildings. They find themselves in the ongoing challenge of fighting for not only the murals that exist, but also the ones that are yet to be installed.
They plan to work on six to eight murals across the city in 2017. Of those, some of the pieces will be refurbished, while others will be newly commissioned. It all comes down to what they can find.
“It's ironic,” they said. “People agree to have murals, but it's harder and harder to find a place to put them.”
Correction: Due to a reporting error, this piece originally named Colbert Kennedy as the artist of the mural "Nurturing Community." The artist is Bryan Conner.

Review
I'm currently in the process of switching all my tech to rechargeable batteries. It was surprising to me how many battery operated electronics I have, as one after another died last month. I replaced batteries in my flashlight, wall clock, alarm clock, wireless keyboard, wireless mouse, thermostat, remotes, and smoke detector. The importance of having a backup battery charger was not lost on me, as my awareness of how much I depend on batteries grew.
The first test was to make sure the charger really recharged batteries and if they would recharge a generic brand of battery. My walkie talkies had generic rechargeable batteries (labeled: CEL). The walkies also showed me how much power was left in the batteries. After letting two walkies drain of power (total of six batteries), I used the GMAG Saltwater Powered Battery Charger. I found it easy to operate, using a funnel to pour in the salt and water. The batteries were completely charged in 5 hours and when placed back in the walkies, showed that they were fully charged. After the recharging was complete, I flushed out the device many times. The flush removed the saltwater and black chunky residue. Throughout the month, I recharged depleted batteries several times using the GMAG charger. It worked well every time. There were only two only minor problems I came across. The first was that one or a couple of the batteries would pop off of the charger but after some finagling, the jumpy battery would stay in place. The second is that I lost one of the plugs for several minutes and wondered if it would still work if the plug could not be found. Overall I was impressed with the quality and function of this product.
Pros
Off-grid charger
Charges AAA, AA, cell phones, & tablets
Inexpensive fuel
Holds 6 batteries
Easy to operate
Potential bartering resource in a crisis
Cons
Funnel not included

Recently, Manchester City played Chelsea in a battle to top the Premier League and best characterized as a catfight involving Louie V handbags filled with diamonds. Ironically, Jose Mourinho complained that Manchester City were spending loads of money, and then stated that UEFA's Financial Fair Play just may not dole out severe enough punishments. Two years ago, a handsome young chap who pens posts at unheralded (but award winning) soccer blog Futfanatico said about Financial Fair Play:
There [is one] simple fact: FFP needs teeth.
As FFP begins to take effect, we'll see just how sharp those teeth can be. I, for one, am cynical. I see three possible outcomes from Financial Fair Play. None of them are pleasant.
First, the big clubs will simply game the system. PSG's allegedly “backward” sponsorship deal shows that rich foreign owners have buddy CEO's' willing to cut checks. The response is that UEFA will look at the “fair market value” of all deals. Here's the problem: with an influx of foreign sugar daddies, the market is skewed. The market is also bipolar – there's clear “haves” and “have nots.” A kit deal for Manchester City is clearly not worth the same as, say, Dynamo Kiev.
This leads to the second possible outcome: everybody follows the rules and, gasp, competitive equity ceases to exist (or totally disappears). The risk is that Financial Fair Play will lock in the existing hierarchies – the winners will keep winning. For example, Chelsea lost 50 million pounds in 2013, but their Champions League winnings allowed them to meet FFP requirements.As long as teams get CL money, they can continue to spend. The Bundesliga is a hugely profitable league, but also has not enjoyed much of a title race in recent years.
At the other end of the spectrum, the upstarts won't get to dream big. This has to deal with the distinction between “debt” and “credit.” Debt is clearly bad on the balance sheet, but credit is useful both to big and small businesses. Big businesses use credit to cover cashflow concerns and keep the machine running. Can't make payroll because a Spanish club is making late payments on a transfer? No worries – take out a short-term loan. Credit is even more important to small clubs because they need it to expand – they eventually maximize revenue from sponsorships and gates, and only be investing in better players can they hope to move up.
Guess what they probably can't do under FFP? (Of course, teams could splurge one year and binge the next.)
Lastly, and most likely, UEFA will do nothing. Rather than having a single strict punishment for offenders, there are nine different ways to dole out pain. From the excellent FinancialFairPlay.co.uk, they are:
Warning Reprimand Fine Deduction of points Withholding of revenue from UEFA competition Prohibition on registering new players in a UEFA competition Restriction on number of players that may be registered Disqualification from a current or future UEFA competition Withdrawal of a title or award
The first two are worthless, and the third one, a fine, could turn FFP into the equivalent of the luxury tax in baseball: a redistributive scheme that makes the rich pay a lot of money, but doesn't really create competitive equity. The restrictions on new players would matter little if there's a delay in punishment, for example, say, you sign four expensive and good players in 2016 to climb the table, they register for UEFA, and then in 2017 you get hid with a prohibition. (I am assuming no prohibition would be retroactive.)
The last two punishments are very severe, which means no important clubs will face them but bankrupt teams from Eastern Europe may get picked on. Here's the major factor that will undermine: UEFA needs big, famous teams to get eyeballs and also needs good players to keep the level of competition high. The bigger concern is that FFP will take credit from the hands of upstarts, foster stasis and lock in place the current oligarchy.
In fact, City released their financials and a maze of “exceptions” means they won't get punished. Yes, a club can lose one hundred million pounds, then fifty million pounds, and still evade serious FFP punishment. Perhaps UEFA should institute a wetnoodle as a 10th possible punishment……

Last week the U.S. Freedom Act was passed by the Senate — aka the first step in reforming the NSA's surveillance programs since Edward Snowden's revelations. The bill shifts bulk harvesting of Americans' phone records to telephone companies, with government intelligence agencies then having to request access via FISA court.
In the wake of U.S. surveillance reform, civil liberty group Privacy International has filed a legal challenge to the GCHQ U.K. intelligence agency's ongoing domestic bulk data collection — which includes telephone records of U.K. citizens and bulk harvesting of other datasets.
The legal complaint has been filed today in the IPT, the court that oversees GCHQ's activities. Earlier this year the IPT ruled GCHQ had acted illegally in sharing data with the NSA, the first such ruling against U.K. intelligence agencies in the court's 15 year history.
In its latest complaint, Privacy International asserts:
The regime governing the acquisition, use, retention, disclosure, storage and deletion
of Bulk Personal Datasets is not sufficiently accessible to the public, nor does it
contain adequate safeguards to provide proper protection against arbitrary conduct.
The context is that Bulk Personal Datasets contain information, which may be
extremely intrusive and sensitive, about very large numbers of people, the majority
of whom are of no legitimate intelligence interest whatsoever
It goes on to note that the existence and use of bulk datasets by U.K. intelligence agencies was only disclosed following a year-long U.K. parliamentary inquiry into domestic spy agencies' operations — itself triggered by the Snowden revelations. And also points out there are currently no legal penalties for the misuse of this information. Yet the parliamentary committee revealed that all U.K. intelligence agencies have dealt with cases of inappropriate access of bulk datasets.
“There is no proper legal regime in place, with no restrictions on which datasets can be collected, how long they can be stored, or accessed. The acquisition and subsequent use of datasets is not authorised by a judge, or even a Minister,” Privacy International notes in a press release today.
It's asking the court to rule that GCHQ's use of bulk personal datasets is unlawful and to order the destruction of any unlawfully obtained material. It also wants the IPT to grant an injunction preventing the intelligence agencies from continuing with bulk collection.
Commenting on the legal action in a statement, Privacy International's deputy director Eric King, condemned GCHQ as acting as if it is “above the law”.
“Secretly ordering companies to hand over their records in bulk, to be data-mined at will, without independent sign off or oversight, is a loophole in the law the size of a double-decker bus,” they said. “The use of these databases, some volunteered, some stolen, some obtained by bribery or coercion, has already been abused, and will continue to be, until the practice is overhauled, and proper protections put in place.
“That the practice started, and continues without a legal framework in place, smacks of an agency who sees itself as above the law. ”
At the time of writing the IPT could not be reached for comment.
Other ongoing legal actions against U.K. intelligence agencies' surveillance activities include challenges to GCHQ's data-sharing activities — Privacy International says it is currently awaiting a final judgement on those cases, and is pursuing a challenge in the European Court of Human Rights against decisions on 5 December 2014 and 6 February 2015. And on unlawful hacking.
On the latter point it emerged last month the U.K. government had quietly amended anti-hacking laws to exempt GCHQ from prosecution, rewriting the Computer Misuse Act on 3 March 2015 without any public debate of the legislative changes.
