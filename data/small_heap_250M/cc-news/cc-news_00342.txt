Enrique Marquez Jr., 25, of Riverside, Calif., is accused of purchasing the assault rifles used in the San Bernardino terrorist attack, and has agreed to plead guilty to federal criminal charges.
Benjamin Gottlieb of member station KCRW tells our Newscast unit:
In his plea, Marquez admits that his friend, Syed Rizwan Farook, paid him for the assault rifles used to kill 14 people and injure 22 others in December of 2015. That's when Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik opened fire at a holiday party of Farook's coworkers at the Inland Regional Center. Marquez also admits he conspired with Farook in 2011 and 2012 to attack Riverside City College (RCC) — as well as commuter traffic on a major freeway in Southern California. Those plans never materialized.
U.S. Attorney Eileen Decker said, "While his earlier plans to attack a school and a freeway were not executed, the planning clearly laid the foundation for the 2015 attack on the Inland Regional Center."
Prosecutors say there is no evidence that Marquez participated in the San Bernardino attack or had advance knowledge about it.
He did acknowledge that he was a "straw buyer" when he purchased two high-powered rifles used in the San Bernardino attack.
According to a Justice Department statement:
"Straw purchasers are criminals who are the beginning of the chain of violence in our country," said ATF Special Agent in Charge Eric D. Harden. "It is purchases like Marquez's that led to the terror on that tragic day in San Bernardino. The crime goes beyond making a false statement on a government form. It puts guns in the hands of criminals who will victimize the community. In this case, the straw purchase is as reprehensible as the attack."
Mandy Pifer, whose boyfriend Shannon Johnson was killed in the terror attack, told The Associated Press that Marquez's plea agreement brought mixed emotions:
"It's a hell of a day to come out, Valentine's Day," the 42-year-old Los Angeles resident said. "I'm relieved that it won't be a long trial. If it'll be finished sooner, I'm all for it." She said she planned to speak at Marquez's sentencing about the impact her boyfriend's killing has had on her. In his last moments, Johnson huddled with a colleague under a table, shielding her from the bullets. "It is what it is," she said. "Nothing's going to bring him back."
Marquez is expected to formally enter his guilty pleas Thursday morning.
He has been in custody since he was ordered detained at his initial court appearance in this case on Dec. 17, 2015.
Marquez faces up to 25 years in federal prison.

Organizers of a newsroom union at the Chicago Tribune have informed its publisher that colleagues have already given such overwhelming formal support for their effort that the paper's parent company should recognize the guild voluntarily and start to negotiate a contract.
The organizers gave the Tribune's parent company, Tronc, a day to make a decision.
According to a letter from the Chicago Tribune Guild organizing committee obtained by NPR, the nascent union has received signed union authorization cards from more than 85 percent of staffers who would fall under the bargaining unit.
"Voluntary recognition would allow us to begin contract negotiations, saving the company the cost and inconvenience of a campaign and an election that will result overwhelmingly in our favor," read the letter, sent Tuesday morning to Bruce Dold, the Tribune's editor and publisher. This story will be updated with any reaction from the Tribune and Tronc.
It is quite a turnaround in fortunes for unions at Tronc, which comes from a strong anti-union background. Historically, the Tribune and its corporate owners took a strong stance against unions at the paper and in society more broadly.
More recently, Tronc fought fiercely for months against unionizing efforts at the Tribune's larger sister paper, the Los Angeles Times, yet lost badly in a lopsided vote held in January. Tronc, then controlled by Chicago investor Michael Ferro, announced it would sell the Times and The San Diego Union-Tribune less than three weeks later. That sale, to Southern California billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, is expected to go through in coming weeks.
Ferro is now gone from the company. He sold his controlling minority stake to McCormick Media — controlled primarily by Sargent M. McCormick-Collier, a relative of the legendary late Col. Robert McCormick who ran the Tribune and built it into a multi-platform staff.
"If the company does not recognize the Chicago Tribune Guild, we will file the signature cards tomorrow with the National Labor Relations Board, and an election will be scheduled," the organizing committee wrote in a separate note to staffers.
The Tribune's parent company, Tronc, and its corporate predecessor, Tribune, have suffered severe financial setbacks, some of them self-inflicted. That has in turn led to waves of layoffs, buyouts and cutbacks. The Chicago Tribune newsroom is perhaps a third as large as it was at its height.
In the years since it was rechristened Tronc, the company has been beset by additional controversy and internal crises, starting with a frenetic branding effort around digital innovation. In Los Angeles, the Times's new publisher, Ross Levinsohn, was sidelined by questions raised over past workplace misconduct (he took a leave and became Tronc's chief executive over its digital activities). The LA Times' new editor-in-chief, Lewis D'Vorkin, sparked a newsroom mutiny over his conversations with Disney over coverage and with his accusations that his journalists have been disloyal. He was shifted over to the digital unit in February and left the company earlier this month.
The company created an uproar with plans to create a large separate digital newsroom that would have generated a vast new output of online content outside the company's newspapers, including the Chicago Tribune, the LA Times, the Baltimore Sun, South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Hartford Courant, and other big metro dailies.
A senior Chicago Tribune editor, Metro Editor Mark Jacob, announced on April 5 he was leaving the company and tweeted: "... owners and managers of media companies must embrace a mission of journalism as public service, invest in their people and show bravery and independence. Our democracy depends on it."
Some digital newsrooms and smaller newspapers have been seeking union representation as well. Union efforts recently have popped up at some surprising newsrooms — including the digital outlet Mic, the satiric publication The Onion, the Casper (Wyoming) Star-Tribune, and the Missoula, Mont., Independent.
If the union is recognized by Tronc voluntarily, or wins it in a vote overseen by federal labor regulators, the guild would represent about 280 nonmanagement employees at the Tribune, its sister Spanish-language daily, Hoy, the entertainment-oriented tabloid RedEye and four suburban publications.
Target is buying a delivery logistics company to help it offer same-day delivery service to in-store shoppers. (Photo: Alan Diaz / AP file)
New York — Target said Monday it is buying a delivery logistics company to help it offer same-day delivery service to in-store shoppers.
Software made by San Francisco-based Grand Junction connects retailers with about 700 delivery companies around the country that pick up items from stores or distribution centers and take them to customers.
Expanding delivery and making it faster have been key areas for retailers trying to attract convenience-seeking shoppers. Target and Walmart have adjusted their shipping programs as they try to lure online shoppers away from Amazon.
Target's latest move is aimed not at online shoppers, but at making buying an easier decision for in-store shoppers. The company has been working with Grand Junction to test same-day delivery at a New York store. Shoppers there can ask to have heavy bags, a sofa or anything else delivered that day for a fee, that's calculated based on time and location. Target plans to expand the service to other New York locations this year, and then bring it to other major cities next year. The company said it eventually plans to use the software to offer faster deliveries for online orders.
Target Corp. said Grand Junction will become a part of the company's technology unit and said Grand Junction will stop working with other retailers when those contracts end.
Minneapolis-based Target did not say how much it will pay for Grand Junction.

Show Recap –
No fantastic results. Valiosa was tense in the indoor warmup. Never released over her back. Very worried in the main large indoor during the first test.
Two judges in the first ride, one which gave us a qualified score, but the other didn't see any harmony.
Blurry little video-capture from home. She can be awesome then.
In the second test, possibly even more tense warmup in another new indoor, with some background thunder rolling by. A steam train in the actual test, which was in an additional different indoor. A qualified score in that test too, but truly, it was low and our worst performances to date.
Summary: tight, worried, harried. Pretty good canter lengthenings – she's really improved there!
Overall, it's clear she can't roll in for just one day. Some more rides there would have made for a more even playing field.
Trot lengthenings CAN happen, but only at home. 🙂
My mare, who has started to feel more soft and willing at home never once let her guard down. With this, I'm rethinking everything – she's going to have only relaxing work for some time. (And actually nothing for a whole week as she seemed off on a hind today – vet check in a few days.)
Showing should be fun, for both, it's not negotiable. Didn't like the look in her eye. To keep doing it now, would mean only doing it for the rider. And that's not why we ever got started.
Pictures from one of the tests coming up!
“We are keeping the family and loved ones in our thoughts.”
“We are deeply saddened to learn of ‎the tragic suicide of a young person at Wapekeka First Nation last night,” said Trell Huether, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Children and Youth Services, in a statement released Wednesday evening.
The three girls were all part of a suicide pact, the community says.
Jenera Roundsky was found dead Tuesday at the local hockey rink in Wapekeka, less than six months after the community lost Jolynn Winter and her friend Chantell Fox, who died by suicide two days apart.
For the third time this year, an Indigenous community in northwestern Ontario is mourning over the suicide of a 12-year-old girl.
“Working with our Indigenous partners, we are committed to reducing the high rate of suicide among Indigenous youth through systems changes that are culturally-appropriate, focused on prevention and access to appropriate interventions and mental health supports as close to home as possible.”
The ministry is working closely with Nishnawbe Aski Nation and others to provide support to the community, Huether said.
Wapekeka is a community of almost 400 people located about 450 kilometres northeast of Sioux Lookout.
Following the deaths of Winter and Fox in January, the community, which had also faced a suicide crisis in the 1990s, was concerned more children would try to take their own lives.
A crisis team flew to Wapekeka in the aftermath of the tragedy. Four girls who were considered to be in crisis were flown out of the community, and 26 other youths were considered at high risk for suicide.
Six months earlier, Wapekeka had asked Health Canada for $380,000 in funding to help address youth mental health issues, concerned that a group of young people had entered into a suicide pact, but Health Canada denied the funding.
The federal department said it was an “awkward” time for their budget, Joshua Frogg, a Wapekeka band spokesperson and Fox's uncle, said in January.
“Awkward? It was awkward for us to bury two young children in the middle of the winter, in -30, -40 degree weather,” he said at a January news conference on Parliament Hill, where chiefs called for a national suicide strategy.
Nishnawbe Aski Nation Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler and Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde called for a national suicide strategy to address the high rates of suicide Indigenous communities across northern Ontario have dealt with for years.
Between 1986 and 2016, there were more than 500 suicides across the 49 First Nations represented by Nishnawbe Aski Nation. More than 70 of those deaths were children aged 10 to 14, 200 were aged 15 to 20.
In January, Health Canada spokesperson Eric Morrissette said funding had been identified to help Wapekeka and the federal department was working to “support the community's vision for youth mental health programming.”
Later that month, a private donor committed to give Wapekeka $380,000 to cover the mental health supports Health Canada had previously denied them.
Since the community's loss at the beginning of this year, the province has also been working with the community and others to “identify needs and help coordinate the response for additional supports and investments,” Huether said.
“We have also worked with Right To Play and other organizations to bring youth programming to the community, including throughout the summer months.”
Wapekeka has a history of trauma. It was one of the communities targeted by convicted pedophile Ralph Rowe, who is alleged to have sexually abused hundreds of boys across northern Ontario over two decades.
Rowe was a former Boy Scout leader and Anglican minister.
Halep fights back in delayed opener, Kvitova into last 32
Paris, May 30 (AFP) World number one Simona Halep battled back after a disastrous opening set to beat Alison Riske 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 in their delayed French Open first-round match today, while Petra Kvitova impressed in reaching round three.
Halep, the runner-up in Paris in 2014 and 2017, slumped 0-5 down in the opening set to world number 83 Riske whose only win at the tournament came in 2014.
The Romanian committed 16 unforced errors in the set but stepped up a gear from that point on to book a second-round match against Taylor Townsend of the United States.
"It's always difficult in the first round of a Grand Slam, you are always nervous," said Halep.
"But I started to run more, played better and kept more balls in play." The 26-year-old, who is still looking for a first Grand Slam title, will play for the second straight day on Thursday, after the match with Riske was pushed back from Tuesday due to rain.
"I think I'll be ready tomorrow, I feel strong in my legs," said the top seed.
"Anything can happen with the rain so all we can do is rest and try to be at our best when we step on the court." Halep needs to reach the semi-finals or better if she is to retain the world top spot.
- Kvitova marches on -
======================
Eighth seed Kvitova eased into the third round with a 6-0, 6-4 victory over Spain's Lara Arruabarrena on Court One.
The two-time Wimbledon champion has now won 13 consecutive matches on clay after claiming titles in Prague and Madrid, and will face Estonia's 25th seed Anett Kontaveit for a place in the last 16.
Czech Kvitova has not reached the quarter-finals at Roland Garros since a run to the last four in 2012.
The 28-year-old raced through the opening set in only 24 minutes, and although she was pegged back after an early break in the second, a booming forehand sealed victory with a third straight game.
Ukrainian fourth seed Elina Svitolina reached the last 32 for the fourth consecutive year by brushing aside Viktoria Kuzmova in straight sets.
The 23-year-old, who arrived in Paris having won her second straight Italian Open title, saw off her Slovakian opponent 6-3, 6-4.
Svitolina, a two-time quarter-finalist at Roland Garros, will take on Romanian 31st seed Mihaela Buzarnescu in the last 32.
Elsewhere, charismatic Japanese 21st seed Naomi Osaka came through a tight match with Kazakhstan's Zarina Diyas 6-4, 7-5.
The 20-year-old Osaka is seeded for the first time at a major tournament, having lifted the prestigious Indian Wells title earlier this year before beating Serena Williams in Miami the following week.
Williams, who made her Grand Slam return with a single win on Tuesday, is back in action in the doubles with sister Venus later today
NEW YORK — Didi Gregorius had another big game at Yankee Stadium with a two-run homer and three RBIs, and Gary Sanchez homered twice to help CC Sabathia and New York romp past the Minnesota Twins yet again, 8-3 on Tuesday night.
Aaron Judge hit his seventh home run as the Yankees went deep four times for the second straight night. Gleyber Torres had a pair of hits and his first RBI for New York, which extended a winning streak to four for the first time under new manager Aaron Boone and sent the Twins to their season-worst fifth consecutive loss.
A night after a 14-1 drubbing, New York beat Minnesota for the sixth straight time and improved to 27-9 against the Twins at new Yankee Stadium, including the playoffs. Judge was a triple short of the cycle and Gregorius also had three hits.
Sabathia (1-0) rarely allowed hard contact in his second start back from the disabled list and gave up an unearned run and two hits in six innings. He is 20-9 in 39 regular-season starts against the Twins.
Gregorius hit an RBI single for a 2-1 lead in the third and pulled a changeup just inside the right-field foul pole and into the second deck for a 5-1 margin in the fifth. All eight of his home runs and 23 of his 27 RBIs this year have come at home. Babe Ruth (1921) and Alex Rodriguez (2007) are the only other Yankees with that many homers and RBIs in the first 22 games.
Jose Berrios (2-2) entered with 14 consecutive scoreless innings and had 29 strikeouts and one walk in his first four outings. He allowed five runs, six hits and two walks in four-plus innings, raising his ERA from 1.63 to 2.84.
Dellin Betances entered with a 5-1 lead in the sixth but lasted just four batters, giving up a pair of walks, a hit and another unearned run. David Robertson pitched out of two-on, one-out trouble by striking out Ehire Adrianza and retiring pinch-hitter Joe Mauer on a comebacker.
Judge led off the bottom half with a loud, opposite-field drive to right off Tyler Duffey, who was brought up from the minors before the game for his season debut. Judge became the fastest in major league history to hit 63 career home runs, doing it in 203 games, four fewer than Mark McGwire.
Sanchez, whose second-inning home run tied the score, hit a two-run drive later in the seventh into the netting above Monument Park in centre. Judge, arms crossed, gave Sanchez the silent treatment in the dugout before smiling and giving Sanchez a hug.
Errors by Judge in right, Neil Walker at first, Torres while covering first and Betances raised the Yankees' total to 22 in 22 games, tied for the major league lead.

A 92-YEAR-OLD US woman shot her son dead because he planned to put her in a nursing home when she became "difficult to live with", reports said.
Anna Mae Blessing reportedly told her 72-year-old son, "You took my life, so I'm taking yours" moments after she gunned him down at their Arizona home.
Blessing, who has been charged with murder, reportedly told police she'd intended to take her own life, too.
The elderly woman was in a wheelchair at her initial court appearance on Tuesday where her bail was set at $US500,000 ($680,000) and a lawyer was being appointed to represent her.
Arizona police said Blessing's 72-year-old son was found dead on Monday at his home in Fountain Hills, located about 50 kilometres northeast of Phoenix.
The man's name wasn't immediately released.
Blessing had been living with her son and his girlfriend for about six months, according to court records, and the elderly woman had reportedly become worried that the pair were plotting to move her into a home.

She told authorities that she argued with her son on Monday morning over the way she was being treated and was upset with him for stating that he was going to put her in a nursing home.
Blessing told police she got out two guns, which she said she has had since the 1970s - one bought at a gun store and the other obtained from her late husband. She told police she hadn't fired either since the 1970s.
She concealed two pistols in the pockets of her bathrobe before confronting her son in his bedroom and firing multiple shots at him with one handgun, records show.
She reportedly turned the gun on her son's 57-year-old girlfriend but after a struggle the woman was able to wrestle it out of her hands.

She also managed to get the second gun away from the 92-year-old.
The unidentified woman called authorities and Blessing was located on a recliner in the home and taken into custody.
Blessing told police she had wanted to kill herself but was out of weapons.
When detectives asked her what she thought should happen to her she replied she "should be put to sleep as a result of her actions".
The woman also tried to shoot her son's girlfriend. Picture: Maricopa County Sheriff's Office
Sheriff Paul Penzone said police had been called out to at least one other case of domestic violence involving Blessing and her son but could not give further details.
"It is always concerning when domestic issues escalate to violence or tragic outcomes," Penzone told a local TV station. "They are often isolated and neither predictable nor preventable."
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) – An Ohio man accused of plowing his car into counter-protesters at a white nationalist rally in Virginia is set to make his first court appearance.
Col. Martin Kumer, superintendent at the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, says 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. has a bond hearing Monday morning.
Fields is charged with second-degree murder and other counts after authorities say he drove into the crowd, fatally injuring one woman and hurting 19 others.
RELATED: Violence erupts in demonstrations in Charlottesville, VA
Fields has been in custody since Saturday. Jail officials told The Associated Press they don't know if he's obtained an attorney.
A high school teacher said Fields was fascinated with Nazism, idolized Adolf Hitler and had been singled out by school officials in the 9th grade for his “deeply held, radical” convictions on race.

Gina Rinehart's bold farm sector expansion plans didn't stop with the $365 million purchase of the S.Kidman and Company beef business in 2016.
The mining magnate turned beef cattle queen, has also thrown her support behind a high-tech fertiliser mining and processing project in the UK.
Two months ago, while Mrs Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting joint venture Australian Outback Beef (AOB) was making headlines in a bidding tussle for the Kidman business, she was also pumping almost $400m into a $5 billion phosphate mine being built 1500 metres under the North Yorkshire moors.
The mine, due to start production next year, is no ordinary phosphate extraction operation.
Not far from the historic port town of Whitby, it sits on the world's largest known reserves of the high grade potash, polyhalite, a valuable mix of potassium, calcium, magnesium and sulphur.
The mine and a processing site will be linked by a 37 kilometre underground conveyor system taking mined rock direct to the coast where it will be crushed, prilled and sent via another enclosed conveyor to the port.
Hancock Prospecting has acquired about $70m worth of shares in the London Stock Exchange-listed company developing the venture, Sirius Minerals.
Sirius is led by several Australian executives with mining and finance backgrounds.
Hancock has also bought the rights to five per cent of the royalties from the first 13 million tonnes produced from the Sirius mine and then 1pc of its royalties for the next 70 years.
Additionally Mrs Rinehart has rights to buy 20,000 tonnes of granulated polyhalite shipped from Sirius Minerals' processing plant at Teesside.
“This project delivers a new and natural product which is relevant to Hancock's focus on agriculture,” Mrs Rinehart said.
“It has potential to become one of the world's leading producers of multi-nutrient fertiliser and could have a life of 100 years.
“This fits with my approach to investing in strategic areas for the long-term and I hope the product will be of assistance to other Australian farmers, too.”
Polyhalite, to be sold under the trademark Poly4, is promoted as improving key mineral absorption efficiency of plants, resulting in heavier seed set and yields.
Poly4 has been the focus of years of agronomy trials in the UK and Africa on a range of crops from corn and soybeans to canola and high value vegetables.
Sirius managing director and Australian expatriate, Chris Fraser, said given Mrs Rinehart's expertise in both mining and agriculture, her investment in the company's patented fertiliser product and production plans was a significant vote of confidence.
Sirius expects to ramp up production from an initial 10m tonnes a year in 2018 to 13m tonnes (subject to development approvals) and eventually 20m tonnes by 2024.
The company has other buyers lined up in Europe, Central America, Africa, and China, which is set to take about a third of its projected output.
Hancock chief executive officer, Garry Korte, said the strong investment fundamentals behind the project, including the need to feed the world's growing population and help boost farmland efficiency, had prompted his company to invest in the innovative Poly4 product.
Sirius Minerals was Hancock's first major overseas investment.
The natural fertiliser business would provide a useful value-add to Mrs Rinehart's expanding agricultural holdings.
Last year proved a busy one for Hancock's farm sector investment push, concluding in late December with Mrs Rinehart visiting the Adelaide offices of Kidman and Company, now officially part of AOB, the partnership with 33pc Chinese shareholder Shanghai CRED.
Accepting an S. Kidman and Co branding iron from managing director, Greg Campbell, to mark her visit, Mrs Rinehart noted a century ago Sir Sidney Kidman and her grandfather, James Nicholas, had run business interests together.
“My mother thought very, very highly of her father, and I can't help but feel she would be very happy our company has taken this historic step,” Mrs Rinehart said.
“We will build on this historic legacy as we plan to increase productivity and further invest to grow the iconic brand.”
AOB has acquired two thirds, or about 77,000 square kilometres of the Kidman company's outback beef estate which went on the market in April 2015 sparking public debate and friction over the sale decision within the Kidman family.
Hancock Beef's own cattle property assets, which already included holdings in Western Australia and central NSW, further expanded in 2016 with the purchase of Northern Territory properties “Riveren” and “Inverway” from short-lived Indonesian investors, and “Phoenix Park”.
Hancock's ambition to be a leading Wagyu beef producer gained pace with its purchase of 1500 Wagyu cattle from globally respected northern Victorian breeder, David Blackmore.
Meanwhile, Mrs Rinehart has forecast her interest in WA-based, Bannister Downs Dairy, would result in a new processing centre by 2018.
Initial construction work for the combined dairy, creamery and tourist facility has already begun.
The proposed 5000 square metre integrated building will showcase milking, processing, packaging and dispatch operations to visitors from an enclosed second-storey public viewing gallery.
LAS VEGAS -- After five days of scouring the life of Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock and chasing 1,000 leads, investigators confessed Friday they still don't know what drove him to mass murder, and they announced plans to put up billboards appealing for the public's help.
In their effort to find any hint of his motive, investigators were looking into whether he was with a prostitute days before the shooting, scrutinizing cruises he took and trying to make sense of a cryptic note with numbers jotted on it found in his hotel room, a federal official said.
So far, examinations of Paddock's politics, finances, any possible radicalization and his social behavior -- typical investigative avenues that have helped uncover the motive in past shootings -- have turned up little.
"We still do not have a clear motive or reason why," Clark County Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said. "We have looked at literally everything."
The FBI announced that billboards would go up around the city asking anyone with information to phone 800-CALL-FBI.
"If you know something, say something," said Aaron Rouse, agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office. "We will not stop until we have the truth."
Paddock, a reclusive 64-year-old high-stakes gambler, rained bullets on the crowd at a country music festival Sunday night from his 32nd-floor hotel suite, killing 58 and wounding hundreds before taking his own life.
McMahill said investigators had reviewed voluminous video from the casino and don't think Paddock had an accomplice in the shooting, but they want to know if anyone knew about his plot beforehand.
Investigators believe Paddock hired a prostitute in the days leading up to the shooting and were interviewing other call girls for information, a U.S. official briefed by federal law enforcement officials said. The official wasn't authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
The official also disclosed that Paddock took at least a dozen cruises abroad in the last few years, most of them with his girlfriend, Marilou Danley. At least one sailed to the Middle East.
It is unusual to have so few hints of a motive five days after a mass shooting. In previous mass killings or terrorist attacks, killers left notes, social media postings and information on a computer -- or even phoned police.
"The lack of a social media footprint is likely intentional," said Erroll Southers, director of homegrown violent extremism studies at the University of Southern California. "We're so used to, in the first 24 to 48 hours, being able to review social media posts. If they don't leave us a note behind or a manifesto behind, and we're not seeing that, that's what's making this longer."
What officers have found is that Paddock planned his attack meticulously.
He requested an upper-floor room overlooking the festival, stockpiled 23 guns, a dozen of them modified to fire continuously like an automatic weapon, and set up cameras inside and outside his room to watch for approaching officers.
In a possible sign he was contemplating massacres at other sites, he also booked rooms overlooking the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago in August and the Life Is Beautiful show near the Vegas Strip in late September, according to authorities reconstructing his movements leading up to the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.
Las Vegas gunman may have scoped out other music festivals
His arsenal also included tracer rounds that can improve a shooter's firing accuracy in the dark, a law enforcement official told AP. It wasn't clear whether Paddock fired any of the illuminated bullets during the high-rise massacre.
Paddock bought 1,000 rounds of the .308-caliber and .223-caliber tracer ammunition from a private buyer he met at a Phoenix gun show, a law enforcement official not authorized to comment on the investigation said on condition of anonymity.
Tracer rounds illuminate their path so a gunman can home in on targets at night. But they can also give away the shooter's position.
Video shot of the pandemonium that erupted when Paddock started strafing the festival showed a muzzle flash from his room at the Mandalay Bay resort, but bullets weren't visible in the night sky.
Investigators are looking into Paddock's mental health and any medications he was on, McMahill said.
His girlfriend, Danley, told FBI agents Wednesday that she had not noticed any changes in his mental state or indications he could become violent, the federal official said.
Paddock sent Danley on a trip to her native Philippines before the attack, and she was unaware of his plans and devastated when she learned of the carnage while overseas, she said in a statement.

Detroit – A cooperating FBI witness in the Macomb County corruption scandal, who helped secure charges against others in the case, died Wednesday, two days after being released on bond.
Former Washington Township public works superintendent Steven Hohensee died of apparent natural causes, Shelby Township Deputy Police Chief Mark Coil said. The impact on the widespread corruption case, which has led to 16 people being charged with crimes, was unclear Friday.
Hohensee, 61, of Shelby Township died two days after a federal magistrate released him on $10,000 unsecured bond. The married father of four was charged in July with accepting $10,000 in bribes from a confidential FBI source – a 10-year felony – and was expected to plead guilty.
The Macomb County Medical Examiner's Office could not be reached for comment immediately Friday.
Hohensee's lawyer also did not respond to a message seeking comment Friday.
Hohensee's death is the latest development in a wide-ranging scandal involving public officials pocketing bribes in exchange for approving municipal contracts with Sterling Heights trash hauler Rizzo Environmental Services and a towing company.
Hohensee's role in the investigation became more clear this fall as others charged in the scandal reached plea deals with the government.
Former Macomb County Public Works Department chief engineer James Pistilli and engineer Paulin Modi conspired to pay Hohensee a $2,000 bribe in 2014, prosecutors allege.
Hohensee, however, was cooperating with the FBI at the time.
Pistilli, 68, of Holly, and Modi, 48, of Troy, have since reached plea deals and are awaiting sentencing in federal court.
A third man, paving contractor Christopher Sorrentino, struck a plea deal Wednesday – the same day Hohensee died – and admitted delivering $66,000 in kickbacks to a Macomb Township official. That official is township Trustee Dino Bucci, The Detroit News has learned.

Chris Spence, the former education director of the Toronto District School Board who had his teaching licence revoked in 2016, has successfully appealed the matter on the grounds that his “precarious” mental state was not adequately accounted for, according to a Divisional Court decision on Wednesday obtained by the Star. The linchpin of the Spence's appeal is that the Ontario College of Teachers' Discipline Committee didn't “consider the totality of the medical evidence describing (Spence's) mental health” when it did not grant a second hearing adjournment — an issue of denying procedural fairness, a judge ruled.

Spence had been found guilty of professional misconduct and was stripped of his teaching licence because of plagiarism. In a written statement to the Star, the Ontario College of Teachers said it “will complete a thorough and thoughtful review of the decision to determine an appropriate course of action, which could include a new hearing to consider the matter,” a spokesperson said. One of Spence's lawyers, Christopher Edwards, told the Star he was pleased the committee's decision was quashed. “There was a lot of medical evidence that he was dealing with what we might call the perfect storm,” he said, adding that Spence is not in “any position” to speak with the press.

“He's emotional and very pleased, very happy that the Divisional Court agreed with his view that he was denied procedural fairness,” Edwards said. Spence's plagiarism scandal began with accusations that he had borrowed passages for an opinion piece he wrote for the Star in January 2013. More accusations came, however, including claims that he had used other people's work in his speeches and books as well his doctoral thesis. Earlier this year, a University of Toronto appeals tribunal upheld an earlier decision to strip him of his PhD. Regarding his teaching licence, the discipline committee's orders between November 2016 and February 2017 have been “set aside” and the issue has been sent back to it for a new hearing, the Divisional Court decision says. Spence's family doctor had provided a medical note to the committee in May 2016, ahead of a hearing, notifying the college that he should not participate in proceedings and would partake in a psychiatric assessment. While the committee had agreed to the initial adjournment in 2016, a second one, sought later that year, was refused. The 10-page report produced by psychiatrist Dr. Ahmed Jehaan Illyas described Spence's symptoms, including depression and suicidal ideation, related to the evaporation of his marriage and career, which “significantly impacted his functioning.”
Dr. Illyas diagnosed Spence with major depressive disorder, the decision says. “Feels his mood has been down since and he doesn't get any joy out of life anymore, feels consumed by the stress of his loss,” states a portion of the report included in the decision, further noting that Spence feels “he was at rock bottom.” A day before the hearing commenced in October 2016, Spence, according to the decision, had written to the college that “(D)ue to my unstable mental health my doctor has advised me not to participate in any disciplinary proceedings as it is a trigger for deterioration of my mental health. Thank you for your continued compassion.”
Article Continued Below
The hearing reconvened without him or any representative, the decision states. “The Discipline Committee found that a further adjournment was ‘not supported by the evidence presented by (Spence)' ” and wouldn't serve the public's interest in a timely hearing on the matter, the college had written. Further, the College searched online and determined that Spence held a job helping youth in Chicago, which was “inconsistent with a claim that (Spence) was unable to attend the hearing.” That the internet search was not divulged to Spence was also unfair to him, the decision says.

The grieving mum of a baby girl who died after choking at nursery has shared a powerful video about her mental health battles since losing her daughter.
Joanne Thompson lost her daughter Millie in 2012 and has spoken out to urge other sufferers to seek help and not struggle in silence.
In her video, which she shared as part of this week's Time to Talk Day from the mental health charity Mind, she talks of how she has had therapy and medication since losing Millie when she was just nine months old, reports the Manchester Evening News.
Following Millie's death, after she choked on food at nursery, Joanne was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety and complex grief.

After a time off medication, the 32-year-old has been struggling again, and has just been prescribed anti-depressants.
She used her vlog to highlight how easy it is for depression to be an invisible illness.
She said: "You can't see when people have got mental health problems...
"Would you be able to tell from me talking now - the way I look, the way I'm talking - that right now I've got a prescription in my pocket for antidepressants that the doctor gave me."
(Image: MEN Media)
In the emotional vlog she describes how she's come to terms with the need to take them again - for the sake of her children, Leo, two, and 13-week-old Asher.
"These two little people really need their mum right now," she said. "And they need me to be as good a mum as I can be."
Joanne, 32, from Cheadle Hulme, has had a massive response to the video, which has been viewed on Facebook more than 20k times.
She said: "I wanted to support the #timetotalk awareness campaign as I am a huge advocate of talking about mental health.

"Through my journey I have found that talking is an amazing therapy to remind you that you are not alone in what is happening to you and there are people available to help and people who have been on a similar journey that can guide you through it.
"Talking is an essential part of therapy to help you live a happy and healthy life when you have a mental health problem, there shouldn't be a stigma attached to it anymore and the more people that talk about it, the more that stigma will fade."
Following Millie's death Joanne and husband Dan set up charity Millie's Trust to teach paediatric first aid.
Jo, who also writes her own blog, Same Person, Different Me , said she'd been blown away by the response to her video.
She said: "The post has had an amazing response and I've already had a message from a lady telling me it helped her to call her doctor yesterday."

CALGARY—The federal government may have paid too much for Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipeline, but a petroleum marketing expert says taxpayers will be able to recoup the forecast $11-billion investment if the project can be completed on schedule and under budget. Analysts with Royal Bank say Justin Trudeau's Liberals are paying a premium of approximately $1.2 billion for the existing link from Alberta to the B.C. coast and the engineering plans for an expansion that will nearly triple the pipeline's capacity.

But the $4.5-million price Ottawa agreed to pay the Houston-based company and the estimated $6.4-million cost of constructing the additional link would be offset by what Moody's Investors Service estimates will be gross earnings of $1.3 billion a year once the combined pipeline is operating. “If Kinder Morgan could get this project built on time without major cost overruns, it would be a very valuable stretch of pipeline,” says Richard Masson, a fellow with the University of Calgary's policy school and former head of the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission. “They decided the risk was out of whack and they backed away.”

While Ottawa has said it wants to put the pipeline back in private hands before the deal closes this summer by offering to indemnify any future owner against losses due to delays caused by other levels of government, Masson said he can't see any companies reaching for their chequebooks. “The guarantees from the feds and the additional $2 billion from Alberta are too nebulous,” he said. “It's very difficult to imagine anyone else stepping up where Kinder Morgan feared to tread.” While Masson believes the federal government can recoup its money in a sale after the expanded pipeline is operational, advocacy groups on both sides of the political spectrum are skeptical the deal is financially prudent. Aaron Wudrick, federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, admits Ottawa is trying to make lemonade from lemons after Kinder Morgan balked last month at proceeding with the project, but he worries the same hurdles remain now for the federal government.
“The main obstacles to this deal have always been political, not economic,” Wudrick said. “The fact that the government owns the project now isn't going to keep protesters from padlocking themselves to bulldozers to stop construction. In fact, it might make them even angrier.”

David Hughes, a former federal government scientist and research expert with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, disputes Ottawa's and Alberta's claim that delays in constructing the pipeline are costing Canada $15 billion a year. Hughes says the difference between the discounted price Alberta producers get for oilsands bitumen and the value sweet crude attracts in the United States is due entirely to the additional cost of refining the product and transporting it to market. “It's a completely bogus claim, based on false rhetoric,” he said.

Singapore police said on Saturday that a 27-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of cheating by impersonation. The authorities said in a press release that officers from the Ang Mo Kio Police Division arrested the duo at Rivervale Crescent on Thursday.
On Dec 13, 2017, a store reported that someone had redeemed gift vouchers using e-vouchers that were later found to be invalid. "They were found in possession of several identity cards including forged identity cards," the police said.
According to the police, both the suspects could be involved in a series of cheating by impersonation incidents. The media release stated that they have used forged cards to apply for handphone lines with telecommunications companies.
On Saturday, the suspects will be charged for conspiracy to commit cheating by impersonation. The authorities said that the if the suspects are convicted, they may be jailed up to five years, fined or both.
However, cases of impersonation are not new in the country. On Jan 27, two Taiwanese men, who were suspected of impersonating China officials in a scam, were arrested by the police. The authorities said the suspects aged 27 and 22, had allegedly cheated a woman of S$32,000.
Last year in July, another Taiwanese man was arrested for alleged involvement in a scam involving impersonation of police. A 55-year-old woman received a call from an unknown person who claimed to be a police officer.
In May 2017, the police had arrested two men aged 22 and 32, for allegedly impersonating police and scamming victims, one of whom lost S$50,000. The police had warned the members of the public in an advisory to be aware of unsolicited calls, especially from unknown parties. "Scammers may use Caller ID spoofing technology to mask the actual phone number and display a different number. Calls that appear to be from a local number may not actually be made from Singapore," the police said.
5 memorable moments from the Pakistan vs England semi-final that don't fade away
Pakistan trounced England by eight wickets to knock the hosts out of the tournament.

Pakistan cruised past the hosts to enter the semi-finals
Having swept aside all opposition in the group stage, the hosts were expected to continue their good run when they faced a strong pace attack from Pakistan in the first semi-final of the Champions Trophy 2017.
However, the tournament's most famed batting line-up was bundled out for 211 in 49.5 overs. Pakistan's bowlers were outstanding on the day, the batsmen performed without pressure, and the fielding unit was also exceptional.
Pakistan outplayed England in all departments to become the first semi-finalists of the prestigious tournament.

Here are 5 memorable moments from the match that don't fade away, quite like the Axe Signature range of body perfumes.
#1 Unreal catch from Fakhar Zaman
Moeen Ali was caught by Fakhar Zaman off Junaid Khan and how! A top edge on the pull and it seemed that the ball would land safely. But Zaman, at deep square, sprinted to his left and held on even as he almost hit the turf. He stretched his hands out and the ball stuck as yet again, Moeen Ali fell to a short ball.
The stunning catch by Zaman had the spectators obsessing over it. Ali had to walk back for 11 runs to add to England's misery. The Pakistan opener's unreal catch is an axe moment that does not fade away.
The renowned competitive eater from San Jose, California, takes home the coveted Mustard Belt and surpassed the previous mark of 72 dogs and buns he downed last year.
The heat wasn't a factor; the National Weather Service put the temperature at 83 degrees with a heat index of 91 degrees.
Miki Sudo said after eating 37 dogs and buns that the heat may have slowed her down in winning the women's competition.
That didn't stop the Las Vegas eater from easily beating out second-place finisher Mischelle Lesco of Tuscon, Arizona, who chowed down 28 wieners and buns.

11 a.m.
Miki Sudo (MIHK'-ee SOO'-doh) downed 37 franks to win her fifth straight title in the women's competition of the annual Nathan's Famous July Fourth hot dog eating contest.
The Las Vegas competitor fell short of the 41 hot dogs she consumed last year but still beat out second-place finisher Michelle Lesco, of Tucson, Arizona. Lesco chowed down 28 wieners and buns.
Thousands of attendees braved 83-degree temperatures and a heat index of 91 degrees to witness the annual July Fourth competition on the Coney Island boardwalk.
Ten-time winner Joey "Jaws" Chestnut will confront 20 other men during the men's competition later Wednesday for the coveted Mustard Belt.
Sudo was a fan favourite, drawing big cheers from the crowd during her performance, which was slightly delayed after she requested new water to soak her buns.

It's frankly amazing.
Chowdown champions will face off Wednesday at Nathan's Famous July Fourth hot dog eating contest, where the men's record stands at 72 frankfurters and buns in 10 minutes.
Ten-time winner Joey "Jaws" Chestnut will confront 20 other men on New York's Coney Island boardwalk. He set the record last year.
Miki Sudo (MIHK'-ee SOO'-doh) is seeking a fifth women's title in a row. The 19-woman field includes record-holder Sonya "The Black Widow" Thomas.
Sudo downed 41 franks and buns last year. Thomas' record is 45, but she managed 30 last year.
The event attracts thousands of in-person spectators and is televised on ESPN.
Last year, animal rights activists tried to unfold a banner amid the crowd. Five protesters were taken into custody for questioning and released.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Netflix subscriber growth missed its mark in the first quarter of this year, but the on-demand television star expects to hit the 100-million milestone this weekend.Along with posting strong earnings Monday, US-based Netflix reported a net increase of 4.95 million subscribers, most of those overseas where it has been investing in becoming a global entertainment network.In comparison, Netflix gained 7.05 million subscribers in the prior quarter, raising expectations in the market.“We have come to see these quarterly variances as mostly noise in the long-term growth trend and adoption of internet TV,” Netflix said in a letter released along with the earnings figures.Netflix finished the first quarter of this year with 98.75 million subscribers and predicted that its ranks would crest 100 million this weekend.“That is a bit of accomplishment,” Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said during a video briefing with analysts. “We are super excited.”The company expected it would add about 8.15 million subscribers overall during the first half of this year as compared with 8.42 million in the same period in 2016.Netflix shares dipped and then rose in after-market trades that followed release of the quarterly earnings figures, eventually gaining more than a percent to reach $149.25.Executives declined to reveal details about viewing trends at Netflix, but Hastings disclosed that people watch more than a billion hours worth of shows weekly at the service while Google-owned YouTube boasts that much viewership daily.“We definitely have YouTube envy,” Hastings said.“We are a little over a billion viewing hours a week, and YouTube has a billion a day so we have a ways to go to catch up.”He downplayed competition, saying “entertainment is not a zero-sum game” and it is more about winning fans with content in the on-demand viewing market.Netflix has no interest in getting into the live television streaming game, so is not facing off with services such as PlayStation Vue, DirecTV and YouTube TV, according to executives.Hastings saw Netflix and rival Amazon Prime Video as competing more with people's limited viewing time than they are with one another.Both Amazon and Netflix have been investing heavily in original programming to win subscribers to their on-demand video services.Netflix reported profit of $178 million on revenue of $2.64 billion in the first three months of this year as compared with net income of $28 million on revenue of $1.96 billion in the same period a year earlier.The company described the opportunity for its service as “gigantic” and said it planned to continue investing in films and shows tailored to win fans in countries around the world.“With a growing member base spread across the world, we seek to please diverse tastes with a wide breadth of content,” Netflix said.Netflix planned to spend a billion dollars this year on marketing aimed at attracting members.“A bet on Netflix continues to be a bet on continued high growth, something which certainly isn't guaranteed,” Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson said in an online note. (AFP)
“At the time when producers signed the deal, the initial commitments were to gradually increase cuts until April and May, so we were expecting to see some producers not fulfilling the 100 per cent cuts,” Al-Marzooq said. “We understand the circumstances, and in February we are talking to non-Opec producers to raise their cuts according to their commitments.”

An adrenaline junkie raced down a steep hill on a skateboard topping speeds of 40mph before he landed with a thud on a cattle grid.
Nathan Barr went flying after the crash which ripped his skin off after he had hurtled down Horse Shoe Pass in Llangollen, North Wales on a long board.
The crash was filmed by his cousin's girlfriend, who recorded the footage from the car behind.
The hair-raising clip shows the 24-year-old dad realising it wasn't going to end well as the board started getting uncontrollable 'speed wobbles'.
But it wasn't until he saw the cattle grid in his path that he realised how painful it would be.
Despite his skin being 'shredded' off his hands and body and 'blood everywhere', daring Nathan self-medicated with beer and even went to work the next day.
Nathan, from the Wirral, Merseyside, said: "It was like a human Temple Run.

"As soon as I saw the gate and the cattle grid I knew I was going to crash. I must have been going 40mh.
"Just after the first barrier I started getting speed wobbles.
" You can see it in the video. I regained control but after then I knew that I was going too fast and couldn't stop.
"After I approached the first corner and everything bent to the right I just knew I was going way too fast."
He added: "There was just no way out without jumping off - as I got to that first barrier I knew I wanted to get off at that point.
"I saw the layby and I thought I could stop there but then I realised there was a gate in the way.
"Looking towards the main road I could see there was a cattle gird - but it was either the grid or the gate - and there was nothing the guys in the car could do.
(Image: Mercury Press and Media Ltd)
"I realised I just had to ride it out."
Nathan said: "I got road rash after that. When I came to the grid I was thinking 'this is going to hurt'.
"I just took it but my skin was hanging off and the first thing I did after that video ended was assess the damage.
"I started walking around to see if anything was broken. I just wanted to check everything was in place and on that level everything was okay.
"It was lucky the guys in the car stopped in time or they would have crushed me.
"I was covered in blood when they came over.
"My longboard broke as a result but I got road rash and my skin was shredded.
"That night we just carried on driving to our destination and I washed my wounds in a Welsh freshwater stream. Then after that I had a couple of beers to numb the pain.

"The next day when I woke up the bedsheets were sticking to me because of the blood so I had to peel myself off.
"I went to work and when I came home that night my boxers were sticking to my skin.
"I was glad I crashed where I did because if I had carried on there were metal barriers and trees further down the road - it could have been ten times worse.
"From the first barrier onwards I was trying to think of a way out but I realised I just had to ride it - there was no way out because I was going too fast to stop.
"I've always been into extreme sports. Doing a parachute jump is on the list because that's about the only thing I haven't done.
"Last week I was climbing cranes - I just love the adrenaline rush."
The outflow meant assets under management (AUM) of gold funds plunged by 10% to Rs4,922 crore at November-end from Rs5,480 crore at the end of March. Photo: iStockphoto
New Delhi: Investors have pulled out over Rs500 crore from gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the April-November period of the current fiscal as they preferred equities, as per the latest data by mutual fund body Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi).
Trading in gold ETF has been lukewarm in the previous four fiscals. It had witnessed an outflow of Rs775 crore in 2016-17, Rs903 crore in 2015-16, Rs1,475 crore in 2014-15 and Rs2,293 crore in 2013-14. On the other hand, equity and equity-linked savings scheme (ELSS) saw an infusion of over Rs1.16 trillion during the first eight months of 2017-18. This included an investment of over Rs20,000 crore in the last month alone.
Stock markets have been on an upswing, touching new highs this year. “Lacklustre performance by real estate and gold, and low interest rates on traditional savings instruments have contributed in pushing investor flows into equities,” Bajaj Capital chief executive officer (CEO) Rahul Parikh said.
Gold ETFs are passive investment instruments that are based on price movements and investments in physical gold. “While demand from India has traditionally buttressed gold prices globally, sound rally in the Indian equity markets has meant that gold as an asset class has not been favoured. A strong Indian equity market may mean a sober outlook for gold,” Vidya Bala, head of MF Research at FundsIndia.com said.
According to the latest data available with Amfi, a net sum of Rs511 crore was pulled out from 14 gold-linked ETFs during April-November period this year. In comparison, a net amount of Rs588 crore was withdrawn from the instrument in the year-ago period.
The outflow meant assets under management (AUM) of gold funds plunged by 10% to Rs4,922 crore at November-end from Rs5,480 crore at the end of March. Withdrawal of Rs66 crore was seen in April this year, Rs71 crore in May, Rs81 crore in June, Rs38 crore in July, Rs58 crore in August, Rs74 crore in September, Rs34 crore in October and another Rs89 crore in November.

Staff at an immigration centre where four men died warned bosses lives were at risk a YEAR before the first death, explosive new
evidence reveals.
As an official investigation into the scandal is set to begin, whistleblowers today claim the mental health of detainees has been seriously neglected.
They say refugee asylum seekers at Morton Hall in Lincolnshire are driven to self-harm and the brink of suicide as
they are bullied by convicted criminals awaiting deportation – and even used to smuggle drugs around “no-go areas” in the centre.
And they tell how a cost-cutting staff shake-up a month before the first death in 2016 saw the axing of a string of mental health experts keeping watch on vulnerable detainees.
Worried Amelia Bailey, who was Morton's Hall clinical lead for suicide and self-harm services, even wrote to her bosses about the likely result as she claims she was left to keep the dangerous ship afloat on her own.
She told us: “In my opinion my warnings fell on deaf ears – a view which was supported by the findings of the whistleblowing report.”

One former mental health worker at the compound emailed management telling how she warned that if nothing was done urgently someone would die. The worker also claimed patients' needs were being wrongly assessed
Another whistleblower claims ­conditions at the centre descended into chaos in March 2015 after NHS Nottinghamshire Healthcare took over running its medical team from G4S and cut costs.
She claimed: “The NHS allowed it's best staff to walk out the door. What was left behind was a mess. There became a culture of over-medicating detainees to keep them calm.”
Morton Hall is in the spotlight after Home Affairs Select Committee chair Yvette Cooper called for an inquiry earlier this month into the ‘removal centre' – run by the Prison Service on behalf of the UK Borders Agency – after four men died within 11 months.
The Labour MP said: “I think we need to know what is going on and also what the Home Office is doing about it.”
In December 2016, Bal Ahmed Kabia, 49, from Sierra Leone, died at the centre. A month later Polish national Lukasz Debowski, 27, is believed to have killed himself after being refused bail. Last October Jamaican Carlington Spencer, 38, died after being taken to hospital and a 27-year-old Iraqi died in November.

Last night Amelia told how she wrote to bosses in November 2015 warning of the dangers of axing the centre's mental health experts.
They included ex-head of healthcare Ryk Izycki, an expert in transcultural psychiatry, and wife Kate, one of the UK's only specialists in the psychological impact of torture.
A close friend of the couple has claimed both were replaced by staff less qualified, including a learning disabilities nurse.
Amelia, 48, said her warnings to bosses “fell on deaf ears. I told them detainees were at risk but, in my opinion, they refused to listen.
“I told them the quality of mental health care had fallen since the takeover and that detainees were no longer being cared for properly.
“I was having to delay seeing people because the workload was unbelievable. Yet when I raised this in a meeting I was told I must prioritise my patients.”
The departures left Amelia struggling to cope with a huge workload in a centre which has 392 rooms spread across six residential units.
She said: “I had three men threatening suicide or seriously self-harming in one day. Many of the patients were torture victims who need specialist psychiatric care, yet I was one person trying to juggle it all.”

Amelia went sick with stress and left in May the following year. Her claims have been backed by other former ­clinical staff, including a GP.
The doctor claimed: “Before NHS Nottinghamshire took over we were never left alone with patients. But we were told this would no longer happen. Many people we dealt with had serious mental health issues, with some known to be violent. I expressed concern, but nobody listened.”
Another ex-staff member confirmed the GP's fears of violence – and even alleged innocent asylum seekers are used as drug mules by criminals awaiting deportation after serving prison time.
The source, who asked not to be named, claimed: “There are real ­problems. Drugs are rife at Morton Hall. Searches of visitors are only carried out on a spot-check basis because it's not a prison – it's a detainee centre.
“Drugs are brought in during visits. At least half the detainees are awaiting deportation after serving sentences, many for violence and dangerous offences. A core are known to bully the more vulnerable residents who are ­sometimes forced to carry and deliver drugs around the centre.”
The ex-staffer, who had a high profile job within the removal centre, added: “There are ghetto-type areas run by different ethnic minorities and officers are scared to go and see what they are doing as they are known to be aggressive. Fights are commonplace and a lot of vulnerable detainees live in fear. They already have mental health issues. Many were tortured in the country they fled.”
The same concerns were highlighted in a Prison Inspection report in November 2016 which said almost four in 10 detainees felt “unsafe” amid rising violence and drug use. It also noted a “significant decline” in safety since an inspection three years earlier as “levels of violence” had increased.

Incidents of self-harm had also risen threefold and “four detainees had narrowly escaped fatal or serious injuries”.
The report also recorded that “some risk information had been overlooked.” It added that Morton Hall had “suffered the impact of new psychoactive substances becoming available for detainees.”
A separate inquiry by the NHS in March 2016 found “no evidence of any actions deliberately intended to impact on staff and patient safety and wellbeing”.
But it found concerns “over the delay in recruiting to mental health services and the lack of understanding apparent from managers in respect of low staffing levels.”
After Carlington Spencer's death last October, detainees wrote to a campaign group complaining about the lack of medical help on site.
They told the South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group, which has staged protests against centres: “Here detainees are 16 hours without a doctor. We only have nurses that do not meet the ­standards of a medical professional.”
Morton Hall is part of a wider problem. There were 10 deaths recorded in UK detention centres last year.

The probe into Morton Hall, near Swinderby, will be included in a Home Affairs Select Committee inquiry looking at Brook House Immigration Removal Centre, near Gatwick Airport.Last September private security contractor G4S suspended nine staff members there after claims of abuse and assaults.
A Home Office spokesman said: “Detention and removal are essential parts of effective immigration controls. It is vital these controls are carried out with dignity and respect.
“The provision of 24-hour healthcare in all removal centres ensures individuals have ready access to medical ­professionals. Last year, the Independent Monitoring Board recognised Morton Hall is well run. However more must be done. We have put in place new ­strategies to reduce violence, self-harm, and the use of psychoactive substances.”
An inspection by the Care Quality Commission in March 2013 commended the healthcare provided by G4S. Its report said: “Staff received appropriate professional development.”
A spokesman for Notts Healthcare last night defended itself over the claims and said a recent inspection had found no wrong doing.
Sales of Hite Jinro's distilled liquor "soju" exceeded the 1 trillion won ($882 million) mark last year for the first time since its debut in 1998, the company said Tuesday.
Chamisul soju sales hit 1.009 trillion won last year with a total of 1.7 billion bottles sold.

The company attributes the rise to people consuming more soju amid the protracted economic slump and the alleged corruption scandal involving then-President Park Geun-hye, senior government officials and owners of big businesses.Chamisul controls about 50 percent of the country's traditional distilled liquor market, industry sources said.It is the first time any South Korean soju makers posted the 1 trillion won sales mark.Soju sale have also grown steadily abroad affected by the popularity of Korean pop culture as K-pop music videos, cinemas and dramas often show people consuming soju together with "samgyeopsal" or grilled pork belly.The combination of soju and samgyeopsal is one of the most popular foods in South Korea together with fried chicken and beer called "chimaek."

In 2016, Salisbury University men's lacrosse team was under pressure to win another national title or it would be the first time a four-year class did not hoist the trophy.
Two years later, SU Head Coach Jim Berkman's Seagulls are coming off celebrating back-to-back National Championships, totaling 12 now for the winningest NCAA lacrosse coach.
The central goal is different than that of 2016. This season the flock will be looking to be the first program to have three-straight national championships since Salisbury did it from 2003 to 2005.
To get back to Foxborough in late May, the team will have to endure one of the toughest schedules across NCAA Division III, with five USILA preseason ranked teams. Salisbury opens the season hosting their NCAA Third Round opponent.
“Hopefully we can get through that first treacherous road in February and the first part of March when we're playing the top-10 teams in the south virtually back-to-back-to-back-to-back. So that we don't have too many dents in the armor, that we're a very tough out at the end of the year,” Berkman said.
One thing is for certain: the starting lineup is restocked with tools to make that happen. Once again Salisbury will have arguably the top national defense on paper despite the departures of defender Aaron Leeds, long-stick middie Andrew Ternahan, and goalie Colin Reymann.
The defense will be a formidable back-bone to a retooling offense after the sector lost the entire starting attacking line.
“It's definitely going to be tough. I mean we lost some great offensive players from last year with all of the attackmen and also three really good middies. Going through fall ball, there were a lot of questions, but guys have really stepped up,” SU sophomore attackman Josh Melton said.
Questions meet this SU program each season, and they have answered them in the last two seasons. Behind the leadership of returning all-Americans and the senior class, Berkman is impressed with what he's seen so far as the season gets ready to start.
“They want to be the second team to ever win three [National Championships] in a row. There's no doubt that lingers in their minds. They came back probably wondering if we would have the offense to do it, but I think after fall ball that they were a lot more excited than they thought they were going to be because the offense had improved,” Berkman said.
Defense
While the defensive unit loses a few starters, familiar faces will feature starting opening day against Hampden-Sydney.
Leading the unit are two returning all-Americans in seniors Will Nowesnick and Kyle Tucker. Both have started for SU for several years. Tucker was also named the 2017 Defenseman of the Year.
“They've been groomed by prior leaders. Two years ago, [Tom] Cirillo and [Preston] Dabbs were tremendous captains. They know what it takes and how those guys have pushed each other,” Berkman said.
The duo combined for 132 ground balls and 74 caused turnovers a season ago, and they will look for more with a new addition to the close defensive line. Former Robert Morris University transfer Cory Berry will move from the similar LSM position to fill the spot left by Leeds.
Dealing with a nagging leg injury for much of last season, Berry only saw action in 15 of the 23 total games, starting in four of them as part of an impactful defensive force next to Ternahan. The now former-LSM had three caused turnovers in the National Championship.
“Cory Berry is a great defender. We actually have three LSM's starting at close defense now from what they came in as, but yeah, it's a really easy transition. He's someone easy to play with, talks and slides well,” Tucker said.
Berry ended the season recording 23 caused turnovers as part of the defense that gave up a national-best 6.68 goals-per-game. As a fourth option, sophomore Drew Borkorwicz will come on, having played in 16 games.
The defensive line is working in front of a new goalie this season after two-year starter Reymann graduated. After winning the goalie-battle in fall ball, junior Anthony Stavrakis will take over the duties.
For those familiar with Salisbury, they should recognize his name. Stavrakis played in 18 games across 2015 and 2016, which included two starts. Reymann eventually took over the job in the cage.
Last season, Stavrakis was not on the team as he recovered from surgery. Now he enters the cage with some of the best defenders nationally in front of him.
“He's been around the block. He's a good kid. He knows this is his opportunity; had a good fall, he's very athletic,” Berkman said.
For Tucker and the other defenders, growing confidence is a must in a new goalie.
“The biggest thing about having a new goalie is having them believe in themselves because goalie is such a tough job. The goal is so big and the ball so small. We believe in Anthony, just giving him the extra talk during the games. He's helping us out too with the talk,” Tucker said.
At long-stick middie, sophomore Kevin Murphy will be at the top of the list after making an impact during the NCAA Semifinal vs. Denison coming in for an injury. New to the squad, Jimmy Case transferred in from Towson University and will offer an additional threat from the position.
From question to stronghold by the end of 2017, the defensive middie unit returns all of their key players and depth.
“Now instead of being the question mark, they're kind of the statement. A lot of coaches would like to start the season with two guys in that position with that kind of experience and speed. They're all fast,” Berkman said.
Notable names to remember are seniors Jeremiah LaClair and Troy Miller alongside sophomores Parker Stevens and Jared Walls. It is one of the deeper units on the team and will provide tough outside defense. One of last season's starters, Miller, gives credit to the coaching staff for managing things well on the way to success.
Berkman notes that one of the greatest strengths of this defensive unit is their ability to fill in other roles. He is open to briefly moving players like Tucker or Berry to LSM if needed in certain situations.
“I would think that if we're doing our job and not making mistakes and staying out of the penalty box, that it's going to be tough to contend goals on us. So, for our offense, the challenge for Coach [Justin] Axel and the offense is to get 10 goals. If we get 10 goals, I think it's going to be hard to beat us,” Berkman said.
Offense
The pressure will be on the offensive side of the ball to perform early on. While three key names lit up the scoreboard in Garbarino, [Carson] Kalama, and Blondino, Salisbury also lost multiple key offensive middies too.
The line does have two returning starters though in senior Garrett Reynolds and junior Corey Gwin. Both Seagulls tallied a combined 76 points last season.
Berkman praises Gwin's shooting ability and Reynold's quickness.
“Garrett has been in the limelight for two years now. He's scored over 50 goals over the last two seasons. He's started on the first midfield last year, so it's not like he hasn't been on the first midfield. But now is going to move into a shooter's shot in the man-up too,” Berkman said.
With 33 career appearances under his belt, junior middie Zach Pompea received the nod for the final spot on the first offensive middie line.
“Hopefully this is Zach Pompea's breakout year. We started to see glimpses of Zach in the playoffs last year. He had a really pretty goal in the Cabrini game in a very limited amount of time,” Berkman said. “He's a basketball elusive point guard playing lacrosse, and there aren't a lot of guys like that. He also has some size.”
Pompea has displayed greater confidence to the coaching staff, but Berkman wishes to see a greater shooting ability from the junior.
Last season, a freshman from Centennial, Colo. Gathered praise as he quickly made an impact to start the season.
Josh Melton finished 2017 with 24 goals and 44 points in his first season in the maroon and gold. By the CAC Tournament, he was playing like a veteran, scoring a goal in each game in the NCAA Tournament.
“Unlike most sophomores, he has a full year of a lot of game experience and scoring three goals in the [National] Championship. I don't consider him a sophomore. I consider him to be more of a junior,” Berkman said.
Alongside starting on the attacking line, Melton will also feature on the Salisbury man-up unit this season. While his production is a sure thing, other responsibilities now await Melton since he is the most experienced player returning to the attacking line.
“I kind of assumed the role of what Nick Garbarino did last year as the vocal leader out there, leading everyone. It's different. It's tough leading the entire offense, but we have great guys like Corey and Garrett coming back who have played in big games,” Melton said.
On the attacking line, Melton will be playing alongside two currently unproven players in fellow sophomore attackers Pierre Armstrong and Griffin Moroney. The two combined for 23 appearances and 10 goals last season.
TORONTO—A judge has ruled that a class-action lawsuit can proceed against the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and a photographer who is alleged to have taken intimate photos of students. Lawyer Margaret Waddell says about 60 people have been identified so far as potential class-action members in the lawsuit against the ballet company and Bruce Monk, who worked as a photographer between 1984 and 2015.

The lead plaintiff, Sarah Doucet, alleges Monk pressured her into letting him take semi-nude photos of her as a teenager and then distributed them. The allegations have not been proven in court, and both Monk and the ballet company have filed statements of defence denying the accusations. Police investigated a complaint against Monk in 2015 but no charges were laid.

The recent decision by an Ontario Superior Court justice certifies Doucet's case as a class-action lawsuit, although the defendants have 30 days to appeal the ruling.

Lawyers for Monk and the Royal Winnipeg Ballet were not immediately available for comment Wednesday. Waddell said there are still a few steps before the lawsuit can be heard.

“We have to get notice out to the class members, to let everybody know that the action has been certified, and they have an opportunity to decide if they want to exclude themselves,” Waddell said. The statement of claim alleges Doucet and other former students felt they had no choice but to follow Monk's orders, and later found images of some students being sold online. “Over the many years he was employed by the ballet, Monk amassed a substantial cache of thousands of intimate images,” the lawsuit says. “Among other means, Monk offered copies of these intimate images for sale over the internet through various e-commerce (sites) to purchasers across the country, including in Ontario.”
Crash Bandicoot rivals Call of Duty success in UK charts N.Sane Trilogy is the first title to rack up four consecutive weeks at No.1 since Infinite Warfare
James Batchelor UK Editor Monday 14th August 2017 Share this article Share
The latest UK charts have been released and, yet again, Activision holds onto No.1 with Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy.
A minor 1% dip in sales wasn't enough to dethrone the compilation, which has now managed four weeks running at the top of the charts, and six weeks total since it was first released in June.
The last title to survive this long at No.1 was fellow Activision game Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, which racked up five consecutive weeks at the top spanning the end of 2016 and early 2017. Incidentally, the shooter saw a 13% rise in sales this week, putting it at No.17.
Bethesda, meanwhile, maintains a good hold on the charts with three titles in the Top Five - thanks primarily to ongoing retail promotions. Fallout 4 is at No.2, Dishonored 2 at No.4 and Doom at No.5. All three actually saw sales decrease week-on-week, by as 34% in Doom's case, but the first two managed to each climb a place when compared to last week's chart.
Also a climber is Forza Horion 3, which rises five places and returns to the Top 10 at No.9 thanks to a 13% rise in sales. Also a re-entry is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, up from No.15 to No.7.
With no new releases, the rest of the chart looks rather familiar. This could potentially change next week with the upcoming release of Agents of Mayhem on Friday.
As always, the UKIE/GfK Weekly charts only include retail releases, not download sales. Here's the full Top 10 for the week ending August 12th.

The National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON), on Tuesday in Abuja, promised to reward President Muhammadu Buhari's driver, Saidu Afaka, who returned lost items during the 2016 Hajj in Saudi Arabia.
The Executive Chairman, NAHCON, Alhaji Abdullahi Muhammad, made the disclosure while presenting the lost items to Shehu Barwa, Executive Secretary, Niger Pilgrims Welfare Board for onward conveyance to the owner.
Muhammad said Saidu Afaka, found and returned to the commission a bag containing 400 dollars, N60,370 and 149 Saudi Riyals and a cell phone belonging to Adamu Umar, a Niger State pilgrim.
According to him, in 2016, a pilgrim from Kaduna State, Saidu Afaka, found a wallet or purse and he brought it to our office in Makkah.
“And I directed the Audit Department to keep and trace the owner, and from our records it showed that the owner is Umar Adamu, a pilgrim with passport Number A07432103 from Niger.
“It is my pleasure to hand over the content of this lost and found item to the Executive Secretary, Niger State Pilgrims Welfare Board for onward conveyance to the owner,” Muhammad said.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Afaka, who hails from Kaduna State, is a staff sergeant in Nigeria Army and a senior driver to President Muhammadu Buhari.
The Chairman said the commission would honour him with a slot to travel for the 2017 hajj.
“The commission will reward the pilgrim, who is a true Nigeria accordingly, and we will make sure he also joins us in performing the 2017 hajj,” he said.
The NAHCON boss, who commended Afaka, urged other faithful to emulate his sincerity and faithfulness which he described as marks of true Muslim.
“I don't imagine he's going to do those things again,” insisted Damon who, again, isn't a psychologist. “I imagine the price he's paid at this point is so beyond anything.”
From here this wise, all-knowing sage — not a psychologist, though he once played a guy who bought a zoo — went on to explain his theory about a “spectrum of behaviour,” a “culture of outrage” and how much he respects disgraced comedian Louis C.K., who sexually harassed numerous women and then apologized (sort of).
“Both of those behaviours need to be confronted and eradicated, without question, but they shouldn't be conflated.”
“There's a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation,” he informed an eagerly nodding male interviewer, carefully detailing the shortcomings of the #MeToo and Time's Up movements.
Two months after the #MeToo campaign kicked off to eradicate sexual harassment in Hollywood, Matt Damon decided to speak his mind on an ABC talk show in the detached, knowledgeable way only a white male movie star from the East Coast can.
The Oscar-nominated actress went on: “Gosh it's so *interesting how men with all these opinions about women's differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem (*profoundly unsurprising).”
Which prompted the following tweet from his former co-star and one-time girlfriend, Minnie Driver.
A month later, after being pounded into the dirt with his own words, a chastened Damon meekly informed Kathie Lee Gifford on The Today Show that he had learned a valuable lesson.
“I really wish I'd listened a lot more before I weighed in on this,” he opined like a 4-year-old forced to wear a dunce cap. “I don't want to further anybody's pain with anything I do or say. I should get in the backseat and close my mouth for a while.”
The apology was forced by the backlash, but you got the sense Damon wasn't doing it solely for that reason.
He was doing it because it had suddenly become abundantly clear to him that, not having been on the receiving end of sexual harassment, he doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.
Jump to last Sunday's Grammy Awards, a bastion of male entitlement where — despite lip service to #MeToo and Time's up — the creaky musical showcase awarded only one televised trophy to a female artist (Canada's Alessia Cara) and pointedly failed to offer the lone female nominee for the prestigious Album of the Year, Lorde, a solo performing spot, despite the fact her four male cohorts were all featured prominently.
Questioned about the lack of recognition for women, Recording Academy president Neil Portnow opened his wizened mouth, stroked his greying beard and — like Moses on Mount Sinai — eloquently fingered the guilty party.
“I think it has to begin with women who have the creativity in their hearts and souls, who want to be musicians, who want to be engineers, who want to be producers, who want to be part of the industry on the executive level . . . to step up.” “Step up” — those were the trigger words.
“Attention everyone, especially musicians: Step up,” tweeted singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlton, who started a campaign to oust the silver-topped mansplainer. “And sign the petition to have Neil Portnow, president of the Recording Academy/Grammy's, step down.”
And then pop star Pink weighed in: “Women in music don't need to ‘step up',” she tweeted using a lot of capitalized words for emphasis.
“Women have been stepping up since the beginning of time. Stepping up, and also stepping aside. Women OWNED music this year. They've been KILLING IT. And every year before this.”
And this nugget from singer-songwriter Charlie XCX: “Ugh bout 2 step up on 2 ur face.”
A day or two later, Portnow meekly backed off, mumbling how his words had been taken “out of context” and vowing to create a task force to figure out why, after 120 years, women wield almost no power in the music industry.
As a middle-aged white guy who has fallen victim to the same tragic foot-in-mouth disease, even I find it comical how inept these ivory-tower windbags are at navigating the sensitive waters of social change.
It's not that men shouldn't speak up. It's that they need to know what they're talking about. And be respectful.
Which brings us to Justin Timberlake, the millennial pop star who will perform at this Sunday's Super Bowl halftime show and — before even setting foot on stage — has engendered the wrath of #MeToo for, among other things, working with director Woody Allen, alleged to have molested his now-grown daughter when she was 7.
If there's an accident waiting to happen at the Super Bowl, it's the scruffy golden boy who used to be in *NSYNC.
“Random question,” he tweeted in what was intended as a jocular conversation starter a week ago. “Can someone please explain the saying, ‘You just want your cake and to eat it too.' What else am I about to do with a cake??”
The exchange that followed is a fascinating window into the cultural moment in which we currently exist.
“The saying means, for example, you can't support Time's Up and praise sexual predators at the same time,” tweeted Allen's estranged daughter, Dylan Farrow, outraged that anyone who would wear a Time's Up pin would avidly support an alleged child molester.
“You can't retain your credibility as an activist (i.e. — retain the cake) and, at the same time, praise a sexual predator (i.e. — eating the cake).”
Fired back a male fan, typically uncomprehending: “Damn, can't a man just ask a philosophical question about cake without it turning into #metoo?”
Which prompted the pithy female rebuttal: “Damn, can't a woman live without being sexually harassed/assaulted? (Answer: usually no.)”
You can bet that when Timberlake steps on that stage, 14 years after exposing Janet Jackson's nipple in an infamous “wardrobe malfunction” that — as #MeToo supporters like to point out — derailed her career but had virtually no effect on his, he will be monitored closely.
It is equally certain that either before, during or after the show, unless someone sews his lips shut, he will say or do something to illustrate the same tone-deafness that plagues all male celebrities who figure it's their God-given right to pass judgment on the experiences of others.
So what's the answer? How can these blundering boneheads show respect for women, save their careers and stay out of trouble?
When it comes to #MeToo and Time's Up, if you're planning to do anything other than pledge support to women on the front lines, ahem, shut the hell up.
If an actress like, say, Alyssa Milano, co-leader of #MeToo and a harassment victim herself, compares different levels of sexual assault to different stages of cancer — “Some more treatable than others. But it's still cancer” — and like Matt Damon, you strongly, vehemently disagree, look at yourself in the mirror, wag your finger and repeat these four magic words: shut the hell up.
When some rich male power broker is accused by multiple women of sexual misconduct and you suspect he's being railroaded by vengeful ex-girlfriends making up lies and what is this, anyway, a witch hunt?, whack your head against the wall and explain to yourself that women have been dealing with sexual harassment on a scale you can't comprehend since the beginning to time. And then shut the hell up.
If you put your foot in your mouth and end up having to explain some patronizing, know-it-all comment because it's hard-wired into your DNA and you couldn't help it, do not use your daughters/wife/girlfriend/sister/mother as a convenient crutch to demonstrate your sensitivity to sexual harassment issues.
Lower your eyes, apologize sincerely and, next time, seriously, just shut it.

Boston, Massachusetts-based nuTonomy made headlines in August 2016 following the launch of the world's first self-driving taxi service.
Although limited to a few streets in Singapore, nuTonomy's fleet of self-driving cars, all prototypes requiring a driving behind the wheel in case of an emergency, provided an early look at a likely future where self-driving cars will run around town offering rides.
Ride-sharing firm Lyft, which is already partnered with General Motors and Waymo when it comes to self-driving cars, is now also partnering with nuTonomy.

In a statement, Lyft and nuTonomy said the goal of their partnership is to understand and optimize the user experience of a self-driving taxi service. The collaborative effort will take place in Boston where nuTonomy has been testing self-driving cars since the start of 2017.
The researchers will look at all aspects of ensuring a passenger's comfort and safety during a trip in a self-driving car—from routing and booking to the performance of the driving system and how it interacts and communicates with the passenger(s).
nuTonomy says it plans to launch a large-scale self-driving taxi service in Singapore as early as 2018.

Separately, Jaguar Land Rover has said it has invested $25 million in Lyft and plans to work closely with the ride-sharing firm in the area of self-driving cars. As part of the deal, Jaguar Land Rover will provide vehicles to Lyft for testing.
In 2016, GM invested $500 million in Lyft as part of an effort to jointly develop a self-driving taxi service.
The news comes as rival ride-sharing firm Uber, which is also developing self-driving technology, comes under fire for numerous reasons ranging from intellectual property theft allegations to claims of sexual harassment in the workplace. The company also continues to hemorrhage funds as well as top staff, including even CEO Travis Kalanick who has just taken a leave of absence.
As we all know Faith, Unity and Discipline is the national motto of Pakistan. Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah gave this motto through his personal instance and imparted this message not only for the people of his time but also for the future generations. However, according to prevailing situation in our country it seems we have failed to understand this motto. As unity means, all Pakistanis should be joint without having any kind of biasness related to sect and discrimination. Faith means, you should start struggle for goodness at your end, and must have strong faith on Allah. Moreover, discipline means you are obliged to follow the rules and regulations and abide by the law.
This is actually the Quaid's vision but sadly, we have failed to practically follow this motto in our country. On the 70th Independence Day of Pakistan, we can aim to progress only if we truly establish this motto to make Pakistan a peaceful and successful state. In the end, I would like to thank Quaid-I-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, National Heroes, Abdul Sattar Edhi and all people who sacrificed their lives for Pakistan. Pakistan Zindabad

PRIME Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, flanked by concerned Ministers, is holding daily press briefings to highlight major achievements of the PML (N) government during the last five years. After recounting economic achievements, he gave a run down on Wednesday of how the incumbent government brought a turnaround in the power sector by adding 11,461 MW to the system from different sources.
Criticism by political opponents apart, the fact remains that the PML (N) government is really credited with focusing on the challenge of power shortage from the very first day. Former prime minister Mian Nawaz Sharif devoted more time and efforts to address the problem than any other issue and as a consequence the situation vis-à-vis availability of electricity to the common man, industry, agriculture and businesses is much better than what the government inherited in 2013. Though the government could not fulfil its oft-repeated claim of eliminating power outages by the time it leaves but duration of load-shedding has come down significantly and it is hoped that the target of elimination would be within sight in coming months or the next year when remaining projects initiated by the government would come online. Apart from initiating new projects, the government also expedited completion of moribund projects like Neelum-Jhelum which has now started contributing its share to the national grid. The government could have performed still better had there been no political instability and leg-pulling by vested interests that did not allow the governmental machinery to work with full capacity and concentration. Anyhow, the outgoing government has added what it could in given circumstances and it would be responsibility of the next government to carry forward the process. More important than all, there is dire need for complete reformation and overhauling of the power sector in view of unacceptable level of line losses caused by dilapidated distribution and transmission system as well as rampant theft in some parts of the country. It is hoped that whosoever comes to power following next general election, would also focus on upgradation and modernisation of the distribution and transmission system and take tangible steps in collaboration with provinces to eliminate electricity theft.

Newsroom To 'Chicago Tribune': With 85 Percent Backing, We Have Votes For Union
Enlarge this image toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images
Organizers of a newsroom union at the Chicago Tribune have informed its publisher that colleagues have already given such overwhelming formal support for their effort that the paper's parent company should recognize the guild voluntarily and start to negotiate a contract.
The organizers gave the Tribune's parent company, Tronc, a day to make a decision.
According to a letter from the Chicago Tribune Guild organizing committee obtained by NPR, the nascent union has received signed union authorization cards from more than 85 percent of staffers who would fall under the bargaining unit.
"Voluntary recognition would allow us to begin contract negotiations, saving the company the cost and inconvenience of a campaign and an election that will result overwhelmingly in our favor," read the letter, sent Tuesday morning to Bruce Dold, the Tribune's editor and publisher. This story will be updated with any reaction from the Tribune and Tronc.
It is quite a turnaround in fortunes for unions at Tronc, which comes from a strong anti-union background. Historically, the Tribune and its corporate owners took a strong stance against unions at the paper and in society more broadly.
More recently, Tronc fought fiercely for months against unionizing efforts at the Tribune's larger sister paper, the Los Angeles Times, yet lost badly in a lopsided vote held in January. Tronc, then controlled by Chicago investor Michael Ferro, announced it would sell the Times and The San Diego Union-Tribune less than three weeks later. That sale, to Southern California billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, is expected to go through in coming weeks.
Ferro is now gone from the company. He sold his controlling minority stake to McCormick Media — controlled primarily by Sargent M. McCormick-Collier, a relative of the legendary late Col. Robert McCormick who ran the Tribune and built it into a multi-platform staff.
"If the company does not recognize the Chicago Tribune Guild, we will file the signature cards tomorrow with the National Labor Relations Board, and an election will be scheduled," the organizing committee wrote in a separate note to staffers.
The Tribune's parent company, Tronc, and its corporate predecessor, Tribune, have suffered severe financial setbacks, some of them self-inflicted. That has in turn led to waves of layoffs, buyouts and cutbacks. The Chicago Tribune newsroom is perhaps a third as large as it was at its height.
In the years since it was rechristened Tronc, the company has been beset by additional controversy and internal crises, starting with a frenetic branding effort around digital innovation. In Los Angeles, the Times's new publisher, Ross Levinsohn, was sidelined by questions raised over past workplace misconduct (he took a leave and became Tronc's chief executive over its digital activities). The LA Times' new editor-in-chief, Lewis D'Vorkin, sparked a newsroom mutiny over his conversations with Disney over coverage and with his accusations that his journalists have been disloyal. He was shifted over to the digital unit in February and left the company earlier this month.
The company created an uproar with plans to create a large separate digital newsroom that would have generated a vast new output of online content outside the company's newspapers, including the Chicago Tribune, the LA Times, the Baltimore Sun, South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Hartford Courant, and other big metro dailies.
A senior Chicago Tribune editor, Metro Editor Mark Jacob, announced on April 5 he was leaving the company and tweeted: "... owners and managers of media companies must embrace a mission of journalism as public service, invest in their people and show bravery and independence. Our democracy depends on it."
Some digital newsrooms and smaller newspapers have been seeking union representation as well. Union efforts recently have popped up at some surprising newsrooms — including the digital outlet Mic, the satiric publication The Onion, the Casper (Wyoming) Star-Tribune, and the Missoula, Mont., Independent.
If the union is recognized by Tronc voluntarily, or wins it in a vote overseen by federal labor regulators, the guild would represent about 280 nonmanagement employees at the Tribune, its sister Spanish-language daily, Hoy, the entertainment-oriented tabloid RedEye and four suburban publications.

There are loads of reasons why you might have a career break or employment gap on your CV - maybe you started a job but hated it, and would rather erase it from your memory, maybe, like so many others, you were made redundant.
Firstly, you don't need to lie about a career break, so don't start messing around with the end date of your last job – it won't do you any favours. L
et's examine how we can get you job hunting positively after that CV gap.
Rework your CV
A gap in your CV can be easily explained without any drama. Be matter-of- fact: were you caring for relatives, dealing with personal illness, trying to write a novel, or just travelling?
If your break seems unremarkable, or isn't something you're comfortable discussing just yet, just enter the relevant dates, and sum it up in a sentence. For example, ‘June 2016 – April 2017: Maternity leave'. It's pretty obvious what your tasks involved, though you could bring up a useful example in a job interview.
The same goes for a gap year that wasn't job-related – no explanation needed. However, to draw on a really useful career break experience, add a few bullet points explaining the skills you built along the way, such as being promoted to manager level whilst doing part-time bar work abroad.
Focus on your goals
Now your CV is nearly ready, it's time to focus. Are you returning to the same industry, or do you want to try something new? If you're starting from the ground up, or trying to emphasise transferable skills because you don't have much experience in your new sector, be prepared to put in some extra effort, like volunteering, work shadowing or interning. See if there are any mentoring networks in your area, and read some inspirational case studies of career changes.
Should your plan involve returning to the same industry as before, you're in luck: you have previous experience to draw on. It's time to decide whether you want the same level of responsibility you had before, or whether you're eyeing up a senior level job. You might want to pick up where you left off, then apply for a promotion after at least six months' work, so you can demonstrate your increased responsibilities and skills.
Do some industry research
If you've had a long break from a competitive or fast-paced industry, such as teaching or media, you might need a refresher course, an assessment or a one day workshop to show you're up to date. Yes, you knew your stuff five years ago, but the world has changed. Talk to people who still work in this area, either through your own network or online, and get advice.
You could find your industry is actively trying to recruit people who've taken time out from their career. For example, the Financial Times reported last month that Vodafone is recruiting women who've taken career breaks . Their plan is to employ 1,000 women in both customer facing and behind-the- scenes roles. Of course, it's not just women who need to take a break, but employment drives such as this will reassure everyone that they shouldn't feel shut out by potential employers.
Practice your interview technique
It's understandable to feel a bit rusty when you haven't had any job interviews for a long time, but be kind to yourself. Dig out relevant examples of the skills you need for the job, like the time you stepped in at the last minute to help your boss with an important presentation. Remember you're still the person who achieved all the things listed on your CV, just with a little time out.
You're also less vulnerable to the modern epidemic of workplace burnout, where your health and morale is at an all-time low due to work-related stress felt day and night (especially if your boss ‘urgently' calls or emails at 2am on a regular basis). Men's Health recently reported on the rising dangers of workplace burnout, but you won't be at risk: you're arriving fresh and energised, with no mental hangover from your last job.
So, you're keen to work, ready for a challenge, and excited about the future – clearly, you'll be a great candidate. Happy job hunting!

If you were to explain the concept of "Melbourne" to an ancient alien civilisation visiting Earth, this is exactly where you would start.
This is the image.
Over the weekend, the Melbourne Demons played the St. Kilda Saints in a decisive Australian Rules Football match that potentially could make or break both teams aspirations for glory this year.
It was a BIG GAME.
A HUGE GAME! Oh boy, wowee, this was going to be MASSIVE.
In fact, it was one of the biggest in recent memory for both of these clubs. The Saints haven't been in the finals since 2011 and Melbourne haven't finished inside the top 8 since before the iPhone existed, in 2006. A win in this game would go a long way to securing a place in the finals so you'd think that the fans would be fixated on the game, or leaning over the barricade shouting obscenities.
At the very least, wouldn't they be giving the umpire the finger like any die-hard?
On an angle, with your thumb out. The most effective bird you can ever flick. #AFLPowerPies pic.twitter.com/BHooQ0Qe8J — Ryan Fitzgerald (@FitzySA) August 13, 2017
Not at this game.
This bucket-hat-wearing Melbourne fan brought an entire cheese platter complete with avocado, salmon, cured meats – hell, I think I can see olives there too? – and of course, Fromager d'Affinois Bleu, a luscious brie-like cheese and the dairy product of choice for Melburnians, as far as I know.
You know what though, I kind of get it. As an Adelaide Crows fan, we've been taking chardonnay and apricot slices to the footy since 1991. Plus, the expensive bin scraps that get offered up as food at the footy aren't the most appealing but hey! It's an Australian tradition to smash a meat pie or some heavily-salted hot chips at every major break, not some meats off your charcuterie board! And how did he get a butter knife through security? Is this something that Melbourne security services let slide - you can bring a knife in as long as it's for your plate of cured meat?
I can't abide by this kind of nonsense.
I mean, avocado? Salmon?
This is Melbourne 101.
This is so prototypically Melbourne that I almost think it was set up.
Oh yeah, and while some fans were tucking into a salmon baguette, the Demons ended up notching a 24 point victory and getting one step closer to playing finals. But that doesn't matter because this bloke has his own cheese platter at the footy.
It is quite surprising and startling that the Chief Justice of Pakistan trashed the entire KP Police force. These remarks are demoralizing and cast aspersions on the system. This shows the frustration of the Apex Court with the law enforcing agency(ies). I agree that there are black sheep in the force. Mostly the officials are corrupt, incompetent and inefficient but there are some who are thorough professionals and work diligently.
Police force employs obsolete methods of investigations. They provide cover to the influential and powerful people. Some of the crimes are engineered by them. The extra-judicial killings and fake police encounters are some of the examples of their methodology. This is not the way to conduct police business. In every walk of life we can find such glaring examples of incompetence and misuse of powers. The Police system needs to be revamped not reformed. The structural flaws can be only removed at the initial stage of recruitment and training. There is a dire need to form a high-powered Police Commission with experts to do this Job.
I hope the Police officials will take the criticism for their own good. Chief Minister Khattak should look into this matter and streamline the Provincial Administration and bring positive changes wherever needed. Rao Anwaar, SSP Malir's case should be made a test case.

The White House maintains that the House and Senate will begin considering a detailed tax overhaul after the August recess, with final passage scheduled for November. But after the Republican drive to repeal the 2010 health care law collapsed this summer, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared that the president had “excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process.” (Photo: File)
Washington — President Donald Trump wants to close a frustrating 2017 with the first overhaul of the tax code in more than three decades.
Yet after seven months, Trump's plan remains little more than a rough sketch. Despite the haziness of the blueprint, administration officials have held to their pledges that lowering tax rates would spur the creation of millions of jobs and faster economic growth.
The White House maintains that the House and Senate will begin considering a detailed tax overhaul after the August recess, with final passage scheduled for November. But after the Republican drive to repeal the 2010 health care law collapsed this summer, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared that the president had “excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process.”
The president told reporters last week, “I'm very disappointed in Mitch.”
Here are the open questions about taxes that will be decided in the coming months:
■Tax cuts or tax reform?
They're not the same thing, though Trump seems to use the terms interchangeably.
Tax cuts mean that people pay less money to the government. Reform is more complex and more difficult to achieve. It generally involves simplifying the tax code by erasing breaks. With tax reform, the government can, in theory, collect taxes from a broader base of incomes, and that enables lower rates.
Tax reform is difficult because the deductions and tax breaks generally have vocal and well-financed supporters who will fight to preserve those benefits.
“From a political standpoint, the perceived losers are more vocal and louder than the perceived winners,” said Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury Department official in the Obama administration.
This is why the administration might ultimately decide to cut taxes in hopes of boosting the economy, rather than wading through an overhaul.
■What's in store for the middle class?
Trump has said he wants tax relief for the middle class.
He has supported doubling the “standard deduction.” This essentially means that a greater amount of income would be treated as tax-free and that would help the middle class.
But many elements of the outline the White House submitted in April, like eliminating the estate tax, favor the wealthiest 1 percent of earners. This group would see their after-tax incomes shoot up on average 17.8 percent under the plan, while the middle fifth of taxpayers would get a boost of only 3.3 percent, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center.
Some people who perceive of themselves as middle class could be surprised by tax hikes. This is because the White House wants to shrink the number of personal tax brackets to three from seven, but it hasn't set the income levels for the new brackets.
Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, said the income levels will be set by the House Ways and Means Committee, which will draft and hold hearings on the bill.
■So will the deficit rise?
Trump and congressional leaders have kept quiet about just how much a tax overhaul could increase the budget deficit. Outside analysts have estimated that the known changes could cause the debt to climb by several trillions of dollars over the next decade. A joint White House and congressional statement released in July says their priority is keeping the deficit at its current projections.
Congress could use accounting gimmicks in the budget process to create space for large tax cuts before the new fiscal year starts in October. However, the gimmicks aren't a long-term solution to a revenue shortfall.
Lawmakers could change how the deficit gets calculated in future years by treating tax breaks that are set to expire this year as permanent. This could add $450 billion to the baseline over 10 years, said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
The budget instructions could also allow lawmakers to make both permanent and temporary changes to the tax code.
“This is one way that they get some of their priorities” without having to eliminate popular tax breaks, said Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the right-leaning Tax Foundation.
■Will the plan mostly benefit the rich?
One way White House aides say that growth will be improved is by reducing taxes for smaller firms in which a company's profits double as the owner's personal income. These are commonly known as “pass-through” businesses — and they're linked with rising income inequality.
Trump's April guidelines would have this income taxed at a rate as low as 15 percent, the same as its intended rate for all corporate income. The top corporate tax rate is now 35 percent, relatively high compared with similar nations. The administration has also said it would create rules to keep the wealthy from exploiting the lower pass-through rate as a way to reduce their tax rates.
Pass-throughs play a key role in widening income inequality. Research by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez found that the top 1 percent of earners accounted for more than 20 percent of total U.S. income in 2013, up from 10 percent in 1980. Of that increase in share of income, 41 percent was due to wealthier people earning money via pass-through firms.
But Trump aides say they have yet to finalize a plan that would support small businesses instead of the rich.

A 23.2KG Spanish mackerel was the largest fish caught off Woolgoolga on the weekend for the 2018 Australian Bluewater Freediving Classic.
Shot by Josh Stevens, the big catch still wasn't enough to claim the major prize.
Derrick Cruz from Sydney was the open champion with local Brett Vercoe runner-up.
Vercoe did take the Masters prize while other winners on the weekend included Neil Armour (veterans), Jarrod McKenzie (junior) and Rachel Vercoe (ladies).
A lot of divers had the best luck on the Saturday. The visibility was murky but persistence paid off for divers. Winds of more than 20 knots meant less-than-ideal conditions.
A total of $1615 was raised at the post-event fish auction with all proceeds going towards Woolgoolga Marine Rescue with fish weighed in including cobia, kingfish, mulloway and wahoo.
"We had a good response from the community, a lot of people turned up to the auction and a lot stayed right to the end,” Woolgoolga Marine Rescue's unit commander Tony Skalla said.

My boyfriend of a few months has a brother whose wife suffers from PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) whose details are unknown by his family. She formerly used alcohol for comfort and was very bubbly and fun-loving, then.
Reader needs to recognize her place in the situation, and be an informed ally when trying to help someone with PTSD, writes Ellie. ( Dreamstime )
A year later, they had a child with whom neither her family nor his were permitted much contact for five years. His brother's wife went into complete isolation. She's now allowing the family to spend small amounts of time with the child (who was diagnosed this year with autism and anxiety problems).
Article Continued Below
But there are endless rules, e.g. don't use a cellphone in her presence, period. I wanted to give the child a colouring set, markers and a booklet as a nice surprise. I was told the mother would have to be convinced by a grandparent beforehand, as she doesn't allow the child to be given gifts. I only met this mother briefly as they won't attend any family gatherings. I'm at a loss for how to proceed. I really feel for his family. His brother is very meek; he goes along with whatever the wife wants to not make waves.
How to Handle? This isn't about you. The best gift you can give this child is gentle friendliness and compassion.
Article Continued Below
The same applies to her mother. She has her own story, with a diagnosis to back it up. The rest of the family not only needs to accept this, but also learn about PTSD, which is generally caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events. She isn't behaving out of meanness to the family. Rather, she's responding to a difficult set of symptoms related to her past trauma, e.g. extreme anxiety, nightmares and flashbacks. It's also not uncommon for sufferers to experience feelings of isolation. Hopefully, she's been receiving some counselling. Now, she's trying to protect and help her child who has her own issues to learn to handle. The “rules” about cellphones or anything else may've been recommended by a mental health professional. You can become a great aid to your boyfriend and his family by understanding the conditions the mother and child face. Rather than everyone bringing judgment and hurt feelings to this situation, they and you can offer whatever's truly needed. If and when you do get to meet this woman, let her build trust in you at her own pace. Reader's Commentary: “At 21, I fell hard for a married guy who said he was separating from his wife. But then he found out that he had a 2-year-old and said it was difficult to leave. “He said they never slept together anymore, but when I delivered our daughter I found out his wife had also given birth to another child just months before me. “I needed professional help but didn't seek it. Instead, I raised my daughter, now age 32, on my own for many years. “My daughter contacted her biological father but he's not interested. I told her not to waste her beautiful self on someone who's really not a good person. Good people don't do what this guy did. “My daughter and I have had a good life — a home, and a long-term relationship for me that produced a sister and brother for her. “I'm not ever sorry that I had her. But I'm so sorry I wasted so many years when I should've been seeking education, healthy relationships, respect, etc. “I didn't run fast enough in the other direction.” Tip of the day People living with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder need continued understanding from those close to them.

Canadians have been swindled out of than $1.7 million via scams involving cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin so far this year — more than double the amount during all of 2016.
The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre says that's more than five times the amount people lost to these types of scams in 2015, which was roughly $284,000.
As Bitcoin becomes more popular with investors, sending the price above $17,000 (U.S.) mark last week, criminals appear to be increasingly turning to cryptocurrencies to extort payment from their victims as well.
These new figures come after police in Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario warned in recent months to beware of scams involving demands for a transfer of funds using Bitcoin.
RCMP in Langley, B.C., last month said a woman received a call from what she believed was her husband's cellphone and someone poses as a police officer, asking for bail to secure her spouse's release.
Busquets urges Barcelona to make signings after Madrid defeat

By Rik Sharma
(Reuters) - Sergio Busquets called on Barcelona to sign more players after the club's 3-1 Spanish Super Cup defeat by Real Madrid on Sunday.
The defensive midfielder believes his team need to reinforce if they are to wrestle power back from their rivals Madrid, who won a Champions League and La Liga double last season.
Barcelona announced the signing of Paulinho on Monday but still have to replace Neymar, who joined Paris St Germain for a world record 222 million euros.
They have been linked with Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Borussia Dortmund's Ousmane Dembele, both of whom might have been helpful as Barcelona struggled to break down Madrid at Camp Nou in the first leg.
Barcelona have been frustrated in the transfer market this summer, not only losing one of their best players but unable to sign their reported top targets either.
"We don't need new signings because of the result, but because we always have to renew [our squad] and try to improve, no matter what," Busquets told reporters.
"There's no need for any excuses, now we have to draw up conclusions and look forward.
"We have the game at the Bernabeu on Wednesday. It's almost mission impossible, it will be really difficult to turn it around but we will try."
Paulinho will not be available to play on Wednesday for the second leg, in which Barcelona faces an uphill struggle, needing to score at least three away goals to be in with a chance of winning the cup.
With Neymar gone, Gerard Deulofeu was picked to play on the left wing in the first leg but he did not impress, frequently on a different wavelength to his team-mates.
Coach Ernesto Valverde is confident Barcelona will add to their squad before the transfer window shuts, although he prefers to focus on his current squad instead of speaking about potential signings.
Valverde told a news conference on Sunday: "We're Barça and we want to have the best team.
"Until the end of August, there's time, although I'd like to focus on those I already have here, despite losing. And despite the fact that in this period there will surely be changes in the team."

US Air Force Colonel Thatcher Cardon, MD, has won a competition to develop a new diaper to cradle astronauts' soiled nethers for up to six days of spacefaring.
While no details were given on the design of the space nappy, Cardon has been declared the recipient of $15,000 for submitting his MACES Perineal Access & Toileting System (M‑PATS) to NASA's Space Poop Challenge.
NASA had launched its global crowdsourcing competition for "solutions to human waste management inside a spacesuit" last year, which required that astronauts' health and safety be protected from their own excrement for up to six days.
The current ablution solutions can only handle less than 24 hours of waste, but over the 60-day competition, the Space Poop challenge received more than 5,000 proposed replacements from 19,000 individual registered competitors, with more than 150 teams from "every country and continent on Earth (including Antarctica)" participating.
The second-place $10,000 prize went to Katherine Kin, Stacey Marie Louie, and Tony Gonzales, known as the Space Poop Unification of Doctors (SPUDs) Team, for their Air-powered Spacesuit Waste Disposal System. $5,000 was awarded to Hugo Shelley for SWIMSuit, offering Zero Gravity Underwear for 6‑Day Use.
"The response to the Space Poop Challenge exceeded all of our expectations," said NASA Tournament Lab deputy director Steve Rader. "The level of participation and interest went far beyond what we expected for such a short competition."
"It was wonderful to see the global response from our crowdsourcing challenge," said Kirstyn Johnson, space suit technology engineer at NASA. "We enjoyed seeing the innovative approaches that were sent in, given such a demanding scenario. Others at NASA are now thinking about ways we can leverage a crowdsourcing approach to solve some more of our spaceflight challenges." ®

South Korea's life and nonlife insurance firms saw their combined net profit rise 28.3 percent in the first six months of this year, thanks to robust gain in dividend income and a decline in the loss ratio, the country's financial regulator said Tuesday.Life insurance firms operating in South Korea reported a combined net profit of a preliminary 2.97 trillion won ($2.6 billion) for the January-June period, up 31.1 percent on year, the Financial Supervisory Service said in a statement."When it comes to life insurance companies, dividend income grew 372.1 billion won and investment income was also up 640.2 billion won based on an increase in disposition gains of available-for-sale securities," the FSS said in the statement.Nonlife insurers saw their combined net profit gain 25.2 percent on year to a provisional 2.53 trillion won."Nonlife insurers' earnings improved mostly because a better loss ratio contributed to expanding gains on auto insurance, and disposition gains of real estate grew by 201.3 billion won as well," it said.The FSS did not disclose insurance companies' individual results.

The great white sharks of the Atlantic Ocean swim farther and deeper than researchers previously believed, according to tracking data collected on 32 of the creatures over a five-year span.
Between 2009 and 2014, tagged sharks were traveling as much as 2,300 miles east of Cape Cod, to the Azores, the Portuguese island chain located three quarters of the way across the ocean.
The sharks also dove deeper -- as far down as 3,700 feet -- more frequently and remained at such depths longer than previous research suggested.
"Everything we knew previously indicated that the white shark in the Atlantic is more coastally-oriented, moving north-to-south and remaining on the continental shelf," Gregory Skomal, lead author on a new study, told The Associated Press. "So what we're now describing is this other component, this offshore movement into open ocean."
The research was published last week in the Marine Ecology Progress Series. Scientists from the state Division of Marine Fisheries, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution contributed.
The boundaries of the known habitat of these creatures has been expanded as a result of the research, which will affect conservation efforts, noted Skomal.
"You've got U.S. protection within 200 miles of shore, but you have sharks clearly leaving that protection that are vulnerable to harvest," Skomal said. "We need to engage other countries fishing in these waters to talk about putting similar protections in place."
Massachusetts-based shark researcher Tobey Curtis put the significance of the findings in perspective.
"Prior to this, we were only able to piece together information about their distribution from widely scattered reports from fishermen, scientists and the public," he said. "Having tracks of individual sharks really helps fill in the gaps, and provides a more complete picture of white shark movements and migrations."

Detroit — Better health and a better power play could go a long way towards the Red Wings' goal of making the playoffs, even as they develop their prospective stars and rebuild this season.
Upbeat after their 4-2 win in the home opener in their new arena over a Wild team forecast for success this season, the Red Wings drilled on fundamentals Friday at practice and savored their success on the power play.
But there was a bit of bad news on the injury front.
Defenseman Niklas Kronwall skated by himself after the rest of the team left the ice.
A full participant in the morning skate Thursday and at practice Wednesday, Kronwall's status is day-to-day, Jeff Blashill said.
“He won't be in tomorrow night,” the coach said.
The Red Wings play the Senators, who may see the return of standout defenseman Erik Karlsson to their lineup.
Karlsson delayed his start to the season recovering from offseason surgery on his foot after playing through part of the stretch drive and playoffs with an injured heel.
The All-Star did not play in the Senators' 5-4 loss to the Capitals on Wednesday and Ottawa's power play suffered.
Ottawa GM Pierre Dorion told reporters Thursday he hoped Karlsson could return Saturday against the Red Wings.
On Friday, the Senators coach Guy Boucher scaled that back to say Karlsson remains day-to-day.

An upbeat mood prevailed, generally, at Red Wings practice.
Not only did Anthony Mantha and Dylan Larkin look strong against the Wild, Jimmy Howard withstood some considerable pressure by the Wild until the Wings started scoring and the team had a staunch response when it lost the lead with two quick, early third-period goals by the Wild.
The Red Wings roared back.
Henrik Zetterberg scored the winner and Martin Frk applied frosting to the cake.
Asked if it signaled a more resilient team than last season.
“I am not sure if I would compare it to last year, or not,” said the veteran defenseman Mike Green, who assisted on all four goals, after scoring a hat trick in the home opener last season.
“I think the team did a really good job of staying composed, even when we went down two, there.”
“We didn't lose our cool. We just kind of stayed in the same mind frame and we are able to fight our way out of it.
“With ‘Z.' getting a big goal and ‘Frky' obviously finishing it off, it was great.”

WE'RE living in the luckiest place in the nation and we're not just talking about the pristine beaches.
Moonee Beach has a new claim to fame as Australia's luckiest suburb to win the lottery, with Moonee Beach Newsagency's winning ticket last year catapulting the north and mid-north coast region to the top of the leaderboard in terms of pay-outs.
The newsagency sold a jackpot ticket that netted $8.95 million in May last year.
The north and mid-north coast region saw a total winning of $9.75 million in 2017, the highest in the country, according to the Tatts Group.
Moonee Beach Newsagency manager Bev Baff was thrilled to hear the news.
"We did have a major win last year, around $8.9 million. It was actually just from a $2 lottery ticket," she said.
Sydney's inner west was the second luckiest place in Australia, with an online entry in Drummoyne winning $6.87 million.
Overall, NSW was the luckiest state in Australia with more jackpot and first-prize division winners than any other state or territory.
Winners took home more than $27 million in NSW last year.
"New South Wales continued its track record of having more Lucky Lotteries 1st Prize wins than anywhere else," Lucky Lotteries spokesman Matt Hart said.
So if you're thinking of entering Thursday's $40 million jackpot, the odds may be in your favour.

Game time announced for Georgia-USC football game
COLUMBIA, S.C. — The South Carolina vs. Georgia football game scheduled for Saturday, Sept. 8, 2018 will kick off at 3:30 p.m. ET and will be televised live on CBS, it was announced on Wednesday. The Georgia matchup is the second in a three-game season-opening home stand for the Gamecocks.
Georgia leads the all-time series between the two squads, 50-18-2. The Bulldogs defeated the Gamecocks last season in Athens, Ga., 24-10.
The Sept. 8 game is the third time that the Gamecocks and Georgia will face each other on CBS since 2014. Carolina earned a 38-35 victory in 2014 at Williams-Brice Stadium, while the Bulldogs defended their home field last season.
The Gamecocks open the 2018 season Saturday, Sept. 1 against Coastal Carolina, and they close their season-opening home stretch Saturday, Sept. 15 against Marshall. Kickoff times and television coverage for those games will be announced later this summer.
South Carolina is coming off of a 9-4 season that included a 5-3 SEC record and an Outback Bowl victory over Michigan. The Gamecocks return 16 starters and 55 lettermen from last season's team, which was one of just three FBS teams to increase its win total by three games for the second-straight season.

Arsenal fans will be delighted to learn that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is raring to go ahead of the new season.
So much so that the Gabon international broke a club record in his very first training session of the new season, which will no doubt impress his new boss Unai Emery.
Aubameyang has been very active on social media throughout the summer, and, due to not being in the World Cup, was seen enjoying the sun in Dubai while on holiday in June.
He has also been ensuring he remains in tip-top shape, and has posted various videos of himself training with his brother to Instagram.

Presumably the first training session back would be a light one for the players.
It would be more of an opportunity to meet the new boss and coaching staff, and have a discussion about the direction the club is going to be heading in this season.

But it seems Aubameyang took the session as an opportunity to impress his new manager, as an exclusive behind the scenes video of the striker proved.
In the clip, which Arsenal uploaded to YouTube, the Gabon forward is seen completing a one-legged triple jump test.

He manages a distance of 7m 97cm, which according to one of the Arsenal backroom staff is a brand-new record.
It seems the future is looking bright for the Gunners.

Police and paramilitary forces are seen on a street near a restaurant following an attack by terrorists on the restaurant in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, Monday. (Reuters)
OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - Terrorists killed at least 17 people and wounded eight during a raid on a restaurant in Burkina Faso's capital, the communications minister said, as security forces sought to free people still trapped inside on Monday.
A Reuters witness saw customers running out of the Aziz Istanbul restaurant in central Ouagadougou as police and paramilitary gendarme surrounded it amid gunfire.
“This is a terrorist attack,” Communications Minister Remi Dandjinou told a news conference. He said the toll was provisional because the security operation was still underway.
Burkina Faso security forces killed three suspected terrorists but there were still people trapped inside the building, he said later on state media.
A woman said she was in the restaurant celebrating her brother's birthday when the shooting started.
“I just ran but my brother was left inside,” the woman told Reuters as she fled the building.
Burkina Faso, like other countries in West Africa, has been targeted sporadically by terror groups operating across Africa's Sahel. Most attacks have been along its remote northern border region with Mali, which has seen attacks by Islamist terrorists for more than a decade.
Thirty people were killed when terrorists attacked a restaurant and hotel in Ouagadougou in January 2016 in an incident claimed by al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).
AQIM and related terror groups were largely confined to the Sahara Desert until they hijacked a Tuareg rebellion in Mali in 2012 and swept south. French forces intervened to prevent them taking Mali's capital, Bamako, the following year, but they have since gradually expanded their reach, launching high-profile attacks on Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast.
A new al-Qaida-linked alliance of Malian jihadist groups claimed an attack in June that killed at least five people at a luxury Mali resort popular with Western expatriates just outside Bamako.
African nations launched a new multinational military force to tackle Islamist terrorists in the Sahel last month, but it won't be operational until later this year and faces a budget shortfall.
World Islamic Finance Forum opens in Karachi
Masroor Afzal Pasha
Karachi
Advisor to Prime Minister on Finance Affairs Dr Miftah Ismail has assured Islamic finance sector that he would soon create a post at Finance Ministry that would solely deal with the Islamic Finance Industry.
He further said the Islamic finance industry that he would soon convene the meeting for implementation of the recommendations of Steering Committee for the promotion of Islamic banking in the country.
He was speaking at the two-day World Islamic Finance Forum (WIFE) 2018 organized by IBA Centre for Excellence in Islamic Finance (CIEF) in collaboration with key partners here on Monday. The theme is “Expanding the Footprint of Islamic Finance: Innovation, Fintech & Regulations”. The keynote speakers are local and international academic and industry leaders.
Highlighting the performance of present government, Miftah said that we are set to achieve a 6 percent GDP growth which is the highest growth rate for last one decade. 6 percent GDP growth would create lots of job opportunities and claimed that Pakistan has the potential to achieve 8 to 10 percent growth rate, he hoped.
The present government has removed the basic bottlenecks from the path of growth of prosperity that includes Energy shortage, law and order and Red-tapism for the business and economy, he claimed.
Globally acknowledged Shariah Scholar and Chairman, Shariah Board of AAOIFI, Shaikh Muhammad Taqi Usmani said, “We made a humble beginning in Pakistan, but the point of satisfaction is that people of Pakistan origin are holding key positions in Islamic banking around the world, making contribution in developing regulatory framework and above all developing products that are meeting the emerging needs of trade and business.”
Taqi Usmani urged the government to take concrete steps to get rid of Riba from the economy in absolute terms. He urged the government to immediately establish a section or division at Ministry of Finance to be headed by an additional or joint secretary level official so that problem and issues of Islamic finance sector are addressed.
He said that Islamic financial institutions have excess liquidity and the government should work on creating avenues for the deployment of these excess funds.
He said that Implementation Committee at Ministry of Finance which is dormant must be activated for the goal of Islamization of the economy.
Mufti Taqi Usmani advised current Government to include a resolution in its election manifesto to eradicate the Riba totally.
The Chief Guest of the conference Shaikh Ebrahim Bin Khalifa Al Khalifa, Chairman AAOIFI Board of Trustees said that “Pakistan is striving hard to become another hub of Islamic finance. It has all the basic ingredients i.e. a population of 200 million predominantly Muslims, a robust banking and finance sector, vibrant agriculture, industrial and services sectors.”
“The apex regulator, State Bank of Pakistan, Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan are playing a proactive role, he said, adding, “The progress made during more than one decade is encouraging and provide the faith that achieving the target will not be difficult.”
President of Meezan Bank, Irfan Siddiqui said requested the Federal Government to set a target to acquire at least 25 percent of the local funding through Islamic Banking as Islamic financial institutions have excess liquidity and limited avenues for investment.
A dedicated desk should be established at Ministry of Finance for Issuance of Sukuk headed by Additional Secretary for targeting a Sukuk issue of Rs500 billion in the next 6 months period, he informed.
Irfan further said that “It is a matter of great pride that Meezan Bank, first full service Islamic commercial bank is playing a key role in the promotion of Islamic banking in Pakistan and our work has been acknowledged globally.”
“I am confident that exchanging views at WIFE will enable Pakistan to play its due role,” he hoped.
The Director of IBA Centre for Excellence in Islamic Finance, Ahmed Ali Siddiqui said that IBA CEIF has emerged as a regional platform for excellence in Islamic finance.
He said that focus areas of IBA CEIF include the development of Islamic finance professionals and new human resource talent pool through industry linkages and international collaborations.

The motion is non-binding. Based on a few weekend shopping trips in downtown Montreal, it is having little effect on the city's commercial life. Over the past few years, Montrealers have learned to take the noise from the national assembly in stride.
In the dying days of its fall session late last month, the national assembly took time out from a jam-packed legislative agenda to vote on a motion inviting store clerks to stick to a French-only “bonjour” when greeting customers.
MONTREAL—Quebec's bonjour/hi flare-up has more to do with panicky pre-electoral jitters than with the dynamics of the language debate in Montreal.
What the political mechanics of the unanimous vote reveal about the mindset of Quebec parties 10 months before a fall election is more instructive.
After all, the same MNAs just spent part of the fall fretting over otherwise elusive face-covered Muslim women riding the city's transit system.
The Parti Québécois authored the motion. Its leader, Jean-François Lisée, subsequently bragged he had set a bear trap for the ruling Liberals.
One hesitates to rain on Lisée's parade. The opportunities for self-congratulations have been few and far between since he became party leader.
The latest Léger Marketing poll, published this month, pegged PQ support at barely 19 per cent. At this rate, Lisée will lead his sovereigntist party to a rout next fall. Under that worst-case scenario, the leader himself might not make it back to the national assembly, not that he would be terribly missed. In the Léger poll, only nine per cent picked him as their preferred premier. Only one in two PQ supporters believes he is better suited for the top job than his rivals.
The bonjour/hi ploy has served to remind voters of Lisée's existence but only at a price, for it also fed the widespread perception that for this PQ leader scoring points comes first and Quebec's social fabric only second.
On paper, Philippe Couillard's Liberals have assembled the ingredients for a successful re-election recipe. They have balanced the books and handed themselves a budget surplus to spread around in the last year of their mandate. Quebec's unemployment rate is at record low. But they have alienated a significant part of the middle class on the way to that surplus.
If an election had been held this month, Couillard would have been demoted to leader of the opposition.
The Léger poll puts the Liberals only four points behind the Coalition Avenir Québec provincewide. But among francophone voters, François Legault's party enjoys a massive 23-point lead. It is the overwhelming support of anglophone and allophone voters that has been keeping the Liberals afloat in the polls. That could change over the next few public opinion soundings.
It is hard to think of what more the premier could have done to send Quebec's English-speaking community the message that his government takes its support for granted than to vote for the bonjour/hi motion.
The backlash among anglophone voters that has attended the adoption of the motion is as understandable as it was predictable. The fact Couillard did not see it coming is just one of many signs that his Liberals are, if not in full panic mode, then very nearly there.
This month, Quebecers were treated to the unusual sight of the premier participating in a demonstration designed to pressure the federal government into giving more contracts to the Quebec City Davie shipyard. It was as if Couillard had lost Justin Trudeau's phone number or, alternatively, as if the prime minister was not taking his calls.
Couillard spent much of his year-end news conference last week attacking the CAQ. But he has just spent three years shoring up his cabinet with former CAQ star candidates and stealing pages off that party's policy platform.
At year's end, the next Quebec election looks like it is Legault's to lose. But he has been there before only to finish third on election night. Even as the centre-right CAQ is riding high provincially, Trudeau's anything-but-conservative government is riding higher federally.
For the first time in decades, the debate over Quebec's political future will not frame the ballot question in the next provincial election. As the main protagonists in the battle between federalism and sovereignty, both the Liberals and the PQ had come to surf on the issue. Based on the intellectual bankruptcy that seems to plague those two once formidable parties, it has been a soul-sucking experience.

Di Francesco not ruling out Roma bid for Berardi
Domenico Berardi proved to be a talisman for Eusebio Di Francesco at Sassuolo and could come under consideration for the new Roma boss.
by Omnisport News 14 Jun 2017, 20:51 IST
Sassuolo forward Domenico Berardi
New Roma boss Eusebio Di Francesco played a role alongside sporting director Monchi in the signing of Hector Moreno and refused to rule out a raid on former club Sassuolo for forward Domenico Berardi.
Di Francesco held his first news conference as Roma coach on Wednesday after his departure at the end of five celebrated seasons with Sassuolo.
The 47-year-old's arrival came on the back of Mexico defender Hector Moreno joining on a four-year deal from PSV and Di Francesco kept his counsel when it came to a swoop for Berardi, who won his maiden Italy cap against San Marino last month.
"You'll have to ask the sporting director [Monchi],” said Di Francesco, flanked by Monchi, when asked about Berardi.
"I can say that as a player he's very talented, but that doesn't mean he's a target for us. He has a top profile though.
"The choice of Hector Moreno was a shared one, I work with the sporting director to try and take Roma forward.
"We work for the good of Roma, and together we'll try to put together a very strong team."
Mediaset Premium reported on Tuesday that Inter's long-held interest in Berardi had cooled after Di Francesco's Roma predecessor Luciano Spalletti was brought in to helm a rebuilding job at San Siro.

Di Francesco insists he will remain true to the style that won Sassuolo a Serie A place for the first time in their history before progressing on to Europa League football last season.
"Even though I coached a small team like Sassuolo, I've never had a submissive attitude," he explained.
"With Roma the style of football definitely won't change, we'll always try to force the play and maybe change a little bit depending on the opponents. It depends on the situation.
"We'll start from the 4-3-3, which is how I've expressed myself best, but there could be changes depending on the game."
Ramsey 'can't wait' to work with Emery at Arsenal
Aaron Ramsey thinks Unai Emery could herald an "exciting time" at Arsenal, suggesting he could be ready to sign a new contract.

Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey
Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey says he "can't wait" to work under new head coach Unai Emery.
The former Paris Saint-Germain boss was appointed as successor to Arsene Wenger this month, with chief executive Ivan Gazidis describing him as the "ideal person" to take the club forward.
Ramsey has only a year left on his contract and has failed to come to an agreement over an extension.
However, his optimism around Emery's appointment suggests he could be prepared to commit his future to the Gunners.
Asked if he was looking forward to working with Emery, he said: "Of course. I haven't spoken to him at all yet, but I think it's an exciting time for the club.
"I can't wait to get back there now."
Ramsey was speaking after Wales' goalless friendly draw with Mexico, in which he admits he had to play through the pain of an ankle injury after captain Ashley Williams was forced off 21 minutes in.
"I rolled my ankle but I'd taken the armband from Ash and I thought I had to stay on and do my bit for the team," said the 27-year-old.
"It wasn't the best surface in the world and my ankle is a bit sore.
"Hopefully, there will be no lasting damage and it will settle down over the next few days."

Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, on Friday fingered the anti-open grazing laws in Benue and Taraba states as the primary causes of the violence and killings in both states. He made this disclosure while giving testimony to the Senate joint committee on police affairs and national intelligence. He was summoned to provide reasons for his inability to make any arrests after the January 1 violent breakout.
Gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen attacked two Benue communities on New Year Day and killed 73 persons. The police chief said the enactment of the laws against the Fulani should be blamed for the breakdown of law and order, adding that contrary to reports, arrests have been made.
Idris was categorical that the anti-open grazing laws in Benue and Taraba should be blamed for the continuing killings in the states, a source told The Nation. The police boss was said to have told the committee that over a hundred arrests have been made. He, however, did not give a clear answer on if the anti-grazing law should be scrapped or not.

Top Trump aide Flynn resigns over Russia contacts
WASHINGTON (AFP) -- Donald Trump‘s national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned amid controversy over his contacts with the Russian government Monday, a stunning first departure from the new president's inner circle less than a month after his inauguration.
The White House said Trump had accepted Flynn‘s resignation amid allegations the retired three-star general discussed US sanctions strategy with Russia's Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before taking office.
Flynn -- who once headed US military intelligence -- insisted he was honored to have served the American people in such a “distinguished” manner.
But he admitted he “inadvertently briefed” the now Vice President Mike Pence with “incomplete information” about his calls with Kislyak.
Pence had publicly defended Flynn, saying he did not discuss sanctions, putting his own credibility into question.
“Regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology,” read Flynn‘s letter, a copy of which was released by the White House.
The White House said Trump has named retired Lt. Gen. Joseph Kellogg, who was serving as a director on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to be interim national security adviser.
Flynn's resignation so early in an American administration is unprecedented, and comes after details of his calls with the Russian diplomat were made public -- upping the pressure on Trump to take action.
Several US media outlets on Monday reported that top Trump advisers were warned about Flynn‘s contacts with the Russians early this year.
Questions will now be raised about who knew about the calls and why Trump did not move earlier to replace Flynn.
Ahead of Flynn's resignation, White House spokesman Sean Spicer insisted Trump was not consulted about Flynn discussing sanctions, nor did he task his top national security aide to do so.
Asked if Trump was aware Flynn would raise sanctions with the Russian envoy, Spicer said: “No, absolutely not. No way.”
A former head of defense intelligence, Flynn‘s encounters with Russian President Vladimir Putin had already drawn criticism.
US media reported Monday the Justice Department had warned the White House that Flynn had misled senior administration officials about the contents of his talks with Kislyak, and that it could make him vulnerable to Russian blackmail.
The message was delivered in the last days of Barack Obama's administration by then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates -- who Trump sacked after she instructed Justice Department lawyers not to defend his contested travel ban.
CNN said then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and John Brennan, the CIA chief at the time, agreed the White House should be alerted about the concerns.
In the hours before his resignation, some Trump aides suggested that Flynn has the full support of the president.
Flynn had been an instrumental player in Trump‘s inner circle.
He was an early supporter of Trump's improbable bid for the presidency and has encouraged tougher policies on Iran and a softer policy on Russia.
That was a sharp break with the Obama administration, which introduced a wave of sanctions against Moscow over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea, support for separatists in eastern Ukraine and what US intelligence says were its attempts to sway the 2016 election in Trump's favor.
Washington and Moscow had also clashed over alleged war crimes in Syria, where Russia is accused of aiding the bombing of hospitals and other civilian targets. Despite this, Flynn had argued for rapprochement.
A few of Trump's fellow Republicans had joined their Democratic foes in urging Flynn to resign over a situation that had become a major embarrassment for the ruling party.
“It is his duty to be fully transparent and forthright in his actions -- anything less is unacceptable,” Rep. Mike Coffman, a Colorado Republican, said in a statement.
“If in fact he purposely misled the president, he should step down immediately.”
Flynn's resignation took place just over three weeks into Trump‘s presidency and days before his first official talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, discussions in which the president's national security adviser would normally have a key role.
The Justice Department and US Congress are both investigating possible links between Trump campaign advisers and Moscow, and US intelligence has concluded that Putin personally directed an operation to interfere in the US election.
[Dan K. Thomasson] Dear Donald, take a breath
We know it's not easy being you, Mr. President.
Even the guy you nominated to the Supreme Court, your first attempt at building a solid conservative majority there, has taken a shot at you.
Everybody knows by now that Judge Neil Gorsuch of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found your remarks about some of his fellow jurists “demoralizing and disheartening.” And it's obvious there are times you think being President Trump's (pun intended) everything else, including the judicial branch of government. Your handling of this particular situation squarely fits the pattern you've established in your first few weeks in office: Attack the source of your discomfort. Never ignore.
So, when Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said Gorsuch had expressed his personal discomfort, you turned your wrath on Blumenthal's credibility, citing a discrepancy about Vietnam duty revealed several years ago. Never mind that a White House adviser had confirmed Gorsuch's remarks.
Well ho hum, just another day in the White House Now You See it Now You Don't Office.
Why, just before Gorsuch gave you heartburn, you tied into the media — a favorite target — after citing false figures about rising crime rates. You said the rates are growing rapidly when they actually are in decline over all despite the exception of a few cities.
To your credit, you came back the next day with more accurate statistics that showed crime is far below what it was 47 years ago. The numbers showed a recent 14 percent jump in the number of murders but much of that apparently can be attributed to wild and wooly Chicago, where the mayor and everyone else seem to be at a loss about how to prevent the daily slaughter.
As one sits back watching snafu after snafu arise out of your apparent desire to change the world and clean up its ills in biblical time — the alleged seven days, or somewhere near that — one must wonder if the mistakes are from an inept, politically untutored staff or just a boss who doesn't understand how this constitutionally guided country really works.
You seem to sense that making up things is workable and useful because your loyal supporters really don't care as long as the promises you made brashly throughout the primaries and general election campaigns are fulfilled. So, you lie.
“Who cares? So did (name your president),” you'd say.
Your penchant for having things both ways is clear in your promise that this nation of mayhem will be significantly cleaned up when criminal immigrants are dealt with yet dedicating yourself to preserving one of the true causes of modern crime, the Second Amendment's nearly unfettered authorization of the distribution of firearms. Gun control? What the heck has that got to do with anything? Once again, check with Chicago.
Clearly, there are going to be mistakes in the early days of a presidency, especially when a new chief executive is out to fulfill campaign promises without first determining what already is being done about particular issues and how those efforts can be tailored to meet his own objectives. Prudence is a powerful tool as one makes his way through the pitfalls of the most difficult job on earth.
The presidential ban on immigrants from seven nations under injunction is a timely example. The ban was cobbled together by Donald Trump and his key advisers without regard to its public impact and practical application to those already in the immigration pipeline, not to mention the damage it might cause to our nation's image as one of the most open and fair societies in world history. Also, a more thoughtful and lengthy debate among advisers might have produced action without overtones of religious prejudice.
Trump has established the national mainline media as the boogeyman out to thwart his every initiative. It's a lousy position to be in, resulting in him being compared with the major demagogues of history, who have always needed an imagined evil target to justify radical policies and behavior. I'm sure you can come up with an example or two from the not-too-distant past.
Meantime, Gorsuch's march toward Senate confirmation may have been helped by his benefactor's imprudence.

Washington — The Department of Veterans Affairs warned Wednesday it was unexpectedly running out of money for a program that offers veterans private-sector health care, forcing it to hold back on some services that lawmakers worry could cause delays in medical treatment.
It is making an urgent request to Congress to allow it to shift money from other programs to fill the sudden budget gap.
VA Secretary David Shulkin made the surprising revelation at a Senate hearing. He cited a shortfall of more than $1 billion in the Choice program due to increased demand from veterans for federally paid medical care outside the VA. The VA had previously assured Congress that funding for Choice would last until early next year.
“We need your help on the best solution to get more money into the Choice account,” Shulkin told the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. “If there is no action at all by Congress, then the Choice program will dry up by mid-August.”
The department began instructing VA medical centers late last week to limit the number of veterans it sent to private doctors so it can slow spending in the Choice account. Some veterans were being sent to Defense Department hospitals, VA facilities located farther away, or other alternative locations “when care is not offered in VA,” according to a June 7 internal VA memorandum.
The VA is also scrambling to tap other parts of its budget, including about $620 million in carry-over money that it had set aside for use in the next fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. It was asking field offices to hold off on spending for certain medical equipment to help cover costs, according to a call the department held with several congressional committees Tuesday night.
It did not rule out taking money from VA hospitals.
Shulkin on Wednesday insisted that veterans will not see an impact in their health care. He blamed in part the department's excessive use of an exception in the Choice program that allowed veterans to go to private doctors if they faced an “excessive burden” in traveling to a VA facility. Typically, Choice restricts use of private doctors only when veterans must wait 30 days or more for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles to a facility.
Medical centers were now being asked to hew more closely to Choice's restrictions before sending veterans to private doctors, Shulkin said.
He described the shortfall in the Choice program as mostly logistical, amounting to different checking accounts within the VA that needed to be combined to meet various payments.
Some senators were in disbelief.
They noted that VA had failed to anticipate or fix budget problems many times before. Two years ago, the VA endured sharp criticism from Congress when it was forced to seek emergency help to cover a $2.5 billion budget shortfall due in part to expensive hepatitis C treatments, or face closing some VA hospitals. Congress allowed VA to shift money from its Choice account.
“I am deeply concerned,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., explaining that VA should have “seen this coming.” She said veterans in her state were already reporting delays in care and being asked to travel to VA facilities more than 4 hours away.
Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the top Democrat on the panel, expressed impatience.
“For months we've been asking about the Choice spend rate and we were never provided those answers to make an informed decision,” he said. “No one wants to delay care for veterans — no one — so we will act appropriately. For that to happen this late in the game is frustrating to me.”
Major veterans' organizations said they worried the shortfall was the latest sign of poor budget planning.
Carl Blake, an associate executive director at Paralyzed Veterans of America, said the VA has yet to address how it intends to address a growing appeals backlog as well as increased demands for care. “The VA could be staring at a huge hole in its budget for 2018,” he said. “It's not enough to say we have enough money, that we can move it around. That is simply not true.”
The shortfall surfaced just weeks after lawmakers were still being assured the Choice program was under budget, with $1.1 billion estimated to be left over in the account on Aug. 7, when the program was originally set to expire. That VA estimate prompted Congress to pass legislation last March to extend the program until the Choice money ran out.
Shulkin said he learned about the shortfall just last Thursday.
Currently, more than 30 percent of VA appointments are made in the private sector, up from fewer than 20 percent in 2014, as the VA's 1,700 health facilities struggle to meet growing demands for medical care. During the 2016 campaign, President Donald Trump criticized the VA for long wait times and mismanagement, pledging to give veterans more choice in seeing outside providers.

Training camp is over and the preseason has begun. Let's take a look at 24 things we learned from the Carolina Panthers' 2017 camp.
Offense
New guard/tackle Taylor Moton is a do-it-all rookie who shined all camp. He showed the ability to anchor down in pass protection and steam ahead to create a hole for a running back.
Daryl Williams will most-likely win the starting right tackle position, which doesn't look to be a bad thing. He handled himself well against Jadeveon Clowney and the Texans in the first few drives.
The Panthers will keep five receivers at the least when they enter the season. Damiere Byrd was the front-runner for the fifth spot by the end of camp, and he only reinforced that notion against the Texans.
Center Tyler Larsen may have found a home in Carolina. The now-primary backup center was promoted from the practice squad last year and thrown into the fire. He has now secured control of the primary backup spot behind starter Ryan Kalil.
Christian McCaffrey appeared to be as good as the hype, which is pretty rare when a player is talked up so much. He was the star of camp, no doubt.
Cam Newton didn't throw, but he looked more than ready to for when the time comes. He was experiencing soreness from his offseason surgery all camp.
Ed Dickson did just enough to keep the backup tight end position, but he also benefited from a lack of push from those behind him.
Devin Funchess was the star receiver of camp, catching the majority of first team offense passes when Greg Olsen was not.
Second-round pick Curtis Samuel did not touch a team drill the entire camp due to his hamstring issues.
Fourth-string quarterback Garrett Gilbert looks like a lot more than just a camp arm. He won't make the roster, but if he goes unsigned, look for him to be back next camp.
Chris Manhertz is one of the most athletic players on the team. If he could learn to run crisper routes and catch the ball more naturally, he would be a force to be reckoned with.
Defense
Captain Munnerlyn inserted himself into the starting slot position, completing the trio of the Panthers secondary. He was out half of camp, but began making plays as soon as he got on the field.
Kawann Short has become the new “Big Money” of the Panthers defense, a title formerly owned by defensive end Charles Johnson. Short has been a homewrecker for the interior line, especially when paired next to Star Lotulelei.
Rookie Daeshon Hall is raw for sure, but will get better as the season progresses. At the beginning of camp he was quiet, but he began to show up in the last few days.
Efe Obada will be on the Panthers practice squad this year. He also flashed in the game against the Texans, registering a sack, two tackles (one for a loss), a pass deflection and a quarterback hit on just five snap counts.
James Bradberry has grown into a stellar cornerback, and Daryl Worley will be forced to step up because of this.
David Mayo has become the undisputed leader for the second-team defense, and shows many of Luke Kuechly's qualities.
Jeremy Cash has made the full transition to linebacker, but will be the worst one to make the team. Jared Norris, the other second-string linebacker, is leagues ahead of him.
Mike Adams looks fantastic for 36 years old. He and Julius Peppers should both play far better than their age would suggest.
At the moment, it does not look like there is a spot on the roster for linebacker Ben Boulware. The local fan favorite has not shown anything worth keeping him around for and the position is stacked.
Zack Sanchez might make the team due to lack of experienced depth at the cornerback position, but Jeff Richards and Cole Luke could easily take his spot with good preseasons.

× For Waffle House bravery, lawmakers hail James Shaw Jr. as ‘Tennessee's hero'
When a gunman entered an Antioch, Tennesee, diner and opened fire on patrons, Brennan McMurray and James Shaw Jr. bolted toward the back door. In the back of the Waffle House, McMurray tries to funnel customers, including his best friend, Shaw, into the restaurant's bathrooms.
“He sometimes doesn't listen to me,” McMurray said, standing next to Shaw on the floor of the state House of Representatives on Tuesday, “and this, by far, is the best time that you haven't listened to me.”
Shaw, of course, returned to the dining area, where he wrested a rifle away from the gunman and tossed it over the counter before shoving the shooter out the door early Sunday.
A bullet grazed Shaw's forearm, and he suffered a burn from grabbing the rifle's barrel, but he saved himself, McMurray and all but four other diners and employees in the process.
Shaw has repeatedly said he acted out of a selfish motive — survival — but, still, he has been roundly hailed as a hero. That continued Tuesday, when the state General Assembly officially recognized his heroism, along with his “penchant for honesty,” in a joint resolution.
“No matter his motivations, Mr. Shaw is indeed a hero; his actions on that fateful morning are unfathomable to most, indescribable by even the chief of police, and very poignant to the citizens of Nashville, who are deeply grateful for his brave actions in the face of extreme adversity that saved many lives,” the resolution said.
Wearing a tan suit and striped shirt, Shaw received a standing ovation from lawmakers as he entered the House chambers. He received another after assistant chief clerk Daniel Hicks read the resolution aloud.
A reserved smile spread across Shaw's face amid the applause, and state Rep. Jason Powell told the 29-year-old that he embodied the state's volunteer spirit.
“You are my hero and Tennessee's hero,” Powell said.
The Nashville native stepped to the podium and repeated his claim that he acted solely out of self-preservation but acknowledged that in doing so, he was able to save the lives of others, which he called “one of the greatest things you could do.”
Calling himself a “genuine person,” Shaw apologized to the families of those who died and said he had recently visited survivors in Vanderbilt University Medical Center. He previously set up an online fundraiser for victims' families.
“This was the true test of a man,” the father of one said, wiping away a tear as several supporters, including his parents, siblings and minister, looked on.
State Rep. Brenda Gilmore told her fellow lawmakers that Shaw was a role model, not only for young people, but for the General Assembly, as well — a notion outlined in the closing words of the resolution passed Tuesday.
“If a hero is ‘a person noted for courageous acts or nobility of character,' then James Shaw, Jr. is a hero twice over, for he has demonstrated both his courage and character in a manner few could ever attempt to emulate.”

Shannon Sharpe, Rod Smith. And now, Demaryius Thomas?
During the Denver Broncos shutout win over the New York Jets on Sunday, Thomas put himself among the ranks of the greatest receivers in team history by passing Sharpe in both touchdowns and receiving yards. With 56 touchdowns, Thomas is now second all-time in Broncos history behind Smith (68) and ahead of Sharpe (55), and D.T. is also second in yards, with 8,475 in his career.
I wanted you to be gr8, but not catch me. 😂😂😂😂😂. Congrats @DemaryiusT I know how hard you've work to make this moment happen and to be there for this tm👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 https://t.co/2sex1TH6V7 — shannon sharpe (@ShannonSharpe) December 11, 2017
Many have been critical of Thomas and his seemingly weekly drops, but Sharpe has long been a proponent of the tall receivers' skills.
“It means the world,” Thomas said after the game of passing Sharpe and being mentioned with both the Hall of Fame tight end and Ring of Famer Rod Smith. “Because those guys are like my mentors. When I came in my first year, I sat down with Rod and I sat down with Shannon. They always challenged me to be better than them and be great.
“Without them and some of my teammates pushing me so hard, none of this would have happened.”
Since being drafted in the first round in 2010, Thomas has put together a phenomenal career with the Broncos. After taking a few years to get his body in shape, he enjoyed five straight 1,000-yard seasons, and this year could be his sixth straight if he catches for 229 yards in the last three games.

You'll be waking up a little more awesome tomorrow. Whoa! Something went wrong. Try again?
The Georgia native's career year is difficult to choose because from 2012-14, he had 1,400-plus yards with 10-plus scores each time. No doubt he was one of the greatest receivers in the league during those years, with Peyton Manning throwing him the football, and he's got five straight Pro Bowl appearances and a Super Bowl ring to show for it all.
And, now, with another 3,000 receiving yards, he can become the all-time Broncos leader, surpassing Smith. That will take at least a few more years, so enjoy his time in the Mile High City, fans.
If you've ever had the sneaking suspicion that one of your colleagues is a lot easier to get along with after they've been sufficiently caffeinated, you're not wrong: According to a new study, coffee actually makes you like people more. Conducted by researchers at the University of California, Davis and published this spring in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, the study honestly comes as little surprise to me — but then again, I am a famously misanthropic coffee enthusiast, so I'm already quite familiar with the “But first, coffee” lifestyle. (Seriously. You do not want to talk to me before I have had my morning coffee. Trust me on this.)
Although a large body of research has been carried out on the effects of coffee on individuals, not a lot has been done on how it affects groups — so that's what the writers of the current paper aimed to explore, according to a press release from UC Davis. The study consisted of two experiments For the first, the participants — all undergraduate students — were split into two groups, with one being asked to drink 12 ounces of caffeinated coffee beforehand and the other going coffeeless. Then, they were each tasked with spending 15 minutes reading about the Occupy Wall Street movement before discussing the movement within their groups. The conversations were coded according to a point system developed by the researchers (gotta make the whole thing quantifiable somehow); additionally, the participants completed a self-evaluation after the task was finished.
When the researchers took a closer look at the coded conversation scores, they found that participants who had drunk caffeinated coffee both “delivered a higher quality of arguments when working through simple group activities” and “had more of them,” as well, according the press release. Overall, caffeine seemed to "increase a group's focus and encourage each person to participate more in discussions,” states the press release. Even more interestingly, though, the researchers also found that people who drank coffee before participating in a group task thought more highly of both their own performance and the group's performance than the participants who didn't drink coffee did, as evidenced by their self-evaluations.
But after the conclusion of this experiment, the researchers still had some questions. Specifically, they wanted to know whether it was the caffeine in the coffee that seemed to make people like each other more, or whether it was the act of drinking coffee together that did it. So, they tweaked the original experiment such that all of the participants drank coffee together — but, unbeknownst to the participants, some of them were given caffeinated coffee, while others were given decaf. The effects, however, were the same: Drinking caffeinated coffee correlated with improved focus and alertness, as well as with participants rating both their own performance and the group's performance more highly.
As study author Vasu Unnava explained to Psypost, the researchers think the heightened alertness the caffeine inspired in the participants is likely what brought on the results. “For … people [who regularly drink coffee], it looks like coffee does make them feel more alert, focuses their thinking on the topic or task at hand, and has them participate more in group tasks,” Unnava said. “So if you are a coffee drinker, it looks like coffee helps you do better in group tasks.”
The results are particularly interesting when you consider who frequently coffee factors into work situations: It's usually readily available; meetings are often held over coffee; there's even the whole idea of the social coffee break — what's referred to as kaffeeklatsch in German and fika in Swedish. Although there's certainly something to be said for the social aspect of these work-related gatherings, the caffeine in the drinks that's so often served at them might have more to do with the general sense of good will the meetings inspire than we may have thought.
The current research does, of course, have some limitations. It's worth noting, for example, that the topic of conversation in the experiments was something on which most of the participants already agreed — that is, they weren't coming at the discussion task with wildly differing opinions right from the get-go. “What the results might be if there is a disagreement is an interesting issue to study further,” noted Unnava to Psypost. They also only assessed group discussion as the task; the study didn't gather any data on how caffeinated coffee and, say, group problem-solving or group physical work might — or might not — relate.
Still, though; the results are fascinating, and the whole subject is clearly worth more study. And wouldn't you know it? UC Davis actually has its very own Coffee Center, a research center that exists solely for the purpose of researching coffee. I very much enjoy that this place exists — so of course, I have one very important question about it: How can I get a job there?
Call me, UC Davis. I'll be waiting right here, coffee pot in hand.

Clearly, the love is mutual between Bruno Mars and Zendaya. After the Spider-Man: Homecoming star gave a spot-on impersonation of Mars's "24K Magic" on MTV's Lip Sync Battle earlier this summer, she was at it again, but this time in the artist's new music video, "Versace on the Floor."
Mars, who gave us a peek at the sultry number during the 2017 Teen Choice Awards, dropped the entire video later on Sunday night, surprising us with a special guest appearance from his latest muse. And let's just say Zendaya fits the part.
During the video's five-and-a-half minutes, the 20-year-old dances, lip syncs, and strikes sexy poses in a hotel room, wearing nothing more than a silver embellished Versace mini dress with a plunging neckline. Meanwhile, Mars plays the piano and belts out the lyrics from the hit in the room next door.
The dream-like atmosphere is further enhanced by some serious mood lighting that resembles a romantic starry night, which prompts Zendaya's dress to sparkle even more. Her super sleek strands offset by a new crop of fringe continues to elevate her bombshell status.
Shortly after the video's release, the beauty took to Instagram to share the news. “When the flyest man out here calls you for one of the flyest songs out..you make it happen. #VersaceOnTheFloor @brunomars,” she wrote alongside a snippet of the pair giving each other sexy eyes.

New Delhi: All-rounder Ben Stokes will not travel with the rest of England`s squad for the Ashes, though no final decision has been taken on his participation in the test series in Australia, the England Cricket Board (ECB) said on Friday.
The 26-year-old Stokes, England`s vice captain and one of their most important players, was suspended after he and teammate Alex Hales were arrested following an altercation outside a Bristol nightclub last month and released under investigation.
Pace bowler Steven Finn has been added to the Ashes squad and will travel to Australia with the rest of the team on Oct. 28, the ECB said in a statement on its website. (www.ecb.co.uk)
The five-test series starts in Brisbane on Nov. 23.
The January transfer window signings of Danny Venter and Sandile Zuke have given Lamontville Golden Arrows coach Clinton Larsen a sudden selection headache as his small squad has been bolstered for the second half of the season.
“It's a nice headache to have. I think having these players available means they put each other under pressure to perform consistently so that they can start. And‚ like I've said‚ that's a good headache to have and it keeps everyone on their toes.
“We'll keep making sure we select the best possible XI for every game‚” said Larsen in the ahead of the derby against AmaZulu at the Goodwill Zwelithini Stadium in Umlazi on Saturday night.
Venter‚ 30‚ was signed from Free State Stars and scored for the club last Sunday in their 2-2 draw against Baroka‚ where Zuke was also a starter and influential in the match.
Zuke‚ also 30‚ joined from Chippa United in a move that delighted Larsen.
“I couldn't believe it when I was told he was available. I snapped him up immediately. I can't believe Chippa let him go.”
Arrows have won just one of their last 15 games but earlier in the season did hammer AmaZulu 4-1 at home and have a three-point advantage over their neighbours in the standings. Arrows have drawn 11 of 19 leagues matches this season‚ more than any other top-flight team.
“It is just too many draws but you cannot look too deeply into that. It is just that we are not converting the chances that we are creating‚” Larsen said.
“That happens to a lot of teams. But like I've said before‚ when you can't win a game‚ at least get a point. You don't want to lose it. Take away our 11 draws and we would be talking as different story. We'd be talking relegation.
“We just have to be patient. Since my technical staff and I took over at this club‚ after promotion‚ we have never been in the bottom three.
“This team has never struggled in a relegation fight and that is something we are proud of. I don't think that a newly-promoted team has ever done that before.
“The thing I'm most pleased about is the growth in the team‚ the ever-improving style of play that we are trying to implement at the club and I keep saying: ‘Rome wasn't built in a day'‚” added Larsen.

Manchester City have no intention of selling John Stones this summer.
Reports have claimed the Premier League champions would consider selling the England defender, whose game time in the second half of the season has been limited by injury and increased competition for places.
But it is understood City remain happy with the progress the 23-year-old centre-back has made under manager Pep Guardiola and do not want to lose him.
Stones, a £47.5million signing from Everton two years ago, impressed in the first half of City's title-winning campaign but has not featured regularly since suffering a hamstring injury in November.

He has since had knee and concussion problems and is currently sidelined with an abductor strain. The £57million signing of Aymeric Laporte in January has also reduced opportunities.
Guardiola consistently speaks highly of Stones and expressed hope at the weekend he would be fit again before the end of the season.
He said: "Hopefully he can play the last games and get to the World Cup. I think he will be fine."

Two bodies have been found in the hunt for a pair of 13-year-old girls who vanished after posting eerie photos of themselves on an abandoned railway line.
Abigail 'Abby' Williams and Liberty 'Libby' German were last seen on Monday afternoon when they were dropped off in the secluded, rural spot.
They were meant to be picked up later that afternoon by a family member but never returned.
Police in Delphi, Indiana, US, have confirmed the discovery of two bodies on Tuesday night.
The youngsters were last seen in photos posted on Liberty's Snapchat profile at 2.07pm on Monday as they walked along the abandoned railway track.

They were walking along the Monon High Bridge, which is featured on a list of 10 endangered historic sites in Indiana. The bridge has no guard rails.
Police have refused to rule out foul play or confirm whether any suspects are at large, according to theindychannel.com .
Delphi Police Chief Steve Mullins said: “I think people are able to draw their own conclusions about this situation.
"And they are smart enough to figure out what this situation warrants them to think. So that's all we have to say about that.”
(Photo: Liberty German/Snapchat)
Sergeant Kim Riley , from Indiana State Police, added: “The family asked us to thank the communities around Delphi and the people here in Delphi for assisting in attempting to locate the two young children who were missing here earlier.
"We have a very good community and they are very strong. And they are able to draw their own conclusions about this whole situation very successfully.”
The Delphi Community Schools Corporation confirmed the tragedy in a letter to students.
It said: "It is with heavy hearts that the school corporation day comes to an end.
"It is our understanding that the two bodies found were those of our two missing Delphi Community Middle School students."
The girls' families had previously spoken of their hopes they would return home safely.
Liberty's grandfather Mike Patty told wlfi.com : “We're just praying for their safe return. I'm upset and confused.
"Obviously, very distraught. I'm just worried. All I want to do is have the girls get home safe.”
People beef about irises the way they beef about magnolias and roses. They don't bloom long enough.
This is true, but it is part of their rare charm. You must put down your phone and your tallboy and get out and see and smell them while they last. The same advice goes for peonies.
That is why a visit to the Royal Botanical Gardens' Laking Garden is a must. Soon.
Withering weather is pushing all the beauties of spring to bloom fast and furious.
The collection is laid out in grids with names tucked in amongst the foliage. That is why you know the iris with the pink ruffles and white ground is named Crinoline. The Historic Iris Preservation Society says it has a "refreshing personality."
Crinoline is a tall bearded iris. The RBG collection contains about 600 types but there are also beardless irises, which I prefer. A mainstay of the beardless type is the Siberian iris: tall, slender and with a less complicated profile than the ones with beards.
I have a few Siberians, but just a few, because the conditions are not right for them in my garden. It's too dry.
I used to have quite a few tall bearded ones, but over time they have faded away.
The blame is mine. Though irises are pretty easy to grow if a lot of sun is available, they do need to be dug up and divided every three to five years. This is called renovation, a word most people are allergic to.
My irises are also getting crowded by other creeping perennials, and sometimes weeds. They resist this and sulk and shrink. Irises like a room of their own, just like Virginia Woolf, with their rugged rhizomes free to bask in the sun.
ICC Champions Trophy 2017: Mashrafe Mortaza slams taunting cartoons against India ahead of semi-finals
The Bangladesh captain says these actions do not do any good for his team.
@Rupinzel by Rupin Kale News 15 Jun 2017, 11:25 IST
Mortaza says such derogatory posts are not expected from the fans
What's the story?
Following yet another instance of derogatory cartoons and memes about India from Bangladesh cricket fans, Mashrafe Mortaza slammed the actions but stated that these actions are completely out of the players' control.
Talking ahead of Bangladesh's semi-final clash against India, he said, “These things are not expected and not in the control of players. A match against India is just another game for us and if these cartoons are meant to lift our convictions levels, they just don't work.”
The cartoons have been pouring in on social media ever since Australia lost to England in Group A and India beat South Africa in Group B, thereby setting up a Bangladesh-India semi-final clash at the ICC Champions Trophy.
The Bangladesh captain is clearly not happy looking at these posts and believes that they have no positive impact on the psyche of his team.
In case you didn't know...
This is not the first time when Bangladesh cricket fanatics have vehemently attacked Indian cricket riding on the backs of social media anonymity. When the two sides were to clash in the Asia Cup final last year, a rather unskillful photoshop of Taskin Ahmed carrying MS Dhoni's severed head was promoted incessantly by these fans.
India will face Bangladesh at the Edgbaston Cricket Ground later today (June 15) and the winner of this contest will face Pakistan in the final to have a shot at winning the big trophy.
Bangladesh fans have taken up various social media platforms to show support for their team in a rather tasteless and deprecatory manner. Cartoons of a scared dog with Indian flag superimposed on it being chased by a tiger with a Bangladesh flag being superimposed on it are being shared and re-shared by them.

The details
Commenting on the pressure of being in the semi-final of an ICC tournament, Mortaza stated that India has a lot more on stake than Bangladesh. He added that the pressure on India will be higher considering the country's huge population and craze for cricket.
However, he was quick to add that both the teams are sure to face the heat in such a big contest. He also believes that if his team takes it as a semi-final, they will be under a lot of pressure and hence, they should try and think of it as a normal game of cricket.
What next?
You would hope that both the teams have been able to forget about superficial things like mindless internet trolls and that the players will step onto the field with a positive mindset today.
The last time these two teams met in limited over cricket was in the 2016 World T20 when India constrained Bangladesh from scoring two runs in three deliveries and won the match by one run. And for all cricket fan's sake, let's hope today's match will be just as dramatic and full of action.
Author's take
While Mortaza truly does not have any control over what his countrymen do on social media platforms, the posts they are sharing have touched the highest level of repugnance. It is disheartening to see this kind of behaviour from cricket fans.
While Bangladesh's cricket has grown a lot in the last few years, the psyche of most of its fans remains bitterly immature.

You've read it time and time again: “For an unknown reason, the vehicle crossed the center line, overcorrected and rolled into the ditch.”
Jack Dillon Young, the 20-year-old from Texas, apologized for killing 13 people on a church minibus several weeks ago. He was texting while driving, and typed one letter too many before looking up to see what was happening on the road. A witness saw him cross the center-line multiple times, and even summoned the police. But they were too late. He was sorry he shattered the lives of 13 families, and yet, if he's out driving ever again, you can bet he'll be back doing the same thing.
Almost on a daily basis there's news of someone entering the ditch, overcorrecting and wrecking their vehicle. Or worse yet, someone crossing the center line and having a head on collision with another vehicle. Maybe you know of people, personally, who have been involved in this situation, I know I do. Where it is always reported as to whether a seat belt is being worn, or not, it never comes out in the report whether they're texting while driving. But a look at the phone records compared to the time of the accident would easily identify what actually happened.
If someone thinks it's so important to text while propelling a two-ton vehicle at high speeds, they take the risk of killing themselves. But when others are at risk, also, something has to be done.
I cannot remember the last time I was on the highway and was not threatened by someone texting while driving. It's become epidemic. I've even seen texting in bumper to bumper traffic. Having had two instances of near tragic results, personally, tells me it's high time to speak up.
The programs that have been developed to address texting while driving are a big waste of money. Why? Because it's our human nature to think it's always going to happen to someone else, and not to us. Laws can be enacted, but if they're not able to be enforced, what's the use? I see the attention given to drunk driving, but statistically, texting is much more of an issue than drunk driving. Yet, very little has been done to address it.
I've seen people texting to the point that I'm scared to pass them. I've called law enforcement, and they do follow up, only to see the driver put the phone in their lap until the law enforcement passes by. Then they resume texting.
It wouldn't be so frustrating if there was no answer to this problem, but there is, and it could be addressed immediately. Every phone has GPS capability. When it's noted that the phone is traveling at more than 15 mph, the phone automatically shuts off. If you have an emergency, you pull over and your phone can be turned back on. Does this mean the passengers' phones don't work either? Yes, it does. Maybe we'll have to go back to the Stone Age and actually have a conversation with the driver, like old times. (I've seen husbands and wives at lunch that never talk to one another, because they're texting or on Facebook the entire time). What about navigating through an unfamiliar city? Yes, back to the Stone Age, again, by purchasing a GPS unit and entering the destination before you start on your trip. (Many vehicles don't allow certain entries when the car is in motion, already).
Understand that I'm not on my high horse lecturing others, as the urge to text has bitten me, also. I think of how much I can get done on a long trip if I'm on the phone communicating to people. We all need to have this forcefully taken away from us.
Many will not agree with me, and probably won't, right up to the time a loved one is loss. Then you'll be sorry. Let's not wait that long, please! Call your congressman with your concerns.

Monday, March 19, 2018 at 7:31 pm |

President Donald Trump is preparing to impose a package of $60 billion in annual tariffs against China, following through on a long-time threat that he says will punish China for intellectual property infringement and create more American jobs.
The tariff package, which Mr. Trump plans to unveil by Friday, was confirmed by four senior administration officials.
Senior aides had presented Mr. Trump with a $30 billion tariff package that would apply to a range of products, but Mr. Trump directed them to roughly double the scope of the new trade levies. The package could be applied to more than 100 products, which Mr. Trump argues were developed by using trade secrets the Chinese stole from U.S. companies or forced them to hand over in exchange for market access.
The situation remains fluid, and Mr. Trump has shown a tendency to back off economic threats at the last minute. In recent weeks, however, he has shown a willingness to unilaterally impose tariffs, even amid objections from advisers who fear starting a global trade war. And several administration officials said Mr. Trump was particularly determined to follow through on this specific set of tariffs, as criticism of U.S.-China relations was at the center of his presidential campaign.
Mr. Trump plans to impose the tariffs at a time when he has much of the world on edge over his pivot to protectionism. His 2016 campaign was built around promises to put “America First” on every issue, but some aides managed to scale back his plans for trade restrictions in 2017 as he muscled a tax cut bill through Congress.
That has changed this year, however, with the tax bill signed into law and some of the people who had warned against protectionism exiting the White House.
One of Mr. Trump's top advisers, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, is in Buenos Aires on Monday and Tuesday meeting with global finance ministers. The foreign officials are trying to determine whether Mr. Trump plans to follow through on his threats to engage in a “trade war.”
Many of the financial ministers at the meeting have alleged that China should make changes to its trade policies, but so far most have tried to cajole Beijing multilaterally, a strategy that Mr. Trump has said doesn't work.
Still, Mr. Trump's approach to China has been uneven. He has tried to both befriend Chinese leader Xi Jinping while also isolate him, particularly on economic issues. On Sunday, the Treasury Department had to backtrack on an embarrassing misstep when a senior official said he had suspended economic talks with China, when a formal decision had not yet been made.
Here Comes the Next Financial Crisis by Nomi Prins – The Nation
Trump's deregulators are setting the economy on fire.
There's been lots of fire and fury around Washington lately, including a brief government shutdown. In Donald Trump's White House, you can hardly keep up with the ongoing brouhahas from North Korea to Robert Mueller's Russian investigation, while it already feels like ages since the celebratory mood over the vast corporate tax cuts Congress passed last year. But don't be fooled: none of that is as important as what's missing from the picture. Like a disease, in the nation's capital it's often what you can't see that will, in the end, hurt you most.
Amid a roaring stock market and a planet of upbeat CEOs, few are even thinking about the havoc that a multi-trillion-dollar financial system gone rogue could inflict upon global stability. But watch out. Even in the seemingly best of times, neglecting Wall Street is a dangerous idea. With a rag-tag Trumpian crew of ex-bankers and Goldman Sachs alumni as the only watchdogs in town, it's time to focus, because one thing is clear: Donald Trump's economic team is in the process of making the financial system combustible again.
Collectively, the biggest US banks already have their get-out-out-of-jail-free cards and are now sitting on record profits after, not so long ago, triggering sweeping unemployment, wrecking countless lives, and elevating global instability. (Not a single major bank CEO was given jail time for such acts.) Still, let's not blame the dangers lurking at the heart of the financial system solely on the Trump doctrine of leaving banks alone. They should be shared by the Democrats who, under President Barack Obama, believed, and still believe, in the perfection of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010.
While Dodd-Frank created important financial safeguards like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, even stronger long-term banking reforms were left on the sidelines. Crucially, that law didn't force banks to separate the deposits of everyday Americans from Wall Street's complex derivatives transactions. In other words, it didn't resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 (axed in the Clinton era).
Wall Street is now thoroughly emboldened as the financial elite follows the mantra of Kelly Clarkston's hit song: “What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.” Since the crisis of 2007–08, the Big Six US banks—JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley—have seen the share price of their stocks significantly outpace those of the S&P 500 index as a whole.

Moses Foh-Amoaning, Legal Practitioner
Lawyer Moses Foh-Amoaning has proposed some solutions he believes would in the long run ‘save' homosexuals from what he describes as an unnatural practice. In his view, exorcism is one ideal way to get that ‘spirit' out.
The legal practitioner who is a strong Anti-gay campaigner on Metro TVs Good Evening Ghana told host Paul Adom-Otchere that homosexuality in his view is a spiritual battle and hence requires the supernatural intervention of God to deal with it.
“The power of the Lord is capable of delivering people from that thing because all of this is a spiritual battle anyway. I will take you to people in this country who by the grace of God by the power of the Holy Spirit have come out of it. God is capable of delivering people like that. There is nothing that the Lord can't do, “he said.
Mr Foh-Amoaning, a member of the National Coalition for Proper Human Sexual Rights and Family Values mentioned that though some find themselves subscribing to the ‘anomaly' due to monetary issues, peer pressure and medical problems, there are those who purely are engaged in it because they just feel like it. He also reiterated the importance of seeing the act as ‘abnormal' and a deviation from God's original plan for mankind.
“There are those who think it is a lifestyle , it is a right, let's do it and not only do they want to do it alone, they want to encourage other people to do it and then foist it on all our heads, that I think is wrong and that can be tackled,” he explained.
He added that his Coalition was in the process of providing aid for ‘such' people, saying, “Our Coalition , we are proposing a comprehensive legislative solution to the problem which will isolate those who get into it because of medical problems and those who got into it because of peer pressure, monetary problems and environmental problems. Those, we will deal with and help them, and we will create an environment where there is legal, psychological, psychiatric and medical help and there is spiritual help for them”.
The senior law lecturer at the Ghana law school who is known for widely proclaiming his intolerance for the gay rights movement is one of many advocating for the phenomenon not to be accepted.
The current speaker of parliament, Professor Mike Oquaye who is also known to have a strong opinion about homosexuality as earlier reported, described it as “abominable" and has called for a complete ban on the act.
Professor Mike Oquaye who is also a man of God said, “It is unfortunate that people have become so liberal that they will want to liberalise Christianity…even priests are approving of homosexuality and allowing a man and a man [to] marry, a woman and a woman [to] marry and these are manifest abominations."
The issue of legalizing homosexuality gained massive public interest in 2011 when Late President John Evans Atta Mills strongly refused to legalize it, after the UK threatened to reconsider aids given to countries that are against homosexuality. Reports indicated that Britain put on hold ‘£19 million in aid to Malawi because of concerns including its treatment of gays'.
The interest however doubled when President Nana Addo in an interview with Al Jazeera last year said homosexuality was something bound to happen in Ghana even though he did not have it on his agenda as a president to encourage it.
President Akufo-Addo mentioned during the interview however that, what would push the government to legalize homosexuality may be social pressure from individual and groups saying those are major contributors to the legalization of gayism in most parts of Europe and America.
The president's response on the topic received major disapproval from stakeholders and even the supposed gay community in the country, mostly because it defies most of our cultural and religious beliefs and the homosexuals believe it will subject them to public ridicule.
Homosexuality is illegal in about 30 African countries and has laws that reprimand individuals caught in the act.
Most Africans frown at the thought of legalizing homosexuality as it defies every aspect of their socio-cultural and religious principles.

South Korea and the United States have agreed to work together closely for the success of their upcoming dialogue with North Korea that could determine the fate of the countries and the world, Seoul's top security adviser said Tuesday.
"We have agreed the US-North Korea summit must succeed not only for peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula but those of the entire world," Chung Eui-yong, head of the National Security Office, said of his meeting with his US counterpart, H.R. McMaster.
"And we held in-depth discussions on various ways and issues to realize this goal and agreed to continue discussing frequently in the future," the top security adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in said after arriving at Seoul's Incheon International Airport.

The Chung-McMaster meeting was held in San Francisco over the weekend. The two-day meeting also involved their Japanese counterpart, Shotaro Yachi, officials from the South Korean presidential office Cheong Wa Dae said earlier."The three countries agreed to work closely together for the success of the South-North summit that will be held in late April and the US-North Korea summit to be held shortly thereafter," Chung said.Chung's latest US trip marked the second of its kind following his rare visit to the communist North as Moon's special envoy on March 5-6.It was his trip that helped arrange the upcoming summits among the leaders of South Korea, the US and North Korea.The inter-Korean summit, if held, will mark the third of its kind, but the first to be held on South Korean soil as it is set to be held on the South Korean side of the joint security area, also known as Panmunjom, inside the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone.The proposed US-North Korea summit will mark the first of its kind in history. US President Donald Trump has said he will meet the North Korean leader before the end of May. (Yonhap)

Come to Kazaringa National Park in India to enjoy the stunning and rare great one-horned rhinoceros- but if you want to poach them for their valuable horns, you may want to think twice. This is because the guards have been ordered to shoot with lethal intent at poachers, and have killed 50 of them in the last three years.In 2014, park guards were instructed to shoot at suspected poachers. Poachers here is defined by anyone non-park personnel found in the park at night. 22 poachers were shot dead that year, as many as were killed between 2007-2013.Dr Satyendra Singh, the park director, claims the "shoot on sight" label assigned to the park by the media is inaccurate. "First we warn them — who are you? But if they resort to firing we have to kill them. First we try to arrest them, so that we get the information, what are the linkages, who are others in the gang?"But the park is in the middle of a densely populated area, with dozens of villages surrounding it. Reports have come from some of those villages claiming that innocent locals were killed by the guards.A local man, Kachu Kealing, told the BBC that his son Goanburah was searching for the family's lost cows when he strayed into the park at night.Another local, seven-year-old Akash Orang, lost much of his ability to walk when a guard shot him in the leg in 2016. The park admitted their mistake and paid for Orang's medical expenses.One-horned rhinos are frequently targeted by poachers, asIn 2012,567 rhinoceroses were poached in Kaziranga between 1980 and 2005. Politicians demanded action after another 27 rhinos were killed in 2013, and this led to the more aggressive enforcement.The number of rhinos poached has dropped in the park, from 54 killed in 2013-14 to 35 killed in 2015-16. But only 31 were killed between 2008-2012.Kaziranga Park is one of Assam&'s biggest tourist attraction, bringing in about 170,000 visitors a year. Critics of the park's violent policy claim that the measure ignores the rule of law and the rights of the natives in favor of protecting a valuable tourist attraction. Proponents claim that extreme measures are necessary to protect a vulnerable species.The Indian government seems happy with the results of their policy, as they announced a massive expansion of their national parks program, including an intent to implement Kaziranga's policies nationwide.

Willian unfazed by Barcelona rumours

Brazil's Willian in action against Mexico
Willian insists he is not letting speculation over a potential move to Barcelona distract him from Brazil's World Cup campaign.
The 29-year-old will be hoping to make a fifth consecutive start at Russia 2018 on Friday when the Selecao take on Belgium in a mouth-watering quarter-final in Kazan.
The Chelsea man has been linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge in recent weeks, with Manchester United and Barcelona mooted as destinations.
When asked about joining his fellow Brazilians Philippe Coutinho and Paulinho at Camp Nou, Willian said: "Well, they are excellent players with a lot of quality. In addition to great players, they are very good friends.
"People speculate a lot. We see a lot of things on the internet, but this is not the time to talk about this. I've not received any information about that. I'm trying to focus on my performance, playing for Brazil."
While Neymar has been dominating the headlines throughout the tournament, it is arguably Coutinho who has been Brazil's star man.
And Willian had praise for the forward, saying: "Coutinho has been playing a wonderful World Cup, and he helps us a lot. I hope that he will continue playing even better."

Buy AP Photo Reprints NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are falling Wednesday as energy companies tumble along with oil prices. After a weak retail sales report, investors are looking for safety and buying government bonds and high-dividend stocks. As expected, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the third time in six months. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 6 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,434 as of 2:55 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 3 points to 21,325. The Nasdaq composite lost 30 points, or 0.5 percent, to 6,190. Small-company stocks fell far more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index sank 11 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,414. That suggests investors are worried about the economy, which could have an outsize effect on smaller, domestically-focused companies. The S&P 500, Dow and Russell all closed at record highs Tuesday. THE FED: The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the third time since December, something investors widely expected based on the Fed's recent statements. Fed leaders suggested they still expect to raise rates again later in the year. THE QUOTE: The weak retail sales report Wednesday, and some other disappointing reports recently, did not appear to change the Fed's thinking even though higher interest rates tend to slow down economic growth. "This economy has always been something of a healthy tortoise," said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. "I think growth will pick up a bit but there is sort of a failure to bounce in this economy." BONDS: The Fed also gave more details about its plans to shrink its bond portfolio. Later this year the Fed said it will reduce the amount of principal payments it invests in new bonds. It does not plan to sell bonds. Investors have been pleased that the Fed is disclosing details of its plans and doesn't intend to move too quickly. Still, Kelly said he thinks that will have a big effect on the bond market: as the Fed lets its balance sheet shrink and buys fewer bonds, prices will fall and yields will rise. That will send interest rates higher. RETAIL SALES: The Commerce Department said people spent less money at gas stations, department stores and electronics retailers last month. The result was a surprise to analysts, who expected sales to grow. Video game seller GameStop gave up 43 cents, or 2 percent, to $21.55 and department store chain Kohl's dropped 76 cents, or 2 percent, to $37.28. Elsewhere, the Labor Department said consumer prices slipped, mostly thanks to lower energy prices. That showed how little inflation there has been in the economy, a continued concern for Federal Reserve policymakers. REACTION: Bond prices jumped and yields fell to their lowest level since November. Concerned about weak growth, investors bought bonds and high-yield stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.13 percent from 2.21 percent. Utilities and household goods makers climbed. Banks fell. The drop in bond yields sent interest rates lower, which reduces the profits banks can make from mortgages and other loans. Citizens Financial dropped 63 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $36.25 and Lincoln National lost 80 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $67.75. COMMODITIES: Oil futures plunged after the U.S. government said oil supplies shrank slightly last week and gasoline stockpiles grew. Benchmark U.S. crude fell $1.73, or 3.7 percent, to settle at $44.73 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed $1.72, or 3.5 percent, to close at $47 a barrel in London. Exxon Mobil lost $1.04, or 1.2 percent, to $81.92 and Halliburton sank $1.47, or 3.2 percent, to $44.37. CURRENCY: The dollar slid to 109.53 yen from 109.96 yen. The euro jumped to $1.1221 from $1.1212. BLOCK PARTY: Tax preparer H&R Block posted a bigger profit than analysts expected as well as slightly stronger sales. Its shares climbed $2.41, or 8.9 percent, to $29.40. JOB POSTING: Biotech drugmaker Biogen fell and competitor Alexion Pharmaceuticals rose after the companies said Biogen Chief Financial Officer Paul Clancy will become Alexion's CFO at the end of July.

COMMENT In recent weeks I didn't write stories about Packet.net splashing down in 15 new nations to start an edge compute service, or the plans that Tata Telecoms' shared with me to expand its data centre footprint by targeting partnerships with users of its submarine cables.
I skipped them both because the companies concerned are minor players in the big, big, drama that is the shift from on-premises computing to the cloud. Even if we'd loosed the crack Reg Punning Squad to work some headlining magic, I couldn't imagine many of you would click on news of either company.
But a conversation with Zerto's president Paul Zeiter has me thinking perhaps we all need to spend more time looking at small clouds.
Zeiter pointed out to me that in almost every enterprise IT category, there are a couple of leaders, a few followers and then a big pool of “other” that often accounts for 40 per cent or more of the market. And sometimes the “Others” are more interesting than the mainstream: for example, The Register has often had good responses to our coverage of niche PC vendor Eurocom becuase the company makes stuff like server-class laptops that insist their batteries are actually an uninterruptible power supply. Yes, that's a niche product, but it's useful to know such devices exist in case the mainstream players can't get where you need to go.
Analyst firm Canalys' July assessment of the cloud bears out Zeiter's belief: it finds the big four clouds – AWS, Azure, Google and IBM – account for 55 per cent of all cloud spend.
The “Others” may not be able to match the big four clouds for sheer scale of infrastructure or depth and breadth of services. But “Other” doesn't mean small or risky. The Register's cloud desk hears good things about clouds offered by global system integrators, while the likes of OVH are far from being backyard operators. Nor is Oracle. VMware has around 4,000 cloud partners willing to run vSphere-as-a-service, many of them in nations the big four can't yet find on a map.
At this point readers may point out that HPE killed its cloud and so did Cisco and VMware ran into the arms of AWS. A natural subsequent question is how a smaller player can make cloud work of global titans have already failed.
The answer is that the three abovementioned companies took on an established market with little differentiator and with an ambition to have the cloud as an adjunct to their core offerings.
System integrators, by contrast, have been tending clients' boxes for years. Putting kit from the likes of Zerto into play in multi-tenanted data centres is just what they need to do these days.
Zerto's Zeiter rates his company's software and thinks that service providers and/or minor clouds who adopt it can rival the big four at least so far as data protection is concerned. He's hardly alone: software vendors-a-plenty think their wares can make a cloud resilient, or good at crunching big data, or whatever else is attractive to particular customers with particular demands.
Small clouds that use such vendors wisely are going to make some interesting clouds for interesting niches. They won't be newsworthy every day. But they'll often be worthy of attention and for certain organisations will be as attractive and important, or sometimes more so, than the big four. Perhaps they'll even be able to defend that big slice of "Other" market share.
So here's to the Others. I, for one, will be trying to find and celebrate their differences in the hope you can profit from their diversity. ®

A clown has revealed the shocking moment a little boy was 'shamed' by his own parents for wanting butterfly facepaint.
The children's entertainer took to Twitter to talk about the incident which she witnessed while working at a kids' picnic party in the US.
The social media user, under the account name Sanduhruh, says the little boy asked for a blue butterfly before his mum interrupted and said: "You didn't ask me."
Sanduhruh claims the mum then demanded he have "something for boys" instead - like a skull and crossbones.

When the clown protested slightly, the mum allegedly called her husband over and asked him "do you want your son to have a butterfly on his face?"
According to Sanduhruh, the dad said: "No."
"I see this all the time," she said in a Twitter rant which has now gone viral.
"And I really feel for these boys, because the girls don't get it as bad.
"Being a tomboy is slightly more normalised.
"And when girls want skulls or sharks the parents shrug and laugh like 'haha she's a kooky kid!'
"Because maleness and masculinity aren't a sin."
(Image: Moment RF)
"I'm sorry that he was shamed for wanting to share in the joy that is the miracle and wonder of nature," she continued.
"But when a boy want to enjoy something for its beauty, they are told it's not for them. Not in this house. Not in this family.
"We are teaching them that anger and violence are the only things they are allowed to experience. That to value beauty and elegance is shameful.
"I know that it was just facepaint, but that's sort of my point. Why in the hell are these parents shaming their boys over facepaint."
Sanduhruh claims the woman ended up complaining to her boss but says it will not stop her from talking about gender stereotypes and the expectations placed on young children.
She says parents must "teach our children to strive for other types of power beyond anger and oppression".
Police in Leeds are hunting a man who assaulted a shop worker in Leeds this morning.
Officers were called to the Co-op in Broadway, Hawksworth, just before 7.25am to reports of an assault.
Police are still establishing the full circumstances, but said a female shop worker had been hit in the face with a bottle.
A spokesman said the victim had been treated by paramedics and taken to hospital.
Her attacker was described as a mixed race man who was aged in his mid 30s.
It is the second time this year that a female member of staff has been assaulted at the store.
Back in March, police issued an appeal after armed robbers threatened a woman at knifepoint and assaulted her as she was forced to open the safe.
Anyone with information on the latest incident is asked to call police on 101.

It has long been a method of assassination.
Hidden in drinks, food and everyday objects, poison stealthily enters its unsuspecting victims' bodies and takes away their lives.
From ricin to Polonium 210, a range of deadly chemicals - some, relatively easy to get hold of - can be used by assassins to commit murder.
And for centuries, they have been - with a number of notable figures in history, including spies and writers, having been killed by poison.
Yesterday, it was reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's estranged half-brother had been poisoned to death in the Malaysian capital.
(Photo: AFP)
Kim Jong Nam was apparently waiting for a flight to Macau at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Monday when he fell ill.
He later died on the way to hospital, officials say. He is thought to have been poisoned to death - allegedly by two female North Korean agents.
It "is strongly suspected to be a poisoning attack", South Korean lawmaker Kim Byung-kee, who was briefed by the country's spy agency, told Reuters.
However, police are yet to determine his cause of death.
(Photo: REUTERS)
A woman holding Vietnam travel papers has since been arrested by Malaysian police in connection with the alleged assassination, officials say.
Kim Jong Nam's high-profile death has revived discussion on poisoning - and the sinister ways in which it can be used as a murder weapon.
Below, we look at previous victims of the method, and how they were killed - from being jabbed with a rigged umbrella to drinking poisoned beverages.
Alexander Litvinenko: A poisoned cup of tea
Alexander Litvinenko was a former Russian spy.
The 44-year-old died in November 2006 after he was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 at a central London hotel.
It is believed the substance was slipped into a cup of tea he was drinking.
(Photo: Getty Images)
Litvinenko was hospitalised on November 1 that year after suddenly falling ill. He passed away three weeks later in intensive care.
The dad of one had fled to Britain in 2000 after being arrested in his home country for exceeding the authority of his position.
He had previously been an officer with the Federal Security Service (FSB).
After his death, it emerged he was being paid by MI6.
(Photo: TASS)
In January last year, a public inquiry concluded Russian President Vladimir Putin had probably approved Litvinenko's killing.
For a timeline of events leading up to Litvinenko's death, click here.
Georgi Markov: A specially rigged umbrella
Georgi Markov was a Bulgarian dissident and BBC journalist.
He was waiting for a bus on London's Waterloo Bridge when a tiny pellet laced with ricin was fired into his leg using an umbrella.
The fatal incident - which could come straight out of the pages of a spy novel or film - occurred on an evening in September 1978.
(Photo: Reuters)
Markov was heading to work when he felt a pain in his limb. He saw a mystery man pick up an umbrella before fleeing in a taxi, reports say.
It later turned out the item was specially rigged.
Markov died in hospital just days later.
A postmortem found the pellet laced with ricin - a highly toxic substance that is made from castor beans and difficult to trace - in his leg.

Ibn al-Khattab: A poisoned letter
Ibn al-Khattab was a Chechen rebel commander.
He died in March 2002.
He was killed by a poisoned letter, slipped to him by Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), according to Chechen rebel sources.
Al-Khattab, who was considered a symbol of Islamic extremism, was born in Saudi Arabia in 1959 and eventually moved to Chechnya.
He fought with Chechen separatists and was deemed a "terrorist" by the FSB.

Stepan Bandera: Cyanide gas
Stepan Bandera was a Ukrainian political activist.
Born in January 1909, he fought Soviet rule well into the 1950s.
During World War II, he was arrested by the Nazis and imprisoned at Sachsenhausen concentration camp before eventually being released.
After the war, in 1959, he was assassinated by a KGB agent in Munich, Germany.
(Photo: Getty)
A medical examination later found that he had been poisoned by cyanide gas.
Bandera is regarded as a hero by many in western Ukraine. But in the Russian-speaking east of the country, many take the Soviet view he was a terrorist.
Socrates: Forced consumption of a cup of poison
Socrates was a hugely influential Greek philosopher.
The thinker, whose most famous student was Plato, died after being accused by the Athenian government of corrupting the youth with his teachings.
According to accounts, he suffered a slow death in 399BC after being forced to drink a cup of hemlock as a form of execution.

Munir Said Thalib: An arsenic-laced drink
Munir Said Thalib was an Indonesian human rights and anti-corruption activist.
He was poisoned by an off-duty pilot while on a flight to the Netherlands.
During the journey in 2004, he was apparently given an arsenic-laced drink by Pollycarpus Budihari Priyanto, according to the BBC.
Soon after consuming the drink, he began to suffer from acute diarrhoea and vomiting before eventually passing away, reports say.
It is thought the plane was still in the air when he died.
(Photo: kontraspublication/Youtube)
An autopsy confirmed that he had extremely high levels of arsenic in his system.
Priyanto was jailed for 14 years in 2005 after being found guilty of murder.
He later had his conviction overturned.
However, in Janaury 2008, Indonesia's Supreme Court reinstated his initial conviction and jailed him for 20 years.
He was released on parole in November 2014.

As well as being a method of assassination, poison has also been used by a number of notable figures as a way to take their own lives.
An example of this is Hitler's wife, Eva Braun, who committed suicide by biting into a capsule of cyanide in April 1945, when she was 33.
Her Nazi leader husband killed himself with a gunshot to the head.

Residents are being invited to find out more about planned Houghton Regis Flood Alleviation Scheme next week.
On Wednesday 13 December the Environment Agency is holding a public drop-in to share its plans to reduce flooding in Luton by building a flood storage area on land at Houghton Regis.
The drop in is at Bedford Square Community Centre, Tithe Farm Road, Houghton Regis, from 4-8pm.
There are many records of flooding from the River Lee and its tributaries in particular where the Houghton Brook joins the River Lee around Toddington Road. To reduce this flood risk the Environment Agency is planning to build a flood storage area on the Houghton Brook at Houghton Regis on a site adjacent to the M1motorway.
The Environment Agency is working in partnership with Luton Borough Council and when completed the Houghton Regis Flood Alleviation Scheme (FAS) is planned to reduce flood risk to over 500 properties downstream in Luton. This scheme is part of the £2.5bn planned to be spent by the Environment Agency between 2015 and 2021 on flood management because flooding has devastating costs for people and businesses. The Houghton Regis FAS has received Grant In Aid funding of £4million, together with a contribution of £230k from Luton Borough Council.
Once established, the flood storage area will form part of the green infrastructure between Houghton Regis and a proposed new development site. The Houghton Brook will be realigned and re-naturalised to provide an attractive green corridor with public open space and recreational areas, creating a better place for people and wildlife.
Suzanne Wilson, Flood Risk Advisor at the Environment Agency, said: “This is a great opportunity for us to work with our partners to reduce flood risk and also deliver some environmental enhancements. We are in discussions with Central Bedfordshire Council and intend to submit our planning application before the end of the year. If we are successful in our planning application, this will enable us to begin construction in 2018.”

Companies in this article Rovio Entertainment
Rovio Entertainment is considering an IPO, according to a report from Bloomberg, which could take place as early as next month.
Bloomberg's sources said that no final decision has been made, but that Rovio would seek to raise $400 million in a local market listing, which would value the Finnish company at $2 billion.
Local market listings have been relatively commonplace among Scandinavian game developers in recent times. Last year, Paradox floated on Sweden's Nasdaq First North stock exchange, while both Next Games and Remedy Entertainment looked towards the Nasdaq First North Finland exchange this year.
In June, Tencent was reported to be considering acquiring Rovio, which stopped short of squashing the rumour in its official statement on the matter. Instead, it reassured shareholders that it "regularly assess different alternatives to further develop Rovio," and suggested the possibility of an IPO, "at some point in the future."
Rovio is now emerging from a period of transition, motivated by the need to diversify beyond its Angry Birds mobile games. The most prominent example of that push was the Angry Birds Movie, which grossed almost $350 million worldwide according to Box Office Mojo. The film's production budget was $73 million, but the amount spent on its marketing push was rumoured to be at least $100 million.
In 2016, Rovio earned €190 million in revenue and a €17.5 million profit, both of which were significant improvements over the previous year.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has criticized the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, warning that it could destabilize the region and derail the Middle East peace process.
Speaking Monday after a hectic day that took him from a Russian base in Syria to Cairo and Ankara, Putin said the U.S. move “doesn't help the Mideast settlement and, just the other way round, destabilizes the already difficult situation in the region.”
The Russian leader added that it may “finish prospects for the Palestinian-Israeli peace process.”
He added that Moscow believes that the status of Jerusalem should be settled through talks between the Palestinians and Israel in line with United Nations resolutions.
The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.

CLEVELAND -- The children of a 74-year-old man gunned down on his way home from an Easter meal have a message for his suspected killer, who is now the target of a nationwide manhunt.
Steve Stephens, 37, is wanted for aggravated murder after he allegedly shot Robert Godwin Sr. Sunday afternoon – then posted a video of the homicide on Facebook, according to Cleveland police.
Tonya Godwin-Baines, one of Godwin's daughters, said the family is absolutely devastated and is calling for Stephens to turn himself in.
"To the young man who murdered my daddy, I ask that you please surrender," Godwin-Baines said. "I forgive you, and love you but most importantly, God loves you. God can heal your mind and save your soul. Please!"
Godwin was the father of 10 children -- six girls and four boys.
Godwin's children say the reason they are able to forgive Stephens is because of their father, who took them to church every Sunday, and always stressed the importance of forgiveness.
Robert Godwin Jr. said the woman who Stephens blames in the Facebook video is also in the family's thoughts and prayers. "We know it is not her fault. She should not feel like it's her fault."
Godwin Sr.'s children described him as a wonderful person who loved his family, and said they want their father to be remembered for the good he did in his life, not for the horrific video.
"If you do watch it, it should make you want to change," Godwin Jr. said. The family is asking people not to share the disturbing footage, but, for those who do, Godwin Jr. asked that they "take something from it."
There is now a $50,000 reward for information leading to the Stephens' arrest. The FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and U.S. Marshals provided the money for the reward.
Anyone with information about the suspect's whereabouts should call 1-800-CALL-FBI. If you see Stephens, do not approach. He is considered armed and dangerous.
A memorable season continues for the Minnesota Gophers as Sunday they received a bid to "The Big Dance"--the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament.
Minnesota came into this season looking to improve upon a 8-23 season in 2015-16. Improve on it is just what they did.
By going 24-9 this year, the Gophers were named a five seed in the South Region facing 12th-seeded Middle Tennessee State, with their first tournament berth under Richard Pitino.
The Gophers can't count out this Middle Tennessee team as the same Blue Raiders squad knocked out the 2nd-seeded Michigan State in last year's tourney.
Middle Tennessee earned an automatic bid by defeating Marshall in the Conference USA Championship.
The Gophers and Blue Raiders will tip off in Milwaukee on Thursday, March 16 at 3 p.m. on TNT.
“The opportunity to modernize matters and shouldn't be lost on people,” the official said.
“It doesn't mean that every Canadian will be paying attention (Monday) but we know that very shortly they will be,” said a government official, who spoke on background.
The Liberal government has been consulting with stakeholders ahead of the negotiations — consultations that will continue — but Freeland wants to prompt a larger discussion about the coming trade talks.
Freeland will use two appearances — first in a speech at the University of Ottawa and later before a parliamentary committee — to sketch out the broad strokes of Canada's principles for the negotiations that begin later in the week for a new North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
OTTAWA—Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland on Monday will make the case as to why a modernized trade deal with the U.S. and Mexico — containing enhanced protections for labour and the environment — is vital for Canada's continuing economic success.
Those include provisions to strengthen protections for labour and the environment. Canada is also expected to push for language that sets out ambitions around gender equality, a priority for the Liberal government at home.
That strategy is not expected to change. But Freeland will speak to broad objectives and themes that Ottawa will be pushing to see included in a revised pact.
Canada has kept its cards close to its chest with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying recently that he's “not going to negotiate in public.”
Freeland will speak to the vast changes in the digital economy, how that has changed trade and needs to be addressed in the new agreement in a “substantive way,” the official said.

Trump wants a victory on NAFTA. These Trump voters disagree on what that should mean
Meet NAFTA negotiator Steve Verheul — the most important Canadian you've (probably) never heard of
Here's what to expect as crucial NAFTA talks between U.S., Canada and Mexico begin this week
She will also address to the protectionist tone in Washington and “push back” on why that's not a long-term viable solution for trade between the three countries. That's the same argument that the Trudeau government has taken to the White House, Congressional leaders and state governors across the United State as part of an orchestrated campaign ahead of the negotiations.
The first round of talks kick off Wednesday when trade officials from Canada, Mexico and the U.S. will meet at Washington's Marriott Wardman Park Hotel.
U.S. President Donald Trump rode to victory last November with a campaign that pushed a Buy America focus and that protectionist theme will hang over the bargaining table.
At various points, he's called NAFTA a “catastrophe” for the U.S., a “total disaster”, and “one of the worst deals, ever.”
Canada and Mexico have struck a more diplomatic tone. They say the negotiations are a chance to update a decades-old trade pact, address issues that weren't a factor when it was first crafted, such as e-commerce and the digital economy, and for Mexico, freer access to energy and telecommunications.
“NAFTA has proven that it's very good. It has proven that it's beneficial. It makes sense to take a look at how we can improve it, we can update it, modernize it,” Dionisio Perez Jacome, Mexico's ambassador to Canada, said in an interview.
“We do believe it's possible to come with a win-win-win and we will work hard to achieve that.”
Perez Jacome said his country is keen to negotiate a new deal but not one at any cost. “The outcome has to be a win-win-win for the three countries . . . . We know very clearly what we want and what we don't want,” he said.
Observers worry about the chaotic political climate in Washington and how that might influence negotiations. Trump is the wild card. An early morning tweet or an off-the-cuff comment could be enough to rock the negotiations, said Paul Frazer, a former Canadian diplomat who heads a government-relations firm in the U.S. capital.
“I think what matters more is the political backdrop here,” he said. “It's the unpredictability of the president. He needs a win. He's had a very unfavourable six months.”
Not surprisingly, the U.S. trade office picks up on some of Trump's grievances in its outline of objectives for the NAFTA renegotiation.
The document, released last month, sketches out a broad range of areas the U.S. administration wants to bargain, including dispensing with dispute settlement mechanism.
Yet keeping some form of dispute resolution is important for both Canada and Mexico. Trudeau has said that a “fair” dispute resolution system is “essential.” It's critical for the Mexicans, too. “This is very important to us, to have a strong, transparent and efficient dispute settlement mechanism,” Perez Jacome said.
The written introduction to the U.S. trade objectives gives a telling sense of how the U.S. administration views the existing agreement. Since the deal took effect in 1994, the document says “trade deficits have exploded, thousands of factories have closed, and millions of Americans have found themselves stranded.”
But similar concerns are being heard north of the border as unions and other stakeholders complain that free trade has led to the loss of manufacturing jobs in Canada, notably in the auto sector.
These groups say the coming negotiations are a chance to improve on a trade deal they argue failed to deliver promised improvements in wages, productivity.
“I agree that NAFTA has been a complete disaster,” said Jerry Dias, president of Unifor, Canada's largest private sector, which counts more than 23,000 autoworkers among its members.
Over the life of NAFTA, he said assembly lines have closed in Canada and the U.S. while new plants have opened in Mexico.
“There has to be a timetable for a transformation of some of the auto work from Mexico back to Canada and the United States,” Dias said.
Similar sentiments are voiced by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, which thinks Canada could find common ground with the Trump administration in seeking measures to regain jobs that gone overseas or Mexico.
“We share a hope with a lot of labour unions in Canada and the United States that we could remake NAFTA to make it more fair for workers in all three countries so that they are seeing more of the gains from trade,” said the centre's Stuart Trew.
Yet the fact that Canada's goals going into the talks have so far remained a mystery is unacceptable, says New Democrat MP and trade critic Tracey Ramsey.
Ramsey, a former 20-year autoworker, says the federal government should have formally laid out its objectives, just as the U.S. and Mexico have done.
“Liberals made a lot of promises to Canadians about progressive trade and it's time to define what that is and show Canadians what they mean,” Ramsey said.

President Donald Trump wants to send man back to the moon — and on to Mars.
Trump signed a policy directive Monday instructing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to “refocus America's space program on human exploration and discovery.”
The move, Trump said, “marks an important step in returning American astronauts to the moon for the first time since 1972 for long-time exploration.”
“This time we will not only plant our flag and leave our footprint,” he said, “we will establish a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars, and perhaps someday, to many worlds beyond.”
Past presidents, including George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, have also proposed returning to the moon and missions to Mars, Budget constraints derailed their plans.
Trump was joined at the White House by several current and former astronauts, including Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, and former U.S. Sen. and Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison “Jack” Schmitt, the next-to-last person on the moon.
“Today we pledge that he will not be the last, and I suspect we'll be finding other places to land in addition to the moon,” Trump said.
No human has been on the moon since Apollo 17 in December 1972. Only 12 men have set foot on the moon; all have been Americans.
Under the directive, the government is also expected to work closely with other nations and private industry.

Suspected pirates have seized 12 crewmembers of a Dutch-flagged cargo ship off the coast of Nigeria, the vessel's managing company confirmed Monday.
The 480-foot MV FWN Rapide was attacked on Saturday morning as it was approaching Port Harcourt, Nigeria, according to gCaptain, an industry website.
According to the ship's Automatic Identification System (AIS) tracking, it was bound from Takoradi, Ghana, to Bonny Island, Nigeria, at the time of the attack, gCaptain says.
The ship's manager, ForestWave, issued a statement Monday saying its "main priority is to establish contact with the missing seafarers and secure their earliest and secure return."
"The company's Emergency Response team is working around the clock and is liaising with the local and international authorities," the statement said.
"We are currently in close contact with the authorities and taking professional advice in order to secure the earliest release of those that are currently being held," the statement read. "Together with our local representatives in the countries of origin of our valued seafarers we are keeping the families of the FWN Rapide crew informed about the situation."
Two crewmembers were left aboard and are reported safe. ForestWave lauded them for their "courageous and professional handling" of the vessel following the attack, crediting them with moving the vessel to a safe location.
Piracy off the Horn of Africa, made famous in part by the Hollywood film Captain Phillips, starring Tom Hanks, has largely shifted to West Coast of Africa, particularly Nigeria, which has been an on again, off-again hotspot.
In 2013, Nigerian pirates seized the U.S.-flagged C-Retriever, a 222-foot offshore resupply vessel, holding two of its crew for a month.
In 2004, Atal Bihari Vajpayee's electoral march to victory was stopped cold by his government's failure to adequately recognize and address the problems of the rural economy. His heir, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seems to have unfortunately learnt only half a lesson from that. Farmer distress is a real and pressing problem, as evidenced by the protests currently taking place in various parts of the country. But by announcing a farm loan waiver on the Uttar Pradesh campaign trail, Modi took the easy way out—and left the real problems unaddressed.
The numbers go some way towards explaining farmer resentment. Consumer price inflation in May dropped to a low of 2.18%, while food price inflation slipped into negative territory. At the index level, vegetable prices fell by 13.44% and inflation in pulses was at (-) 19.45%. After two successive years of below par rainfall, production shot up in the last financial year on the back of a normal monsoon and has resulted in a steep decline in prices. The production of tur, for example, is estimated to have gone up by about 80% in 2016-17. Similarly, higher production of vegetables has resulted in a price crash in the wholesale market. Prices have also been affected by demonetisation.
Little wonder farmers have taken up the UP precedent. Last week, a reluctant Devendra Fadnavis government in Maharashtra was compelled to announce a total farm loan waiver. The government had earlier decided to give a loan waiver only to marginal farmers that was estimated to cost around Rs30,500 crore. Similar demands are being raised in other states. For instance, Punjab has been asking the Central government to intervene. Union finance minister Arun Jaitley has said on more than one occasion that states going for loan waivers will have to raise resources on their own for such a scheme—but the damage has been done.
Loan waivers might help the government buy peace with farmers in the short run, but they are unlikely to change much on the ground. As we have highlighted in this space before, research shows that loan waivers do not result in greater investment or better labour market outcomes. In a column published in these pages in May (“The Hazards Of Farm Loan Waivers”, 24 May), Tanika Chakraborty and Aarti Gupta, who studied the implementation of a previous farm loan waiver in Uttar Pradesh, noted: “Given that households in the same district face similar agricultural shocks, no improvement in farm productivity for households qualifying for loan waiver indicates a failure of the programme to achieve its desired goals.”
Loan waivers can also affect the flow of credit as bank lending tends to move away from areas with greater exposure to such schemes. It creates distortions in the credit market, as repeated waivers incentivise default, which can affect the flow of credit to the sector in the medium to long run. Moreover, loan waivers have fiscal costs. They can not only increase the deficit and interest burden, but also limit the ability of the government to undertake capital expenditure. Lower capital expenditure affects longer-term growth prospects, including that of the agriculture sector.
Addressing the problems in the agriculture sector means solutions that go beyond loan waivers. One of Indian economic policy's original sins is that over the years it has not been able to incentivise people to move out of agriculture because of lower than desired expansion in the manufacturing sector. Agriculture currently contributes just about 15% to the national output and about 50% of the population directly or indirectly depends on it for employment. This is unsustainable.
Compounding this are a number of issues in the sector today that require policy attention. For instance, in response to the changing demand pattern, farmers have diversified into producing more fruits and vegetables. Consequently, for the last five years, horticulture production has exceeded the production of foodgrains. However, accompanying infrastructure for storage and marketing has not developed, resulting in higher price volatility.
A paper brought out by NITI Aayog in December 2015 made several suggestions that are worth considering. Apart from efforts to increase yields, the framework for land leasing can be strengthened, which will not only allow consolidation, but will also give an opportunity to unwilling farmers to exit the sector. It also highlighted the idea of price deficiency payment. If the price of a crop falls below a predetermined threshold level, farmers can be compensated through cash transfers. Adequate safeguards need to be built in order to protect farmers against both production and price risks. Cooperatives can also be encouraged; these will help reduce risk and transaction costs.
Central and state governments will need to work together in order to enhance the viability of the sector. This will require investment in practically every aspect of the farm economy, including irrigation, agricultural research, storage and marketing. It will also require policy decisions in other areas—foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail, which would lay the groundwork for cold- chain storage infrastructure—that support the sector.
In the absence of this long-term planning and vision, the stress in the sector will keep resurfacing. And that means the same protests, the same debates and the same fiscally deleterious government responses a few years down the road.

Glued to your TV last night watching the final round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational? Of course you were. So was Gary Player.
Few viewers could have been rooting for McIlroy more than the nine-time major winner, especially after comments made by broadcaster Johnny Miller on Saturday about - you guessed it - the four-time major winner's workout regime.
In the commentary booth, Miller remarked that had McIlroy not gone to a gym in the past five years, he would have played better. Bear in mind, in those five years, McIlroy has captured two of his four majors, the FedEx Cup and the Race to Dubai.
Johnny Miller on Rory: "This is probably a controversial comment, but I think if he would have never gone to a gym he would have played way better the last five years ... I'm not sure in golf you need to be ripped."
Rory hits to two feet on 18 while he's talking.
🤫 — Kyle Porter (@KylePorterCBS) March 17, 2018
Naturally, those comments were met with bemusement from Player, who simply responded with a load of laughing faces.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 — Gary Player (@garyplayer) March 17, 2018
Then, after the Northern Irishman charged to victory with five birdies in his final six holes, Player couldn't resist making a sly dig towards Miller in his congratulatory tweet.
One person is dead after a crash between a car and a truck on Highway 401 Monday morning.
The crash occurred around 5:20 a.m. in the westbound lanes of Highway 401 at Martin Grove Rd., closing all lanes, said Ontario Provincial Police Sgt. Kerry Schmidt.
“It's an absolutely devastating crash,” he said. “The driver of the car is deceased. The driver of the truck is obviously very shaken up.”
Schmidt said the crash appeared to be a rear-end collision to the back of the car, but the reconstruction team would be able to confirm what happened after an investigation.
The highway is expected to be closed for several hours, which will affect the morning rush hour.
After a congressman resigned in disgrace amid sexual harassment allegations, voters in the Copper State will head to the polls on Tuesday to cast a ballot in Arizona's special election. The circumstances surrounding former Rep. Trent Franks' December resignation were already unusual, but the election to fill his seat strays from the norm as well. Two women are vying to replace the accused sexual harasser in Congress in an election unique to the #MeToo era of politics.
Either Democratic candidate Hiral Tipirneni or Republican candidate Debbie Lesko will be elected to take Franks' seat in Washington. Lesko is expected to win the seat, CNN reports, as Donald Trump won Arizona's 8th District by a double-digit margin in 2016. But regardless of who wins, a woman will be replacing Franks on Capitol Hill.
As you may recall, Franks abruptly resigned after the House Ethics Committee launched an investigation into his behavior last year. The move came in response to allegations that Franks sexually harassed two of his female staffers by discussing surrogacy. "I deeply regret that my discussion of this option and process in the workplace caused distress," Franks said in a December statement. He officially left office on Jan. 31.
Multiple seats in Congress have opened up in recent months as men accused of sexual harassment have left Capitol Hill — and women are stepping up to fill them. Sen. Tina Smith was sworn into office in January following former Sen. Al Franken's resignation amid multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.
Unlike Smith, who was appointed by Minnesota's governor, Tipirneni and Lesko had to face off in a special election. The two women's campaigns were polar opposites: Tipirneni ran on a progressive platform aimed at protecting immigrants and women's right to choose, while Lesko supported President Trump's border wall and described herself as pro-life.
The very issue that launched the special election also created clear distinctions between the two candidates. Lesko backtracked on previous statements that Trump should be investigated for alleged sexual harassment, telling The New York Times last month: "I didn't mean a formal investigation by government or something like that — I just meant it needs to run its course."
She also accepted a $2,700 donation from Franks, the maximum amount allowed in a general election, The Arizona Republic reports.
Her opponent, Tipirneni, has consistently called for Congress to strengthen laws prohibiting sexual harassment and asserted that Lesko should return the money her campaign accepted from Franks. "Franks mistreated the women on his staff, and his money is not welcome!" Tipirneni tweeted earlier this month.
Tipirneni only faced one Democratic challenger in the February primary — who also happened to be a woman — while Lesko beat out a whopping 11 male primary challengers, including a minister involved in a sexting scandal.
Even though Tipirneni is expected to lose in the GOP-controlled district, a close race would give Democrats a more optimistic outlook on the November midterm elections. Similarly to the Pennsylvania special election earlier this year that was initially too close to call, a Democrat even getting close to beating a Republican in a historically Republican district gives Democrats better odds of flipping red districts in November.
And although both candidates haven't taken a strong stand against sexual harassment, the all-female congressional race signals a shift in American politics brought on in part by the #MeToo movement. The record number of women running for office in 2018 is expected to shake up ballots across the country in November, so Arizona's special election could serve as a preview of what's to come. Either Tipirneni or Lesko will soon supersede an accused sexual harasser, shifting the gender imbalance in Washington a littler closer to parity.
Wisconsin Voters Aren't Enthusiastic About Republican Tax Bill What do voters think of the tax bills currently under debate in Congress? In the swing state of Wisconsin, many voters don't know much about the legislation — but don't like what they see so far.
Even some of the St. Louis players he spent almost four seasons with have been cheering for the father of two young children.
"They knew (the trade) was tough," Stastny said. "I was close with a lot of those guys. They keep in touch. A lot of them are rooting for me to do well."
Morrow has learned to look on the bright side of all the new addresses he's had in his career.
The Pittsburgh Penguins' 2011 first-round draft pick (23rd overall) was shipped to the Dallas Stars in 2013 and traded the same year to Boston. Last July, he signed as a free agent with the Canadiens and got into 38 games.
"When you get traded, it essentially means another team wanted you," Morrow, 25, said. "When that's the case, you can feed off that positivity. I have been very, very fortunate to be here."
The Jets have been lucky to have him.
Injuries to their blue line propelled the Edmonton native into the lineup right away and he played 18 games, collecting one goal and four assists.
In the post-season, he was the unlikely hero of Game 1 against the Wild when he scored the go-ahead goal late in the third period of a 3-2 victory.
"It's always nice to get rewarded with something like that and such a big stage and scenario for this team, gets its first franchise win in the post-season," Morrow said.
"It's been great to be a part of this city and a part of this team, too."
Even though he's not a well-known face of the franchise, Morrow said fans have recognized him when he's out and about.
"It just shows me that the dedication level of these fans is through the roof," he said.
"They pay attention to more than just the hockey aspect of things when they can recognize you without your gear on and say hi to you and be comfortable in that kind of situation."
The Jets will play their first game against the Predators in Nashville on Friday, but Morrow might find himself in the press box.
Veteran defenceman Toby Enstrom participated fully in Tuesday's practice for the first time since he was injured March 23. He could get into the lineup, bumping out Morrow or Ben Chiarot.
The Jets received good news about Blake Wheeler Tuesday afternoon. The captain is a finalist for the Mark Messier Leadership Award along with Deryk Engelland of the Vegas Golden Knights and Wayne Simmonds of the Philadelphia Flyers.

North Korea held a ceremony to mark the sailing of a trade cargo ship, the North's state media on Tuesday reported, amid the country's setbacks in international trade caused by severe UN sanctions for its nuclear and missile development programs.
Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, said the 5,000-ton Jaryok set sail during the ceremony held at the Ryongnam Dockyard in the western port city of Nampho on Monday and it "provided another material and technical foundation for developing the maritime transport of the country."
North Korean people attend a send-off ceremony in the western port city of Nampho the previous day to mark the sailing of a trade cargo ship, the Jaryok, (For Use Only in the Republic of Korea. No Redistribution) (Yonhap)
According to the daily, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un instructed a 5,000-ton cargo ship to be built and named the ship in person, with the word "Jaryok" meaning self-reliance.North Korea held a launching ceremony for the ship in May last year when the North's ruling party held its first congress in 36 years.The North's maritime transport is one of its sectors hit the hardest by the UN Security Council's strengthening of sanctions against the country following its fourth nuclear test last year.Under the measure, ships owned by Ocean Maritime Management Co., a Pyongyang-based shipping company, were blacklisted in the sanctions resolution imposed on the North for carrying out the nuclear test in January last year.It was part of a move designed to act as a logistical restriction that will prevent the free movement of banned ships cited for engaging in North Korea's nuclear and other weapons development programs.The registrations of many North Korean vessels made in the third country's nationality were called off. The North Korean shipping firm has been evading the sanctions regime by changing the names of most of its ships.The trade ship sailing is seen as the North's resolve to flout the economic sanctions in order to expand its international trade based on the spirit of self-reliance stressed by the North Korean leader."I understand the North is trying to show the international community it has its own technologies to carry out shipbuilding and is able to engage in trade despite international sanctions," said Cho Bong-hyun, a senior analyst at IBK Economic Research Institute.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — As Southern California enters its second week engulfed in flames, fire officials anticipate more growth and danger due to continued strong wind gusts, no rain and decades-old dry vegetation.
A powerful flare-up on the western edge of the largest and most destructive wildfire sent residents fleeing Sunday, as wind-fanned flames ripped down hillsides toward coastal towns northwest of Los Angeles. New evacuations were ordered as the fire sent up an enormous plume near Montecito and Carpinteria, seaside areas in Santa Barbara County.
“The winds are kind of squirrely right now,” said county fire spokesman Mike Eliason. “Some places the smoke is going straight up in the air, and others it's blowing sideways. Depends on what canyon we're in.”
Southern California's gusty Santa Ana winds have long contributed to some of the region's most disastrous wildfires. They blow from the inland toward the Pacific Ocean, speeding up as they squeeze through mountain passes and canyons.
Gusts of up to 40 mph (64 kph) are expected through Monday, according to the National Weather Service.
Containment increased Sunday on other major blazes in Los Angeles, Riverside and San Diego counties. Resources from those fires were diverted to the Santa Barbara foothills to combat the 270-square-mile (699-sq. kilometer) fire that started Dec. 4 in neighboring Ventura County.
As of late Sunday, the Thomas Fire had destroyed 790 structures and damaged 191.
Fires are not typical in Southern California this time of year but can break out when dry vegetation and too little rain combine with the Santa Ana winds. Though the state emerged this spring from a yearslong drought, hardly any measurable rain has fallen in the region over the past six months.
“This is the new normal,” Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown warned Saturday after surveying damage from the deadly Ventura fire. The governor and experts said climate change is making wildfires a year-round threat.
High fire risk is expected to last into January.
The air thick with acrid smoke, even residents of areas not under evacuation orders took the opportunity to leave, fearing another shutdown of U.S. 101, a key coastal highway that was closed intermittently last week. Officials handed out masks to residents who stayed behind in Montecito, the wealthy hillside enclave that's home to celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Jeff Bridges and Rob Lowe.
“Our house is under threat of being burned,” Ellen DeGeneres tweeted at midday Sunday. “We just had to evacuate our pets. I'm praying for everyone in our community and thankful to all the incredible firefighters.”
Ojai experienced hazardous levels of smoke at times and officials warned of unhealthy air for large swaths of the region. The South Coast Air Quality Management District urged residents to stay indoors if possible and avoid vigorous outdoor activities.
In San Diego, which is 130 miles (209 kilometers) to the south, the Lilac Fire was 75 percent contained. The flames erupted suddenly Thursday in the Fallbrook area, known for its avocado groves and horse stables in the rolling hills.
The fire swept through the San Luis Rey Downs training center, where it killed more than 40 elite thoroughbred race horses, and destroyed more than 100 homes — most of them in a retirement community. Three people were burned trying to escape the fire that continued to smolder Sunday.
Despite the size and number of wildfires burning in the region, there has only been one confirmed death: A 70-year-old woman, who crashed her car on an evacuation route, is attributed to the fire in Santa Paula, a small city where the Thomas Fire began.
Most of last week's fires were in places that burned in the past, including one in the ritzy Los Angeles neighborhood of Bel-Air that burned six homes and another in the city's rugged foothills above the community of Sylmar and in Santa Paula.

Of the three major military dramas arriving on broadcast TV this fall, SEAL Team is the sincerest.
The series (Wednesdays, 9 p.m., on Global and CBS, 2 ½ out of four) works mostly because it's not reaching beyond its comfort zone. Following a team of Navy SEALs carrying out covert operations with the aid of the CIA, it's an uncomplicated action series without twists or unnecessary spectacle, at least so far.
TV veteran David Boreanaz (Bones) plays Jason Hayes, the leader of the Tier One (SEALs), and he's an intense and focused guy not unlike the FBI agent he played for so many years on Fox's series. Jason's home life has crumbled due to his dedication to his work, and he's haunted by the death of a teammate on a recent mission. The cast is rounded out by Jessica Pare (Mad Men) as a CIA analyst and Max Thieriot as a young and ambitious soldier trying to make it into the Tier One unit.
The drama plays to the strengths of its network, and its star. The missions are simple and paint the soldiers as patriotic and unimpeachably good. In last week's second episode, SEAL flirted with bigger questions about war and the state of the world, but all in the service of its core characters. The action is sharp, clean and often close up, prioritizing the soldiers' points of view.

In Closing, Cosby's Lawyers Call His Accuser A 'Pathological Liar'
Enlarge this image toggle caption Pool/Getty Images Pool/Getty Images
Prosecutors told the jury in Bill Cosby's criminal retrial that the legendary funnyman on The Cosby Show stands in glaring contrast to the sexual predator who victimized Andrea Constand.
National Jury Hears Closing Arguments In Bill Cosby's Sexual Assault Trial Jury Hears Closing Arguments In Bill Cosby's Sexual Assault Trial Listen · 3:12 3:12
And Cosby's chief accuser was not his sole target, prosecutor Kristen Feden said in her closing argument, describing how scores of other women have accused Cosby of trading on his celebrity status over decades to sexually prey on them.
"He utilized that image and cloaked it around himself so he was able to gain the trust, gain the confidence of these young, aspiring, unsuspecting women stripped of their very autonomy, stripped of their ability to say no," Feden said.
Over more than two weeks of testimony in a Montgomery County Court in Pennsylvania, defense lawyers routinely characterized Constand as an opportunistic "con artist." Feden used that portrayal as a jumping-off point.
"The defense was partially accurate when they use that term. But the perpetrator of the con is this man," Feden said.
Feden then marched over to the table of defense lawyers where Cosby has sat for the entire trial. Inches away from him, she pointed at his face.
"Sitting right here. This is the man. Sitting right here," Feden bellowed.
"Nothing funny about that"
Andrea Constand, who was last seen by the jury when she confronted Cosby from the stand over two days, was present during the prosecution's speeches, sitting in the audience not far from the seven men and five women who will decide Cosby's fate. The panel sat listening raptly in the jury box.
"The law makes it very clear. The uncorroborated testimony of the victim alone is enough to convict the defendant, so if you believe Andrea Constand," said Feden, gesturing toward Cosby's main accuser who looked straight ahead with a stony gaze, "you need to convict."
Feden said the defense team embarked on "character assassination" of the five additional accusers who took the stand against Cosby, saying the "shameful" attacks and questions are "the exact reason" sexual assault victims rarely report their assailants to authorities.
Defense lawyer Kathleen Bliss perpetuated "rape myths" to the jury by suggesting that victims of sexual assault bear some responsibility for being victimized, Feden argued.
National Andrea Constand, Bill Cosby's Main Accuser, Continues Testimony In Second Trial Andrea Constand, Bill Cosby's Main Accuser, Continues Testimony In Second Trial Listen · 3:12 3:12
Feden, at times, mocked Bliss by putting on a fake high-pitched voice and imitating her line of questions in a derisive tone.
Then she shot a look at Cosby and accused him of smirking.
"There's nothing funny about stripping a woman of her decency. There's nothing funny about that, Mr. Cosby," Feden yelled.
At that, rows of journalists stood up and tried to catch a glimpse of Cosby, who appeared expressionless.
Prosecutors projected old photographs of first woman to testify against Cosby. The wide-eyed, youthful glam shots of the woman, Heidi Thomas, taken decades ago when she was a promising young actress. The image accompanied a play-by-play description of what Thomas said happened to her: she was drugged and sexually assaulted by Cosby at a secluded ranch house in Nevada that she visited under the guise of private acting lessons.
With the innocent photographs of Thomas as a backdrop, Feden said Cosby's attack was no mistake: Cosby groomed and preyed on other young women the same way. He made some of the same promises of career opportunities to them before he molested them, sometimes in similar locations, such as private hotel suites, Feden said. All along, she said, Cosby assumed his victims would be too afraid to ever report him to authorities.
"It's the same con, ladies and gentlemen, just a different day," she said.
Cosby, facing the jury during this moment, shook his head in disagreement.
Some of the most convincing evidence in the case, Feden told jurors, is contained in Cosby's own words, excerpted from a civil deposition he gave as a part of Constand's civil lawsuit in federal court. In it, Cosby says he does not remember ever asking Constand for permission before he carried out sex acts on her in his Cheltenham mansion in early 2004.
"You knew that it wasn't consensual because of his words," Feden said. "You know it wasn't consensual because of the pattern. The MO," she said, referring to Cosby's alleged modus operandi of drugging and molesting women. "And you know it wasn't consensual because of the testimony of Andrea Constand."
In finishing up the government's closing, prosecutor M. Stewart Ryan picked up where Feden left off. He was interrupted a handful of times with objections from the defense team.
"I wonder what they're so worried about," Ryan replied after the fourth objection.
"I wonder what we'll have to correct," Bliss countered.
Judge Steven O'Neill told both sides to settle down, reminding the court that he will address objections to closing statements later.
"Biggest highway robberies of all time"
Earlier, Cosby's lawyers told the jury in the entertainer's retrial that Constand is a "pathological liar" whose story of "so-called assault" is so replete with inconsistencies that it cannot be trusted.
"In a case like this, credibility becomes everything," defense attorney Tom Mesereau told the jury in closing arguments Tuesday morning. "There are so many big lies, they get lost. The number of lies starts to drown others out."
Flipping through a PowerPoint presentation, Mesereau walked jurors through what he said are a dozen instances of Constand lying about her relationship with Cosby — and about what Mesereau described as her motive to milk Cosby for a financial settlement.
He pointed out discrepancies over things such as how long Constand had known Cosby; whether Constand had ever flirted with the comedian; and what he said were fibs about wearing a cashmere sweater Cosby gave her as a gift.
The nearly $3.4 million Constand received as part of a previously confidential civil settlement she reached with Cosby in 2006 was long the aim of Cosby's chief accuser, he told jurors.
"She took the money, ran with the money. Her mom got money, her father got money. They're all part of the settlement agreement," Mesereau said. "It's one of the biggest highway robberies of all time."
The other women who confronted Cosby in court were driven by the desire for publicity and money, Cosby's defense lawyers said, taking direct aim at the #MeToo movement. Attorney Kathleen Bliss said "mob rule is not due process," adding that the claims of more than 60 women who have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct have been tantamount to a "lynching," or a "witch hunt."
"When you join a movement based mostly on emotion and anger, you don't change a damn thing," Bliss told jurors. "Questioning an accuser is not shaming a victim. Gut feelings are not rational decisions."
For more than two weeks, Cosby's defense has focused on the argument that Constand is a "con artist" who sought to extort Cosby for a payout. In closing arguments, however, lawyers harkened back to a point made repeatedly by his defense team during the entertainer's first trial in June 2017: that Constand was always romantically interested in Cosby.
For proof, Mesereau pointed to "at least 100 calls" Constand placed after the alleged assault in January 2004.
Constand, who worked for Temple University's basketball team at the time, has said that the calls were about business, since Cosby was a powerful university trustee heavily involved with the school's sports teams.
"This is a personal, intimate relationship, not basketball," Mesereau said. "Constand placed twice the number of calls than he did to her, demonstrating her pursuit of him."
Camille Cosby, the entertainer's wife of more than five decades, made her first appearance Tuesday during the retrial. She walked up to her husband, kissed and embraced him. Wearing a bright yellow and orange dress, she took a seat in the first row and remained stoic throughout the proceeding.

In an unusual move, the defense team split the two-hour-long closing speech between Bliss and Mesereau.
Bliss reminded the jury about the defense team's star witness, Margo Jackson, a former colleague of Constand's who claims Constand confided that she wanted to fabricate a story of sexual assault in order to try to shake down a celebrity for money.
"You would've thought they would've done something to check her out," said Bliss, indicting that prosecutors ignored Jackson in their investigation. "Who are you going to believe? A well-educated ... woman who works at Temple and who counsels students and has a background in psychology?" Bliss asked the jury. "Or Andrea Constand, who was running a pyramid scheme at the same time?"
Bliss then spoke to the jury about Gianna Constand, the mother of the accuser, who testified in the case and played for the court a recording she made of Cosby apologizing, saying he would like to set up an educational fund for Constand as long as she maintained a 3.0 average.
"Yes, he feels badly. He's 30 years older than she is. He's got this mother accusing him, yelling at him, whatever she was doing," Bliss said. "He's also worried about extortion."
Mesereau, after describing the high bar to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, delivered his final line to the jury of seven men and five women who will soon decide Cosby's fate.
"He must walk out of here free," Mesereau said. "He's an 80-year-old man. He's had a distinguished career. He's made some mistakes for sure, but he is no criminal."
Prosecutors next will deliver their final remarks to jurors in a case that could send Cosby to prison for the rest of his life.
Last June, a different jury could not decide on Cosby's fate following 52 hours of closed-door deliberations about the case.

It's entirely possible that Alberta NDP Premier Rachel Notley secretly hopes B.C. premier Christy Clark will soundly beat the NDP in the upcoming provincial election. That's because a win by the NDP would put one of Notley's most prized bragging points — the expansion of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline — in jeopardy. B.C. NDP leader John Horgan, a former colleague of Notley's, opposes the $7.4 billion pipeline, which would transport diluted bitumen from Alberta's oilsands to shipping terminals near Vancouver. He has pledged to withdraw B.C's support if elected on May 9. That would be a disaster for Notley, who has gone to great lengths to try and convince Albertans that her NDP government not only supports the petroleum industry's expansion plans but sees them as essential to the province's economic well being. She often points out her government's Climate Leadership Plan, which includes a carbon tax and a cap on oilsands emissions, paved the way for federal approval of the pipeline. Those carbon reduction strategies, she argues, dampened the arguments against the pipeline mounted by environmentalists, climate change activists, and some indigenous groups, thereby making it easier to gain social license.

For many New Democrats in B.C., Notley's attempts to curb carbon emissions simply weren't enough. They reject Kinder Morgan's expanded pipeline because of the threat of explosions, leaks, and spills. They don't want tankers full of tarry bitumen plying the waters off their coast, even if it would help Alberta's economy. New Democrats in the B.C. interior are more amenable to the project because it will employ construction workers and local contractors. But the heavily populated areas on the coast will hold the most sway come election time. It's not clear what the B.C. government could actually do to prevent construction of the pipeline, which has been approved by the National Energy Board and the federal government. But even just delaying the start of construction could be enough to weaken Notley's claim she has been more successful at getting major oil pipelines approved than her conservative predecessors at both the provincial and federal level.
This may not mean much in B.C., but in Alberta it is an important bragging point for an NDP premier, especially since the low price of oil has caused corporate layoffs, reduced investment in the oilpatch, and eroding confidence in the Notley's government. Last week, Notley announced that none of her staff would be allowed to work for the NDP during the B.C. election. So far Notley has good reason to be worried. Polls show the NDP are in the lead at 40 per cent with the Liberals a close second. Complicating matters is the support for the Greens, who also oppose The Trans Mountain pipeline. They are up around 17 per cent. At this stage, a minority NDP government with support from the Greens is certainly within the realm of possibility. At the federal level, Justin Trudeau is also no doubt hoping the NDP lose to Christy Clark's Liberals (even though they aren't his brand of Liberals). Throwing a monkey wrench into the Trans Mountain pipeline will only make his life more complicated. As for the federal NDP, it stands to end up caught in the middle of a nasty fight between two NDP premiers. That should do wonders for its image. Of course, the NDP was touted to win the 2013 B.C. election. But that was before its leader Adrian Dix revealed he was opposed to the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, even though Kinder Morgan was still in the midst of the application process. That seemed to spook voters who felt Dix had gone too far in his quest to outdo the Greens, who were gaining support at the expense of the NDP. In the end, Christy Clark won a resounding victory. She may pull it off again. Especially since, according to Democracy Watch, more than $550,000 was donated to the B.C. Liberal party by pipeline-related companies over the past five years. Notley, no doubt, hopes all that money will save her bacon as well. Gillian Steward is a Calgary writer and former managing editor of the Calgary Herald.

WASHINGTON (AP) -
Monday, December 11, 2017 at 6:57 pm |
U.S. employers posted slightly fewer job openings in October than the previous month, but the number of people being hired improved.
The Labor Department said Monday that nearly 6 million jobs were available at the end of October, down from 6.18 million in September. Manufacturers, retailers, wholesalers and the information sector advertised fewer jobs — an indicator of their possible intentions in the coming months.
“The leveling off of openings in recent months suggest a more moderate pace of hiring ahead,” said Sarah House, an economist with the bank Wells Fargo.
But total hires rose 4.4 percent to 5.55 million. This indicates that even if employers are seeking fewer workers, they're still looking to add staff. It also indicates that employers shook off a slowdown caused by hurricanes earlier this year. Leading sources of increased hiring came from restaurants and hotels, the health care sector, manufacturers and financial services.
This means that manufacturers, for example, added workers in October but they are now seeking fewer workers in the future.
For every job opening, there is now the equivalent of 1.1 unemployed jobseekers, the lowest ratio on record for data that go back to 2001.
The government said last week that employers added a net total of 244,000 jobs in October and 228,000 in November. The unemployment rate stayed at 4.1 percent.
Despite the healthy job market, many people are staying in their jobs rather than departing for new ones. Departures are usually a sign that people are confident they can find new jobs that pay higher wages. The number of quits held steady for a second straight month at 3.18 million. Meanwhile, average hourly earnings have risen just 2.5 percent over the past 12 months, a relatively lackluster figure given the low unemployment rate.
Unfortunately, the predominant exposure most non-Indigenous people get to Indigenous-inspired designs is through cheap souvenirs and tourist trinkets, says Paul.
Despite the fact that many Indigenous communities boast master weavers, beaders, and applique artists, they have yet to receive broader recognition for their talents, she says.
"(It's) because of colonization and because of the commodification of our culture and I think a lot of it has been cheapened through that," says the 34-year-old.
"You can go to any Canadian tourist store and buy a really cheap piece of beaded work that's not even made here in Canada.... It costs more money to do one of a kind custom-made pieces."
By nature, the fashion industry has not been friendly to emerging creators who more often work-to-order or only make small batches, she adds. Those on remote reserves are at a further disadvantage because tools, materials and shipping are more expensive.
"We're not going to be able to mass produce at the level that a major retailer would want. I'm hoping to change or to start influencing how we work with Indigenous designers ... to look at purchasing lower quantities and understanding the value with that," she says.
"By bringing everyone to Toronto I'm really hoping that that sparks some sort of interest and motivation for retailers and buyers to actively go out and find these designers, regardless of where they're located."
With sustainable fashion now trendy in the broader fashion world, Paul hopes Indigenous techniques and knowledge can be recognized for their value. She points to the inspiring work of Janelle Wawia, a self-taught artist from northwestern Ontario who traps her own furs and leather.
"We know where the food goes — it goes into the community to feed community members, bones are used for tools and the fur is used for whatever is being made out of the clothing."
Ducharme says he's added 10 new pieces to a collection he revealed at Vancouver Indigenous Fashion Week last summer, and will unveil his reimagined showcase in part to combat notions that designs are disposable from season-to-season.
The 25-year-old — whose designs are not geared specifically to men or women, but rather "genderless" wearers — says welcoming new ideas is key to fashion's future.
And he's got plenty to offer.
"My work is always going to be an ode to those ancestors who did everything that they could so that my generation and the generations to come after me would have a better tomorrow."
Indigenous Fashion Week Toronto starts Thursday and runs through Sunday.

A spokesman says former President George H.W. Bush is in “good spirits” at a Maine hospital but will need several more days of treatment.
The 93-year-old was taken to a hospital on Sunday when he experienced low blood pressure and fatigue hours after attending a pancake breakfast at the American Legion post in Kennebunkport.
His spokesman said in a tweet Wednesday that Bush is talkative and in good spirits but that the treatments to address his blood pressure “are expected to take several more days.”
The nation's 41st president arrived in Maine on May 20 after being treated for a blood infection. He's without his wife of 73 years, Barbara Bush, who died in April in Houston.
Promising opener Manjot Kalra played a starring role with an unbeaten century as India overpowered Australia by eight wickets in the final to claim the ICC U19 World Cup for a record fourth time here on Saturday.
The opener batted through the innings and remained unbeaten on 101 runs off 102 deliveries as the Indians romped past the modest target of 217 runs with 67 balls to spare.
Harvik Desai played an excellent supporting role at the other end and was not out on 47 runs off 61 balls.
Desai brought up the title win in style, smashing a boundary off Australian pacer Will Sutherland through the off-side.
Kalra was adjudged the man of the match while compatriot Shubman Gill took home the player of the tournament award.
"Great feeling. Enjoyed a lot. Conditions were very good. It was a flat wicket to bat on. In the team, it's been a great environment," an overjoyed Kalra told the media after the final.
India thus became the first nation to win the ICC U19 World Cup four times. They had earlier won the title in 2000, 2008 and 2012.
Australia is second on the list with three titles.
This is the second time that India have defeated Australia in the final. They had earlier defeated the boys from Down Under in the final of the 2012 edition.
Chasing a modest target, India got their chase off to a flying start with Manjot and skipper Prithvi Shaw piling up 71 runs for the opening stand.
India's chase was briefly halted by rain after just four overs, but Manjot and Prithvi ensured that they maintained their focus and after coming back they batted out the initial few overs before cutting loose.
But just when the Indian pair threatened to take the match away, pacer Will Sutherland drew first blood for the Australians by rattling Shaw's off-stump.
The Indian skipper scored 29 runs off 41 deliveries with four hits to the fence.
Shaw's dismissal brought in the centurion of the semi-final against Pakistan, Man-of-the-Tournament Shubman Gill, who raised 60 runs for the second wicket with Manjot before perishing to off-spinner Param Uppal on the personal score of 31.
This was, unfortunately, Gill's first below-50 score in the tournament but wicketkeeper-batsman Harvik Desai ensured that there were no more hiccups in India's road to the title.
With India just five runs shy of the title, Manjot got to his personal landmark, punching one down to square leg for a single even as the celebrations began on the sidelines with the Rahul Dravid-led side romping home in 38.5 overs.
Earlier, electing to bat after winning the toss, Australia rode on Jonathan Merlo's steady 102-ball 76 -- laced with six boundaries -- to set up a modest 216-run total.
Australia lost their three top batsmen with just 59 runs on the board, thanks to pacer Ishan Porel's twin strikes early on.
Porel's victims included the openers Max Bryant (14) and Jack Edwards (28) before fellow fast bowler Kamlesh Nagarkoti joined the party by removing Australian skipper Jason Sangha for an unlucky 13 off 24 balls.
Thereafter, Merlo and Param Uppal (34) steadied the innings with a 75-run fourth wicket stand which saw them going past the 100-run mark.
Left-arm spinner Anukul Roy ended Uppal's 58-ball stay with a brilliant catch in his own follow through.
With Australia tottering at 134/4, Merlo was joined by Nathan McSweeney (23).
The pair added 49 runs for the fifth wicket before McSweeney met the same fate as Uppal, this time caught and bowled by the other Indian spinner, Shiva Singh.
Despite losing his partners at the other end, Merlo continued to torment the Indians, raising his maiden half-century off 60 balls by chopping a slower delivery from Porel for a single to sweeper cover.
Merlo, however, succumbed under the pressure of scoring quick runs, when he attempted a reverse sweep off Roy only to manage a top-edge for Shiva to grab at sweeper cover, even as Australia's hopes were dashed after losing the last five wickets for just 33 runs.
For the boys-in-blue, Ishan Porel, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Shiva Singh and Anukul Roy took two wickets each while Shivam Mavi grabbed one.

New Delhi: Finance minister Arun Jaitley said GST rates on 27 items have been reduced, after the GST Council eased rules for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and exporters.
Small businesses would be allowed to file GST returns once a quarter instead of monthly returns, Jaitley said following the GST Council meeting on Friday. Businesses with turnover of up to Rs1.5 crore will be allowed to file quarterly returns as against monthly filings, Jaitley said. The compliance burden of SMEs in GST has been cut while eligibility of composition scheme has raised to Rs1 crore, he added.
Tax refunds of July and August for exporters will be processed from 10 October, said Jaitley, adding that e-wallet for exporters to start from 1 April 2018.
GST, which was launched in July, is a landmark reform which turned India's 29 states into a single market for the first time. But SMEs, crucial to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plans to create millions more of jobs, have been hurt by the massive tax overhaul that added layers of extra bureaucracy for firms and hit exports.

A push to address chronic absenteeism among students as part of Michigan's new federal education plan comes as the problem is getting worse.
In Michigan, 15.6 percent, or 233,582 students, from K-12 were chronically absent in 2016-17, up from the year before at 14.7 percent.
“We have a lot of kids missing a lot of school,” said Carolyn Claerhout, a truancy expert at Oakland Schools, which serves local districts in Oakland County. “We get it — that this is what we need to have districts focus on.”
State education officials define chronic absence as missing 10 percent of school. In a 180-day school year, that is 18 days.
Officials with the U.S. Department of Education require states to address chronic absenteeism under the Every Student Succeeds Act. Michigan's ESSA plan, which was approved Nov. 28, calls for chronic absenteeism rates to be a factor in measuring school quality, said Kyle Guerrant, deputy superintendent of finance and operations with the Michigan Department of Education.
And for the first time this school year, Guerrant said, Michigan education officials are requiring all school districts to report suspension data for all student populations, not just special education, so they can review how suspensions are impacting student attendance and chronic absenteeism rates.
“It's important that we know why kids are being suspended. It will help us have better conversations with districts; how can they better support students in a teaching way. There is a way to address behavior and keep them in school,” Guerrant said.
Education experts say chronic absenteeism, which starts as early as preschool and kindergarten, increases the likelihood that children are unable to read well by third grade, fail classes in middle school and drop out of high school.
“The reality is they are missing school, no matter what the reason is,” Guerrant said. “The data is clear on the negative outcomes. If you aren't there, you aren't being successful.”
As the days go by
Missing school a few days a month may not seem like much, but educators say if you do the math, it adds up. Being absent two days a month during the school year amounts to four weeks of missed instruction.
Last school year, kindergartners had the highest rates of chronic absenteeism among all grades, with seniors being close behind, according to state data. About 20.4 percent of kindergartners were chronically absent last year while 20.2 percent of seniors were, too. Fifth- and sixth-graders had the smallest group of chronically absent students at 12.9 percent and 12.6 percent, respectively.
Among all racial and ethnic groups, African-American students had the highest rates of chronic absenteeism at 31.9 percent. Students with disabilities, considered economically disadvantaged and those who were identified as homeless were also more likely to be chronically absent, according to state statistics.
Detroit has one of the highest rates of chronic absenteeism in the state.
In the city's public schools, more than half of the district's students — 56.3 percent, or 27,533 students — were chronically absent last school year, a staggering number in a district already beset with record-low test scores and a teacher shortage. The year before, it was 54.8 percent.
In response to the data at Detroit Public Schools Community District, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti moved additional attendance agents directly to schools from the central office to assist in locating chronically absent students and getting them back in school.
Vitti's staff is meeting with principals individually this school year to discuss what they are doing to improve attendance and then sharing best practices with other principals, he said.
“Starting next year, we will connect attendance to strategic plan metrics, my evaluation and principals' evaluation ... and improve systems to take attendance with more accuracy and less time taking attendance,” Vitti said.
Starting in the 2018-19 school year, DPSCD is also launching a formal plan to address chronic absenteeism by decreasing the number of out-of-school suspensions and replacing them with in-school suspensions, Vitti said.
Shifting mentoring programs and at-school wraparound services — that address mental health, behavior and medical issues at the school site — to address chronic absenteeism will also be done, he said.
Last week, the Coalition for the Future of Detroit Schoolchildren issued a report saying chronic absenteeism is among its priorities to improve education for the city's schoolchildren.
DPSCD attendance agent Stephen Bland says he calls and sends emails, too, but after 20 years in the field, he has found a personal visit is best.
“There is no substitute for getting out there and hitting the ground, going to peoples' homes,” Bland said.
Poverty is the driving factor behind chronic absenteeism at DPSCD, Bland said — kids without clothes, uniforms or coats. No transportation to school which can be miles away. Family problems that require assistance.
“Their mindset is at times to make it through another day and education gets put on the back burner. When you are in the situation, people don't realize education is the change agent that can get you out of poverty,” he said.
The reason for absences
Experts say there are plenty of reasons that keep students from being in classrooms, from lack of transportation, illness, anxiety and suspension from school. Absences are often tied to health problems, such as asthma, diabetes, and oral and mental health issues.
Attendance Works, a national and state initiative that pushes for better policy and practice to improve school attendance, estimates that 7 million students across America are missing too much school.
Hedy Chang, executive director of the nonprofit Attendance Works, said children living in poverty are two to three times more likely to be chronically absent and face the most harm because they lack the resources to make up for the lost learning. To compound the problem, many of the absences especially among younger students are excused.
Hedy said in the past, the mindset has been that only truancy — or unexcused absences — were a problem for students. As the issue of chronic absenteeism gets more attention nationally and in local school districts, there comes a better understanding of how all school absences are detrimental to children.
“If our kids aren't in school, it's pretty tough for them to succeed and thrive. Kids who are successful in school are more likely to be contributing citizens. Attendance is our earliest warning sign that kids are off track,” Chang said.
Claerhout, with Oakland Schools, said chronic absenteeism has been identified as a more important measuring stick for academic performance than truancy or daily attendance.
“We need to ask what is this barrier to education? What is happening that this parent can't get this child to school?” Claerhout said.
Oakland Schools, an intermediate district, has been trying to raise awareness about chronic absenteeism since 1995. The county's prosecutor, school superintendents of the 28 school districts in Oakland County, and the intermediate district have together developed an early truancy intervention program to work on the issue of children who are not regularly attending school.
Michigan has a compulsory school attendance law for children ages 6-18 that says they have to be in school continuous and consecutive.
If a local district in Oakland County cannot solve the issue, cases of chronic absenteeism are referred to the intermediate district. Claerhout gets about 1,300 referrals a year from local districts in the county seeking help with chronically absent kids. Of those, 10 percent are sent to court.
A petition in Oakland County family juvenile court can be issued to address the problem and require compliance. But the goal is never to punish; it's to get these kids in school, Claerhout said.
If local districts can bring attendance back up, the next step is to work on attachment, such as building a relationship with an adult in the school building.
The Waterford School District has a dedicated truancy coordinator to monitor and track attendance for students. In 2012, the district created a program and a policy that informs parents of triggers when a student misses school.
Becky Staab, a truancy coordinator for Waterford School District, said she starts with a phone call to parents after five missed days of school and then a letter at seven missed days.
“It says, ‘You know we are worried here. Your child has missed school. What can we do to help you?' ” Staab says. After 10 days, parent meetings are called at the school with parents and school officials. At 20 days, referrals are made to the county.
Educators say chronic absenteeism is more common in transitional years, such as when a child moves to middle school or high school or from kindergarten to first grade.
The reasons for missing school range from anxiety to parents who work and are unaware their child has not gone to school. In some cases, a child refuses to leave home and attend school, she said.
“Sometimes, it's just easier to stay in bed, and no one is making them go. It really depends and is on a case by case basis. These are families we really get to know. Our language is different with each one. Our whole goal is to get them into school,” she said.

In a clear and emphatic denunciation of federal immigration authorities, an Ontario Superior Court judge ordered the release Monday of a refugee claimant he said had been detained in a maximum-security jail “for no real reason at all.”
Ricardo Scotland, a 38-year-old native of Barbados who is the single parent to his 13-year-old daughter, had been held at the maximum-security Niagara Detention Centre in Thorold, Ont., for a total of 18 months in two stints over the last two years. He has no criminal convictions, nor active criminal charges.
He was charged with a number of offences in 2013, but the charges were stayed. In spite of this, he was jailed by Canada's border police, the Canada Border Services Agency, as a flight risk while his refugee claim is being processed.
The Star, as part of a continuing investigation into immigration detention, has previously reported on Scotland's case.
The CBSA has alleged that he breached the conditions of his release, even though criminal bail court, upon which his immigration conditions were reflected, either withdrew the alleged breaches or found them to be innocent mistakes.

It is a happy and prosperous beginning to the New Year for the Canmore Eagles.
Buoyed by strong goaltending and a robust power play, the Eagles took down the Camrose Kodiaks 4-2 on Sunday evening in the first of a two-game set between these two Alberta Junior Hockey League South Division rivals, which also featured the largest crowd this season as 680 fans filed into the Canmore Recreation Centre.
The league-leading scoring tandem of Matt Forchuk and Logan Ferguson each scored power-play goals for the Eagles, while the first day of the new year provided a first goal for Eagles rookie Trevor Van Steinburg. Coy Prevost would put the game on ice with an empty net marker with 17 seconds remaining.
Camrose would trail 3-0 after 40 minutes but would make it a one-goal came on goals by Colin Schmidt and Tate Coughlin in the opening minutes of the third period.
If it wasn't for some outstanding goaltending by Bontorin in the first 40 minutes of this contest the result could have gone the other way. He only had to make 15 saves through the first two periods but many were of the spectacular kind including whipping out a glove hand to deny the Kodiaks a goal on two-man breakaway. The Kodiaks would fire another 14 shots his way in the final 20 minutes but the 20-year-old looked steady even if two shots did get by him.
“That's what a 20-year-old goaltender in our league needs to do, play well enough to give us a chance to win and I thought he was real good and made some big saves,” said Andrew Milne, Eagles GM and head coach.
Canmore outshot Camrose 30-29 on the night, with Patrick Gora in goal for the Kodiaks.
There were plenty of fireworks in the opening half of this game and it led to the Eagles scoring two power-play goals on their first five chances of this game.
Forchuk opened the scoring with his 17th goal with the Eagles enjoying the man advantage. Ferguson fired an intentional shot off the backboards behind the Kodiaks' goal with the puck kicking out to a wide-open Forchuk standing on the goal line at the side of the net. There was nothing but open goal for him to slide the puck into at 15:56 of the opening period.
In the second period, Van Steinburg scored his first junior A goal in his 34th game, whipping the puck over Gora's right shoulder and just under the crossbar far side at 4:05.
Ferguson then scored the Eagles' second power-play goal just 51 seconds later almost from the same right wing spot that Van Steinburg scored. Only Ferguson's shot was lower down and Gora thought he trapped it between blocker and jersey but the puck made its way through and slide just inside the post.
It all looked great for the Eagles through 40 minutes.
However, an early giveaway in the third period allowed Schmidt to score his fourth of the season at 2:27 and breathe some life into the Kodiaks.
Then during a five-on-three power-play, Coughlin, whose hard work on the first goal led to an assist, was given plenty of opportunity to score and made it a 3-2 game at 5:39. The newest member of the Kodiaks got his second goal in his sixth game since joining the team from the BCHL Nanaimo Clippers. He also played two-plus seasons with the WHL Kelowna Rockets.
While trailing 3-2, the Kodiaks would take three more minor penalties in the third period which the Eagles failed to capitalize on while experimenting with the use of five forwards.
“I just think with our back end being a little banged up, and with only six defence, it was time we can give them a rest in these situations,” said Milne, further citing having back-to-back games as motivation to give rest to his blue line corps when it arises.
With the referees finally whistled out the game settled into a mad dash of end-to-end hockey the final six minutes with Prevost's 14th goal at 19:43 settling the result.
The win puts fifth-place Canmore (20-12-4) within one point of fourth-place Camrose (21-14-3) as the two teams have only 15 hours until the puck drops on the next game between these two rivals, 2:30 p.m. at the Canmore Rec Centre.
EAGLES NEST: Healthy scratches for Canmore were Daylan Marchi and Mitch Zambon. ... Camrose was without Jason Mowbray who has joined the Spokane Chiefs of the WHL. ... Canmore was 2-for-9 on the power play and Camrose was 1-for-7.

RSPCA officers in the Bristol area have said they are facing an equine crisis, as the number of rescued horses reaches a four-year high.
Worried members of the public phoned the charity 321 times in 2017 to complain about 265 horses in Bristol and Somerset.
The figures released by the RSPCA highlight the plight of horses as animal rescuers and welfare charities struggle to cope with an ongoing equine crisis.
The problem faced by the charity is highlighted in a number of sickening reports of terrible cruelty inflicted on horses over the past year.
In December we reported on a shocking incident where a South Gloucestershire man was caught on camera viciously hitting a young horse in the face with a piece of wood.
The man was banned from keeping equines for life after he admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a pony in May 2017 by inflicting blunt force trauma and physical violence.
In October, Crumpet the pony was tied up and mutilated by a sick individual in a disgusting attack which took place in a barn in Weston-Super-Mare.
April saw another upsetting report, where sadists slashed horses with knives before leaving them to die in a burning stable in Withywood.

Luckily the owners returned in time, but the two horses had suffered severe smoke inhalation, burns to their bodies and horrific knife wounds to their faces.
Sadly, mistreatment of horses is on the rise across the country.
The charity's new cruelty statistics reveal that nearly 1,000 horses were rescued by the charity from cruelty, suffering and neglect last year (2017), and a staggering 880 horses are still in the charity's care.
The national horse crisis, which charities first highlighted in 2012, has since seen RSPCA officers routinely called out to abandoned horses every day up and down the country, with many of them extremely sick, dead or dying on arrival.
The crisis in figures The charity's 24-hour emergency line received more than 80 calls a day about horses in 2017
The charity took in the highest number of horses into its care for four years (980)
The charity currently has more than 880 (TBC) in its care
Last year the RSPCA secured 25% more convictions for equine offences than two years ago.
It costs the RSPCA more than £3m per year to care for the horses, excluding veterinary cost
The RSPCA's Inspectorate National Equine Co-Ordinator Christine McNeil said: “We've been talking about the horse crisis for several years now, but the truth is the situation is just as severe today as when it started. Last year (2017) we took in more horses than we have in the past four years, and with our inspectors being called to rescue more and more every week, we are stretched to the limits.
“Up and down England and Wales, horses are being found sick, dying or sometimes dead and it is frequently the case that they have been abandoned and left for dead. This is upsettingly very common and it's a massive issue - a very sad one at that. We are constantly receiving calls to our cruelty line - on average 80 per day about horses alone - as well as messages every day on social media from very concerned and upset people asking for our help.
“Many of the calls we receive from people who are concerned about a horse have found them being illegally fly-grazed - where horses are moved from place to eat the grass there, often without the permission of the landowner.
“We are also frequently called about tethered horses, where the animals are kept secured to a peg in the ground on unfenced land with a rope or chain. We do not agree with tethering but sadly there is nothing we can do as this practice remains legal.”
Last year the RSPCA once again dealt with shocking cases of horrific cruelty and neglect, securing 1,492 convictions under the Animal Welfare Act.
The number of convictions the RSPCA secured after investigating cruelty and neglect to horses in England has risen by 25% in two years, with convictions relating to horse accounting for 15% of the total number of convictions secured by the RSPCA in 2017.

The huge inferno at Saddleworth Moor is being treated as arson as investigators probe a bonfire spotted nearby the evening it started.
The fire has raged since the evening of Sunday June 24 with the army being drafted in to help firefighters due to the 'unprecedented scale' of the blaze.
Although now under control, the fire is continuing to burn despite the best efforts of all those involved.
Witnesses reported people lighting a bonfire at around 7.30pm the night fire started on the moors near the Stalybridge estate.
Officers from Greater Manchester Police are currently pursuing this as a possible line of enquiry.

Chief Superintendent Neil Evans, Territorial Policing Commander for Tameside, said: “The moorland fire is now being investigated as arson following information from local witnesses and initial inquiries.”
“The scale of this fire is exceptional and we are treating it with the utmost seriousness.
“That said, we are under no illusion that solid evidence as to where the fire started and what was the cause, will not be easy to establish.

“The areas we have been able to look include dusty ash, burnt peat and grass and, because of this, our work with the fire service will be painstaking.
“We recognise the incredible support that the emergency services have received and we now hope that the local community can help us further by getting in touch with any information that could help our investigation.
“Were you on the moors last Sunday and did you see anything that could help us understand exactly what happened?
“If you know anything, no matter how small, it could help our investigation so please get in touch.”

More celeb senior citizens are travelling to India to see whether they could retire there. They're spending a month in Kochi on the south-west coast, which offers warm weather all year round and low living costs.
"I'm coming at it like a child, with eyes wide open", says actor Paul Nicholas, one of the more lively members of the gang. He joins columnist Dr Miriam Stoppard and actress Amanda Barrie, who is there "to audition India to see if it comes up to scratch".
Former snooker champion Dennis Taylor cracks jokes and is ready to have the time of his life. But Lionel Blair, the oldest at 88, has a bad back and doesn't share his enthusiasm.
"I'm out of my depth, I'm a bit shocked," he reveals. "You feel very vulnerable, with animals roaming in the street."

But by the end of the first week, once he has sailed down backwaters surrounded by emerald green fields, he is won over by the country.
Former Three Degrees singer Sheila Ferguson isn't used to being around people 24 hours a day. The minute she arrives (with Pot Noodles in her suitcase) she demands a room with a veranda. But once she sees the size of Bill Oddie's quarters, she persuades him to swap with her. Meanwhile, celeb chef Rustie Lee, the baby of the group at 63, insists on walking 40 minutes to a food market to buy ingredients – even though the house has a staff and a very experienced cook.
(Photo: BBC)
Within hours, the guests are already proving to be ‘an interesting bunch' says housekeeper Smita, diplomatically.
In the first episode, some of the group try their hand at traditional fishing, attempt yoga (but not Bill, who prefers to watch with a coffee in his hand), queue to buy booze, dance at a Hindu festival and experience a body massage. They also dress in lavish traditional costumes to attend a local wedding.
As Amanda puts it, their experience has "got the edge on Eastbourne, quite frankly".
The Real Marigold Hotel is on tonight, BBC1, 9pm
Come Wednesday, editors, buyers and influencers alike will descend upon Mumbai for the biannual Lakmé Fashion Week. From the music to the set to the actual clothes, a runway show is the purest distillation of a designer's vision for the season ahead. We catch up with Jaspreet Chandok, Vice President and head (Fashion) at IMG to navigate this season's line-up – from Sanjay Garg's much-awaited presentation at the recently refurbished Royal Opera House to Manish Malhotra's launch of bespoke tailoring at his closing show.
What shows should one look out for?
Sanjay Garg's opening show at the Royal Opera House is going to be magical. Manish Arora is coming back after a long time to showcase his Paris collection in India. And of course Manish Malhotra is doing the closing show. Besides that, we have an incredible set of designers. While we keep speaking about the 9:30pm slots, we are equally excited about the Gen Next and emerging designers showcasing their collections.
How are you feeling about Sanjay Garg's opening show at the Royal Opera House?
It's the first time a fashion show is being done there. It's a small venue so the guest list is very tight. But for anybody that's lucky enough to get in, it'll be a show they'll remember for a long time.
Which menswear shows are on the line-up?
Manish Malhotra is launching his bespoke tuxedo line for men as well as doing western wear for the first time. There's also a dedicated men's show in partnership with Johnny Walker, which will see Abhishek Paatni, Asa Kazingmei and Ajay Kumar showcasing their designs. In the business of fashion womenswear is larger category and menswear is underrepresented. But we have the intent to grow menswear with each season.
What are you most excited about?
We look at LFW as a platform for innovation. This time for the sustainable day showcase, we have senior representatives from the United Nations attending. To partner with such organisations makes the conversation much larger.
What are some of the new initiatives you'll have this time around?
While there are innovations in the physical sense like Wendell Rodricks doing the first every designer showcase for plus size people and choosing Opera House as venue, there are a lot of digital initiatives. Right now on our Facebook page, we have a 360-degree schedule. Lakmé Fashion Week is actually the most followed fashion event online. Facebook just did a global case study on us about how we got 60 million unique users last season. So we've upgraded our live streams this – a four-camera set up on Jio, Hotstar, Facebook and Twitter including live designer interviews after every show.
Three tips to survive the five days of Lakme Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017?
For me: 1. Should not speak to anybody in the fashion industry. 2. Work with my fantastic team who can keep the show running even when I'm not around and 3. Do team meetings every morning to face any issue head on.

The Michigan Supreme Court has rejected an appeal in the case of an unusual school labor agreement that was widely viewed as a way to get around the state's right-to-work law.
The decision Thursday means a 10-year side agreement between the Taylor school district and its teachers is dead. Justice Richard Bernstein wanted to hear the case.
The deal was made just before Michigan's right-to-work law started in 2013. Taylor and the Taylor Federation of Teachers had agreed that teachers would pay union dues or a service fee over a 10-year period.
But the Michigan Employment Relations Commission struck it down. The state appeals court agreed, saying it would "undermine" the intent of the right-to-work law, which says workers can't be forced to support a union to keep their job.

Jennifer Lopez shined on the red carpet as she led the glamour at the star-studded Time 100 Gala in New York on Tuesday night.
J-Lo, who was joined by boyfriend Alex Rodriguez, appeared to steal Gigi Hadid's birthday style by opting for a dramatic plunging gold dress that was heavily embellished with silver and gold sequins.
The flowing tulle skirt also featured a daring thigh split that Jennifer, 48, didn't appear to be comfortable with as she tried to desperately cover up it up with her clutch bag as she posed for pictures on the red carpet.
Stranger Things actress Millie Bobby Brown, who is one of the youngest people to be included in the Time 100 list annual List Of The World's Most Influential People, also opted for a show-stopping look, choosing a bridal-inspired Dolce & Gabbana dress.

The white frock featured a puffball skirt and a pretty colourful flower print running from one shoulder to the bottom of the dress.
Singer Kesha also stopped to pose for pictures inside the Lincoln Centre to show off her Mikael D Gown.
Meanwhile, Nicole Kidman kept her outfit muted, choosing to wear a chic all-black ensemble.

The actress was joined by husband Keith Urban, who put a tender arm around his wife as they posed together.
Leslie Jones also had all eyes on her as she flaunted her incredible legs in an oversized white blazer and black heels.
The US comedian and actress finished off the eye-catching look with a pair of cat eye shades and jewelry by Jared Lehr.
Other guests in attendance at the annual event included Yara Shahidi, RuPaul, Ben Platt, Trevor Noah, Sterling K. Brown

The Time list is split into pioneers, leaders, titans, artists and icons, and also features other huge namea such as Hugh Jackman and director Guillermo del Toro.
The Time 100 list was first launched in 1927, but back then it was known as Man of the Year.
These days, it's perhaps best known as Time Person of the Year and sees profiles printed on whom the magazine determines to be the 100 most influential people in the world.
Some controversial people have been included on the list in the past, such as Adolf Hitler in 1938.

NEW DELHI (AP) — India's top court has ruled that election candidates cannot use religion or caste to seek votes, describing them as corrupt practices under electoral laws.
India has a Hindu-nationalist government, and most political parties select candidates in various districts based on caste and religious considerations.
The ruling on Monday is considered significant as it comes months before elections in Uttar Pradesh state where dominant campaign issues are caste affiliations and the building of a Hindu temple in place of a 16th century mosque demolished by Hindu hardliners.
Legislature elections are also due in Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur states.
Hindus constitute nearly 80 percent of India's 1.25 billion people, while Muslims comprise 14.2 percent and the remaining 6 percent adhere to other religions, such as Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism and Jainism.

If the World Cup was won on sportsmanship, Japan would have taken home the top prize. After a heartbreaking loss to Belgium in the round of 16 on Monday, the Japanese men's team stayed behind to clean up their locker room.
Japan held a 2-0 lead in the second half before the Belgians stormed back to take control of the game in the final seconds, CBS Sports reports.
Belgium scored three goals in the final 25 minutes to earn the 3-2 victory. Nacer Chadli netted the winning third goal in the 94th minute.
Despite Japan's loss, the team saluted their traveling fans with a bow and also took the time to clean out their locker room before leaving, according to a photo shared by sports journalist Tancredi Palmeri on Twitter.
The photo shows a spotless dressing room and a note with a single word in Russian: "спасибо (spasibo)," which translates to "thank you."
But it was't just the players. Japanese fans stayed after every game of the tournament to clean the trash out of their section of the stadium -- including Monday. Some fans even tidied while fighting back tears.
Amazing from Japan.
This is how they left the changing room after losing v Belgium: cleaned it all.
And in the middle, have left a message to Russia: “Spasibo” (Thank you) pic.twitter.com/lrwoIZt2pR — Tancredi Palmeri (@tancredipalmeri) July 3, 2018

Diet Coke finally reversed its downward spiral, Coca-Cola reported on Tuesday.
In January, Diet Coke launched new flavors, packaging, and advertising in an attempt to win over millennial customers.
Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said that the company is considering adding "new, interesting" varieties to the Diet Coke line up, after flavors like Feisty Cherry and Twisted Mango helped win over millennial shoppers.
After years of struggle, Diet Coke is finally on the cusp of a turnaround.
On Tuesday, Coca-Cola reported that Diet Coke "returned to volume growth in North America" for the first time in years. The success follows a brand revamp announced in January, when Coca-Cola rolled out new flavors, packaging, and advertising for Diet Coke.
The revamp proved "bold enough and interesting enough" to reverse Diet Coke's negative sales trend, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said in a call with investors. According to Quincey, the "small positive" growth by volume came from three major groups: lapsed Diet Coke drinkers, people drinking flavored and sparkling water, and millennials.

Attracting millennials has been front-and-center in Coca-Cola's plan for Diet Coke's comeback.
The sleek cans and new flavors, such as Feisty Cherry and Twisted Mango, aimed for a trendier drinker than Coca-Cola Classic. According to Quincey, one-third of the sales improvement by volume could be attributed to the new flavors, while two-thirds were connected to classic Diet Coke.
"I think the flavors certainly caught people's attention. I can imagine we will now follow up with some new, interesting flavors," Quincey said on a call with reporters on Tuesday.
Marketing has also been aimed at millennials, with a Super Bowl ad that was originally designed for social media and Instagram meme account Girl With No Job posting Diet Coke sponsored content for her 2.8 million followers. Quincey says that, while the company is continuing to analyze the results, the more "contemporary" advertising also played a role.
Historically, Diet Coke has failed to fully win over millennials, as younger Americans have turned away from soda.
For the last few years, Diet Coke has been the weakest link in the company's cola lineup. Industry publication Beverage Digest reported Diet Coke US sales by the dollar dropped 1.9% in 2016.
Americans are increasingly cutting sugar out of their diets, meaning that they're drinking less of sugary sodas. But shoppers remain suspicious of Diet Coke's use of artificial ingredients. From 2005 to 2017, diet soda sales dropped a whopping 34%.
However, the suspicion over diet colas may be waning, as Quincey says Americans are grouping zero-calorie sodas alongside flavored sparkling water — one of the fastest-growing beverage categories.
"There's a blurring of the categories going on," Quincey said.
London: The "Big Ben" bell in the British Parliament`s famous clock tower will cease its regular bongs at noon on August 21, falling silent for most of the next four years while renovation works are carried out, the House of Commons said on Monday.
The hammers which have struck the 13.7 tonne bell every hour for most of the last 157 years will be locked and disconnected from the clock, although the bongs will still sound for important events such as New Year`s Eve celebrations.
"This essential programme of works will safeguard the clock on a long term basis, as well as protecting and preserving its home, the Elizabeth Tower," said Steve Jaggs, Keeper of the Great Clock.
The Palace of Westminster on the bank of the River Thames, home to Parliament, is a world heritage site and major tourist attraction, and Jaggs encouraged members of the public to gather in nearby Parliament Square to hear the final bongs next Monday.
The 96-metre-tall Elizabeth Tower, believed to be the most photographed building in the United Kingdom, is already half enveloped in scaffolding as part of a major renovation project.
As part of the works the clock housing Big Ben will be dismantled and each cog examined and restored. The clock`s four dials will be cleaned and repaired, their cast iron framework renewed and the hands removed and refurbished.
One working clock face will remain visible at all times, telling the time silently, and it will be powered by a modern electric motor until the original clockwork mechanism is reinstated.
All the other bells which chime every 15 minutes will be silent as well during the works that are due to be completed in 2021 when Big Bell`s familiar tolls will begin again.
A RUSSIAN journalist has pulled off a modern miracle after returning from the dead following his bloody murder on the streets of the Ukrainian capital of Kiev.
Arkady Babchenko was unveiled, alive and well, at a news conference just 24 hours after Ukrainian police reported he had been assassinated in front of his apartment building.
Authorities said Babchenko, who was a vocal critic of the Russian government, was found by his wife after being shot multiple times.
He was reported to have died in an ambulance on the way to the hospital.
However, in a move that has shocked the world, Vasyl Gritsak, Ukrainian Security Service chief, announced the police had solved the murder at a press conference on Wednesday (Ukrainian time), only to reveal a very-much alive Babchenko.

An apologetic Babchenko said he had "no options" but to follow through with the stunt after being informed there had been a threat on his life.
"I'm still alive," he said. "Apologies to my wife, Olechka. I'm sorry, but there were no other options. The operation was being prepared for two months.
"They told me a month ago. As the result of the operation, a man is taken, he is in custody."
Babchenko fought in Russia's two Chechen campaigns, experiences he would later retell in the book One Soldier's War, before becoming a well regraded war correspondent.
However, his views on the Kremlin made him an unpopular voice in Russia, and he admitted he endured more than his share of death threats.
Then, last year, after another threat on his life, he fled the country.
But the threats continued, forcing him to take the drastic action of faking his own death.
Despite the relief of family and friends seeing Babchenko safe and well, the stunt has been criticised by many in the media industry.
"It is pathetic and regrettable that the Ukrainian police have played with the truth, whatever their motive... for the stunt," Reporters Without Borders head Christophe Deloire said.
Qatar has agreed its long-awaited order for 24 British-built Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets and a billion pounds' worth of missiles assembled in the UK to go with them.
The £5bn Qatari order for the jets, built by BAE at its Warton and Samlesbury bases in Lancashire, will not, however, save all of the thousands of jobs set to go over the next few years.
BAE confirms it is slashing 2,000 jobs READ MORE
On top of that comes a £1bn order for Brimstone and Meteor missiles from French-headquartered defence conglomerate MBDA, which is one-third owned by BAE Systems and incorporates the formerly BAE-owned bits of the UK's guided missile industry.
Although the Eurofighter is nominally a multinational EU effort, in reality it is a mostly British aircraft built mostly in Britain by a mostly British firm. The Qatari order has been on the cards for years and a letter of intent was signed by former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon in September this year.
Qatar also intends to buy a handful of Hawk jets, also made by BAE Systems. The Hawk is famous as the jet flown by the RAF's Red Arrows aerobatic team; it also equips RAF fast jet training units as well as a score of air forces around the world, plus the US Navy (with the licence-built T-45 Goshawk).
"We are delighted to begin a new chapter in the development of a long-term relationship with the State of Qatar and the Qatar Armed Forces, and we look forward to working alongside our customer as they continue to develop their military capability," said a clearly chuffed Charles Woodburn, chief exec of BAE Systems.
New defence secretary Gavin Williamson chipped in, also in a canned quote: "These formidable jets will boost the Qatari military's mission to tackle the challenges we both share in the Middle East, supporting stability in the region and delivering security at home."
The deal is good albeit belated news for British industry: the Typhoons won't be delivered until "late 2022", BAE said, while the Hawk element of the deal has yet to be decided at all. MBDA isn't struggling for work, thanks in part to the RAF's consumption of Brimstone air-to-ground guided missiles in the Middle East, but a fresh order for those and Meteor missiles keeps the order books nicely swelled.
The UK and Qatar will also form a joint squadron to provide aerial security during the 2022 football World Cup, which the Gulf state is hosting.
While Williamson was crowing about the deal securing thousands of jobs (one of the key tenets of Ministry of Defence public relations is that actually defending the nation comes a very distant second to job creation schemes), it isn't saving all that many; hundreds of the planned redundancies are still going ahead. Nonetheless, it's a few billion added to UK plc's bottom line.
BAE Systems is expecting to sign a deal with Saudi Arabia for 48 Typhoons at some point in the near future. ®
There Is Extreme Danger Ahead And All Roads Lead To A Higher Gold Price from King World News
As we kick off trading in the second month of 2018, there is extreme danger ahead and despite today's takedown, all roads lead to a higher gold price.
February 2 ( King World News ) – This email came from one of the global KWN readers (Kevin W.): “Here is a great article with super charts that make it quite easy to see the Feds predicament. It's one of the best analyses that even the new paradigm young gunslinging analysts can understand and should have the same conclusion regarding the US reserve currency and its seigniorage…
I would add that the FED's own book is quickly turning upside down as their assets decline in value with higher interest rates. There is however a simple way for the Fed to prevent their own balance sheet from reflecting negative equity and preventing excess reserves from falling faster than the reduction of the Fed's balance sheet. And no additional QE is needed. The Treasury simply imposes a yield ceiling on its debt, officially capping rates. It's already happened a number of times before, mostly during wartime, which of course, make no mistake, the US is in today.

LAS VEGAS (AP) - The Walt Disney Studios has previewed a scene from the Star Wars spinoff "Solo" featuring the card game where Han Solo and Lando Calrissian meet at CinemaCon Tuesday in Las Vegas. The scene cuts off right as the two space scoundrels decide to bet their ships.
The studio also unveiled early footage from its live-action adaption of "Dumbo" and "Aladdin," starring Will Smith as the Genie, and showed the first scene from "The Incredibles 2," which picks up right where the first left off in 2004.
Both "Solo: A Star Wars" story and "The Incredibles 2" hit theaters this summer.
Unlike most studio presentations at the annual theater owner convention, Disney doesn't generally bring out the stars of its films. Instead it lets the footage and behind-the-scenes reels do the selling.
All you need to know about the Windies vs World XI match
Two legspin prodigies and a host of cricket greats battle it out at Lord's for a good cause
On 31 May, Windies will play a Twenty20 International match against ICC World XI, an iconic match to be played very fittingly at the home of cricket, Lord's. The reigning ICC World T20 champions will take on a star-studded World XI side comprising cricketers from as many as eight nations in a bid to raise funds for a cause that is very crucial to not only the Caribbeans but the entire cricketing fraternity.
"We've got Pakistanis and Indians sharing a dressing room" - World XI head coach Andy Flower.
The World XI match against @westindies
at the @HomeOfCricket
will help rebuild stadia in the Caribbean, but it will also do so much more.
READ 👇https://t.co/2CQjyJDr8r pic.twitter.com/1gFYUkfldA — ICC (@ICC) May 30, 2018
Reason behind the match
Ronald Webster Park in Anguilla, Sir Viv Richards Stadium in Antigua, Windsor Park in Dominica, AO Shirley Recreation Ground in BVI and Carib Lumber Ball Park in St Martin – will now be refurbished with the funds from the one-off Twenty20 International match between ICC World XI and the Windies at Lord's on 31 May.
"To have two category 5 hurricanes in the space of two weeks was unprecedented and everyone around the world was shocked by the destruction which was caused," Colin Graves, the ECB chairman, said on February 14, 2018, when the fixture was initiated. "The ECB and CWI have always enjoyed a fantastic relationship and we are keen to support them and the people of the Caribbean in this fundraising initiative."
"Hurricanes Irma and Maria have devastated parts of the Eastern Caribbean and we have been considering how CWI can best show support for our region in the most impactful way," CWI president Dave Cameron said on the same occasion urging the world to get behind the victims of the calamity in the way they know best, ergo, cricket.
Titled, Hurrican Relief T20 Challenge, the financial proceeds from the staging of the much-anticipated premium match will go in the restoration efforts. This will not be the first time that an ICC World XI will take field to develop a philanthropic cause, in 2005 it played an ODI against an Asia XI side in the World Cricket Tsunami Appeal and in 2017, it played the Independence Cup in Pakistan to welcome back full-fledged international cricket into the country after a nearly decade-long hiatus.
Where to watch?
The match will be broadcast on Sky Sports on May 31, 2018 starting GMT 16:00 onwards.
New Delhi: The BJP's electoral victory in the recent assembly polls has virtually ensured that its candidate will become the next president of India.
The BJP has initiated moves to reach out to the opposition parties on selecting a consensus candidate for the upcoming presidential poll. However, the ruling party does not need support of major opposition parties.
The party's victories in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand have mathematically guaranteed it a lion's share in the electoral college, which would elect the next president.
President Pranab Mukherjee's term ends on July 24 and the nomination process for the July 17 poll began today.
The electoral college which elects the president through the system of proportional representation comprises elected MPs and members of state legislative assemblies -- a total of 4,896 voters including 4,120 MLAs and 776 elected MPs.
While 233 are elected members of the Rajya Sabha, 543 are from the Lok Sabha.
While the Lok Sabha Speaker, an elected member, can vote, two nominated members from the Anglo-Indian community in the Lok Sabha and 12 nominated MPs in the Rajya Sabha cannot.
The value of an MLA's vote depends on the population of the state he or she represents. But the value of the vote of an MP is the same and does not vary.
The total value of the electoral college is 10,98,903.
Before the Assembly polls, the NDA was short of 75,076 votes in terms of value. But after the BJP's astounding performances in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Manipur, the gap will narrow down to 20,000 votes, an official in the Election Commission explained.
If the BJP is able to get the support of parties such as the AIADMK with 134 MLAs and the BJD with 117 MLAs, it can see the person of its choice in the Rashtrapati Bhavan easily.
Even if these parties do not support the BJP, it can still manage to scrape through with the help of smaller parties.
The voting for the president's position is through a secret ballot, and party whip does not apply.
In the 245-member Rajya Sabha, the BJP has 56 members, while the Congress with 59 is the single largest party.
With wins in Assembly polls, the BJP is set to emerge as the single largest party in the Rajya Sabha too next year and the NDA's tally would be close to 100. It would, however, still be short of a majority in the upper house.
Mayawati's BSP, which finished a poor third in Uttar Pradesh with a tally of just 19 seats, will not be in a position to send her to the Rajya Sabha again when her current term ends next year.
LAHORE : Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah on Wednesday termed withdrawal of Nasir Khan Khosa's name for Punjab's caretaker chief minister (CM) a joke.
He was exclusively talking to a private television channel.
“Decision to nominate Nasir Khan Khosa as caretaker CM of Punjab was taken after thorough consultation with Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI). There is no space to take back Khosa's name at present”, Sanaullah asserted.
Sanaullah held that further dialogue on same issue can't be held as per Constitution. He asserted that Khosa was a honest man.
Earlier, PTI has withdrawn its nominee Nasir Khan Khosa for the post of caretaker Punjab Chief Minister (CM), reported Dunya News.
As per details garnered, opposition leader in the Punjab Assembly Mian Mehmood ur Rasheed stated that party would announce new name for the same after holding consultation. He further stated that announcement was made in haste. Rasheed adopted stance that names of Tariq Khosa and Nasir Khosa were given to him by PTI supremo Imran Khan.
He went on to say that party had fallen prey to misunderstanding. “Ever since his nomination, Nasir Khan Khosa has become a controversial figure”, held Rasheed.
PTI will propose name of new caretaker Punjab CM today.

The shameful act of murder of an innocent Medical College student in Kohat speaks volumes of how ruthless and destructive our society has become as a whole. We have reached the lowest ebb of moral degeneration. From paedophilia to homicide, we have everything in our arsenal. After committing the murder, the murderer not only escaped from crime scene but also managed to flee from the country.
The silence of Imran Khan on the issue is causing collateral damage to his reputation as well as government of PTI in the KP. Such killers must be crushed with an iron hand and in an exemplary way. I request Imran Khan to take personal interest and move KP machinery to capture and punish the perpetrator of this heinous crime which put millions of eyes to tears. Justice delayed is, indeed, justice denied.

RICHMOND, Va. — Otis Livingston II scored 22 points and made four straight free throws in the last 7.7 seconds as George Mason held off Richmond 79-75 on Saturday in an upset that knocked the Spiders out of a tie for second place in the Atlantic 10 Conference.
George Mason (10-13, 4-6) held a 10-point lead with 2:33 remaining. Richmond's Nick Sherod made two free throws with 1:11 left to top his previous career-high of 28 and pull the Spiders within 75-71. After George Mason freshman Goanar Mar was called for a double dribble, Richmond missed a 3-pointer and had a putback blocked but Jacob Gilyard stole it and Sherod got Richmond within 75-73 with an inside basket at 36.6.
George Mason's Justin Kier missed the front end of a 1-and-1 with 25.9 seconds left but Sherod was short on an open 3-pointer from the wing.
Sherod finished with 32 points and 11 rebounds, Grant Golden pitched in 10 points with 10 rebounds and Gilyard scored 11 for Richmond (8-14, 6-4). The Spiders lost ground to Davidson (12-9, 7-3), which won Saturday.

New Delhi: Twenty one Delhi Police personnel, including six women officers, have been awarded the President's police medals for exemplary services on the occasion of Independence Day.
The President's Police Medal for Gallantry was awarded to Additional DCP (retired) S.K. Giri.
The President's Police Medal for Distinguished Service was awarded to Joint Commissioner of Police (Operations) Robin Hibu and ACP Suresh Chand Tyagi.
Among the 24 recipients of Police Medal for Meritorious Service is Special Cell DCP P.S. Kushwah, who was instrumental in some high-profile arrests, including that of Mumbai-based don Ashwini Naik.
In 2003, as an ACP, Kushwah had unearthed a conspiracy by Lashkar-e-Taiba to execute a blast near India Gate.
Also, in the same year, he apprehended Jafar Umar, linked to terrorist outfit Hizbul Mujahideen. Umar was later convicted by a trial court.
This past weekend my nephew, Kyle, had his First Confirmation at the Cathedral Basilica. Of course I was a little worried about Lu and how she would behave because she's 19 months old and doesn't understand when to be quiet. She actually did great and provided us with some funny stories ... such as when the church bells would ring, she would loudly say, "Hello?"! It was pretty adorable.
For the most part, everyone around us was understanding, but there was one woman who seemed annoyed. As a parent of a toddler, I do get nervous in certain situations we are in, but I can also take a step back and realize she's a toddler and toddlers will be toddlers. I will leave it at that.
We haven't flown with Lu and honestly, the thought of flying with her makes me nervous ONLY because of the other passengers. Not everyone is as nice as Todd Walker. Who's Todd? Read on ...
A woman named Jessica Rudeen was flying from Kansas City to Charlotte earlier this month with her three-year-old daughter AND four-month-old son. Her daughter Caroline had a meltdown after they boarded and the baby was screaming too. Luckily, they ended up sitting next to the nicest guy EVER - a guy from Kansas named Todd Walker.
He offered to hold the baby while Jessica dealt with Caroline. Then she needed to feed the baby. So he switched gears and started talking to Caroline to keep her distracted. He kept it up the entire flight. He watched a movie with her, helped her color, and let her lean over him while he showed her stuff out the window. By the end of the flight, they were best buds.
At some point, Todd and Jessica realized they also had the same connecting flight from Charlotte to Wilmington. When they landed, they walked to the gate together. Then before they boarded, he talked to someone at the desk and asked them to change his seat so he could sit next to them again for the last leg of their trip.
Jessica says he told her he has two kids of his own, and someone helped his wife when she had to fly a while back. So he was just trying to pay it forward.
What a great guy!!! Jessica posted pics on Facebook.
The City reminds residents that the Burn Fee Permit fee is now $10, effective February 1, 2018. This recent change from the original $5 fee is part of the City's User Fee review that occurred following the City Council's budget work session in fall 2017. User fees are fees for services for specific users, and should recover most of the related cost of providing the service, so general taxes are not supporting services for specific users. Under Hancock provisions, the City is only allowed to recover the cost of providing the service.
A burn permit is required for any burning done within city limits. Permits can be purchased at the City Finance Department or any of the six Joplin Fire Stations. Permits are valid for three consecutive days*, starting with the date of purchase. If purchased at the City Finance Department, cash, check, and money order is accepted, however the Joplin Fire Stations do not accept cash.
Citizens are also asked to keep in mind City fire ordinances:
No burning after sunset.
Burn piles must be at least 50 feet from any stricture and must be overseen by an adult at all times.
Some means of extinguishment must be available on location.
Burn permits are not necessary for cooking fires, barbecues, grills, or outdoor fireplaces.
The Finance Department, located on the third floor of City Hall, 602 South Main, is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. If residents are planning to burn during the weekend, they will need to obtain their permit on Friday.
Residents need to inquire with the Joplin Fire Department about weather conditions and if burning is allowed on each day. Residents can obtain this information by calling 417-623-0403 or going to their website at www.joplinmofire.org .
“Residents should call each and every day prior to burning,” said Joplin Fire Chief Jim Furgerson. “The Fire Department makes this determination early in the day to allow our residents time to complete their yard work.”
Furgerson also reminds citizens that they need to call on weekends as well.
“Although residents may have the burn permit, it is not a guarantee that the weather conditions will be favorable for burning. We evaluate wind speed, storm movements, humidity and precipitation in our decision to allow burning.”
* If residents purchase a permit, and burn conditions are not favorable during their three-day period, they may return it to the Finance Department within three days to receive another permit that will be good for an additional three days.
In 2016, an Emirati man was sentenced to 10 years in jail for planting 38 marijuana plants in his Dubai villa and a Dh50,000 fine. According to Dubai Police, the majority of the plants were found on the ground floor of the villa and some of the plants had reached up to 1.5 metres in height.

There has been a lot of chatter about local elections in the national news, and several people have asked Bristol.Live why we haven't had any coverage of the impending votes.
Well, the simple answer is because we don't have any local elections taking place.
In a rare turn of events Bristol, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset will not hold any council elections on May 3, meaning there will be no chance to change the political make-up of the authorities.
In fact, the only vote taking place in the region will be on May 24th for the Westbury-on-Trym and Henleaze by-election which was triggered after Liberal Democrat councillor, Clare Campion-Smith stood down at the start of April.
The lack of elections is down to the voting cycles employed by the individual councils.
Bristol, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset councils all work to a four-year voting pattern.
The last local council elections for South Gloucestershire and North Somerset took place in 2015, meaning residents will have the chance to go to the polls in May next year.
The last Bristol City Council elections were in 2016, meaning residents will next vote in a local election in 2020.
Bristol will also vote for its directly elected city mayor – the post currently held by Labour's Marvin Rees – in 2020.
Residents in Bristol, North Somerset, South Gloucestershire and Bath & North East Somerset (B&NES) will also vote for the next Police and Crime Commissioner – the post currently held by independent Sue Mountstevens – in 2020.
The next West of England Combined Authority (Weca) election - the post currently held by Conservative Metro Mayor, Tim Bowles - will take place in 2021.
The next general election was due to take place in 2020, but last year's snap election means this has been shifted back to 2022.
Some 156 of England's 353 county, district and unitary authorities will hold local elections next month.

When you think about Vin Diesel's movies, you probably imagine a high speed action movie with either fast cars, big guns, or both. Yet one of the actor's most beloved films is The Iron Giant, a childhood classic from 1999 that's hitting Netflix on April 1. While the full list of the movies coming to Netflix next month will come out on March 20, knowing that The Iron Giant will soon be available should get you pretty pumped.
In addition to Diesel, the acclaimed animated film features the voices of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., Cloris Leachman, Eli Marienthal, and John Mahoney. It's a star-studded cast, and the movie's director, Brad Bird, is also a big name as he went on to later direct The Incredibles in 2004 and Ratatouille in 2007. Bird also recently directed Incredibles 2, which is one of 2018's most highly-anticipated movies. Based on the major star power behind Iron Giant, you can be sure that the movie will amaze you whether you're revisiting it or seeing it for the first time, even almost 20 years after it first hit theaters.
One of the most memorable things about The Iron Giant is its emotional impact. Similarly to E.T., the story follows a mysterious appearance of an alien creature who befriends a young boy. This time, a giant (voiced by Diesel) falls from the sky, only to be discovered by Hogarth Hughes (Marienthal). Hogarth takes the Iron Giant in, but (years-old spoilers ahead) the U.S. army eventually learns about the gargantuan figure after his impressive weaponry attracts attention. The army tries to capture the giant, but Hobarth saves his new friend by hiding him in a scrapyard.
Warner Bros. Pictures on YouTube
Since the original story of The Iron Giant was written during the 1950s, it fittingly centers around Cold War paranoia of foreign spies. At its core, the movie tells the story of a powerful being that's built to destroy, but eventually becomes a superhero after learning from Hobarth about good versus evil. Not only will The Iron Giant's lessons in Goodness 101 make you cry, but the emotional connection that Hobarth makes to a being that the U.S. army fears is a menace planted by the USSR will also feel eerily relevant today.
The Iron Giant not only tells the story of a potentially threatening character who learns to love a young boy, but it also makes a powerful point about choosing your own identity. When Hogarth shows the giant his favorite things, he points to two different comic books, one about Superman, and one about "Atomo, the Metal Menace." Atomo, as you can guess from the comic's title, is a made up superhero villain, and both Hogarth and the giant immediately notice the similarities between the Iron Giant and Atomo. Of course, the name Atomo sounds a lot like "atomic" and it refers to the U.S.'s fear of a nuclear attack at the time, but even if you're watching The Iron Giant today, you'll sympathize with the giant's fear that he, too, could be evil.
Rather than decide that he will turn out like Atomo — something which his body would allow him to do — the Hogarth tells the Iron Giant that he's more like Superman instead. That lesson resonates with the giant, and he ultimately agrees that he can be like Superman if he so chooses. In a way, the story resembles Black Panther's, as T'Challa realizes that his dad might not have made moral errors that he wishes to avenge.
As you wait in nail-biting anticipation for Avengers: Infinity War to come out on April 27, The Iron Giant is the perfect movie to stream in the meantime. From its awesome superhero action to its heartwarming lesson in the power everyone has to choose their own identity, it's no wonder the movie's a celebrated classic.

Reports: Manchester United set to complete first signing of the summer
A good addition, Manchester United fans?
A good signing?
What's the rumour?
According to reports from the BBC, Manchester United are closing in on Porto's Diogo Dalot. The full-back is reportedly a transfer target for the Red Devils.
In case you didn't know...
A product of Porto's famed youth academy, Dalot has been a regular for Porto's B team this season. He got the call-up to the first team in the second half of the season and has made 8 appearances at the senior level.
The 19-year-old is primarily a right-back but is capable of playing on the left side as well. His current contract with Porto runs out in 2019 and reportedly has a release clause of £17.4 million in his contract.
The heart of the matter
Mourinho is set to overhaul his defence this season as they have come under criticism for their poor performances. He wants to strengthen United's right-back area as Antonio Valencia will soon be 33 years old. Matteo Darmian is expected to leave the club as well.
Thus, Manchester United have been linked with Porto's Dalot who has caught the eye of United's scouts. Mourinho is set to make a move for the player and is ready to make him their first recruit of the summer.
The club is looking to activate his release clause in the coming days as per the report.
Rumour rating/probability - 8/10
Many sources, including credible ones, are reporting the same and we believe that there is some truth after all in the rumours.

5 Takeaways from this week's WWE SmackDown Live (3 July 2018)

Team Hell No faced The Usos, while James Ellsworth took on Asuka
Five matches took place as WWE SmackDown Live emanated from Omaha, Nebraska this week.
The show began with the reunited Daniel Bryan and Kane arguing over their previous rivalries, only to be interrupted by The Usos, who were informed by General Manager Paige that they would be added to the SmackDown Tag Team title match at Extreme Rules if they could defeat Team Hell No in the main event.
In the first match of the night, Jeff Hardy celebrated Independence Day by successfully defending his United States Championship against The Miz, defeating him with a Twist of Fate followed by a Swanton Bomb.
Next up, all three members of The New Day competed in a pancake-eating contest. However, just five seconds into their allocated five minutes, they were attacked by SAnitY and the segment ended with Eric Young sending Xavier Woods through a table following a top-rope elbow drop.
Elsewhere on the show, Asuka's match against James Ellsworth ended in a double-countout when Carmella's sidekick ran away from “The Empress of Tomorrow”, while Becky Lynch recorded her sixth consecutive SmackDown Live victory by defeating Peyton Royce.
In the night's featured matches, AJ Styles warmed up for his Extreme Rules match against Rusev by defeating Aiden English, and Team Hell No put their differences aside to defeat The Usos in the main event.
Let's take a look at five things that stood out from this week's episode.
#5 Credit to WWE for acknowledging Team Hell No's storied history
Kane lost all four of his previous televised matches in 2018
When Daniel Bryan and Kane reunited with a hug at the end of last week's SmackDown Live, it looked as though the duo would immediately be back on the same page ahead of their upcoming SmackDown Tag Team Championship match against The Bludgeon Brothers at Extreme Rules.
However, long-term WWE viewers with good memories will know that things didn't exactly end well when Team Hell No split last time, with Kane hitting Bryan with three tombstones on an episode of Raw (as well as trying to abduct his wife!) during their WWE Championship rivalry after WrestleMania 30.
WWE often rewrites history (or neglects to mention it at all) when two people are involved in a storyline together after a long period of time, so credit to them for getting old and new fans fully up to speed on Team Hell No's drama-filled history throughout this week's SmackDown Live.

The Archaeoacoustics Field of Study
"Archaeoacoustics is an interesting new method for re-analyzing ancient sites, it uses different study parameters to re-discover forgotten technology which operates on the human emotional sphere." (SBRG).
© CC BY 3.0
"Archaeoacoustic research-sonic science applied to archaeological evidence-has revealed secrets built into Chavín's architecture, unlocked by the sound of conch shells that were buried for millennia." "Performing a replica shell horn inside Chavín's galleries, I can feel through my body the resonances between instrument and architecture, a physically and emotionally transformative experience that would have been similarly sensed-but interpreted differently-by humans in the past".
Purpose and Use of Ancient Conch Musical Instruments
In this article, I will introduce the subject of archaeoacoustics and ancient "musical instruments". As we will see, these can be used in conjunction with a number of ancient sites from around the world.Archaeoacoustics is the use of acoustical study within the wider scientific field of archaeology. This includes the study of the acoustics at archaeological sites, and the study of acoustics in archaeological artifacts. Over the last 40 years it has become increasingly obvious that studying the sonic nature of certain areas of archaeology can help us understand ancient cultures. Archaeoacoustics is an interdisciplinary field, it includes various fields of research including: archaeology, ethnomusicology, acoustics and digital modelling. These form the larger field of music archaeology.One of the leading research groups publishing new papers on archaeoacoustics is SB Research Group (SBRG). SBRG is a multidisciplinary university project supported by University of Trieste, Italy "that aims to study from 2010 the architecture, geometry, shape and materials of ancient structures in Europe".Research over the last few decades is starting to shed light on the connection between ancient instruments and ancient sites. At Chavín de Huántar, Peru, Miriam Kolar of Stanford University reports in her article, "The Code of the Conch - How the science of sound explained an ancient Peruvian oracle":Chavín de Huántar and the work carried out by Stanford University provide us with a window into the acoustic past.. From my own research and experience, I can add, whilst inside certain Egyptian pyramids, being immersed in these sound frequencies has a more pronounced effect than simply listening to the sound frequency on headphones.Certain notes produced by the conch shell are amplified by the chamber it's played in. I can say from personal experience, once a stone structure's resonant pitch has been matched, you can feel sound waves entering the body. On the tours I help organise, the first contact people have with this effect can often be very surprising. In this setting, the human voice can often sound like a didgeridoo, in the past, Australian guests have looked around for someone playing a didgeridoo! Even though the sound is simply my voice, creating vowel sounds, which are then amplified by the chamber.People of the past may have experienced similar astonishment. Once the initial surprise is out of the way, I explain how altered states can be accomplished. This is where the practice of meditation can help. A quiet mind is key. Many of us have trouble simply sitting in silence; this can act as a barrier to the effects of sound. Relaxation and attention help to facilitate the process.Read the remainder of the article here

Michigan's Mason Cole offers versatility on the offensive line. (Photo: David Guralnick / Detroit News)
Ann Arbor — Michigan offensive line coach Greg Frey is encouraged by the effort the linemen have been putting in this preseason camp, a carryover from a focused summer conditioning led by veterans Mason Cole and Patrick Kugler.
There are still plenty of questions marks on the line and no one is prepared to reveal a starting five — this has been made perfectly clear since the start of camp on July 31 — and Frey is just fine with that.
“The guys have been working hard, had a great summer,” Frey said Monday. “There's a really good vibe. They're fighting. It's been a pleasure watching them grow, excel and learn and become a team.”
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh last Friday shed some light on the offensive line competition, and there were no surprises.
“Mike Onwenu, (Jon) Runyan, (Juwann) Bushell-Beatty have all been in there rotating with the ones,” Harbaugh said. “(Ben) Bredeson has been a mainstay, (Mason) Cole is a mainstay. (Patrick) Kugler has had a nice camp. He's giving us a lot of confidence there. They continue to pick up the enormous variety of blitzes we see from our own defense. It only makes us better, which you love. It's not the normal practice sessions. There's a lot of chaos. It will make us better.”
Harbaugh laughed and said the line hasn't been able to block defensive tackle Maurice Hurst. Frey loves that his line is developing by facing a defensive line that also includes Rashan Gary, Bryan Mone and Chase Winovich.
“You know the old saying, ‘Iron sharpens iron,'” Frey said. “When you've got guys coming in and you're trying to prepare them to play, who you practice against plays a big part in that. While you can't go every single snap every single day against Rashan or Mo, what does happen is it becomes competitive. And when it becomes competitive, it brings the level of play up for guys.”
More: Michigan's Chris Evans preaches power of positive thinking
Michigan's season opens Sept. 2 against Florida in Arlington, Texas. Frey, who is coaching tackles and tight ends, while Tim Drevno handles the interior line, said competition is fierce and nothing is settled.
“Right now, the focus is on us,” he said. “It's on developing each kid and correcting things. Everybody is doing really good things and everybody is doing some things you want to do better.
“At this point in camp, legs are tired, guys are fighting, so it's a situation where you're really trying to bring the stress level up and individually correct and develop. And as we get through camp, I think separation occurs and it goes from there. It's a little too early to tell right now.”
Frey-Cole connection
Frey and senior Mason Cole go way back to Cole's high school days. Both are native Floridians and from the same town, so Frey had some insight into the young lineman.
“You'll have to confirm this, but I think I was his first offer,” Frey said. “I've had the privilege of watching Mason develop as a young man and as a person.”
From early on, Frey identified Cole for his athleticism and natural leadership ability.
“Mason was special in high school,” Frey said. “They had a great team down there, and he was definitely a leader on it. When you'd go and watch him practice, there was just something different about him. He had the ‘it' factor.”
Cole has been a starter at Michigan since his freshman season when he started his first two seasons at left tackle and then last year at center. He likely will be back at left tackle this fall.
“If he helps us win there, then I love it,” Frey said. “If he helps us win at center, I'd love that too. It's about whatever helps us score points. If you ask Mason, he'd play wide receiver if he thought it would help us win.”
Getting better
Brian Smith, who coaches Michigan's safeties, said with all the youth in the secondary it's all about reps and getting better this fall. He's not ready to say who the starters will be.
“That's a few weeks in the future,” Smith said. “We're just trying to get better from a standpoint of our assignments and getting guys lined up. We've got a lot of new guys in there and we're focused on getting better.”
Smith said it remains unclear at the moment how deep a rotation he'd like, saying that depends on the opponent and number of receivers.
“A lot of times we'll try to match what they're doing,” he said. “Right now, we're trying to figure that out. Right now, 10, 11 practices in, however many it is, we're just trying to take it one day at a time and figure it out. We're still in an open competition and trying to see which guys can play and which guys can't.”

By approaching the courts, NSE has thrown a spanner in the works of Singapore Exchange, or SGX, which was all set to list its ‘India Futures' and ‘India Options'. Photo: Aniruddha Chowdhury/Mint
National Stock Exchange (NSE) has thrown a spanner in the works of Singapore Exchange (SGX), which was all set to list new India equity derivative products—essentially Nifty futures and options by another name. NSE filed for and was granted an injunction by the Bombay high court against SGX's planned 4 June launch. The court said the two exchanges are at liberty to raise all their contentions, including on “jurisdiction and/or arbitrability” in an arbitration process.
If justice S.J. Vazifdar, the arbitrator, can get the exchanges to see eye to eye, it will be nothing short of a miracle. NSE is upset with SGX because of its decision to launch single stock futures earlier this year, and later try to thwart its ban on Nifty futures trading by launching so-called surrogate products. SGX, too, is miffed that NSE took the extreme step of terminating the licence it had granted SGX for Nifty futures trading, and end a relationship that lasted nearly 18 years. In short, neither side can be expected to budge.
SGX may well seize the foothold the court has given and contest the case on jurisdiction, citing that the new contracts are being launched in Singapore. NSE, too, stands on fairly solid ground. Its existing agreement with SGX is enforceable in Mumbai, and it has claimed in its petition that SGX's decision to launch new contracts violate the existing contract. The new contract mimics the existing one without the burden of having to pay NSE any licence fees, as it needs to in the ongoing contract.
Apart from the fact that the new contracts will use NSE's settlement prices for Nifty contracts, another giveaway is that SGX said it will allow its customers to migrate outstanding positions in the existing Nifty futures contract to the new India futures contract. NSE can point out in the courts that this is possible only when there is an apples-to-apples comparison between the two products, which essentially means that SGX's new product is a clone of the earlier one. Perhaps, if SGX's launch was after its contract with NSE expired in August, and it had avoided a straightforward migration of outstanding positions, the latter may not have succeeded with an appeal in Mumbai. Of course, it remains to be seen how SGX responds and whether the fight stays in Mumbai.
At some point, the legal debate will centre on the question whether public prices such as those of equity indices are copyrightable works, and the related question on whether the exercise of data collation involved in the creation of an equity index needs to be protected from so-called misappropriation. This column has pointed out earlier that the legal precedence in such matters is a bit mixed. When the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) dragged the Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE) to court on the use of its settlement prices for some over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts, the judge ruled in the latter's favour, saying that NYMEX's settlement prices were not copyrightable works as a matter of law.
In a later ruling, however, the Illinois appellate court ruled in favour of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., prohibiting International Securities Exchange from listing options on either the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones index, on which CBOE had exclusive licences from McGraw-Hill. The order heavily cited an earlier ruling in The Board of Trade vs Dow Jones & Co. case by the Supreme Court of Illinois, which had prohibited the board from launching contracts linked to the Dow, citing it would amount to misappropriation given that “the publication of the indexes involves valuable assets of the defendant (Dow Jones), its goodwill and its reputation for integrity and accuracy”.
Needless to say, NSE can be expected to hold dearly to this ruling while arguing its case.
But it must be noted that the above ruling has been criticized by legal commentators, and, indeed, by three of the court's own dissenting judges. Justice Seymour Simon wrote in his dissent note, “Unless the creators of intellectual property have some protection against the appropriation of their ideas by others, they will be discouraged from producing them; on the other hand, unless society can demand that the owners of intellectual property allow it to be appropriated by people who have developed novel and productive uses for it, the pace of innovation will slow.”
Even if justice Vazifdar arrives at this right balance in the NSE vs SGX case, it is highly unlikely both sides will see the wisdom. This is just the beginning of a long-drawn legal battle
My dad was diagnosed with dementia a couple of years ago. Now I notice that he is restless and crying. Is this sadness a normal part of the disease?
Depression can indeed be part of dementia. Some research has shown that up to 78 per cent of people with Alzheimer's disease suffer from symptoms of depression. It is also common that family members report depression more than clinicians do. Depression is most common in the early to middle phase of the disease. Since depression and dementia can exhibit similar symptoms, it is sometimes hard to differentiate what is actually occurring. If you suspect a problem, it is imperative that you see your doctor, since a proper mental-health examination is essential.
To muddy the waters further, it is reported that there is a two- fold increase incidence of Alzheimer's in depressed elderly in the community. Dr. Madan, psychiatrist-in-chief at Baycrest Health Sciences, explains: “One theory is, that depression that occurs right before Alzheimer's disease is an early symptom or manifestation of the illness. Again, this points to the reason to seek treatment early.”
Some studies report that symptoms of depression may be less severe when someone already has a dementia. Two common symptoms of depression in dementia are irritability and social withdrawal. Other signs and symptoms to look for include crying, lack of appetite and a lack of interest in activities that the person previously enjoyed. A lack of interest in being with people and a general lack of desire to participate in social activity are also symptoms of depression.
With dementia it is important to realize that more than one cause can create a behaviour change. Hearing impairment, or an inability to understand an activity are two such causes; while some impaired individuals become easily overwhelmed in a given social situation. These are just some examples of why someone with dementia may withdraw and appear sullen or depressed.

HANCOCK/NORWAY—That the West Iron County girls basketball players were bouncing off the walls waiting for the 2017-18 season to begin is understandable. So was the fact that they played like their hair was on fire in the first several minutes of their opener against Hancock on Nov. 28.
Even first-year coach Eric Shamion said he had butterflies before the game.
“I hadn't felt those since I played many moons ago.”
But once everybody settled in, the Wykons showed why they will be a handful to deal with this season as they crushed the host Bulldogs 60-36 in the West Pac Conference openers for both teams.
Three nights later, the Wykons were even more dominant in a 66-28 thrashing of Norway in a nonconference game at Norway.
Against Hancock, the Wykons (2-0, 1-0) trailed 8-6 at the 3:22 mark of the opening quarter before they calmed down and started to execute. What followed was a 15-0 run that bridged the first and second quarters as West Iron found its groove and never really looked back.
“Before we started the game, in the locker room, I told them it's the first game of the year, you're going to be nervous and you're going to play 600 miles an hour,” Shamion said. “You need to slow down. And it took us a quarter and a half to settle down.”

Filming a moving car used to be the stuff of big budget Hollywood movies, but now all you need is a drone.
The Skydio R1, launched in February and billed as the first self-flying camera that automatically follows and films its subjects, is adding a Car Follow feature as part of its first big software update.
The new feature's name tells you what you need to know; the Skydio R1 will tag along behind a car or other vehicle, capturing the action in 4K at 30 frames per second (fps), or at 1080p at 60fps or 30fps.
The Skydio R1 is equipped with 13 cameras, which it needs not only to capture footage, but also to understand and navigate its way in the world. Its self-flying and autonomous filming powers stem from the Skydio Autonomy Engine, backed by a Nvidia Jetson chipset.
Skydio R1 can hit speeds of 25 miles per hour (40kph), which may be speedy for a drone, but serves as a reminder that you shouldn't expect your car to rev to top speed and have the R1 keep up.
Also included in today's update are three new cinematic modes, an improved Lead Mode, an updated landing experience (you'll actually know where the R1 is going to land now), and an improved UI.
While its specs and features are impressive, the Skydio R1 only lasts an average of 16 minutes before needing a recharge, five minutes less than the DJI Mavic Air.
And though the Skydio R1 costs less than a Hollywood film budget, it still comes with the hefty price of $2,499 (about £1,810 / AU$3,180). The DJI Mavic Pro, by comparison, costs $999 (£1,099 / AU$1,599).
It hasn't been confirmed whether Beyoncé is in labor yet, but the internet already believes she is. You can't blame them—there are plenty of clues hinting that Queen Bey is about to deliver her twins.
The biggest giveaway are recent photos, which reportedly show Beyoncé and Jay-Z's security team parked outside the UCLA hospital for most of the day on Tuesday, June 13.

Security parked outside the UCLA Medical Center on June 13 Splash
The BeyHive was abuzz after an unconfirmed report was published in The Shade Room, where a source who is close to someone who works at the hospital claimed that the entire 5th floor was closed off for Bey to give birth.
E! News reports that that the singer checked into an LA-based hospital under a different name to avoid attention. And according to Us Weekly, there is "a significant amount of security" on location. The Daily Mail even claims that the security SUVs parked outside contain two baby seats, presumably for the twins.
A previous clue came from her hairstylist Chuck Amos, who posted a photo of the star on Instagram with the caption, "Hang in there, Mama! 💛 You @Beyonce!!"

TOKYO (AP) — Shares fell in Asia on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates, as expected. Lower oil prices took a toll on energy-related shares across the region and property developers led the decline in Hong Kong.
KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index fell 0.2 percent to 19,838.86 and South Korea's Kospi sank 0.6 percent to 2,358.66. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 1.0 percent to 25,621.26 and Shanghai's Composite index edged 0.1 percent lower to 3,128.21. The S&P ASX 200 in Australia tumbled 1.2 percent to 5,761.00. Shares in Southeast Asia also were mostly lower.
RATE HIKE: The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the third time since December, something investors had widely expected based on the Fed's recent statements. Fed leaders suggested they still expect to raise rates again later in the year.
ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "Asian markets were seen broadly lower this morning, taking little cues from overnight markets. The drop in crude oil prices and the corresponding unloading of energy shares in the region, meanwhile, seems to be the primary drag on regional bourses," Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary.
HONG KONG: The Hong Kong Monetary Authority raised interest rates after the Fed's move, to help keep the territory's currency at a stable rate against the U.S. dollar. That spurred selling of real estate developers' shares.
U.S. DATA: The Commerce Department said retail spending decreased in May, surprising experts and prompting investors to buy traditionally safe assets like government bonds and high-dividend companies and sell stocks from other industries that depend more on economic growth. Bond yields hit their lowest level of 2017.
WALL STREET ON WEDNESDAY: The Standard & Poor's 500 index edged 0.1 percent lower, to 2,437.92. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.2 percent, to a record 21,374.56. Home Depot and Goldman Sachs contributed most of the blue-chip index's gain. After a late tumble in technology stocks, the Nasdaq composite lost 0.4 percent, to 6,194.89.
ENERGY: Oil futures plunged overnight after the U.S. government said oil supplies shrank only slightly last week while gasoline stockpiles grew. Benchmark U.S. crude fell another 2 cents to $44.71 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It fell $1.73, or 3.7 percent, to settle at $44.73 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rebounded, gaining 6 cents higher to $47.06 a barrel. It had shed $1.72, or 3.5 percent, to close at $47 a barrel in London.
CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 109.64 from 109.57 yen. The euro edged up to $1.1218 from $1.1217.

The council is facing calls to draw up a new housing plan for Bedminster as developers clamber to build between 1,200 and 1,500 new homes in the area.
Bristol Civic Society is urging Bristol City Council to come up with framework for extensive housing plans in Bedminster Green.
The area south of the river is the subject of intense interest from housing developers and one of seven places earmarked for high-rise buildings by the council.
Plans are at various stages for five key sites including Little Paradise, Pring and St Hill, St Catherine's Place, Hereford Street car park and land off Dalby Avenue next to Bedminster car park.
The proposed buildings vary in size, with the tallest reaching 21 storeys.
But the so-called Bedminster Green regeneration plans have been mired in the confusion and chaos caused by different developers owning different parts of the area either side of Malago Road.

While most agree there is a need for high quality affordable housing in the area, Bristol Civic Society, two Green Party councillors and local residents are concerned at the height of proposed building and lack of thought given to the pressure on local amenities.
The society say a framework is needed to plan road improvements to mitigate the effects of the development and set out how extra GP practices and school places will be created for the new residents.
It claims there is also scope to develop improvements for the area such as redeveloping Bedminster rail station, uncovering the culverted Malago stream and creating a new ‘village green'.
“The Bristol Civic Society welcomes the proposal to demolish and redevelop buildings that do not contribute to the vitality and appearance the areal,” a spokesperson said.
“Bedminster is an important local centre and is well placed to attract high quality development.
“[However] there is no overall development frame, which frustrates the developers which has led to disconnected planning applications. The development is too large and important for the development to be entirely developer led.
(Image: Dandara)
“The size of the new quarter compares to the Kings Cross redevelopment in London which has an overall development framework to answer these questions.
“The development area needs an analysis of it character and its relation to East Bedminster and a comprehensive development framework.”
The society is calling on the council to improve public engagement around the sites and to seriously consider whether the high-rise buildings are appropriate.
Green councillors for Southville, Charlie Bolton and Steve Clarke, have carried out their own survey in to opinions about the height of the buildings and of 300 residents asked, 68 per cent said the developments were too high.
“I supported the original development at St Catherine's Place, and I have to say I increasingly regret having done so,” Mr Bolton said.
“While I believe the intentions of the original developer were honourable, the fact that we now have multiple developers has meant a substantial increase in scale.
“Developers seem to cherry pick the parts of applications they like, and leave out the bits I liked. What we have now is a plan which is just enormous. Essentially, I feel I have been played.”
“I absolutely agree that we need more homes for people in Bristol (especially affordable ones) but I am concerned about the massing and scale of the proposed developments and also about the potential lack of social infrastructure such as schools, doctors and dentists for these thousands of new residents in our ward,” Mr Clarke said.
“In fact, it's not proven that very tall buildings are the best way to deliver higher density accommodation – taller buildings require more land and space. Despite all its skyscrapers New York still has a lower density than cities like Paris and Barcelona.”

In 1986, the story of a teenage girl who has to make her way through a Goblin king's labyrinth in order to reclaim her baby brother didn't really shake the world. In the three decades since, however, Labyrinth has amassed a huge fanbase. The movie is now an '80s classic with a large cult following. Now, TriStar has begun talks to make a Labyrinth spin-off, to be directed and scripted by Don't Breathe and Evil Dead remake director Fede Alvarez.
When news of the project first broke, over an year ago, many fans were upset that David Bowie's legacy as Jareth, the Goblin king, would be tainted so soon after his passing. Producer Nicole Perlman even shared her own love for the movie on Twitter, saying "no one is remaking Labyrinth (...) that movie is perfect as it is." With ideas for a remake or a sequel out of the way, a spin-off seems not only to be a great solution, but also a refreshing start. According to Deadline, casting has already started for the Labyrinth spin-off and production is set to begin in the fall of 2017.
The universe created by Jim Henson for Labyrinth is so rich and diverse that there's no shortage of stories a spin-off could explore. Since there will be no recasting for Bowie's role, let's have a look at what other angles would work for a Labyrinth spin-off without its charming original Goblin king.
The Labyrinth After Sarah

After Sarah defeats the Goblin king, all his creatures and labyrinth creations would lose their reason to exist. Seeing what happens to Hoggle, Ludo, Sir Didymus and his faithful companion Ambrosius after Sarah moves on with her life would make for a fun new adventure.
A New Goblin Queen

Many fans dislike the idea of someone replacing David Bowie's Jareth. Since that's not happening, there's nothing wrong with crowing a new queen altogether. Maybe someone who, like Sarah gets drawn into the Labyrinth, but never manages to leave and takes over after Jareth flies to the moon.
'Hook' Meets 'Monsters Inc.'

If Jennifer Connelly returns to play a more mature version of Sarah, then we're all set for a trip back to the Labyrinth — this time to rescue her own children, maybe. It'd be a much-changed space, without Jareth, but it'd be other-worldly just the same.
Teenage Toby
'Labyrinth' [Credit: TriStar Pictures]
There's actually a manga (published by Tokyopop) with a grown-up Toby as the main protagonist. He's never fully recovered from his time with the Goblin king, and eventually gets lured into the Labyrinth himself. In the comic, Toby meets all sorts of creatures and faces many adventures, eventually becoming the Goblin king himself.
More on #Labyrinth:
Regardless of the path Fede Alvarez decides to take when creating his version of Labyrinth, fans should be happy that Jim Henson's fantastic world will have a much deserved rebirth. Judging by the enormous amount of online fan fiction about Labyrinth (most of which have much better plot points than my feeble attempts here!), I'd say it's about time all the generations of fans can see what Labyrinth would look like with 21st century especial effects!

Palmetto High School senior Natalia Ortega interned this summer at the University of Miami's Dean of Student's office. She worked four days a week for ten hours a day, taking on primarily administrative duties.
“I answered phone calls, I scheduled appointments with the deans, I delivered packages and letters across campus, I faxed things,” she says. “I loved it. Especially because UM is a school I have always had an interest in. Hopefully I'll be able to go there as a student this coming year.”
In previous summers, Ortega volunteered at ZooMiami as a camp counselor. She watched the kids while they ate lunch and ventured out to the various areas of the zoo the kids were to visit that day.
“I love working with younger kids,” she says. “I have a younger sibling. It's in my nature to want to be around them.”
She loved being at the zoo.
“Being with the animals was so much fun,” she says.
They had close encounters with some animals – the two that came to mind were parrots and a chimpanzee.
Her community service includes volunteering at the Actor's Playhouse on Miracle Mile. She ushered at evening shows when she attended a summer acting program during the day.
“I did four or five shows. I did Cat – that was my first show and lead role ever,” she says. “I did Seussical Jr., Into the Woods, and Shrek the Musical.”
Naturally, Ortega has been in the Palmetto drama program since she was a freshman.
“I'm now the Thespian president,” she says. “I love musical theater. I found a passion for it when I was around 11 years old and I've been pursuing it ever since.”
Since joining the Palmetto program, she's been in productions of Curtains, Charley's Aunt, Beth in Little Women, ensemble in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, the Witch in Into the Woods, a techie for I Hate Hamlet, and Helena in a Midsummer Night's Dream.
Surprisingly, she does not plan to major in musical theater in college. Instead she wants to go into law. She's considering either criminal defense law or entertainment law.
So far, she's been accepted to Florida International University and is still waiting to hear from UM, the University of Florida, New York University and the Miami-Dade Honor College.
“I'll be taking sociology in my undergrad major,” she says. “Apparently it's a ticket to law school and it's considered to be a rather interesting major. That's what I've heard so that's what I'm going with.”
Aside from Thespians, which she says takes up 85 percent of her time, Ortega is involved in several clubs at school. She's in Florida Future Educators of America. Club members work with the teens that attend Palmetto with special needs.
“We make them feel welcome and whole in society,” she says.
She's also a member of the debate club, although she does not attend debate competitions because competition preparation takes too much time away from her time in the drama program.
“We usually do environmental topics,” she says. “When we are doing debates, we debate environmental things like global warming, and how many humans are affecting the planet. We've also done political debates and things on human rights. Usually we like to switch sides to gain knowledge on what it's like being a defendant as well as a prosecutor.”
Ortega is also in the Creative Writing Club.
“We discuss which writing prompts would be the most interesting,” she says. “We get together, write, read to each other and do peer reviews. It's a pretty cool club.”

ADAMS TOWNSHIP – After a series of slow starts and playing from behind, Clinton-Massie head coach Todd Cook decided his team needed a change of pace.
“We talked about adjustments we need to make. Do we need to make adjustments in our pregame, in our warmups, to get us mentally ready to come out and play?,” Cook said. “Like a football script, I had in my mind what I wanted to do differently to see how we would respond to it. We were giving up points no matter what in the first quarter and coming from behind. So I just wanted to get us in a different type of mindset of attacking, and maybe get some quick deflections and some easy baskets.”
The script Cook cooked up was a horror film for visiting New Richmond Friday. The Falcons scored 15 of the last 17 points of the first half and the first 10 points of the second half to build a 46-16 cushion and coast to a 58-40 Southern Buckeye Athletic and Academic Conference American Division victory.
“It is the best we've played this year,” Cook said. “The Blanchester game was an extremely good game for us, but we didn't know what to expect coming out of the gate. This one is the best just because we've been in a drought and not really playing well.”
Zach Chowning led the Falcons (10-5, 3-3) with 16 points off the bench, 11 of them in the second quarter.
Teammates Thomas Myers and Trey Uetrecht joined Chowning in double-figures with 12 and 11 points, respectively.
Jason Ackerman led the Lions (7-9, 3-4) with 12.

Paris, May 30 - Italy is part of Europe and the euro and will remain so, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Secretary-General Angel Gurria said Wednesday. Gurria was answering a question as to whether he could imagine an Italy without the euro. Gurria added that there were fears for Italy but policies should not be based on the markets. "It would be madness, we need a medium and long-term vision".

Two Cambridgeshire police officers have returned from the British Virgin Islands following the catastrophic damage caused by hurricane Irma feeling humbled by the three week experience.
The world watched as hurricane Irma took hold of the Caribbean and travelled across the North Atlantic killing more than 120 people with winds of up to 185mph at the end of August.
Pc Beesley and PC Williams (L-R)
News bulletins and social media sites were awash with images and videos showing the pure devastation hurricane Irma had left behind but nothing could prepare PC Den Williams and PC Ross Beesley for what they were about to witness.
The pair volunteered, along with more than 50 other officers from across the country, to offer mutual aid in the British Virgin Islands and flew out from RAF Brize Norton to Barbados on 9 September.
PC Williams said: “Words cannot describe the devastation. We saw 40ft containers that had been thrown around, homes without roofs and what was an island full of lush greenery turned into something like what you would see in a Hollywood movie.
“Yet the people were still upbeat. Despite losing everything themselves they were committed to helping others. There was one woman in particular, Janet, who left her own teenage children to come to the aid of those in a children's home.”
The devastation
PC Beesley, from Wisbech, said: “We saw it on the TV before we left but you are detached from the pictures and videos. It's not until you are there that you can smell the sewage in the street, you avoid puddles not knowing if the power cable lying in it is live or not. You are driving round in vehicles that wouldn't be fit fort purpose in the UK and are witness to many other dangers around you.”
With around 40 per cent of the islands police force unable to work because of the devastation caused to their own lives, the majority of PC Williams and PC Beesley's time was spent at banks to stop looting and robberies or at supermarkets and fuel stations to prevent panic buying.
PC Beesley said: “The moment we landed and our presence was known, we were starting to make a difference. We were able to take some control and allow everyone to get on with try to rebuild what they had lost.”
It wasn't long after they arrived that they were put under a 24 hour curfew as hurricane Maria struck the islands.
The valley
Their efforts soon turned to offering reassurance to members of the public, giving people lifts from hospital and interacting with the families and children.
The pair were so touched by the community they were working with that they got in touch with the Police Federation and the Police and Crime Commissioner, Jason Ablewhite, and were able to secure a donation to purchase books, toys, pens and pencils for the children.
PC Williams said: “The best part of the trip was seeing the small difference we were making. Seeing the children's faces when you presented them with small gifts, playing ball with them. You couldn't put a price on it.
“Being in 40C heat, wearing full body armour and not being able to wash above the neck because of the E.coli in the water was a low. We were living without the basics but we had a roof over our heads, were fed and watered which is more than most had out there.
Janet from the children's home with PC Williams
“I feel very privileged to have had the chance to go.”
PC Beesley added: “The one thing I will take away from the experience was a line from a gentleman who had lost his home, his belongings, everything. He said; ‘I've got life and as long as I have that, I can rebuild everything else'.”
OTTAWA — The governments of Canada, Ontario and Quebec are partnering with some of the world's digital heavyweights to usher in the next generation of wireless technology.
A $400-million public-private investment will create a corridor of 5G wireless test beds through Canada's two largest provinces, aimed at giving companies a chance to experiment with new ideas and products that are only now becoming possible thanks to recent breakthroughs in telecommunication technology.
While many estimates it will take years before 5G is widely rolled out to the Canadian mass market, it's being billed as the wireless backbone to futuristic technologies including driverless cars, remotely controlled complex surgeries, and download speeds up to 100 times faster than today's 4G networks.
"5G is the gateway to the future and we are just on the brink of this technological revolution," Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said Monday at a funding announcement in Ottawa.
The new project is called ENCQOR — Evolution of Networked Services through a Corridor in Quebec and Ontario for Research and Innovation — and will allow an estimated 1,000 small and medium-sized businesses to plug into an early 5G platform for research and development.
Ontario, Quebec and the federal government have each pledged about $67 million, while the remaining $200 million will come from five private-sector partners. Ericsson, Ciena Canada, Thales Canada, IBM Canada and CGI will lead the public-private partnership, which is expected to "secure" more than 4,000 jobs, 1,800 of which will be specialized in 5G.
Karl Sasseville, a spokesman for Bains, clarified that those jobs are made up of existing positions within the five private-sector partners that will be repurposed for the project.
Borje Ekholm, CEO of Swedish telecom giant Ericsson, said Canada is "leapfrogging" to the front of 5G technology with its commitment to wireless innovation. When people think of national infrastructure they often think of roads and streets, Ekholm said.
"We believe the future highways will all be digital," he said.
Ekholm said he expects the test-bed technology to be deployed later this year and become operational by early 2019.
However, the United States — where Toledo is believed to be holed up — said it could not arrest Toledo until it received more information on the case against him, according to Peruvian officials, who were rushing to send investigation documents to their US counterparts.
Toledo, once hailed as an anti-corruption champion, is accused of taking a huge payoff from Odebrecht in exchange for a massive highway contract connecting Peru and Brazil during his 2001-2006 presidency. Peruvian police launched a manhunt for him after a judge ordered his arrest Thursday night. There is a $30,000 reward out for information leading to his capture. Peruvian authorities believe Toledo, 70, is in the US city of San Francisco, where he is a visiting professor at nearby Stanford University. The Peruvian government has indicated that Toledo might try to flee to Israel, where his wife, French-born Elaine Karp, is a citizen. “We heard from a solid source that he was trying to flee to Israel. So we alerted Israel,” Interior Minister Carlos Basombrio said on RPP Radio. But Israel blocked any such effort by Toledo. “Toledo will be allowed in Israel only when his affairs in Peru are settled,” foreign ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said in a statement. Peru's authorities have a warrant for Toledo to be detained and held in preventive custody for 18 months pending a full investigation. He is accused of influence peddling and money laundering. At the moment, Toledo could leave the United States, since the US has not yet received the documents on which the warrant is based, according to Basombrio. Israel's foreign ministry later said he was not aboard a Sunday evening flight from San Francisco that landed at the country's main international airport. Toledo denies the accusations against him, branding them political persecution. But he has struggled to explain the source of the money.
Portland's Mississippi Avenue appears to be a location for the pilot episode of a new HBO original series.
While the production details indicate the show will be produced in California, a flyer distributed to Mississippi Avenue business owners and residents says scenes from the new show, which the network refers to as "Untitled Alan Ball HBO Drama," will be shot there April 25.
The show was created by Alan Ball, whose prior hits for the channel include the Emmy and Peabody winning drama “Six Feet Under” and the Southern vampire soap opera “True Blood.”
It's a family drama starring Holly Hunter and Tim Robbins that focuses on a multi-racial family starting to crack.
The flyer tags five blocks as possible sites for production.
Sources with the city of Portland, the governor's office on film and television, and HBO could not immediately be reached for comment.
South Korean giant LG recently received certification from Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in the United States. Though there are no confirmations as to which phone in the LG lineup acquired the certification. Based on the model number of the device we can safely assume that the phone in debate, to be the successor of the LG K8 V, as the model number of both these phones are of the same series.
The LG K8 V, was released in April, last year and was positioned as a mid-range device. The device ran on a MediaTek MT6735 chipset and the model number was LG-VS500, whereas the model number on the new device which got the certification is LG-VS501.
So considering the model number and other details like the company announcing its plans to launch a new version this year, it might be safe to assume that the device could most likely be the successor to the LG K8 V.
SEE ALSO: Mysterious LG smartphone spotted on FCC
The successor is expected to run Snapdragon 425 processor clocked at 1.4GHz and it will be paired with 1.5GB of RAM, along with 16GB internal memory. The smartphone will sport a 5MP camera at the front and 13MP rear camera and it will be powered by a 2500mAh battery. In addition, the device is believed to be rolled out with Android 7.0 Nougat.
On the contrary, LG seems to be cutting a lot of corners in an attempt to keep the costs as low as possible as it is targeting the low and mid range market with these phones. Keeping that aspect in mind the company seems to be offering value for money.
SEE ALSO: LG G6 will be a reliable smartphone
However, with just the leak of the certification, it is hard to be sure about the specifications and even the model right now. You can stay tuned to GIZBOT and we will keep you posted as and when we get the latest updates.

Saturn Easily Visible – if the clouds clear…

London: Antonio Conte says Chelsea are battling to secure their Champions League future and warned of a "bad surprise" after weekend results left them 14 points behind Premier League leaders Manchester City.
After a fourth loss in 16 games against West Ham on Saturday, the Chelsea boss thinks a title challenge is now all but over and spoke of a revised target ahead of Tuesday`s Premier League clash at Huddersfield.
"I like to win," said Conte. "When we lose I`m not happy. In 16 games we lost four games. My experience tells (me) it`s impossible to win the title.
(Also read: UEFA Champions League: It's Real Madrid vs Paris St-Germain, Chelsea vs Barcelona in last-16)
"Now we must be focused in the league to go game by game, to do our best. This league is not simple. We have to fight to find a place in the Champions League."
But securing a Champions League berth will not be easy, with six big Premier Leagues clubs all chasing four spots.
Conte's focus is on the immediate future and not the Champions League last-16 tie with Barcelona.
He has continually bemoaned a lack of transfer activity last summer, when he watched rivals City and Manchester United strengthen their squads.
But the Italian is seeking an immediate response and is not relying on new recruits in January`s winter transfer window to improve Chelsea`s fortunes.
Midfielder Danny Drinkwater missed the West Ham loss through illness, while defender David Luiz is being monitored over his knee injury.
Conte is likely to make changes for the trip to Huddersfield. Midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko was substituted at half-time at the London Stadium and striker Alvaro Morata was replaced 10 minutes into the second half and both could be in need of a rest.
And Conte, who repeated his Chelsea side are rebuilding after the departures of the likes of John Terry and Frank Lampard in recent seasons, says it is important the summer arrivals are given time to bed in.
Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford speaks at a news conference at U.S. Army Garrison Yongsan, Seoul, South Korea, Aug. 14, 2017. (Photo: Andrew Harnik / AP)
Seoul, South Korea — The top U.S. military officer said Monday that the United States wants to peacefully resolve a deepening standoff with North Korea but is also ready to use the “full range” of its military capabilities in case of provocation.
The comments by Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford in a series of meetings with senior South Korean military and political officials and the local media appeared to be an attempt to ease anxiety over tit-for-tat threats between President Donald Trump and North Korea while also showing a willingness to back up Trump's warnings if need be.
Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is visiting South Korea, Japan and China after a week in which Trump declared the U.S. military “locked and loaded” and said he was ready to unleash “fire and fury” if North Korea continued to threaten the United States.
North Korea, meanwhile, has threatened to lob four intermediate-range missiles into the waters near Guam, a tiny U.S. territory about 2,000 miles from Pyongyang, North Korea's capital. This would be a deeply provocative act from the U.S. perspective, and there has been widespread debate about whether Washington would try to shoot the missiles down if they're fired.
The U.S.-North Korea impasse, which has simmered since the end of the Korean War in 1953, has grown more tense in recent months over worries that the North's nuclear weapons program is nearing the ability to target the U.S. mainland. Pyongyang tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles last month.
“We are seeking a peaceful resolution to the crisis,” Dunford, who also met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, said to reporters, according to a local pool report.
He earlier told his South Korean counterparts that America is ready “to use the full range of military capabilities to defend our allies and the U.S. homeland,” according to U.S. military spokesman Capt. Darryn James.
Moon separately called Monday for a peaceful solution to the nuclear standoff, saying that “there must not be another war on the Korean Peninsula,” according to his office.
In a meeting with top aides at the presidential Blue House, Moon said South Korea would work to safeguard peace on the peninsula in cooperation with the United States and other countries. Moon said North Korea must stop issuing menacing statements and provoking.
North Korea, which is angry over new United Nations sanctions condemning its rapidly developing nuclear and missile program, continued its tough stance on Monday.
The North accused the United States of mobilizing a huge number of weapons and troops for annual military drills with South Korea that begin later this month. Pyongyang, which claims the drills are war preparation, says it will be ready to send its Guam missile launch plan to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for approval just before or as the drills begin.
“What matters is that if a second conflict (on the peninsula) erupts, that cannot help but lead to a nuclear war,” the North's official Korean Central News Agency said in a commentary. “We are closely monitoring every move by the United States.”
The commentary said that about 3.5 million young students and workers have volunteered to join or rejoin the army because of a possible confrontation with the United States.
Dunford earlier told reporters traveling with him to Asia that he aims to “sense what the temperature is in the region.” He also will discuss military options in the event the “diplomatic and economic pressurization campaign” fails.
“We're all looking to get out of this situation without a war,” Dunford said.
Chinese President Xi Jinping talked on the phone Saturday with Trump and called for cool-headedness. Xi urged Washington and Pyongyang to avoid words or actions that could worsen the situation.
Trump has pushed China, North Korea's biggest economic partner and source of aid, to do more to stop the North's nuclear ambitions. Beijing says its influence on Pyongyang is limited.
Trump's recent threats followed a report that U.S. intelligence indicates North Korea can now put a nuclear warhead on its long-range missiles.
For all his bluster, Trump's words did not appear to be backed by significant military mobilization on either side of the Pacific, and an important, quiet diplomatic channel remained open.
On Sunday, CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, Trump's national security adviser, tried to provide assurances that a conflict is avoidable, while also supporting Trump's tough talk. They said the United States and its allies no longer can afford to stand by as North Korea pushes ahead with the development of a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile.

Emmerdale fans were shocked as the love story between Cain Dingle and Harriet Finch took more twists and turns.
The bad boy of the Yorkshire Dales seemed furious following what he apparently saw as a betrayal by the village vicar, and he warned her he's implicated her in his crime after being confronted by the police.
However, when Harriet promised to turn herself in before the police get the chance to come to get her, he revealed he hadn't done it at all - and vowed to keep her out of it before they shared a kiss.

"This is the first time ever that I wanted to change places with a vicar.. Lucky Harriet," joked one viewer.
Another added: "Harriet can't seem to keep her hands off Cain can she?"
On Friday it was more of the same, and viewers couldn't enough of it as the pair shared another steamy kiss .
He got caught out while he was stashing stolen goods at the church, and he did his best to distract her by pulling her in for a kiss.
The vicar kissed back, and it didn't take long for fans to take to Twitter and voice their amusement - and several jokes - at the amazing and unexpected moment.
"I might become a vicar, the one on #Emmerdale has bagged Cain Dingle," one user joked.
Another quipped: "Cain's getting into dirty habits #emmerdale #itv #soapland (sic)"

The final dispersal sale of the entire milking section of the Moyarget farm herd on behalf of Michael and Sue Stewart-Moore, will take place at Kilrea Mart on Tuesday, 20th March at 11.30am.
The sale includes 85 milking stock with an outstanding wealth and depth of breeding.
Of the animals on show, 15 are graded Excellent, 25 are VG and over, with half on offer only in their 1st or 2nd lactation.
This sale marks the end of an era at Moyarget. The story began in 1971 when Michael's father Hume bought the farm from his elder brother James. In 1978 the suckler herd was sold off and milking began with British Friesian cows sourced locally. Michael's mother Clare was instrumental in grading up the herd to full pedigree status while at the same time making the move from Friesian to Holstein. This was achieved by selected use of AI and also by buying in pedigree stock from local farms as well as from herds across the water such as Huddlesford, Stardale and Manorpowis. Cow families that came from these purchases continue to have a profound effect on the herd to this day.
Michael and Sue took over the reins in 1995 ably assisted by Des Simpson and Brian Walker, both of whom have worked on the farm for over 25 years.
The emphasis since 1995 has been to maintain a largely closed herd and to produce surplus female stock for sale locally. Some readers will have been present at the sale of the spring calving cows in June last year in Kilrea; those animals consisted mainly of 4th, 5th and 6th calvers reflecting the breeding policy at Moyarget. We all need cows that can thrive in a cubicle environment and which have the potential to last way beyond four lactations. Average herd yields have been consistently over 9,000 litres on twice a day milking. This sale gives purchasers and breeders a unique opportunity to obtain stock from a long established, renowned, herd of top quality stock.
For more information or a herd brochure email suejsm@hotmail.co.uk or contact Auctioneers H.A. McIlrath & Sons Ltd Tel: 02829540269.

Sekondi, April 24, GNA - President Nana Addo Darkwa Akufo-Addo, has announced his government's commitment to protect the country's territorial waters from pirates and other illegal sea activities.
“I pledge my unwavering commitment to protecting the territorial integrity of the country. Criminals and pirates cannot be allowed to create unsafe situations in our waters”.
The President said the state would therefore commit resources to ensure protective water territories, “We need the full force of state security in curbing this emerging phenomenon”.
Nana Akufo-Addo said this at the commissioning of the refurbished and expanded Sekondi Fishing Harbour valued at $20million.
The expansion was necessitated by the recent congestion that had characterized the use of the fishing harbour, with the ice making capacity also overstretched due to increased landing volumes.
The President therefore expressed gratitude to the Japanese Government for responding to the government's call for support.
Nana Akufo-Addo said between 2010 and 2013 the government requested for grant aid to cater for the enhancement of functions, resource management, congestion mitigation measures and rehabilitation of related facilities.
The expansion works carried out by Messers TOA and ECOH Corporations have improved the capacity from 50 to 126 in shore vessels intake at the port.
The facilities now have a 30tonne ice making facility as against the previous 15 tonnes to cater for the substantial rise of fish inflows.
The President said with fishing contributing four percent to the country's GDP, it was essential that its activities were properly regulated and supervised to create the needed jobs and improve upon the livelihood of communities engaged in that sector… “This is why we have a full ministry to oversee the activities of the sector”.
Nana Akufo-Addo paid glowing tribute to the former administration for initiating the expansion and rehabilitation works, adding, “I will not abandon any project started by my predecessors”.
The government, he said, had taken lots of steps to grow and expand the fishing industry and that included the construction of the James Town Fishing Habour through a Chinese facility of 15 million dollars, three landing sites at Winneaba, Mumford and Axim.
The rehabilitation of fishing laboratories, refurbishment of the Tema Boatyard and other such interventions to improve the lots of the players in the industry.
The President encouraged individuals in the sector to do the right thing by avoiding illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities which could destroy the ocean, “Lets protect the ocean for future generations".
Mr Hirofumi Hoshi, Chief Representative, JICA Ghana Office, said infrastructure development had been position as one core concentration for JICA's cooperation to Ghana to contribute to the economic and social development of the country.
The JICA implementation of the rehabilitation and expansion of Tema Fishing Harbour and the Sekondi Fishing Harbour was originally developed through a Japanese grant in 1998.
He said JICA's support was to ultimately see Ghana become the transportation hub in the West Africa Region…in line with the vision, the fisheries promotion project in Sekondi was implemented to strengthen the capacity and functions of the Harbour.
Mr Hoshi said through the improvement and expansion of the harbour facilities, it would contribute to efficient coastal fishery operations and growth of the fishery industry.
Mr Paul Ansah Asare, the Director General of the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority, said the fishing harbour was to originally provide improved services to fisher folks of Shama, Sekondi-Takoradi and adjoining fishing communities with a capacity of only 50 inshore vessels.
The new facilities include a new administration block, renovated old administration block, a layby wharf, a new ice making plant, access driveway, parking lot, pavement works, in port road and improved drainage among others.
He said the expanded harbour gave more space and the needed facilities to receive many vessels and would go a long way to improve fishing activities and offer a new impetus for making life more meaningful in the Region.

1 Suspect In Custody After Explosion At Subway Station In Midtown Manhattan
Updated at 9:01 a.m. ET
New York City police say a suspect is in custody following an explosion early Monday at a subway station a block away from Times Square.
Police say the male suspect is the only person who was injured in the incident at 42nd Street and 8th Avenue. The New York City Fire Department had earlier confirmed one nonlife-threatening injury at the scene of the explosion.
Authorities haven't announced what caused the explosion. But The Associated Press reports that "Law enforcement official tells AP that man had explosive device strapped on when it exploded in New York City subway."
Shortly before 8 a.m. ET, police said a blast was reported at the Port Authority bus and subway station in Midtown. The NYPD said that in the city's subway system, "The A, C and E line are being evacuated at this time."
The Port Authority issued a tweet saying, "The Port Authority Bus Terminal is open. Due to police activity, the entrance to the subway at the Port Authority Bus Terminal on Eighth Avenue is closed."
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio's office says that he has been briefed about the incident, adding, "The NYPD, FDNY and first responders are on the scene."
President Trump "has been briefed on the explosion in New York City," White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said via a tweet.
This is a breaking news story. As often happens in situations like these, some information reported early may turn out to be inaccurate. We'll move quickly to correct the record and we'll only point to the best information we have at the time.
You can call it craft. I call it art. That's because the border between craft and art has unravelled.
Nevertheless, the first-ever Canadian Craft Biennial at the Art Gallery of Burlington puts craft in the spotlight, showcasing work by leading craftspeople from all over Canada.
The Canadian Craft Biennial, founded by Emma Quin and the AGB's Denis Longchamps, aims to increase our understanding and appreciation of craft in Canada.
Longchamps says craft plays an important role in our everyday lives.
"Craft is all around us in various forms," he says. "Often in our house, it is also on TV, in magazines. Many have a favourite handcrafted mug or hand knitted sweater.
Craft and art have traditionally been stuffed into separate categories. Simply put, craft was seen as functional, art was not. That made art superior to craft.
Certain materials and techniques such as yarn and knitting, for example, were the domain of craftspeople. But in the 20th century, art appropriated materials and techniques once exclusive to craft.
Both craftspeople and artists now use recycled materials. Moreover, many craftspeople create objects that for the most part are nonfunctional. And they imbue their creations with timely messages and meanings.
The biennial comprises four exhibitions. Can Craft? Craft Can! is one of them, bringing together more than 60 makers. It fills the main gallery.
This exhibition's title, Longchamps tells me, "is a play on words. Can as in Canadian and Can as the verb, 'Yes we can!' So the exhibition is showing a small portion of who and what is Canadian Craft in its multiplicity of manifestations including video, installation, traditional, community oriented, contemporary and sculptural."
THE new floodlights at the Victoria Park tennis courts in Newbury were officially switched on last Thursday, enabling play to continue until 9.30pm.
Tennis coaches were available to answer questions about their programmes and guests were encouraged to try out the courts under floodlights.
Leader of Newbury Town Council Adrian Edwards said: “The tennis courts area is already well used, and, with the addition of the floodlighting, we are confident that they will be used even more.”
The newly-refurbished courts have been open since March 2017 and the floodlights are the final part of the renovation.
Since March, more than 300 people have taken out annual memberships and a successful coaching programme has been run.
The total cost of refurbishment was in excess of £100,000 and was funded from the legal settlement secured by the council last year from Parkway developer Costain, together with a £39,893 grant from the Lawn Tennis Association and a £10,000 contribution from a West Berkshire Council Members Bid.
The annual cost for membership is £36, which will allow a whole family to play unlimited times within a year.
You can also book online on a ‘pay and play' basis, costing £3 for 30 minutes.
When players choose to use the floodlights, there will be an extra charge of £1.50 for every 30 minutes play.
Further details on the booking process can be found at www.newbury.gov.uk/tennis.
VAUGHAN, Ont. — Recipe Unlimited Corporation will eliminate plastic straws from its 19 restaurant brands including Swiss Chalet, Harvey's, Kelsey's and East Side Mario's.
The restaurant giant formerly known as Cara Operations will start phasing out its plastic straws in August.
Recipe Unlimited says it will dump plastic straws because of their impact on the environment and wildlife and the company's commitment to recyclable materials.
It hopes to offer paper straws in all of its restaurants by the end of March 2019.
The compostable and biodegradable straws will automatically be provided with drink orders at the brand's quick serve restaurants, including New York Fries and St-Hubert.
THE creation of a hung parliament as a result of last week's general election has dramatically changed the balance of power between the Government and Parliament, with potentially profound consequences for the United Kingdom's relationship with the European Union.
Hitherto the Prime Minister has sought to minimise the influence the House of Commons might have on the Brexit negotiations. She sought to deny MPs the right to debate the triggering of Article 50, which would set the process in motion. But she was challenged in the High Court – and lost.
She called a snap election with two objectives in mind. Leading the polls by 24 points over Labour, she sought to wipe the Opposition off the map for the forseable future. And, in so doing, she hoped to gain such a large Conservative majority that she could railroad any Brexit settlement through Parliament.
She has failed to achieve both objectives.
Rather than reading the last rites over a moribund Labour Party, she has revitalised it, and it is the Conservatives who are now in turmoil. Furthermore, instead of a Conservative majority rubber-stamping her Brexit deal, the Houses of Parliament will now scrutinise in detail all proposals before either approval or rejection.
Parliament, therefore, will play a more influential part in the forthcoming negotiations and will be held accountable for the outcome of the most important economic and political debate since the end of the war.
MPs will be aware that a great deal has happened since the referendum vote. For a start, the claims made by the Leave campaign, led by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, that Brexit would bring big economic benefits have proved to be entirely fallacious.
On the contrary, it is generally accepted that the economy will be damaged quite severely. It is already happening. This week's figures show inflation is rising much more quickly than wages, a result of the Brexit-inspired currency devaluation. The relative calm of the past few months is over.
It becomes increasingly obvious, therefore, that the economy will suffer if the hard line Brexiteers have their way.
Now senior Conservatives, including the Chancellor Philip Hammond, are suggesting that economic agreements should determine the UK's negotiating stance, and that the hazy illusion of greater sovereignty and taking back control should not be the decisive factor. Very few of those who voted to leave thought they were also voting to be poorer.
Next the process of withdrawal is proving to be far more complicated than anyone, including the chief negotiator, David Davis, anticipated. If new trade agreements are made with the EU and the rest of the world, they will take years to put in place, assuming they can be carried out in an orderly way.
But if the Government sticks to its manifesto preconditions – no Single Market, no Customs Union, no European Court of Justice and a massive reduction in EU immigration – the result will be administrative chaos and confusion.
Far from there being a bonfire of regulations, as the Leave campaign suggested, there is going to be an upsurge in bureaucracy around new trade deals and the introduction of a Customs Union.
The two main political parties mechanically and vacuously repeat the slogan that Brexit means Brexit and that the United Kingdom must leave the Single Market. They are like the citizens of Denmark who refused to admit their king was going past without any clothes on. King Brexit is similarly naked.
Common sense therefore would suggest that it is time to take stock of the situation before stumbling further into the abyss. The Government should, therefore, give MPs a free vote as to whether to hold a second referendum.
If the House of Commons said no, then the buck stops firmly with Parliament. If a referendum is called, and the people voted to remain, then that would clearly instruct the Parliament not to do a Brexit deal.
It is possible however, on further consideration of the new evidence and changing circumstances outlined above, that the voters on second thoughts will change their minds, as they do about general elections. In which case, Parliament would resume normal service with the EU. The business community, the NHS, the universities, the farmers and even the local authorities would all breathe a sigh of relief, because they would have escaped from a perilous future.
However it seems very unlikely that the two main political parties would have the courage and the common sense to endorse this approach, because they are fearful of the anti-immigrant feeling in the country which determined the referendum last year, even though most of the concerns were shamefully related to prejudice against coloured immigrants, which has nothing to do with EU membership. The naked King marches on.

22nd Zahid Husain Memorial Lecture
Our Special Correspondent
Karachi
Creating a shared narrative induces mutual obligations on the part of the public to contribute towards economic development while introducing constraints on rulers at the same time. Central banks as a constitutionally independent institution can do a lot to create this shared narrative.
This was stated by Sir Paul Collier, Professor of Economics, Oxford University, the United Kingdom at the 22nd Zahid Husain Memorial Lecture on “The Role of a Central Bank in National Economic Development” organized by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) here on Thursday.
Professor Collier, while discussing the capacity of state institutions to tax and to install checks and balances on the abuse of power, emphasized on the belief of a sense of shared belonging, a sense of fairness and a sense of purposive action. Without these complementary beliefs sustained economic development would be hard to achieve, he said.
He said that it is imperative to create a shared narrative and inculcate these beliefs among all the main stakeholders if a country wants to walk the path of sustained economic development.
Referring to the SBP, he mentioned that the recent emphasis of SBP on the provision of financing to under-served segments of the society such as to SMEs, low-cost housing finance and agriculture are purposeful actions in this regard.
He also praised the national consensus on CPEC as a powerful symbol of national unity. He further added that these actions accompanied by sacrifices of current generations will create trust between the government and the general public needed for achieving economic prosperity for future generations. Earlier, in his inaugural address the Governor State Bank of Pakistan, Tariq Bajwa, introduced the guest speaker and recounted his achievements in the field of economic research and policymaking.
Governor Bajwa also highlighted the role of the SBP in the development of Pakistan's economy through strengthening financial institutions, developing human resources, providing credit to SMEs and other priority sectors and spearheading efforts for financial access to underserved segments of the society. Justice (Retd) Nasir Aslam Zahid, son of (late) Mr Zahid Husain, first Governor SBP, also graced the occasion as chief guest.
The lecture was attended by former SBP Governors, SBP Board and MPC members, diplomats, vice chancellors, deans and students of various universities, presidents and CEOs of banks, and other bankers.

CLEVELAND — Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue is taking a leave of absence from the team to address health issues that have included chest pains and loss of sleep.
Lue said Monday in statement that tests have offered no conclusion about what the issue is and offered no timetable for his return. The coach said he feels he needs to step away "and focus on trying to establish a stronger and healthier foundation" from which to coach the rest of the season.
"While I have tried to work through it, the last thing I want is for it to affect the team. I am going to use this time to focus on a prescribed routine and medication, which has previously been difficult to start in the midst of a season," Lue said. "My goal is to come out of it a stronger and healthier version of myself, so I can continue to lead this team to the championship we are all working toward."
A stress-filled season for the Cavs has taken a toll on the 40-year-old Lue, who led them to the 2016 NBA championship after taking over for David Blatt midway through that season. They are just 40-29, third in the Eastern Conference, and have endured roster shakeups, injuries and other distractions as they try to return to the NBA finals.
Now they will play without their coach.
"We all want great players, we all want the best teams, but with that comes a lot of pressure as well. And what Ty Lue has had to go through this year with that team, with the trades and the injuries and the pressure, it's unrelenting," Denver coach Michael Malone said. "So I hope that he gets healthy and is able to get back in time for the playoffs and help that team win as many games as possible."
Lue spent the second half of Cleveland's victory in Chicago on Saturday in the locker-room because of an illness, the second time this season he left a game because he wasn't feeling well. The former NBA guard also sat one game out against Chicago at home in December.
Associate head coach Larry Drew coached the second half of Saturday's game, the finale of a six-game, 11-day road trip. Cleveland is back home to host Milwaukee on Monday.
"We know how difficult these circumstances are for Coach Lue and we support him totally in this focused approach to addressing his health issues," general manager Koby Altman said.
Charlotte coach Steve Clifford also left his team to address his health this season. He took six weeks off. Medical tests revealed that the 56-year-old Clifford did not have any internal problems, but the doctor's diagnosis was the coach was suffering from severe sleep deprivation.

Long before the wonderful glut of goals, as Sadio Mane skied the second of two sitters into what pass for cheap seats these days, an Anfield groan grew a little angry.
Just like Jurgen Klopp, who turned to the stands and demanded applause for Mane, his gestures urging them to encourage not admonish.
It was Klopp the rabble-rouser.
There have been moments in his time at Liverpool when a few sceptics wondered if he was little more than that, an extravagantly-paid cheerleader with an infectious laugh, a whirling dervish with enthusiasm in more abundance than managerial nous.
Those moments have long gone.
(Image: PA Wire)
Yes, the theatrical rallying of the masses is part of his arm-waving, hollering package.
Its effect was clear or coincidental here, the period of pressure started by Mane's hapless miscuing ending with Mo Salah putting Roma to the calm and clinical sword.
But Klopp is, of course, much more than someone who can help whip up a decent atmosphere.

This remarkable Champions League form is showing him to be a coach of many facets, a man-manager supreme.
Tactically, think of the job he has done with the remarkable Salah, the way he has deployed him in this fluid three-man attack.
The Egyptian's brilliance has become one of the more astonishing storylines of this domestic and European season but Klopp has helped unlock brilliance that even Salah probably never knew was there.
And it is clear he has helped not just with his game plans but with the way he has managed him in every aspect.

Before signing him, Klopp and Salah sat for three hours, chatting about football, family, life and whatever else cropped up.
Klopp liked everything about Salah as a man and the reverse was true. It was the basis for this stunningly happy marriage.
Less than 48 hours ahead of kick-off here, Salah had been suited, booted and bothered by a lot of well-refreshed punters at a Mayfair hotel, picking up his Player of the Year award.
(Image: REUTERS)
It was hardly a riotous or demanding gig for Salah but there are a few coaches of elite clubs who might have suggested he made his acceptance speech to a lens on Merseyside.
Sir Alex Ferguson took a lot of persuading to allow Cristiano Ronaldo to pick up one of his Footballer of the Year awards a couple of days ahead of the 2006-07 FA Cup Final, even though Manchester United were staying in London.
Ferguson eventually relented but attended himself and put Cristiano on the clock. When he decided Ronaldo had been there long enough, he stabbed at his watch in familiar fashion.
Klopp, on the other hand, sent a lovely video message and hinted at a punctual return to work for Salah.Jokingly. He couldn't have been more relaxed had he had a beer in his hand.
When you get Klopp's trust, it seems, you keep it.

Even when you are youthful as Trent Alexander-Arnold and have just had a wake-up call at Old Trafford, especially when you are as diligent, honest and as underrated as James Milner.
Both were excellent here but then the same could be said about Mane, who eventually atoned for those misses and for Roberto Firmino who matched Salah's couple to make progression to the final seem like a formality until the late goals from Edin Dzeko and Diego Perotti.
Klopp looked understandably furious - maybe partly with himself for withdrawing Salah before conceding - but Liverpool fans should not seriously fear a capitulation in Rome.
As he has demonstrated in the vanquishing of Manchester City and in vast, vast swathes of this contest, he is too savvy a coach to allow that.
Jurgen Klopp - much more than a cheerleader.
OTTAWA — Canada has quietly paid another $54 million toward the development of the F-35 stealth fighter, bringing its total investment in the controversial project to roughly half a billion dollars over the last 20 years.
The government is consulting with fighter-jet builders, including U.S. aerospace giant Boeing, before launching a formal competition early next year to decide on a replacement for the air force's aging CF-18s.
Boeing remains on the fence about whether its Super Hornet will participate in the competition because of enduring questions about how the government will run it.
One concern is a new provision the government announced last year that aims to make it more difficult for companies that are deemed to be hurting the Canadian economy to win defence contracts.
The Institution of Engineers, Pakistan, Rawalpindi-Islamabad Center (IEP-RIC) here on Saturday arranged an interactive seminar for professional growth of the young engineers in field of air-conditioning. The resource person, an eminent expert Engr. Muhammad Riaz Baig gave an overview of modern air conditioning systems at the seminar that was largely attended by the young graduates.
It was the part of series of events of professional development being arranged by the IEP-RIC on regular basis, empowering the young engineers to play their productive role in the country's socio-economic development.
The role of the engineering community is highly important for quality construction and infrastructure development and such events will help them to deliver the best in their respective fields, said Chairman IEP-RIC Engr. Hafiz M. Ehsanul Haq Qazi in his opening remarks.
The seminar was also addressed by the Center's Vice President Engr. Dr. Atta Ullah Shah and Secretary Engr. Shafiqur Rehman. Dr. Atta emphasized that the youth should adopt an inter-disciplinary approach in their educational pursuits to deliver the best in practical field.
Muhammad Riaz Baig, who enjoys rich experience in the field and had worked in the World's largest oil company, Aramco in Saudi Arabia over 33 years spoke in detail about the air-conditioning technology, underlined the need that it should be environment friendly and help in energy-saving.—APP

Here's a little playlist to get all you WMTS listeners in the loving mood this Valentine's Day.
SAN FRANCISCO—It's Uber, but for bicycles.
For the first time in Uber's history, the company is offering rides on roads in the United States using something other than cars. Starting next week, it will let certain users in San Francisco reserve pedal-assist electric bicycles through its app. The idea is that people will see the bicycles as a cheaper and faster alternative — not a huge stretch of the imagination for anyone who has been stuck in Friday evening gridlock traffic in San Francisco.
Uber is not supplying its own bicycles. It is working with Jump Bikes, a bike-sharing service that secured a permit in January to put 250 motorized bicycles — making it easier to tackle San Francisco's steep hills — in locations throughout the city.
“We're excited about the future of bike sharing in the Uber app, and this is the first step,” said Andrew Salzberg, Uber's head of transportation policy and research.
The pilot program is the latest indication of Uber's ambitions to move beyond its ride-hailing origins. It is also working on autonomous trucking services, while aggressively expanding into the fast-growing food delivery market with Uber Eats.

After many years, Harold "Zoltzz" Weisfeld is closing Ends, his famed thrift shop in the Beach. Rene Johnston / Toronto Star ) Order this photo
Customers at Ends, the famed thrift shop in the Beach, rummaged through worn-out cardboard boxes and rusted racks on Monday, eyeing $4 bath mats and feeling the fabric of $10 tuxedos. It's an experience that could never be had on Amazon, the online company that the owner of Ends partly blames for the store's closure. Harold Weisfeld, widely known as “Zoltzz,” is closing down his location on Queen St. E. this month after 35 years. The store began after Weisfeld started buying left-behind clothing from dry cleaners and reselling it, and his operation expanded into all kinds of apparel and home products at a discount. “I'm tired,” said Weisfeld, a 73-year-old who warmly greets customers and passersby on the street. The store's official closing date is Tuesday, but it will stay open until the end of the month to allow him to give his stuff to charity.

Online shopping is one reason that Weisfeld is closing down. “Once Amazon and online came in, the traffic patterns changed,” he said. “There just isn't any traffic, it's too much downtime.” His store's location on Avenue Rd will remain open.
While increasing property taxes are hurting his business, Weisfeld also decided to close the store on Queen after an unpleasant end to an act of charity. “A woman came up to me and I make, as a hobby, wooden sculptures and she told me how much she loves this stuff,” he said. “I gave her a little piece, it was like 75 bucks. I gave it to her as a present and she was very poor lady . . . Ten minutes later, one of the kids that was working for me came up and says ‘you know the lady you were talking to? She just stole a pair of socks.' “I phoned my wife and I said I'm finished. That was the last straw.” That experience didn't sour Weisfeld on most of his customers, who he beams about. “I love the people,” he said, reflecting on his time running the store at 1930 Queen, near Woodbine Ave. “They were great, just fabulous to me. There's a couple that didn't like me but that's what life's all about.”

Now that he is nearing retirement, Weisfeld plans to spend more time working on his sculptures. As for his customers, many of whom bought from Ends for decades, they are sad to see it go. “It's very, very sad,” said Mary Loria, who has been going to Ends for 20 years. “The ambience of this place, the character, the staff is amazing.” Elizabeth McFicker has been shopping for “everyday things” at Ends for 15 years. “The quality is quite good for the really inexpensive price,” she said. “I hope another condo doesn't come up.” Eddie and Alexa Smith will benefit from Weisfeld's decision to give his products to charity. They are organizing a youth powwow this month, where they will give some of the products to the children. “We've had great success (with) beautiful people like this (Weisfeld),” Alexa Smith said. Weisfeld said that giving is “a great high.” “When you give, you teach people to give,” he said.

Philippe Coutinho has been left out of the Liverpool squad for their Champions League play-off first leg against Hoffenheim.
The Reds star is still nursing a back problem that ruled him out of Saturday's Premier League opener against Watford.
Coutinho's future at Anfield is in the balance, with the Brazilian keen to join Barcelona.
And the midfielder will play no part in Tuesday's game at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena after being omitted from the 22-man travelling party.
Jurgen Klopp's side will be looking to take a lead back from Germany ahead of the return clash on Merseyside next Wednesday.
Liverpool squad: Alexander-Arnold, Moreno, Lovren, Milner, Wijnaldum, Henderson, Can, Mane, Salah, Firmino, Kent, Solanke, Origi, Gomez, Klavan, Flanagan, Robertson, Matip, Grujic, Mignolet, Karius, Ward.
“A lot of people are following what's happening with this lawsuit,” Sprovieri said. “There is a lot of speculation and much of it is negative. Until it is resolved this speculation and the allegations are a reputational issue for Brampton — it could be doing significant damage to our reputation.”
“It's of the utmost importance that this matter be resolved in 2017,” says Councillor John Sprovieri, who has been critical of the city's handling of the six-year-old lawsuit, which Mayor Linda Jeffrey said has “paralyzed” city hall.
Some city hall watchers and councillors worry that the ongoing lawsuit launched by local builder Inzola Group against the city in 2011, regarding the handling of a historic downtown redevelopment deal, is causing reputational harm and the possible loss of business as it drags through the courts.
A $28.5-million lawsuit still hangs over Brampton City Hall, council is wrestling over a future route for a LRT corridor, long-standing policing policies in one of Canada's most-diverse communities are being challenged by residents and plans for the city's first university need to be hammered out.
In November, after more than 19,000 pages of documents supporting its case had been filed by Inzola to fight the city's attempt at dismissing the lawsuit, the city abandoned its dismissal strategy , dropping its motion, and now the case is heading for trial.
The city, responding to numerous questions from the Star about the lawsuit throughout 2016, did not address documents that had been filed with the court raising concerns about the conduct of senior staff involved in the selection process. The city stated that it had filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit “in its entirety.”
After Inzola was disqualified from bidding on the project, its lawsuit was filed, alleging bias against the local builder by senior city staff and former mayor Susan Fennell in the awarding of a $500-million downtown redevelopment project. The city denies all the lawsuit's allegations.
“No one knows what really happened,” Sprovieri said. “We could be losing tens of millions of dollars in business because reputable firms might be concerned about getting involved with projects here. We need to get this to trial as soon as possible now, to find out what happened and finally clear the air so the city can move on.”
Early in 2017, the Ontario Ombudsman is expected to release his findings after a broad investigation into Brampton real estate and development dealings. The probe could cause more controversy inside city hall, and force changes to the way the city does business. Ombudsman Paul Dubé stated in the spring, after his team's initial inquiry, that “we determined that the issue of non-competitive procurements could potentially have systemic implications on the city, its staff and its citizens.”
The sweeping investigation, called after Brampton council raised concerns about the procurement for the redevelopment deal and other possible systemic problems inside city hall, is being conducted by a team from the ombudsman's office that has had access to all documents and staff inside city hall for much of the year. The investigation will not, however, deal with matters related to the downtown deal that are subject to the ongoing litigation.
On the transit front, early in 2017 city staff is expected to present council with more details for a future LRT corridor after it voted against the province's preferred route along Main St. in 2015. Staff is looking at council's chosen alternatives along either Kennedy Rd. or McLaughlin Rd. Concerns have been raised about how much work has been done on the file, particularly after more than 45 managers, including some top bureaucrats, were suddenly dismissed by the city recently.
Chris Drew, co-founder of the group Fight Gridlock in Brampton, who advocated for the scrapped Main St. route, says lessons were learned from that LRT debate, which bogged down council for the better part of a year and divided many in the city.
“I'm hopeful that the city can learn and grow,” he said, adding that he expects staff to report on the only two LRT routes now on the table, early in the year. Asked if council and the city might again get mired in an exhaustive debate over which of the two routes to back, Drew said the city can't afford to get into another acrimonious battle while traffic congestion gets worse every day.
“It's not healthy for Brampton to make things personal.”
Drew said council can make a decision on the future route early in 2017, when staffers present findings on the two corridors being considered. This, Drew said, will allow the city to start advocating for funding from higher levels of government and get the project moving.
Along with better transit for the city, residents have also been clamouring for a university presence — it is the largest city in Canada without one. In October the province saved Brampton from having to fight with Milton over the selection for just one new university — the Liberal government announced it will award one campus to each municipality along with $180 million in combined funding.
Now, residents are wondering what work has been done to select a campus location, who the university acting as Brampton's required partner will be and where the money will come from, beyond the city's share of the $180 million, to build the city's first university campus. All of these issues will have to be tackled by a staff missing now many key personnel in the management ranks.
Mayor Jeffrey said that while the province's decision is a welcome one, it means more work, but also more potential opportunities because the scope of the proposal has been greatly widened.
“Whereas before we were really limited to Ontario partnerships, the province is really expanding that reach . . . we now can look beyond an Ontario partner.”
Jeffrey said that while the principal university partner has to be Ontario based, the city is now going to start working with the province to find other post-secondary partnerships, even possibly overseas, that tie in with the local economy and the desires of Brampton residents who want specific types of educational opportunities in a rapidly transforming economy.
She says the work about to be done to build the city's first university campus could “transform the region.
“It's early days, but I'm very excited about it.”
Another key issue facing Brampton, where more than two-thirds of residents are visible minorities, is the future of policing, specifically policies surrounding racial profiling and diversity within the force. After the force's own data was published by the Star in 2015, showing black individuals were three times more likely to be carded by Peel police than whites, Mayor Jeffrey voiced strong opposition to the practice, in her role as a police services board member, overseeing the force.
Jeffrey has also supported a broad equity-diversity audit of Peel police, which in 2017 will probe whether or not its hiring and promotion practices are equitable and reflect the demographics in one of Canada's most diverse regions.
Police Chief Jennifer Evans, who refused the board's request to suspend carding (after the board voted in 2015 to do so) and challenged the board on how it handled its decision to launch the equity-diversity audit, is in the last year of her contract. Jeffrey and the rest of the board will have to decide in 2017 whether to keep Evans on as chief after almost two years of tension between her and the board.
Kellyanne Conway recently spoke out about first ladies, and it might upset a lot of Michelle Obama fans — depending on your interpretation, of course. A TMZ reporter asked Conway about why Melania Trump hasn't appeared on many magazine covers whereas Michelle was featured on many. In one part of her response, Conway said Melania is a "superior" first lady, which is being taken as a dig against Michelle.
As TMZ often does, television cameras and a reporter followed Conway to her car. The reporter asked, "Is it a double standard how the the media has been covering Melania Trump?" He goes on to point out Melania "hasn't been on the cover of any U.S. magazines," but Michelle has been featured "30 times."
Conway jumped right in with her superior comment. "Melania Trump is such a superior and excellent first lady," Conway told the reporter, immediately after he mentioned Michelle. Conway continued, listing out Melania's accomplishments:
This country is so lucky to have her as its first lady. Her work with youth, her work with... you saw her in the East Wing recently talking about the opioid crisis, empowering young kids in their curriculum in the public schools. And she's just doing wonderful job. Everybody's so excited that she and her team are in charge of the state dinner with the Macrons coming up this week. And they see every time that they witness Melania Trump going down for the hurricane recovery, she's a philanthropist. She's a wonderful role model for women and girls, and really anyone everywhere.
TMZ on YouTube
Then comes the second comparison with Michelle. "I don't think she needs to be on the cover of a magazine for everybody to see how wonderful her work is," Conway concluded.
It may not be exactly fair to claim Conway called Melania superior specifically in comparison to Michelle — but she did seem to start and end her response relating Melania to her predecessor.
What is definitely true is that Melania has not been on the cover of magazines to the same degree that Michelle was. NBC News looked into the matter, noting that the first lady, who is a former model, was on the cover of many top U.S. publications before becoming first lady but has been on none since. Her only magazine cover since it is south of the border, when Melania graced the front of Vanity Fair Mexico — which provoked outrage, given her husband's policies.
"It's a lack of sensitivity on the part of the publisher,” Guadalupe Loaeza, a Mexican author and columnist, told The Guardian. “I started reading this and I couldn't finish. I didn't want to know anything about the wife of our country's No 1 enemy.”
That outrage is reportedly the main reason she hasn't been on any U.S. covers either. "For some people, it's a moral issue," one major editor told NBC News. "There is no way to do the Trumps without infuriating either the base or the resistance. It is a no-win."
The question asked of Conway has been brought up several times on Twitter. Actor, Republican, and vocal Trump supporter James Wood posited, "If the Trumps were Democrats, Melania would be on every cover of every chic women's magazine in the world every month."
There's no promise of a cover, but it does seem that Melania will feature in Vogue at some point in the next years. "We have a tradition of always covering whoever is the first lady at Vogue, and I can't imagine that this time would be any different," Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, told The Wall Street Journal in February 2017.
Conway's right that magazine covers don't make a first lady superior, but Michelle fans may still take offense at the comparison.
LONDON (Reuters) - Chinese businessman Jisheng Gao has completed a takeover of Southampton, club owner Katharina Liebherr said in a letter to fans on Monday.
"Following extensive and fruitful work, we are entering into a partnership with the Gao family and I am excited about what we will achieve together," Liebherr said.
Although no details of the deal were released, local media reported that Gao had purchased an 80 per cent stake for around 120 million pounds ($155.60 million).
Liebherr said she had built up a close relationship with Gao's daughter Nelly Gao, who local media said would join the board.
The Premier League approved the takeover by Gao's company in June, and the deal takes to 28 the number of European clubs now under Chinese ownership.
Seven of those are British: West Bromwich Albion, Birmingham City, Aston Villa, Wolves, Reading and Northampton are the others, with Manchester City also 13 per cent owned by Chinese.

Punjab University clinched the trophy after handing over a shocking 4-0 defeat to University of Central Punjab in the final of the All-Pakistan Higher Education (HEC) Commission Inter-University Men Football Championship played at University Campus ground under the aegis of Directorate of Sports University of Peshawar on Friday.
Minister for Excise and Taxation and Narcotics Mian Jamshed Uddin Khan was the chief guest on this occasion. Vice Chancellor University of Peshawar Professor Dr Muhammad Asif Khan, Pro-VC Professor Dr Muhammad Abid Khan, Director General Sports Bahre Karam, officials, players and large number of spectators were also present. Before the start of the final match the players of two finalist teams Punjab University and University of Central Punjab were introduced to the chief guest. The players of the University of Sargodha, a team, got third position was also present.
The final match was started on a slow note and soon it took momentum when both the teams Punjab University and University of Central Punjab raided on each other territories with some fine moves were also witnessed.
After first 20 minute play, none of the team could score any goal and it was the 21st minute when right winger Aamir Gondal got a free ball from left defender Saqib and quickly zoomed into the danger zone where by reaching in front of the goal-mouth he kicked into the net to make the tally 1-0. After taking lead, Punjab University scored another goal when left winger Zeeshan Siddique on the pass of mid-filder Saad slammed in another goal to make the tally 2-0. It was the dying moments of the first session when this time Aamir Gondal travelled past three defeders and gave a free ball to unmarked Shahbaz Tariq who did nothing wrong in dispatching it into the net to make the tally 3-0.
At half-time Punjab University was leading by 3-0. It was the second session in which University of Central Punjab did some resistance but due to man-to-man marking Punjab University defenders did not give much room to the rival strikers to strike back.—APP
Speaker National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq Wednesday said the new Channel of PTV Parliament would change perception of the public about working of public representatives in National Assembly and Senate. Speaking on the inauguration of Channel of the Parliament, the Speaker said that the main purpose of the Channel of the Parliament was to keep the public informed what kind of issues parliamentarians were taking up on their behalf.
Ayaz Sadiq said that it was general perception among people that the Parliament and its Standing committees were doing little and the new Channel would help in changing that mindset. He said that he as Speaker opened the Parliament for everyone so that people could learn about the working of both houses. Ayaz Sadiq said that delegations from various universities, colleges and schools across the country visited the Parliament and witnessed its proceedings.
Students after their visit said their perception about Parliament changed as they came to know how the houses functioned, he said adding as many 200 internees had completed their internship from Parliament and they were now highlighting the role of Senate and National Assembly on the social media.
“It was great achievement of the Parliament that as many as 26 universities have adopted the syllabus of the Parliamentary Studies with the help of Higher Education Commission (HEC),” he added.
Ayaz Sadiq expressed the hope that message of the Parliament through the channel would reach heart of the general public, adding that role of the Pakistan Television was very crucial in this regard.
Recalling the meetings of Electoral Reforms Committee of the Parliament, the Speaker said the committee sought recommendations from the public and as many as 4000 pages of recommendations were received which were later incorporated in the law.
He said that Pakistan was the world's first green Parliament as it was completely run on solar energy. The Speaker appreciated Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb and Secretary Ahmad Nawaz Sukhera for their efforts for the launch of the Parliament channel.—APP

The UK government has ignored recommendations from a panel of MPs engaged to examine pension regulations by stopping short of handing an M&A veto to trustees in a package of proposed reforms.
The government's proposals, published Monday, are aimed at preventing pensioners being left penniless in the wake of corporate collapses such as the retail group BHS in 2016, or Carillion this year. But a former pensions minister slammed the package as "gesture politics" that might end up having little practical impact.

The Atlanta Hawks will likely be shopping veteran power forward Paul Millsap before the NBA trade deadline hits in February.
The Hawks are reportedly already listening to offers for the 31-year-old, who will be an unrestricted free agent in the summer once he opts out of his current contract.
Story posting soon with @WindhorstESPN: ESPN sources say the Hawks have begun listening to trade offers for free agent-to-be Paul Millsap — Marc Stein (@ESPNSteinLine) January 1, 2017
Millsap is by no means a still star, rather a savvy vet — something that the Detroit Pistons are sorely missing. After making the playoffs for the first time in seven years last season, the Pistons have regressed to a 16-20 record and sit outside of the Eastern Conference's top eight teams.
Players' only meetings and lineup changes have dominated headlines surrounding the Pistons for the past few weeks — right after point guard Reggie Jackson came back from a knee injury.
After limping through the month of December with a 5-10 record, the Pistons need a shot in the arm. Making a trade for someone like Millsap could be the answer.
Here's one possible trade that the Pistons could complete to bring Millsap to the Motor City.
Pistons receive: Paul Millsap
Hawks receive: Marcus Morris, Ish Smith and Aron Baynes.
It might sound like the Pistons would be giving up a lot in this scenario, but they really wouldn't be. The Pistons are likely prepared to lose Baynes after the season ends, which is why they signed Boban (BOBAN!) Marjanović to a rather large contract over the summer. They could also replace Smith's production with more playing time for reserve Beno Udrih, who played superbly off the bench while Jackson was injured.
But most importantly, Millsap would fill in as a much better piece for the Pistons than Morris.
General manager and coach Stan Van Gundy has proved that he isn't afraid to make large-impact moves during the middle of a season — i.e. releasing Josh Smith and trading for Tobias Harris.
The Pistons would likely have to give up a lot to bring Millsap to town — and run the risk of losing him to free agency in the offseason just like the Hawks do — but he might be the perfect fit for Van Gundy's system.
Q&A: Katrina Onstad, author of The Weekend Effect, a call to arms to rediscover the lost art of leisure
Q&A: Katrina Onstad, author of The Weekend Effect, a call to arms to rediscover the lost art of leisure
Free time is at an all-time premium. In the choppy gig economy, everyone is always on call and leisure hours are fleeting. When people do find time to relax, they feel lazy or guilty. Is there still time to save the weekend?
Toronto journalist and author Katrina Onstad offers up a few answers in her new book, The Weekend Effect: The Life Changing Benefits of Taking Time Off and Challenging the Cult of Overwork, on sale April 18. It's part diagnosis, part prescription—an account of the history and importance of a leisurely weekend and how ignoring it could literally be the death of us. We asked Onstad what went wrong and how to win back our downtime.
How was your weekend?
My family did something I highly recommend in the book: we got out of the city. We drove to Halton Hills with our crazy dog and our kids and went hiking on an unmarked trail. It was incredibly calming and rejuvenating.
At what point in your life did you sense that the weekend was starting to slip away?
I was working in television production, nine to five in an office, while my writing career was percolating on the side. I was acutely aware of never being “off,” and my family was feeling it, too. The weekends just didn't leave us feeling rested and bettered.
Sunday night morphed into Monday morning?
We actually ended up feeling like, “Thank God it's Monday,” because the weekends just left us wiped out.
One of the central ideas of the book is that our slavish commitment to checking emails at night and on weekends has essentially turned us into “low-stakes doctors always on call,” as you describe it. Is that behaviour driven by a fear that everyone else is doing it, and if we don't, that there are plenty of other workers who will?
This is the struggle. It benefits us to look like we are totally immersed in work. In these economically shaky times, no one wants to be the person who packs up at 5 p.m. If the person in the cubicle next to you is going to stay until 11 p.m., they are going to look like a better employee.
What needs to change?
We need to look at this as a public health issue. Overworked and burnt-out employees are less productive, make more mistakes, are less happy, have more mental health issues, and so on. The risk of stroke among employees who work 55 or more hours per week is 33 per cent higher than those working a 35- or 40-hour week, for example. There are actually governments around the world that are protecting the weekend. France just enshrined the right to disconnect on the weekends and at night.
Do corporations have a responsibility?
Corporate leadership can help. Innovative companies seem to be realizing that this is just not sustainable—burnt-out workers do in fact have negative repercussions.
Any stand-out examples?
Google did an experiment called “Dublin Goes Dark,” where they had their employees leave their devices at work on Fridays and pick them up on Monday, and they reported blissfully chill, rejuvenated workers. There's also a surge of “time protecting” software for businesses, which, during off-hours, lets employees announce: “Hey, I am not working right now. Sorry!” That simple gesture sends such a strong message. It acknowledges that people have lives beyond work, which is a reality workplaces culture often suppress. Workers have to perform being “all-in” whether they are or not.
Do we ultimately have any power to do anything about this on a personal level? Aren't we just beholden to the rules of the game?
We need to address our own personal commitment to time off, which is very hard to do because the system is working against us. We have to decide on a personal level—how much does it matter to us to protect that time to make sure that our weekends are not just binge-watching TV?
Any examples of people who have disconnected from work on weekends and found themselves better for it?
TV writer-producer Shonda Rhimes, who works more than anyone, has a strict policy against email on weekends or after 7 p.m. She says she's reclaimed her life and never missed anything urgent since invoking this rule—and she receives 2,500 emails a day!
What are the most important things we are losing?
Sadly, community and connection are usually the first things to fall off the schedule due to the cult of overwork.
In the book, you mention that Aristotle's ideal of a good life includes leisure—that leisure is freedom. How did a generation raise on Ferris Bueller's Day Off lose sight of that?
There's a palpable equation of overwork and success out there: profiles of CEOs always include the requisite “And she works seven days a week with two hours sleep!” line, as if it deserves a slow clap. Advertizers love to use busyness to flag fabulous lifestyle, especially in car ads. Look at the recent campaign by Fiverr that appealed to the vanity of entrepreneurs with the line: “Sleep deprivation is your drug of choice.” So, when all of our time needs to be focused on productive activity, it becomes harder and harder to blow off work to go to the art gallery and have a profound interaction with a piece of art, like Cameron did in Ferris Bueller.
You mention missing the feeling of being bored when you were young. Is that sense of boredom something that digital natives will ever experience, never mind miss?
At its best, being bored means you are free to ponder and wonder. I mean, we all do this, but when you have a device in your pocket, it's hard not to check it when you are standing in line. Before, that would have been a space for your mind to go places it normally wouldn't.
In the book, you question whether brunch is a worthy thing to do on a time-strapped weekends. What are your thoughts on the notion that “activism is the new brunch”?
I think that is a bit cynical. Brunch is this performance piece that people enact in urban centres, which says, “Look at how much disposable income I have,” and, “Look at how much time I have” to be able to stand in line for three hours to drink overpriced mimosas. It's one of those weekend activities that leave people feeling really hollow. Whereas with activism, we do have a profound, deep need to connect with other people and express ourselves. It's a good thing to be engaged in the world. That said, since the Kendall Jenner/Pepsi fiasco, I do keep hearing, “activism is the new brunch.”
In researching the history of leisure and the concept of the weekend, what surprised you the most?
Lots of things, but the one that keeps coming up is the fact that Medieval peasants actually worked less than we do. They worked where they lived, they had long naps in the middle of the day, they had a lot of religious holidays, and they'd check out of work at the drop of a hat: “Hey, a juggler is in the town square, gotta go!”
Anything in particular, good or bad, that strikes you about Toronto's attitude to work-life balance?
I think Toronto is a workaholic city. The first question you get when you meet someone is “What do you do?” instead of “How are you doing?” There is a real danger of merging work and self, and losing sight of the fact that we need to have meaningful existence beyond the office. Can you be a person outside of work?
You suggest that Silicon Valley holds much of the blame for popularizing the cult of overwork. They have the Burning Man festival to blow off steam. Does Toronto need some drum circles to chill out?
It would be great to decompress once a year at a festival like Burning Man. I would totally go. But I'd rather see is a city where looking busy isn't a currency, where everyone didn't start a conversation with the proclamation, “I'm so busy!”
Now that you're finished the book, how good are you at following your own advice?
I did take part in the National Day of Unplugging last month. What was interesting was that it changed the geography of my house: I started using areas I don't ordinarily hang out in because they're not associated with my computer. But I'll admit that last weekend I spent many hours working, and it sucked. I was mad at myself about not planning better to protect that time, so I followed up by dragging my family to the woods on Sunday. Even during crazy crunch time, a couple of beats of actual respite and beauty, sometimes that's not about work or consumption—that is enough to declare a weekend a success.

Sunyani, April 24, GNA - The Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit (DoVVSU) of the Ghana Police Service in the Brong-Ahafo Region received 864 cases in 2017, as against 1,162 in 2016.
Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Setina Aboagye, the Regional Coordinator of the Unit, in an interview with Ghana News Agency (GNA) on Thursday in Sunyani, said the figure represented a decrease of 34.5 per cent of the 2016 reported cases.
DSP Aboagye gave the statistics as, non-maintenance, 340, spousal assault, 173, threat of death, 46, stealing, 37, defilement, 36, abduction, 35, non-acceptance of pregnancy, 35, threat of harm, 26, and unlawful removal of children, 24.
The rest were offensive conduct, 22, defrauding by false pretence, 12, rape, 10, causing damage, 16, causing harm, 10, unlawful ejection, four, missing persons, nine, abandonment of infants, six, criminal abortion, three, indecent assault, four, and deprivation of property, nine.
She said 80 out of the cases were sent to Court, and 15 of them were acquainted and discharged, two perpetrators were convicted, while 45 were still awaiting trial.
DSP Aboagye added that 50 cases were referred to the Department of Social Welfare, but 66 were still under investigations and 540 settled and closed.
She said 62 victims in the cases were males and therefore encouraged men who were being abused and maltreated by their wives to report them to DOVVSU.
DSP Aboagye assured that the Unit would continue with its outreach programmes to educate parents in churches and communities through workshops and on local radio stations.

As Trump Inquiries Flood Ethics Office, Director Looks To House For Action
Enlarge this image toggle caption Claire Harbage/NPR Claire Harbage/NPR
Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub Jr. is calling on the chairman of House Oversight Committee to become more engaged in overseeing ethics questions in the Trump administration.
In an interview with NPR on Monday, Shaub said public inquiries and complaints involving Trump administration conflicts of interest and ethics have been inundating his tiny agency, which has only advisory power.
"We've even had a couple days where the volume was so huge it filled up the voicemail box, and we couldn't clear the calls as fast as they were coming in," Shaub said. His office is scrambling to keep pace with the workload.
But while citizens, journalists and Democratic lawmakers are pushing for investigations, Shaub suggested a similar level of energy is not coming from the House Oversight Committee, which has the power to investigate ethics questions, particularly those being raised now about reported secret ethics waivers for former lobbyists serving in the Trump administration.
Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, has "authority to investigate these things and compel responses, so hopefully we'll see some action from him," Shaub said.
"OGE, however, has no investigative authority, so we're limited as to what we can do if these waivers are not being released publicly," he said.
Chaffetz' office said he had no comment.
The New York Times, in collaboration with ProPublica, published a story on Saturday saying Trump has been filling the White House and federal agencies with former lobbyists, lawyers and consultants, and has been generously waiving ethics requirements without even posting the waiver information on the Government Ethics website.
But while Chaffetz has generally been quiet on Trump-related ethics issues, the public has been hammering OGE with questions and complaints.
How big is the jump in public contacts, such as calls, letters and emails? During the six months between October 2008 and March 2009, as the Obama presidency was taking shape, the OGE got 733 contacts.
During the October 2016 to March 2017 period, it got 39,105 contacts from citizens — an increase of 5,235 percent.
Comparing those same two time periods, the number of Freedom of Information Act requests — typically from journalists and public-interest groups — shot up to 280 from 39. That's an increase of 618 percent.
Shaub said that, for example, when a top Trump adviser recommended certain fashion lines on Fox & Friends, the public outcry and media interest rocketed up.
"When Kellyanne Conway had endorsed Ivanka Trump's product line, our phones rang off the hook, and they practically melted the system," he said. "This is a level of attention that we haven't seen before in terms of public interest."
Shaub said Trump is correct when he says, as he did back in January, that presidents technically are not covered by law from having conflicts of interest. "I have a no-conflict situation because I'm president," Trump said at the press conference. He added, "I didn't know about that until about three months ago, but it's a nice thing to have."
There are ethics rules that do apply to members of his administration, though. Those are the ones keeping Shaub's small staff busy, according to the director.
"When you get 39,000 calls coming into a 71-person agency, the best they can do is log the calls," he said.
The statistical analysis, comparing the Obama and Trump eras, have not previously been released. Shaub says his office is "understaffed right now," compared with the massively increased workload involving FOIA requests and the congressional requests, coming mostly from Democrats. "I've never seen anything like this," he said.
Still, the office is keeping up with the advisory work — trying to guide Trump appointees on ethics laws and suggesting solutions to conflicts of interest they may face. Other routine business, such as doing staff training or writing new guidelines, has been put on hold as the staff focuses on moving along Trump staffers, he said.
Following the 3-0 defeat at Southend United, Neal Ardley was forced into one change with Lyle Taylor having to sit out this game due to his red card. This meant a rare start for Tyrone Barnett.
The other two changes were Jon Meades returning at left-back and Andy Barcham taking his place on the left of midfield.
Wimbledon have never won at Bristol Rovers and few were confident that would change and so it proved.
Two strikes from Matt Taylor in the second half separated the sides, but as is customary there were two talking points where penalties could and perhaps should have been awarded.
Tom Elliott was wrestled to the ground and his shirt almost removed from his back, but the referee deemed it to be fair play.
The other was Dean Parrett hacked down inside the box and the free-kick was then awarded outside.
Would either penalty award have had an impact on the final score? Based on play until then, highly unlikely.
Quite simply the team is going through a mid-season away slump in the league.
The last goal they scored was in the 1-0 win on October 22, when Peterborough were dispatched.
In hindsight that game, which should have seen the Dons win 4-0, was a high point and it is baffling as to why no league goals have since been found.
Oldham Athletic was a tight affair and the 0-0 reflected the day, whilst the stalemate at Millwall was seen as positive. Both were points won rather than two dropped.
The 0-1 against MK Cons hurt, especially with the manner of a penalty award.
Southend United and New Year's Eve simply saw the team completely and utterly out of sorts.
That means three away games on the spin have been lost and five games without a league goal.
Interspersed have been cup games at Bury, Newport County and Curzon Ashton, so supporters know goals can be scored. Conversely the defence has at times seemed on the back foot and chasing shadows.
Neal Ardley changed the formation for Bristol to 4-4-2 in an attempt to make the team solid across the pitch and for long periods Rovers were held at bay with the best chance falling to Andy Barcham, but somehow the goalkeeper managed to smother the shot and force it away for a corner.
Had Wimbledon taken the lead then, then perhaps the outcome would have been different, since Rovers looked no better or worse and they had had a pretty patchy run of form too.
It is though in moments like that, which see games won or lost.
Perhaps then some of the missed chances are down to tiredness?
This then begs the question, whether Ardley should be rotating his squad more?
True there have been injuries to key players, one of which saw Darius Charles come on in a striker role for the last few minutes of the game.
Will he replace Chris Robertson in defence? If so, then the promotion-winning back four will once again be in place and perhaps then confidence will return.
With the derby against Millwall today followed by the FA Cup away to Sutton United, Ardley and Dons supporters will be seeking positive answers very soon.
AFC Wimbledon 4-4-2: Shea 7, Fuller 5, Robinson 6, Robertson 6, Meades 5, Bulman 5 (Parrett 67, 7), Reeves 6, Francomb 5, Barcham 7 (Poleon 67, 7), Elliott 7, Barnett 7 (Charles 85)

It took a while, but Love Island 's Marcel Somerville has FINALLY got his first kiss in the villa.
Gabby Allen has succumbed to the Blazin Squad star's charms and puckered up.
Admitting her feelings for him in the Beach Hut, she says: "I have had butterflies but I don't have them all the time. Maybe that's because everything's so chilled.
"My heart has flipped a couple of times. Oh God that sounds so cringe doesn't it.
"The more I get chatting to Marcel, the more we have one on one time, the more I'm gravitating towards him.
"He's so interesting and I find him really charming and he's obviously trying to play it cool.”

Having worked out together in the garden, Marcel agrees: "It's going really well with Gabby. I'm kind of liking her a lot.
"She's kind of got a lot of similarities to me. There's obviously a bit of chemistry there.
"They always say a couple that trains together, stays together, so you never know what's going to happen.”
Later that night, when Gabby suggests Marcel would do well as a personal trainer, he replies: “I'd be a great PT because obviously I build up people's confidence all the time. I'm not saying I'm building up your confidence.
"You don't need to build up your confidence. You should already know that you're banging.”
He adds: “I'm happy you know. You're my girl in here, that I want to spend time with.”

Gabby replies: “We've got all the time in the world. I'm excited, because I think there's good things coming.”
The pair then lean in for a passionate embrace.
Having partnered with Marcel at the last re-coupling, good friend Montana immediately gives her seal of approval to the budding romance.
She says: “Marcel and Gabby are just really cute together. They already look quite smitten, so I'm really happy for them both. Especially Marcel.
"He 100% deserves it. And I really hope that it just grows like a love tree from now on.”

The film faced massive protests by fringe groups claiming that the filmmaker has distorted historical facts in the film. However, Bhansali time and again mentioned that none of these claims are true.
The film was initially scheduled to hit the screens on December 1, 2017. It stars Deepika Padukone in the titular role of Rani Padmavati while Shahid Kapoor plays her on-screen husband Maharawal Ratan Singh. Ranveer Singh plays Alauddin Khilji in the period drama respectively.
The impeccable performances of the lead actors have been appreciated by one and sundry.
Erin Hills a tough test for golfers and USGA

By Steve Keating
ERIN, Wisconsin (Reuters) - The U.S. Open is always billed as the ultimate test in golf due to course conditions but this week could also be one of the toughest logistical challenges as the major comes to Erin Hills for the first time.
A sprawling links-style layout nestled in the bucolic Wisconsin countryside about 35 miles outside Milwaukee, Erin Hills offers a new challenge for the world's best golfers and an equalling daunting test for everyone from volunteers to police.
With no blueprint to follow, getting more than 35,000 spectators, 5,000-plus volunteers, hundreds of media and 156 golfers in and out and around the golf course will be a monumental logistical feat.
"It's tough," United States Golf Association executive director Mike Davis told Reuters on Wednesday. "Not having an event at the same place every year is a challenge because you have different volunteers, different vendors, different police.
"It's not like the Players Championship or the Masters or the John Deere or whatever where it is the same place, so it has its challenges.
"Once you've done an event at the same place over and over you get pretty good at it."
As with most big sporting or entertainment events weather is the wildcard, and with blazing temperatures and a threat of violent thunderstorms spectator safety will be a prime concern.
As menacing clouds gathered on Wednesday several spectators who asked red-shirted volunteers where to go if the evacuation siren sounds were told to seek cover, which may prove difficult at a venue with only a handful of permanent buildings on site.
With just one two-lane road leading in and out of Erin Hills and only 300 parking spaces on site the U.S. Open will be a major traffic headache for both fans and police.
"Most of what we are worried about right now is weather-related issues," said Davis. "We are very likely to get some pretty significant rains later today.
"They're predicting more rain Thursday night into Friday morning, likely some on Saturday.
"The normal things you are worried about."
After U.S. Opens at Oakmont and Chambers Bay the last two years came under criticism - the former for a rules controversy and the latter for the condition of putting greens - the USGA is desperate for the 117th edition run smoothly.
While the USGA and organisers believe they have prepared for almost every contingency Davis admitted you never know what can happen.
"We know we've had some issues the last two years," said Davis. "Moving forward we want a nice, smooth U.S. Open.
"But, listen, we're prepared -- you never know what's going to happen with Mother Nature.
"You're never going to know what happens with certain rule situations or how the players play the course.
"So you just deal with them and you remain nimble and flexible."

Keitha Thomas Designs of Midlothian has been creating and arranging events and decor for years in Central Virginia. A native New Yorker who has brought her individual flair to the region, Thomas utilizes her knowledge of styles and colors in her floral designs and distinguished events.
Bride: What's the most common mistake people make when looking for floral arrangements?
Keitha Thomas: I think brides don't have a realistic idea of what florals actually cost, so most of their budgets are unrealistic.
Bride: How do you bridge that gap between a client's budget and their vision?
KT: We'll sit down and have a real classroom session where I educate the bride on what flowers cost and, based on the design that they present us, what something like that will cost them. And then from [that initial consultation] it's their decision if they're able to [increase] their budget to meet that expectation or if they want to compromise and work together to make that ‘wow' factor or style that they want [using a plan] that's more feasible.
Bride: What are your thoughts on DIY flower arrangements?
KT: It's really more overwhelming than [most people] think. There's a lot of detail that goes into designing and decorating a wedding, and it's not something that [most] can do by themselves. They can probably help out now and then on the days leading up to the wedding, but for the wedding [day] they need an actual designer or planner or someone there dedicated to [ensuring] their vision is seen through to the end. All the hard work they did up to planning the wedding is so that they're able to relax and enjoy the day and not have to worry about whether their vision is coming to life behind the scenes.
Bride: What do you mean when you say on your website that you don't design an event, you design an experience?
KT: Designing an event to me is basically just placing a whole bunch of decorations. There's no plan or reasoning behind what you do. You're basically just choosing a color and running with that color, or choosing a theme and running with that theme. Designing an experience is more [about] the look, the feel, the way a guest feels when they walk in a room.
It is the cohesiveness in [each] touchpoint that your guest is going to experience throughout the whole thing.
“There's a lot of detail that goes into designing and decorating a wedding, and it's not something that [most] can do by themselves.” —Keitha Thomas
Bride: How much has the art and bridal scene of New York influenced your work?
KT: I feel the wedding industry in Virginia is behind on a lot of trends. With my knowledge of New York events … I get to bring a lot of that new, unique experience and design to Richmond.
Bride: How do you keep up with trends? Where do you find design inspiration?
KT: We still do events in New York. We also look through magazines. ... We're not just limited to wedding magazines. We also look at Architectural Digest and interior design. We do a mix of not just the wedding world but design in general.
Bride: Were there any weddings that had a big impact on you personally?
KT: Most of the weddings I have done have made some type of impact on me, because I'm still friends with my brides. … We never met before then, but after doing the wedding we [went] on to be such close friends.
Bride: Is it common in the industry to build personal relationships?
KT: When you're looking for your ideal client, it's based on the connection, especially for millennials. It's about a relationship and how you click with the person you're buying from.

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. – Missouri State Senator Jamilah Nasheed wants the FCC to pull the broadcasting license for 1190 KQQZ-AM because of a radio host's racist and homophobic comments on his show.
Radio host Bob Romanik, who hosts Kool Killer Kountry on 1190 AM, has used the n-word on his show. Romanik said it's his First Amendment right to say what he wants and asserts half his audience is African-American.
“I promise you when the rap artists quit using the n-word and as soon as Chris Rock quits using the n-word, I'll quit using n-word,” he said.
Senator Nasheed wants Romanik off the air, adding that he's full of hate.
“To call individuals out of their names and call African-Americans the n-word, it's unacceptable,” she said. “That's why I'm calling for the FCC to remove (the station's) license.”
Romanik said half his audience and callers are black and that he wants people to judge him but what he does, not by what he says.
“I've done more for black community with my money. I can call you a killer…that doesn't mean you are,” he said. “They don't like what I say, so automatically I'm racist. I paid $25,000 for people below the hill. I'm not a racist, I'm a realist.”
An edited audio clip of Missouri State Representative Bob Burns calling into Romanik's show recently surfaced over the weekend, stirring this controversy.
Senator Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri) and several other politicians asked Burns to resign because he was calling into a show hosted by a man known to make racist comments. Burns has said he won't resign because he was saluting patriotism and not necessarily agreeing with Romanik's commentary.
“To go on his show and praise him and talk about how great he is doing, I don't think people understood that mentality. (Burns) should resign,” Nasheed said.
An FCC spokesperson said the organization would review Sen. Nasheed's complaint but declined further comment.
CLOSE Three local players win Mr. Football By John Varlas/The Commercial Appeal

One of the state's top-ranked 2019 prospects, Christian Brothers defensive lineman Bill Norton, announced Sunday night that he has committed to Georgia.
"Committed to the University of Georgia #GoDawgs," Norton tweeted.
The 6-foot-6, 270-pound Norton, a four-star prospect and the nation's 11th-ranked strong-side defensive end according to 247Sports composite rankings, chose the Bulldogs over offers from Alabama, LSU, Mississippi State, Ohio State, Notre Dame, Penn State, Oklahoma, Ole Miss and Tennessee.
Committed to the University of Georgia ⛓ #GoDawgspic.twitter.com/EgPRlr98S2 — Bill Norton (@willienorton33) March 18, 2018
The reigning TSSAA Division II-AAA Mr. Football recipient, Norton made his decision known a little more than 24 hours after visiting Tennessee for the first time since new Vols coach Jeremy Pruitt's hiring.
"He's lean; he's a really good athlete for his size; and we think he has a real knack for finding the football," Christian Brothers coach Thomas McDaniel said. "Georgia has kind of been adamant from day one that they thought he'd be a defensive lineman. In this recruiting process, some schools have leaned more towards thinking he was going to develop into an offensive lineman."
Mississippi State hosted Norton on March 10, and he visited Georgia on March 3.
"It's just about fit, and he really enjoyed the staff there," McDaniel said. "It's not a reflection of anything that's happened during the recruiting process recently or Georgia's success on the field last season. It was more about his visit over the summer, going to a game in the fall and kind of the rapport he has with their entire staff."
A two-way standout for Christian Brothers, Norton concluded his junior season with 45 total tackles — 16 for loss — and seven sacks for the Division II-AAA semifinalist Purple Wave.

Advocates of data visualisation using virtual or augmented reality argue that both let your brain do what it does best. Namely, pick out and memorise patterns by walking through the data using 3D and assisted by colour, movement, sound and even touch to represent extra dimensions.

We are, supposedly, on the cusp of a revolution with VR and AR being far more intuitive than mouse and monitor.
That's the promise – but it's not yet quite the reality. Startups, research labs and curious individuals are trying to figure how best to visualise data in VR and AR. One of the best known startups, Virtualitics, won $4.4m from investors in April.
But the field is a Wild West of competing platforms and interfaces, and it's unclear which, if any, will win out. Some even believe there is a risk that VR can distort our view of data – while others have rejected it, at least for now, as a serious tool of analysis.
Keep the sick bag handy
David Burden, managing director of 3D platform specialists Daden, spent six months trying to get his firm's software to work in VR, but eventually decided to stick with monitors. He is skeptical that viewing a 3D visualisation is any better in VR than on a flat screen.
"One of the issues is with the current generation of headsets you get a very narrow field of view," he says. "You're moving your head around a lot... we're flying backwards and forwards, so all of a sudden you're doing all the things that start to get people nauseous in VR."
Headset displays cannot yet match the resolution of a high-end monitor, meaning that a data point that would show up as a single pixel on a screen might get lost in VR. "You can't get that level of resolution, so you lose some of that data in VR," he says.
During initial analysis, where you need to look at a lot of data rapidly in different visualisations to find something interesting, using a screen remains a lot quicker and more comfortable over extended periods, Burden believes. "Trying to do that in VR is just silly," he argues, and is surprised so many companies are attempting it.
Instead, he thinks VR is "very powerful" at the end of the process, when you fly colleagues or clients through the data to show them what you have already found (Datascape's visualisations can be viewed in VR on Google's basic, mobile-based Cardboard).
This is the approach taken by LOOOK, an AR studio that has designed a tool for KPMG clients to inspect 3D table-top graphs using Microsoft's $3,000 Hololens AR headset. "This is a visualisation tool, it's not an analytics tool," says Sébastien Motte, LOOOK's chief executive.
But others insist analytics really can be done inside VR – it just needs a good engine to prepare the data first.

Christmas is just around the corner, and with the festive season finally here many high street stores have already revealed their top toys of the year.
These toys are set to be the biggest sellers in the lead up to the festive season, and the lists include some nostalgic favourites plus a few eye-watering price tags.
Hatchimals are once again gracing the list, with an updated version of the classic toy that ended up selling out last year, leaving parents scrambling to get hold of one in time for Christmas Day.
NERF and Star Wars also top the toys list on a number of retailer's lists this year, alongside new editions for 2017 like the popular Luvabella doll (which is getting mixed reception from parents) and tech-focused toys like the LEGO Boost and Fisher Price's ‘Teach n Tag Movi'.

Supermarket giant Tesco predicts the L.O.L Big Surprise Ball will be the year's bestseller for Christmas - but it won't come cheap, at £60 each.

"While the Big Surprise sits on top of our top 10 list there are other toys for kids of all ages – and the good news is that this year's selection is less reliant on technical innovation, and more to do with getting children to use their imagination."

A group of angry customers has launched a "boycott Walmart" hashtag after learning a third-party vendor was selling shirts on Walmart's website with the phrase "Impeach 45."
CNBC reports a description underneath the clothing item states, "Show how you really feel about our president with this tee!"
The shirt is being sold by third-party seller Old Glory. CNBC reports the shirts have since been removed from the website.
Angry Trump supporters voiced their anger on Twitter Tuesday morning, some tweeting #BoycottWalmart.
Walmart's third-party marketplace also has "Make America Great Again" merchandise.
TWEETS FROM UPSET TRUMP SUPPORTERS:
@Walmart Looks like I'll be shopping elsewhere from now on since you find it tasteful to sell Impeach 45 clothing in your stores! Goodbye!#BoycottWalmart — Mark Lonsinger (@MSLdraco) July 3, 2018
hey @Walmart care to explain why you would sell these shirts? Are you out of your mind taking the chance of alienating at least half the population? #Walmart#Impeach45 pic.twitter.com/DJYmMuqWv2 — Joe Pags Pagliarulo (@JoeTalkShow) July 3, 2018

Shoppers in Cabot Circus have the option of eating at a huge variety of restaurants ranging from Greek to Mexican cuisine.
From the all-you-can-eat gluttony of the newly-opened Casa Brasil to popular chains such as TGI Fridays and Five Guys, there's something to appeal to everyone.
A firm favourite for many is Wagamama, the nation-wide chain that serves traditional Asian dishes.
But visitors to the restaurant over the past few days hoping to enjoy its trademark ramen and katsu dishes have been turned away at the door.
And at a time when restaurants are closing all over the city for various reasons, they will no doubt have feared that Wagamama is the latest casualty.
However, there's no need to worry too much as it isn't a permanent closure – the restaurant is undergoing a refurbishment to improve the look of the interior.
A restaurant spokesman said: “'Wagamama will be closed for refurbishment and will reopen for customers to enjoy with an updated and refreshed interior from Friday 9 February.
"As a brand, we stick to our core value of Kaizen, meaning good change in Japanese, which is at the heart of everything we do from our food and drink offering to our restaurants.
“And don't worry, while we are closed you can still get your Wagamama fix at our Clifton and Cribbs Causeway restaurants.”

The BMW M3 and M3 are about to become a little less special as both the sport sedan and coupe will switch from carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) driveshafts to fairly commonplace steel components. BMW says the reason behind the switch involves emission standards and future compliance.
The CFRP driveshafts are wider than steel units and take up more space under the car. BMW plans to add a particulate filter to the exhaust system in the near future and the CFRP driveshafts simply don't mesh with the emissions equipment.
However, BMW assures enthusiasts that the steel units have been developed with M performance attributes in mind while being narrower to make the particulate filters fit. Inevitably, the M3 and M4 will likely gain a few pounds with a shift to steel construction.

It should be noted the change will not affect the BMW M4 CS and BMW M4 GTS, both of which represent more track-focused interpretations of the M4. For those who simply can't put a CS or GTS in their garages, BMW again reassured "the superlative performance and handling qualities" found in the regular M3 and M4 will not change. True, most drivers may not notice a difference, but for some, it may represent a more sour note just in principle.
BMW plans to introduce the steel driveshafts beginning in November. From there on out, all M3 and M4s (aside from the CS and GTS) will be equipped with the steel units. If CFRP is a must, it's best to locate a current example before inventories dry up.
Jeannie Cole pivots to a new career with ReBoot Accel paving the way
Jeannie Cole's story is not unlike other Menlo Park moms. She came to Menlo soon after marrying and has stayed in the same neighborhood — if not the same house — ever since. She started her career in educational publishing before turning freelance when her second child was born. As her children got older, she realized she was at a crossroads.
“I needed to either re-up my freelancing or get an in-house position,” she says. “I decided on the latter as I really wanted to be in a collegial environment.”
Knowing she needed a lot more digital experience, she was among the first group of women to take advantage of ReBoot Accel career accelerator for women, staying on with that organization for another year helping to shape its programming. “I was doing content marketing which I'd never done before,” she recalls.
Her ReBoot experience — a “career pivot” as she calls it — led to her current position leading communications and events for the Stanford-based DREME Network. DREME stands for development and research in early math education, and the Network consists of 12 professors at 11 universities along with 44 affiliates.
“Even though I'm employed by Stanford, my work involves all the universities,” Jeannie explains.
The Network focuses on math from birth through age eight years, with an emphasis on the preschool years. Network members and affiliates collaborate to conduct basic and applied research and develop innovative tools that address high-priority early math topics, which have been shown to be a better predictor of academic success.
“What is most satisfying about this job is that I get to help academics reach a wider audience,” she says. “A lot of what they do has practical implications for equity in education.”
Jeannie believes that her ReBoot Accel experience was pivotal to her getting her current position. “The application process required writing a communications plan, how I would use social media versus regular media,” she says, adding that it wasn't specific to the job she was applying for but another fictitious entity. “These were all things I learned at ReBoot. I felt ready and confident for working in a digital age.”
We ended our visit with Jeannie on the Stanford campus with a fun footnote: Her mother also worked for Stanford, as a librarian at both the Cubberly and Green Library.

TWENTY years have passed with today marking the moment when Ginger Spice left the Spice Girls at the height of the group's success. With reports of catfights and claws, this is the story of what really happened, from the girl's own mouths.
*****
"GERI'S leaving the band".
Victoria Beckham was in London when she received the call from the Spice Girls' lawyer, Andrew Thompson. She thought it was a joke.
"No, this is serious, Victoria. Geri is leaving the band. She's had enough. She doesn't want to come back".
It was May 26, 1998. The Spice Girls, then the biggest girl band of all time, were at the tail end of their European tour and had flown out of Helsinki to launch the midweek Lottery in the UK. Scary, Baby, Ginger, Posh and Sporty were set to take the stage the next evening in Oslo and the American leg of the tour was due to start in just a couple of weeks in Miami.
Geri had already warned the girls a couple of months earlier, while in Milan in March, of her plans to depart the band. She sat the girls down in a dressing room when she announced her decision to leave at the end of the world tour, notably after the Spice Girls' scheduled performance at Wembley Stadium that September.
Geri was met with silence from the rest of the group.
"Why do you want to leave?" Victoria asked, according to Halliwell's 1999 autobiography, If Only.
"I've had enough," Geri replied.
By this stage the Spice Girls' insane schedule had taken a toll and Geri's eating disorders had returned at full force. Her life, she felt, was spiralling out of control.
Over the next two months, Ginger had begun to slowly lose some of her colour. Her outfits less daring, her hair a shade or two lighter. Her blonde streaks removed. Less make up. Layer upon layer unravelling before the public's eye. She knew she wanted to get off the rollercoaster. She said the girls had begun to squabble and that "things were far from perfect".
"One thing that was clear at the time I decided to leave was that inside Ginger Spice, underneath the make-up, the big hair, the giant platforms and the headline-grabbing dresses, there was a real girl and she was being suffocated," Halliwell wrote in her second autobiography, 2002's Just For The Record.
Lawyers had been informed and the four remaining girls began to grow closer, Geri thought. The wheels for a departure were in motion.
The Spice Girls in happier times perform on stage at the Brit Awards in London on February 24, 1997, where they scooped awards for Best British Video and Best Single.
On the flight home to London to launch the Lottery in May, the girls were in good spirits.
"It was one of those mad flights we sometimes had, with loads of shouting and laughter and messing around. Geri seemed fine - we all did," Melanie B wrote in her autobiography, Catch A Fire. The girls hugged, said "See you tomorrow" - and that was it.
But then, all hell was let loose in Spice world - a snap decision that would throw the plan into disarray and would leave the girls gobsmacked.
That morning, Geri had discovered a "heavyweight" breast cancer interview that she had scheduled had been cancelled despite The Sun running a front page piece headlined: "Ginger Spice secret breast cancer op".
For Geri, it was a particularly sensitive issue. She was keen to use her fame for higher purposes and felt this an ample opportunity after she had emergency surgery on a small lump in her breast at the age of 17. Despite her negative result, she was desperate to highlight the issue and felt it was a chance to send out a positive message to check your breasts.
"Although some might think it was just a slogan or a gimmick, I had always been serious about Girl Power," she wrote.
"Unfortunately, the girls made it clear that they would rather I waited until after I left in September. The answer was obvious - it was time for me to go."
Devastated that she couldn't do the interview, it was breaking point for Ginger Spice.
"Forget the rest of the European tour," she wrote in her diary that night.
"Forget America! Forget Wembley Stadium! Ginger Spice is no more. She has left the band."

After the call from the Spice Girls' lawyer, Victoria's reaction was to simply ignore it.
"I literally no idea," she wrote in her 2001 autobiography, Learning to Fly.
"If anybody had taken a picture of me at that moment, it would not have been a pretty sight. A monkey's bum would have been more attractive."
But the issue couldn't be ignored forever. Melanie B, Victoria, Melanie C and Emma frantically tried to reach Geri, and found her hiding out at her brother's house.
The four girls all phoned and attempted to convince her to return, telling her "we've come this far" and "what on earth are you playing at?" One by one they tried, with no luck.
Geri said there was simply nothing left to say.
That night the girls had the scheduled Lottery appearance, but they weren't ready to tell the world of the inner turmoil raining down in Spice world. Geri's sickness became the "scapegoat" for the story; there was still hope that Ginger could eventually return, the remaining four still thought she would eventually see some sense.
So, throwing on a smile for the cameras, what would become the "fab four" made their first appearance sans Geri.
"Unfortunately Geri's not very well tonight so get well soon Geri!" Mel C spoke for the group. The official Virgin line was: "Geri is suffering from nervous exhaustion".
After the Lottery gig the remaining four flew to Oslo, but on their way Geri had been spotted boarding a plane to France.
"People recognised me at the airport, but nobody realised I was making my escape," Geri wrote.
By the time she had flown out, questions were being asked. Geri wasn't sick at all and the media could sniff a story. She hadn't been seen publicly since her performance with the Spice Girls in Helsinki.
"Everyone had their theories," wrote Victoria.
"That there had been some great row on the flight back from Helsinki. That we'd been hitting each other. The truth is that we'd all really had a laugh on that flight back."
Despite Geri saying the had prepared the girls for the inevitable, Victoria says differently.
"Perhaps she thought we were mind readers," Victoria wrote.
"We didn't know. Why she said that I have no idea; perhaps because it made her look better, because otherwise it was like admitting she had left us in the lurch. Which, of course, was exactly what she did. Geri Halliwell had left us totally in the lurch."
There wasn't much time to think - the Spice Girls had a show the next day and there was rearranging to do. The four remaining Spice Girls had less than 24-hours to completely rechoreograph and sort out new vocals to all their songs.
"It was mad. We didn't have a spare moment to absorb what had happened. We just had to get on with things," Mel B wrote.
Melanie C was particularly nervous about covering Geri's famous lines in Wannabe.
"It was more strange than difficult, especially doing the opening lines with Melanie," Mel B wrote. "She would sing the words, whereas they were meant to be shouted."
For Victoria, there was "one big plus. For the first time ever I got to sing on Wannabe".
But it didn't make up for the "total betrayal" she felt.
"I'd known Geri for four years, we'd shared a room in Windsor (before they were famous), we'd been through the most extraordinary experiences of our lives together. She was one of my best friends. And now she had walked out without a word. What I felt was anger at the selfishness of it all, then betrayal," Victoria wrote.
But the public was still completely unaware, despite the press reports.
"Spice Girls face split as Geri stays away," read a headline in the Daily Express. Sky News was running bulletins about "Missing Ginger Spice".
Statements were prepared by both parties and the announcement was made on Sunday, May 31. Geri escaped to Mauritius while the remaining Spice Girls continued with the final European leg. Her lawyer, Julian Turton, stood outside Andrew Thompson's office, the lawyer for the Spice Girls, surrounded by a full media pack and read Geri's statement:
This is a message to the fans. Sadly, I would like to confirm that I have left the Spice Girls. This is because of differences between us. I am sure the group will continue to be successful and I wish them all the best. I have no immediate plans. I wish to apologise to all the fans and to thank them and every one who has been there.
Lots of love, Geri.
PS. I'll be back.
The press statement issued by Freud Communications Agency for former Spice Girls member Geri Halliwell.
A £500,000 ($AU883,000) price tag was offered for the first shots of Geri sans Spice life. She wrote in her diary the next day: "Things are going crazy. Everybody is looking for me. I can't possibly hide forever. But where can I go? I don't feel safe here any more. They're going to find me."
She received a call from Ken Berry, the boss of Virgin Records, telling her George Michael had offered her a safe haven to stay and ride out the storm.
"I felt as though an angel had been sent down to me. In my hour of need, he came to my rescue," Geri wrote.
She flew to St Tropez where George assured her: "Don't rush, Geri. Take your time. You have longer than you think before the attention goes away."
In later years Geri would eventually describe the breast cancer interview was "only part of the picture" and "deep down in my heart of hearts I know that the disagreement about the interview was a life raft I used to get out of the group".
"Inside my heart, though, I'm not proud of leaving when I did. I'm not proud about that at all," she wrote.
Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti (L) performs with the Spice Girls just over a week after Geri's departure on June 9, 1998. Pavarotti had attempted to bring Geri back for the performance, but she declined.
Victoria reflected: "Geri really had been under much more strain than the rest of us, it was always harder for her, the only Spice Girl who wasn't a trained dancer.
"It's not easy getting up there on stage night after night, six days a week. Despite all the extra classes and rehearsals, she still found the pace of doing show after show more difficult to cope with than the rest of us.
"And she did get criticised for it, and it's horrible when people say you're the one with no talent, which they did. And I should know."
At the end of the year, the Spice Girls were back on top of the Christmas chart with their single Goodbye.
"It felt as if they were singing it to me," Geri wrote.
But "without Ginger to hide behind, I wasn't really sure who Geri was any more".

The firm says Clark will join its government affairs and public policy team, which also counts former deputy prime minister Anne McLellan and former foreign minister John Baird as members.
VANCOUVER — Former British Columbia premier Christy Clark is joining the Bennett Jones law firm as a senior adviser in its Vancouver office.
Bennett Jones CEO Hugh MacKinnon says in a statement that Clark's focus on economic growth through trade fits in well with the interests of the firm's clients.
Clark resigned as B.C. premier last summer, having served in the role since 2011, after the provincial New Democrats formed a minority government with the support of the Green party.
Bennett Jones is a Canadian firm with more than 380 lawyers and business advisers in nine offices.

SPEEDWAY, Ind. – Complete with a beer bottle bouquet and patriotic denim outfits, Kristen Mikesell and Kyle Bloomer got married in the Coke Lot ahead of the Indy 500, according to WXIN.
Kristen Mikesell and Kyle Bloomer have spent the past five years being crazy in love. So when they got engaged this year, they knew they weren't going to have a traditional wedding.
At first, it was a joke. But the idea of getting married in the Coke Lot quickly turned into a mission.
“Everyone's gonna remember this," said Kristen.
Both their families and friends go to the race every year. It's inexpensive. And Kyle will soon be re-enlisting so they didn't have a whole lot of time to plan a traditional wedding.
Plus, both are race fans.
"I would say it's not so much the Coke Lot as it is the race. The atmosphere of the race. The memories of being at the race" explained Kyle.
The bride wore a veil, but she swapped a wedding dress for shorts and boots. Her bouquet was in a beer bottle. The groom wore patriotic overall shorts. The groom's father flew in to officiate the wedding.
Whether you think they're nuts or not, it was a day to remember in their already unique love story.
"What's nuts for them is just a great time for us. And a great experience and wonderful memories down the road," said Kyle.

If it wasn't for the minor detail of her age, snowboarding sensation Chloe Kim would've competed at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.
Then 13, she wasn't permitted to participate in Russia - so instead, she did her thing at the X Games, becoming the first athlete in the event's history to win three gold medals before the age of 16.
She followed it up with gold medals in the halfpipe and slopestyle events at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway.
But now, aged 17, she's going for gold at her first Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea.
Here, we provide all the key information on Team USA's brightest rising star.
Who is Chloe Kim?
(Image: Getty Images North America)
Born in America to South Korean parents, Kim grew up in Long Beach, California.
Speaking to Bustle , she said her dad first put her on a snowboard when she was just four-years-old and she credits him with devoting "a lot of his time to making sure I got to my practices".
In PyeongChang, she'll be competing in the halfpipe event in front of Team USA fans as well as her parents' relatives who still live in South Korea.

What is halfpipe?
(Image: Getty Images North America)
In snowboarding, a halfpipe is a semi-circular ditch or purpose-built ramp between 8ft and 22ft deep.
The snowboarder moves from side to side, performing tricks in the air.
And Kim is something of an expert - in 2016, she became the first female athlete to land a back-to-back 1080 spins (six full turns) in a competition.
Is Chloe Kim likely to win a medal?
Despite her age and inexperience, Kim is among the favourites to win gold in the halfpipe event at the Winter Olympics.
Once you've seen her pioneering 1080 spin feat, you probably won't bet against her.

Equality charities are celebrating after gay marriage was finally legalised on the Channel Island of Jersey.
Politicians voted to pass the new marriage laws on Thursday night by a majority of 42-1.
It followed in the footsteps of other British crown dependencies Guernsey, Alderney and the Isle of Man.
The decision leaves Northern Ireland as the only place within the British Isles yet to approve same-sex wedding ceremonies.
The historic debate was held over two years after equal marriage was originally agreed in principle by States members in the Jersey government but it has since been bogged down in amendments.
But during the sitting, politicians on the Channel Island also voted by 40 votes to 5 to reject a clause, which would have allowed traders to refuse to serve same-sex couples if it was deemed incompatible with their religious beliefs.
The law now has to go to Privy Council for Royal Assent and it is expected same-sex couples will be walking down the aisle in Jersey by this May.
Pressure had been piled on to legislators after more than 5,000 people signed a petition by Jersey LGBT charity Liberate to block the clause.
And speaking after the vote, a Liberate spokesman said: "We live in a democracy and the fact that we are all free to speak is something to be cherished. The debate has been impressive in terms of the number and variety of people it has engaged and in the respect shown by all sides.
"What this proves is that our island is home to diverse groups and communities, who will not always agree on every issue, but that is what makes us stronger.
"It is vital that we can share our views and continue to do so, especially with people we don't agree with, so that we can learn from each other."
(Image: AFP)
The day's debate heard emotional speeches from the island's politicians against the proposed change - many asking why they had the right to approve discrimination against a minority group.
Assistant minister Scott Michael Wickenden said: "What In Christian teaching would prevent a believer partaking in same-sex marriage?
"In modern Christianity this should not be a problem."
Another senator, Philip Ozouf said: "I would ask Members to consider the implications of legalised discrimination.
"Where will this end? This is a slippery slope. We should not go there."
The new law also includes legalising humanist marriage which follows on from a four-year campaign by Humanists UK and its member, States of Jersey Deputy Louise Doublet.
Humanists UK Chief Executive Andrew Copson said after the vote: "We're delighted that Jersey has joined Scotland and Ireland in giving legal recognition to humanist marriages.
"And as humanists have performed same-sex wedding ceremonies for many decades, we can't think of a more fitting occasion than at the same time as same-sex marriages become legal too.

Development of a next-generation Audi Q3 is well underway as our latest spy shots confirm.
The new compact crossover SUV is expected on sale in 2019, as a 2020 model, and so far it doesn't appear that Audi will be pulling any surprises regarding the design.
The vehicle should resemble a scaled down version of the latest Q5 albeit with a more dynamically proportioned body.
The platform residing under said body will be the familiar MQB design used by the Volkswagen Group for compact cars and non-premium mid-size models.
Look for turbocharged inline-4 engines predominantly, though a plug-in hybrid option may be offered at some point. We're also expecting a repeat of the RS Q3 with the same 400-horsepower 2.5-liter turbocharged inline-5 found in the latest RS 3. The good news is that Audi Sport should offer the RS Q3 in the United States this time around.
The redesigned Q3 is just one of at least five new SUVs Audi has in the works. The others are the electric e-tron and e-tron Sportback models, plus the Q4 and Q8 coupe-like offerings. There are also rumors Audi is working on a Q1 subcompact SUV based on its next-generation A1.
NEW YORK — Arizona coach Ariel Prieto and the Diamondbacks have been fined by Major League Baseball for his wearing an Apple Watch in the dugout during the NL wild-card win over Colorado.
MLB announced the discipline Friday, two days after the game.
The commissioner's office said in a statement that it interviewed Prieto and examined his watch and cellphone. It said it "found no evidence that Mr. Prieto used the Apple Watch or cellphone for any purpose in the dugout, nor any baseball-related communication on either device, during Wednesday's game."
Prieto and the team were fined because he violated a regulation, and MLB will donate the fine money to hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico.
CHartered accountant BHP has merged with Sheffield based gvt.
gvt's team will relocate from its Nether Edge office to BHP's Rutland Park headquarters over the coming weeks. BHP now has more than 300 employees across five offices in Sheffield, Leeds, Cleckheaton, Chesterfield and York.
The moves follow the death of of Melanie Viner, gvt's Key Relationship Partner, following a battle with cancer.
Ms Viner joined gvt in 1991 and quickly established a strong reputation in the accountancy industry, becoming the firm's managing partner.
Following her diagnosis, Melanie became passionate about securing gvt's future for its staff and clients and agreed to the completion of the merger shortly before she passed away in November.
Melanie's business partner Mark Goodband has retired from the partnership and after a short hand over period, will pursue other opportunities.
John Warner, managing partner at BHP said: “It was hugely important to Melanie that both gvt's team and the firm's client base would continue to thrive after her death. gvt has always had a strong, well-established team.
“As a result, we were delighted to agree to this merger proposal.
“We are now looking forward to welcoming our new colleagues into our business and continuing to provide gvt's clients with the level of service and expertise that they have come to expect, which will form an important part of Melanie's legacy.”
In the year 2017, it seems like everyone has a side hustle. Riverdale's Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch) is no different. In addition to being the River Vixens' HBIC and Riverdale's resident it girl/arsonist, she's also the Sugar Man.
That's right: Meet Cheryl Blossom, drug lord.
Let's rewind to last season and the revelation that Cheryl's dearly departed dad/brother murderer, Cliff Blossom, wasn't just selling Riverdale's most addictive maple syrup, he was also selling Riverdale's most addictive, well, addictive substances. We never really did find out what kind of drugs they were, but they seemed very druggy. Druglike. Also worth noting: Cliff was a busy guy! Two jobs!
One theory about the motivation behind Jason Blossom's gnarly basement murder is that Cliff felt he just wasn't man enough to run the family business(es). While I don't think that Cheryl was necessarily in cahoots with her skeevy pa, you know what they say: The best man for the job is usually a woman. Enter Cheryl.
Have you noticed that Cheryl seems to be lurking in the background of pretty much every shot this season of Riverdale? It can't just be because gal is a season regular and they have to pay her regardless of how many A-plots she gets. She definitely seems like she's Up To Something.
Southside High teacher Mr. Phillips was revealed to be the drug-running Sugar Man (and subsequently gunned down by the Black Hood while in prison) a few episodes ago, one of the ever-rotating cast of goons to support the Blossom drug empire, but that doesn't mean Jingle Jangle isn't a problem anymore. All it means is that Cheryl lost her guy on the inside at Southside High. Indeed, the fact that the Blossom high-fest didn't end with Cliff's death, and the rise of Jingle Jangle among the town's youths points to Cheryl running the game. She's basically a trend forecaster, in with the kids, and we all know Penelope's been too busy being a burn victim/grieving mother to be disguising narcotics as pixie sticks and finding raves full of doofus football players who are dying for a hit. Do you think Penelope's ever even been invited to a rave? Please, she might get a glove dirty.
Plus, at the recent drag race between the Ghoulies and the Serpents, Cheryl mentioned that she was "born for" the flag girl role. Perhaps because she's been orchestrating Jingle Jangle deals with both gangs (the Ghoulies were the primary dealers, but the Serpents were getting in on the action as well), so she might as well kick off their race to dominance, right?
Not to mention Cheryl's hard creepy behavior as of late around Josie (Ashleigh Murray). This isn't the Blossoms' first rodeo with poisoning and/or dosing women (see also: Polly's daily prenatal downer milkshakes), and it seems pretty clear something's going on with Cheryl and the yowliest Pussycat. What, exactly, is she putting into that tea that she keeps pushing on Josie? And has anyone else noticed that Josie has been losing her voice after she has Cheryl's treats? Plus that attempted back massage — you can dose those "essential oils" that she just so happened to have on hand, you know?
Not to mention, Jingle Jangle's (ridiculous) name has been shortened to "JJ" several times by characters. Recall any other notable JJs in the Riverdale canon? That's right, it's Cheryl's pet name for her bro, Jason. And we never even heard about JJ until AJ (that's After Jason, obviously). In memoriam, I guess.
Cheryl's always been a strategist (also a witch, remember, that doesn't hurt), deploying her River Vixens and cronies when she sees fit. She'll most likely end up at the top of her MBA program in a few years, but for now, it would seem that she's experimentally stirring the ish in Riverdale's teen community and then throwing in extra drugs to fuel the fire and pad her pockets. Thornhill Jr. ain't gonna pay for itself, you know?
Is Cheryl an agent of chaos? Maybe. But she's also one successful entrepreneur.

OWEN SOUND -
Another man who overdosed was brought back with naloxone, this time on the holiday Monday in Chatsworth Township.
Grey County OPP responded to the call at about 1 a.m. at a residence along Highway 10. A 40-year-old Chatsworth Township man was showed no vital signs and officers began cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
He remained unresponsive until naloxone was administered to counteract an opiate overdose. He's expected to make a full recovery, Grey County OPP said in a news release.
It noted OPP officers are equipped with naloxone kits and are trained to use them in an emergency. Bruce and Grey county paramedics carry the drug, city police have naloxone nasal sprays at the police station and city officers will soon carry it with them.
This incident followed last Friday's warning by Owen Sound police about two potentially deadly strains of fentanyl -- one a rusty-red and the other purple -- after one man died and another survived after suspected fentanyl overdoses on June 28.
Insp. Jeff Fluney said Wednesday there haven't been more overdoses in the city since last Thursday. But police would like the public to "stay on alert" about fentanyl because it's so potent.
"We don't know that there's any connection between the arrest that we made and the overdoses. And those drugs can find their way into the community at any time," Fluney noted.
Last Thursday a 41-year-old man died despite receiving naloxone immediately after he collapsed. He was rushed to hospital but lifesaving efforts by paramedics and emergency room staff didn't save him. He'd taken the red suspected fentanyl.
About 10 minutes after this incident, a 29-year-old man recovered from an overdose after receiving naloxone. Police said he'd taken the purple suspected fentanyl.
"We are seeing more of it," Fluney said on Wednesday. "I think drug users are underestimating how powerful it can be and how quickly they can get themselves into danger with overdosing on it."
However, Fluney said police aren't seeing the even more potent carfentanil as much.
Last August, Owen Sound Police Chief Bill Sornberger said that trafficking and illicit use of fentanyl was his single-biggest concern.
Alanna Leffley oversees health data and statistics analysis at the Grey Bruce Health Unit. She noted in an interview overdoses increased markedly last summer.
"We're just starting the summer now. So I hope that our messaging and our partners' messaging and the availability of naloxone and safer practices, that hopefully that will be reduced somehow."
She said Grey-Bruce emergency departments see an average of five opioid overdoses a month, most often caused by accident. But not everyone goes to hospital after overdosing, given the availability of naloxone, she noted.
She's working with local emergency medical responders to capture those data.
Last year, 11 people in Grey-Bruce died from opioid-related causes -- the most since the data were collected back to 2005. In 2016, eight died; in 2015, four died; in 2014, nine died; in 2013, seven died; in 2012, 10 died.
Leffley said data she's seen show doctors are prescribing opioids less in Ontario, including in Grey-Bruce.
City police arrested Tiffany Johnson, 28, of Owen Sound on suspicion of trafficking fentanyl and methamphetamine. Officers found Johnson in possession of $4,900 worth of methamphetamine, $2,200 in fentanyl and over $1,100 in cash proceeds believed to be from the sale of the narcotics, police said in a news release.
Ontario's Good Samaritan Drug Overdose Act provides legal protection for people who call 911 or need help during an overdose, the OPP release noted.

LONDON (AP) - Global stocks rose on the first day of 2017, though trading volumes were thin as many major markets were closed.
Germany's DAX was up 0.8 percent at 11,574 and France's CAC 40 was 0.4 percent higher at 4,883. Italy's FTSE MIB was up 1.5 percent at 18,520, though trading was still suspended in the shares of Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the bank that is due to get a government bailout. Britain's FTSE 100, which closed at a record high on Friday, remained closed.
Markets were buoyed by a report showing the manufacturing sector in the 19-country eurozone grew at the fastest rate in 68 months in December. The so-called purchasing managers' index rose to 54.9 points from 53.7 points in November. Also helping sentiment was a report published Sunday showing that China's manufacturing sector continued to expand in December, though at a slightly slower pace than the month before.
“While the eurozone seems to have ended 2016 on the up in economic terms, we are concerned that GDP growth could be increasingly hampered in 2017 by political uncertainties,” said Howard Archer, global economist at IHS Markit. Those uncertainties include Britain's formal start to talks to leave the European Union and elections in France and the Netherlands, where far right parties that favor leaving the euro are expected to do well.
Trading was slow as many markets were closed. Besides Britain, markets were closed in Japan, China and Hong Kong and were due to remain shut in New York. Of those that did trade in Asia, India's Sensex ended the day 0.1 percent lower at 26,595.45 while South Korea's KOSPI was flat at 2,026.16.
The dollar started 2017 with broad gains in currency markets. It was at 117.30 yen, up from 117.00 the previous day. The euro was trading at $1.0477, from $1.0443.
Trading in several commodities, including crude oil, was closed on Monday.

Jurgen Klopp has been urged to give blundering keeper Loris Karius another chance at Liverpool.
David James understands the pressures of trying to be the Reds' No 1 from his seven years there in the 1990s, and sympathises with Karius after his nightmare evening in the Champions League final loss to Real Madrid last weekend.
James, nicknamed 'Calamity James' back in the day because of his own knack for costly errors, claims the 24-year-old German should not be written off by the Anfield giants because of one bad game and insisted he is still young enough to prove himself.

“Yeah, he's got time on his side for sure,” he said.
“He's a talented goalkeeper. Unfortunately, it was a Champions League final where it didn't quite go right for him.
“If you want to be playing in those games, you have to expect things like this. Playing for Liverpool comes with a tremendous upside, but if there is a downside, then every mistake is going to be amplified more than anyone else's.

“Goalkeeper is a tough position to play at Liverpool.
“I hope Karius is given an opportunity to set the record straight and prove why he was such an important buy. I hope he's able to bounce back and prove what a good goalkeeper he could be.”
James, 47, was in Kiev, and spotted that Karius took a whack on the head minutes before his first mistake gifted Karim Benzema the lead and suspects this might have been a factor.

“I have analysed all the goals and one thing I don't think anyone has picked up on is that three minutes before the first goal, he actually suffered a blow to the head,” said the former England No 1.
“I wonder whether that had any influence on his game because it was literally three minutes beforehand he got smashed and ended up in the back of the goal, but they didn't show that in the replays.
“It can take a while to get over something like that. If that had any influence on it, then that becomes an exceptional circumstance.

“If you analyse the performance as just as a performance and strip away all the external influences — ie, it being a cup final — then as a goalkeeper coach you've got to work out how he can improve.
“I'd like to think there was something which was an influence on the performance — ie, a blow to the head — more than anything else.”
James also defended Karius for fumbling Gareth Bale's long-range effort into the back of the net for Real Madrid's clinching third goal.

“Interestingly, in my analysis, he put his hands up too early and didn't see the ball until the last second and then the ball wasn't where he thought it was,” he said.
“These things happen in training sessions, you hope they don't happen in matches.
“But unfortunately he had the worst person shooting against him in Gareth Bale, who is renowned for hitting wobblers from distance.”

Starsbourg, July 4 - Economy Minister Giovanni Tria has issued an assurance on the euro but the European Commission will have to wait and see on the budget, Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said Wednesday. "In October the countries will send their plans and then we will comment, he said. "Tria assured me of (Italy's) attachment to the euro and the common values in which Italy plays a role," said the commissioner.
Even When Black Unemployment Is At Record Lows, It's Dangerously High
toggle caption Lynne Sladky/ASSOCIATED PRESS
On Tuesday, President Trump painted a rosy picture of the economy during his first State of the Union speech: rising wages, a boom in manufacturing jobs, jobless claims were at their lowest in nearly half a century.
But one of the biggest applause breaks during his survey of the landscape greeted this claim: "Something I'm very proud of — African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded." Cue hoots and hollers and a standing ovation from the members of Congress on the chamber floor.
It was an oddly showy response from the folks in attendance, given how little serious attention is usually paid to black unemployment by members of Congress. Really, who knew they cared so much?
The qualifiers for the president's claims around black joblessness are pretty significant; indeed, they're actually the whole story. Most of the improvement in the jobs figures are part of an ongoing trend that can be attributed to the Fed's management of the economy under Janet Yellen, whom President Trump declined to renominate to run the nation's central bank. And while the black employment numbers were historically low, at the time of Trump's speech, the most recent jobs data put black unemployment at 6.8 percent. If those numbers were the overall national figures, the country would be in or near a recession. Consider that for as far back as the data goes, black unemployment has consistently been around twice the rate of joblessness for white people, in strong economies or sluggish ones. If the broader economy is on solid footing, black unemployment numbers is high. When the nation is a downturn, black employment figures teeter on the catastrophic.
Even the relatively low black unemployment numbers that Trump touted in his State of the Union speech couldn't hold; by the end of the week, new jobs figures showed that black unemployment actually spiked nearly a full point to 7.7 percent. And if black unemployment is never that low, white unemployment is almost never that high, with a notable recent exception of a sustained fallow period between 2009 and 2011 during the Great Recession. (In January, white unemployment fell to 3.3 percent.) Taken together, the January numbers are another example of the precarity of the black economic condition and the extent to which racial disparities in joblessness have calcified into a permanent, structural feature of American life.
"[Politicians] using improvement in the numbers to ignore the disparities, but there's almost no celebration to be had," said Andre Perry, a fellow in the Metropolitan Privacy program at the Brookings Institute. He said that black people were "the sacrificial lambs for full employment," as a desire for aggressive interventions to lower joblessness tends to dry up when the economy is doing better, even as black people are still struggling. And it means that the kinds of policy decisions that get made when the economy is robust — say, raising interest rates — might be good for banks but make it even harder for black borrowers with less family wealth and lower incomes to get loans for homes and businesses. "[Lawmakers] have not demonstrated the stomach to really invest in ways to create inclusive economies," Perry said. "It's still federal investment, but in a gated community kind of way."
And yes, a major part of understanding the employment gap means understanding discrimination, which as we've written before, is a knowable, quantifiable component of the labor market. Even when you control for education, black folks are less likely to be employed and have lower starting salaries than similarly situated white people. When the economy is more robust, that racial gap in employment does shrink, because there's more competition among employers for workers; which is to say that it becomes more costly for employers to discriminate than when jobs are more scarce. But that gap in employment remains, and the gains we do see in black employment tend to be clustered in lower-paying sectors like retail or the gig economy.
There are rural, white communities where unemployment numbers looks like black unemployment numbers, but their employment prospects, too, tend to also be obscured by federal jobs numbers. Conversely, there are communities across the country where black employment and wages actually outpace national averages — they tend to be places that have large, black middle classes due to their proximity to federal jobs, universities, military bases, and the steady private investment that flows around those institutions. Perry said those regions could serve as a template for how to reduce the racial jobs gap — lawmakers in Washington could direct funding and investment to bolster those anchor institutions, while investing in the kind of infrastructure jobs that create jobs and transferable job skills for communities where people are consistently out of work for long stretches of time.
Which brings us back to President Trump. He's never never really explained which specific policies he's championed or enacted that would have lowered the low (but still really high) black unemployment rate for which he's claimed credit. And of course, that's not really the point of him invoking any of this: his boast and Republicans' rapturous applause to it was a way to ding the Democrats (and Trump's black predecessor) for their supposed inaction toward alleviating the plight of black people. All of which is far easier than actually doing something about it.
From: Andrew Kilburn, Alandale Crescent, Garforth, Leeds.
I HAVE travelled from Garforth to Leeds General Infirmary every day for the last nine weeks and have been able to observe the usage of the cycle lane from the A63 to the Woodpecker junction.
In this time I have counted eight users, one of which was cycling in the wrong direction and another who was keeping up with 40mph traffic on the downhill section (passing a bus stop where a mother and toddler were waiting) without slowing down. However, I'm glad to report that on Thursday morning it was being put to full use... by pedestrians! They were taking advantage of the fact that Leeds City Council had de-iced the cycle lane but not the pavement.
Never, in the field of personal transport, has so much been spent by so many on so few.
From: Shaun Kavanagh, Morley.
WE are at a stage where there are too many traffic cameras, but they are in place simply because of irresponsible drivers. If drivers used common sense, instead of flaunting the law, then perhaps there wouldn't be the need for so many.

WITH reference to the street lighting switch-off saga (The Yorkshire Post, December 30),a complete re-think is needed. To save a few thousand pounds is futile when balanced against the public feeling safe. Because of the terrible state of the roads and footpaths due to lack of maintenance, the councils should abandon the switch-offs.
From: Tim Bradshaw, Slaithwaite.
HOW good to hear that councils are saving money by switching off street lights. We have saved the councils thousands of pounds as the lights do not exist where we live.
Perhaps by paying £200 per month to have our dustbins emptied will help to save money that would have been wasted on projects beyond our control.

Many soldiers wounded, Captain among martyrs
Tariq Saeed
Peshawar
The serene valley of Swat where peace was restored after years of bloodshed and militancy through the concerted efforts of the Pakistan Army led security forces, was again hit by terrorism when a suicide blast targeting a military unit left at least eleven soldiers martyred and several others seriously wounded in Tehsil Kabal Saturday. Those martyred and injured include two captains of the Pakistan Army.
According to reports, confirmed by the Inter Services Public Relations, a suicide bomber managed to pierce through the security cordon of an Army Unit in Sharifabad area of Tehsil Kabal some ten kilometers from the Mingora city and blew himself up in the sports area of the unit.
As the explosion wreaked havoc in the vicinity more than a dozen men in uniform received critical injuries. While the security forces cordoned off the area to facilitate the rescue activities, the victims were rushed to Saidu Sharif Hospital where emergency was declared. The medics declared at least eleven soldiers martyred that also included Captain Jehanzeb. Many soldiers were admitted to hospital for treatment. Reports said another Pak Army Captain namely Adeel is among the injured.
“The attacker targeted the sports area of the armed forces' unit situated in the Sharifabad area of the Tehsil Kabal leaving eleven Soldiers martyred and many others seriously wounded”. The ISPR said. Unconfirmed reports said the number of injured crossed well over a dozen people including seven troops.
It was reported that various agencies started probe into the suicide blast. The security forces also kicked off large scale operation in the area to apprehend the culprits.
Peace, it may be recalled, was ultimately restored in Swat, also called Switzerland of Pakistan, after the armed forces carried out a series of military operations against local and foreign terrorists in the scenic valley that was virtually controlled by the Taliban militants under the command of self-styled cleric Mullah Fazlullah alias Mullah Radio during the year 2007-2009.
Operation Rah-e-Haq was thus launched thrice in the valley and Shangla district in 2007, 2008, and 2009 respectively. The army advanced towards Mingora, the main city in the valley after it launched the Swat Operation, also known as Operation Rah-e-Rast, in May 2009 ultimately restoring the state writ in the region.
The Prime Minister, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, has strongly condemned the suicide attack in Swat. In a statement on Saturday, he prayed for eternal peace for martyrs and the early recovery of injured. He also commiserated with the bereaved families.
Abbasi said the coward enemy cannot fight with Pakistan's valiant soldiers and such cowardly acts cannot deter the country's resolve for the elimination of terrorism. Prime Minister said the war against terrorism will continue till the elimination of the last terrorist from Pakistan.
Chairman Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf and Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pervez Khattak have also condemned the blast at Army unit in Swat in strong words. Imran said such kind of cowardly acts cannot weaken the resolve of the security forces and the masses to curb the menace of terrorism at all costs.
The Chief Minister directed the hospital authorities to ensue the best possible treatment to the injured sol-diers. The two leaders also sympathized with the bereaved families and prayed for the early recovery of the injured.
White House Narrows List Of National Security Adviser Candidates To Replace Flynn
Enlarge this image toggle caption Khalil Mazraawi /AFP/Getty Images Khalil Mazraawi /AFP/Getty Images
The White House is narrowing its list of candidates to replace former national security adviser Michael Flynn and has already interviewed former CENTCOM deputy director Robert Harward about the vacancy, according to a senior administration official.
The official said they spoke to Harward last week and again on Monday.
"We've been getting our ducks in a row for a long time," the official said.
The comments indicate that Flynn's exit had been anticipated for some time as controversy swirled around his conversation with the Russian ambassador during the White House transition and his subsequent comments that misled then-Vice President-elect Pence about those conversations.
Trump asked for Flynn's resignation on Monday night, citing an "evolving and eroding level of trust," White House press secretary Sean Spicer said during Tuesday's briefing.
Spicer told reporters Tuesday evening that the administration hopes to announce a replacement by the end of the week. But he cautioned that Trump has not yet made a decision.
Robert Harward is a retired Navy vice-admiral who was the deputy director of the U.S. Central Command under now-Defense Secretary James Mattis during the Obama administration. He served on the National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration. As ABC News notes, Harward was the deputy commander of U.S. Joint Forces Command and led Combined Joint Interagency Task Force 435 in Afghanistan. He also led troops in Afghanistan and Iraq after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
Harward is currently the Chief Executive for Lockheed Martin operations in the United Arab Emirates. He's the son of a Naval officer and grew up in Iran, graduated from the Tehran American School. He speaks Farsi.
Other candidates believed to be under consideration for the job are former CIA director and retired four-star Gen. David Petraeus and Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general who was named the acting national security adviser after Flynn's resignation.
Petraeus would be a controversial choice given the scandal that caused him to resign in 2009 as head of the CIA. He pleaded guilty in 2015 to sharing classified information with his biographer Paula Broadwell, with whom he was having an extramarital affair. Petraeus was given two years probation (which runs through April of this year) and had to pay a $100,000 fine, but he avoided jail time due to a plea deal. Petraeus met with Trump during the transition and was in the mix to be Secretary of State. Before his fall from grace, Petraeus was a widely-respected general who helped lead military US strategies in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Kellogg is a retired three-star Army lieutenant general who was a foreign policy adviser to Trump's campaign. As NPR's Tom Bowman noted, he served in the Vietnam War with 101st Airborne Division and was commander of the 82nd Airborne. Kellogg also served in Iraq as a leader with the Coalition Provisional Authority, the interim government after the fall of Saddam Hussein.
With rookie Matt Renshaw likely to be retained as opening batsman after impressing in his four Tests over the summer, Shaun Marsh is in a battle with his brother and hard-hitting all-rounder Glenn Maxwell for the middle order position.

Higher than average unemployment, low social mobility and a growing homelessness problem - Liverpool is still lagging behind the rest of the UK when it comes to poverty.
According to damning figures shared exclusively with the Mirror by the University of Portsmouth's A Vision of Britain Through Time the city now has record numbers of people out of work and rough sleeping is a growing problem.
The data, which compares the 1931 census with the latest government figures, shows Liverpool has been struggling with high levels of poverty and poor social mobility since Orwell's book The Road to Wigan Pier was published.
(Image: Daily Mirror)
Unemployment
When he visited the city a shocking 20 per cent of men and women were out of work - compared to the 11 per cent England/Wales average.
But while employment prospects across the UK have drastically improved since then, Liverpool hasn't been as lucky.
Official estimates show that the national rate of unemployment for 16-64 year olds today is five per cent.
In Liverpool this stands at seven per cent - one of the highest rates of unemployment in the country.
Homelessness
The number of rough sleepers in the city has risen dramatically too.
Official figures estimate there were at least 21 people sleeping rough in Liverpool on one night at the end of October in 2016.
That's up from 15 people counted at the same time the year before, and seven times as many as the three people counted in 2010 - way higher than the national average.
Social mobility
The city has a much higher working class population than the rest of England and Wales too.
In the 1930s, 43 per cent of workers in Liverpool were in semi-skilled and unskilled manual jobs.
By 2011, that figure had fallen to 32 per cent - much higher than the 24 percent UK average.
It means Liverpool has rocketed into the top 10 per cent most working class areas in the country.
Infant mortality
Infant mortality - also a key indicator of poverty - is another area where Liverpool still faces challenges.
In 1931, 94 out of every 1,000 babies born in Liverpool died before the age of one - much higher than the 66 infant deaths for every 1,000 babies born across England and Wales.
By 2014, death rates for babies under the age of one had plummeted to just six babies in every 1,000 born in England and Wales that year.
The number of infants dying also fell drastically in Liverpool, although rates in the area remain much higher the national average - nine in every 1,000 live births.
Housing
The only thing that has seen a relatively positive change since Orwell's time has been overcrowded housing.
In the 1930s one in four (26 per cent) Liverpudlians were stuck in homes where there more than 1.5 people per room - the standard for measuring overcrowding, way above the 19 per cent national average.
Now just one per cent of people across England and Wales are classed as being in households with more than 1.5 people per room (according to the latest 2011 figures).
Liverpool saw an even more marked improvement with just 0.7 per cent of people living in overcrowded housing in the area.

We are retracing the journey George Orwell made in his book, The Road to Wigan Pier, to tell modern stories of working and unemployed poverty.

Adams Oshiomole, national chairman of the Progressives Congress (APC), says “a former president whose third term agenda was trashed”, has become an unelected adviser to the government of President Muhammadu Buhari.Speaking during the APC south-east mega rally in Owerri, Imo state capital, Oshiomhole said it was the effort of Ken Nnamani, a prominent politician from the south-east, that thwarted the third term “devilish agenda”.Although Oshiomhole did not mention a name, it was clear he was referring to ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo.Nnamani was senate president at the time Obasanjo allegedly tried to extend his tenure.“Those who are writing letters now,who have become unelected adviser, they governed as absolute ruler for almost eight years,” he said.In January, Obasanjo had written a letter to Buhari, asking him not to contest the 2019 presidential election.But Oshiomhole fired back at Obasanjo: “For, eight years, what did they do about second Niger bridge? What did he do? And then he wanted to take us to Mugabe where there is no end of tenure.“But thanks to your son; your own son, my own brother, my own comrade, and I am talking this time of Ken Nnamani, a very proud elder statesman from the south east. He provided leadership for the determination against the road to Zimbabwe.“We must always in moments like this appreciate people for their contribution like this, so that others will be inspired to contribute because history will not forget if he had taken naira or ego and compromised, we won't be here today.“So at any opportunity I have, I want to salute Nnamani and all those who supported determination against the third term devilish agenda.”He also said Buhari would win the 2019 presidential election.“I am happy President Buhari will not change his name to what he is not, to win votes. He will win votes by doing and obeying his conscience, and living up to his oath of office that he is president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria regardless of how people voted,” he said.“And I am happy everything they said is impossible, Buhari is demonstrating that those things are possible. For the very first time, we have seen military generals being brought on trial in advancing the anti corruption war of President Muhammadu Buhari.”
More and more Americans are coming to the realization that we dodged a bullet when Hillary Clinton lost the election. The consequences this country would have faced with the former secretary of state at the helm would have been catastrophic for the entire nation.
Nothing so defined this fact than her latest burst from isolation. She recently sent a Tweet that said only “3-0” that indicated her support for the three-judge panel from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that unanimously ordered a halt to President Trump's executive order on immigrants and ­refugees.
Bypassing the ultra-left view of the press, this is a dangerous moment in our history. Had Clinton won, she would be all for open borders in this country. The very judges that ruled against the president would be her sort of picks for the Supreme Court. Activist judges creating law from the bench in defiance of the Constitution.
In reality, Clinton's Tweet of “3-0” can be construed by those that voted against her as special thanks to the three states that made Trump's victory possible with their 46 electoral votes: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
Here the country is, almost four weeks into the Trump presidency. It is non-stop court rulings, demonstrations, and politicians' photo ops as they begin their 2020 presidential runs and congressional obstructionists on virtually all of Trump's cabinet appointments. The left is illustrating why the country was saved by the miracle of Trump. It has meant an end to Dramatic overreach of an arrogant government that now must face a major correction kicking and screaming.
The hysterical, hateful reaction from the left is absolute proof that the ruling elite must be put in their place. The establishment has been drunk with power, political and cultural. Like a small child, they will never admit they are wrong about anything. Their message resonates as one of entitlement.
They claim to be the party of “inclusiveness,” but in reality they are the most intolerant among us. Case example: Their treatment of African-American Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) who has been inundated with hate mail. A black conservative and Republican, Scott supported the confirmation of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) on the floor of the Senate.
What was the reaction from the left? He was called a “house Negro,” “a disgrace to the black race” and an “Uncle Tom,” among other vile epithets that included the ­N-word, according to Scott. He said, “I just wish that my friends who call themselves liberals would want tolerance for all Americans, including conservative Americans.”
Another example is the recently confirmed secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. Black Lives Matter protesters and teachers-union members blocked her entry into a Washington, DC, public school. Mind you, a public school. There are no rules of law for this sort of hate-mongers and the media has two sets of rules for this hatred and what they perceive is hatred from the despised right.
Hillary's presidency would have continued the stranglehold of America by the contemptuous tenured radicals, college snowflakes and the Democratic media hatred openly held for those who don't share their worldview. It is all now being dismantled day by day. Modern liberals' contempt for others is essential to their sense of superiority and they think it justifies violence in the streets, threats and simple rudeness. Contempt for others lets mayors think they can disobey immigration laws and judges think there is no law but theirs.
It is all changing so quickly. The liberals' hatred of Trump overshadows any concern for ­national security. The calls of “Let them all in” should alarm any thinking American. Why is it the left is so anxious to open wide the borders of our country? How can judges hold a one-hour hearing over the telephone and reach a decision on the Constitution and laws that give the president wide authority to ­decide whether the entry of “any class of alien“ that would harm the United States?
Their ruling is a milestone in the early presidency of Donald Trump. It is a sobering lesson about the difficult road ahead. Nothing can be taken for granted and every inch of progress will require intense preparation and a willingness to battle on multiple fronts.
Trump is a man used to the intense hatred of the left. It is unprecedented in modern times. But it harms America itself more than anything else. It will all be worth it if this man can hang on and finish the revolution he started.

An Ida man has been charged with abusing a 9-month-old girl who has died from her injuries, the Monroe County Sheriff's Office said Monday.
The suspected abuse was reported Saturday. The victim, identified as Kingsley Elizabeth Schwartz, succumbed to her injuries Monday afternoon at ProMedica Toledo Hospital, sheriff's officials reported.
An autopsy to determine cause and manner of death is scheduled at the Lucas County Coroner's Office in Toledo, Ohio.
Earlier Monday, Justin Charles Davis, 32, was arraigned in 1st District Court on first-degree child abuse charges stemming from the incident.
He remains jailed on a $500,000 bond, authorities said.

Happy Holidays From Major League Baseball!
Click to enlarge
Hectic afternoon yesterday, as MLB unveiled all of its holiday and All-Star uniforms. Here's the short version:
• The holiday unis will be worn for the full two-, three-, and four-day weekends of their respective holidays. That means two days of pink, two days of blue, three days of olive (but very little camouflage this year, thankfully), and a whopping four days of stars and stripes.
• The Mother's and Father's Day uniforms are very similar to last year's. Independence Day is fairly similar as well, although the caps have high-tech chrome logos. As noted above, they've dialed back the camo for Memorial Day.
• All-Star jerseys will now include a sleeve patch indicating how many times the player has been an All-Star. The caps have very nice heathered crowns.
• This year's Home Run Derby jerseys (or All-Star BP jerseys, or whatever you prefer to call them) are pretty nice, and the caps are made from some sort of newfangled lightweight material. Sorry, I just can't bring myself to care about that.
• Lots of new sock designs to go with all of these uniforms. Let's just say that none of them were designed to fade into the background.
If you want to know more — and you probably do — I strongly recommend checking out this SportsLogos.net piece, which has excellent info and visuals. Chris had an exclusive on this one, so he had lots of time to prepare everything in advance, and he really hit it out of the park. In terms of basic information, I don't think there's anything I can add that he hasn't covered there.
As for my opinions on all this:
• Extending the designs over multiple days is, obviously, ridiculous. Fits in with MLB's (or the sports world's, or America's) basic credo that anything worth doing is worth overdoing. And these uniforms weren't really worth doing in the first place. But this is clearly where MLB is headed in the Rob Manfred era, and that's that.
• Not much to say about the Ma's/Pa's Day uniforms that wasn't said last year. Minor changes, but nothing significant. Oh, but there's this: The Yankees will be retiring Derek Jeter's number on Ma's Day. Seems very odd that they'll be wearing pink-trimmed unis on that day of all days, no?
• Nice to see them pulling back on the camouflage. And this year's Memorial Day jerseys and caps include five black stars — why, you'd almost get the idea that they think this holiday is for mourning the fallen instead of glorifying the active! I'd still prefer to see just a simple black armband, but this year's design counts as progress, even if it's only baby steps.
• Not a fan of the chrome Independence Day cap logos. Seems like a given that some team(s) will be chosen as the guinea pig(s) to try this style as a regular season alternate cap in the near future. Here's hoping that team isn't the one I root for.
• This year's All-Star Game caps are easily the best they've done since they started creating new cap designs for the event. If I were the kind of person who bought MLB caps — well, I still wouldn't buy one of these, because I don't like the star-shaped grommets, but you get the idea.
• The “Look how many All-Star Games I've been in!” patch seems like something that would be better on the BP jerseys, not the game jerseys, but whatever — not a big deal either way. (The bigger question is how long they'll wait before coming out with dedicated All-Star Game uniforms like the other leagues, which seems inevitable in the current climate.)
• Last year all of the teams' sleeve patches changed colors depending on the holiday, except for Wahoo, who stayed red, for obvious reasons. This year they're avoiding that problem altogether by giving the Cleveland holiday uniforms a block-C sleeve patch. This is the latest in a series of exceptions that have been carved out for Wahoo. All the other teams' fans can dress up as the team mascot or paint their faces — except Cleveland fans. Every other team's sleeve patch can get a stars/stripes treatment — except Cleveland's sleeve patch. And so on. When you keep having to carve out these kinds of exceptions for a logo — or, to put it another way, when your words keep saying that the logo is okay but your actions keep saying otherwise — it's a sign that the logo has outlived its usefulness and needs to go.
That about covers it. Again, for more info, SportsLogos.net has the goods on this one.

Storytime: The Timberwolves unveiled their new logo last night (shown at right; click to enlarge). As you may recall, yesterday we were promised that the design would be full of “stories.” And sure enough, now that we've seen the logo, there are many stories at work here. For example:
Story No. 1: Once upon a time, there was a team that wanted a new logo. There was a lot of hype and buildup, which got people thinking that maybe the team would give itself a serious makeover. But in the end the team decided that all it needed was an update to its secondary logo:
Story No. 2: Once upon a time there was a basketball team that decided to update its logo. But due to some wondrous sorcery, the basketball team ended up with a design very similar to one that's already used by a hockey team:
Story No. 3: Once upon a time there was a basketball team that decided to update its team colors. In yet another feat of sorcery — surely the work of a wizard! — the basketball team's new colors ended up being very close to the colors used by a football team:
But everyone attending last night's game was given a free T-shirt with the new logo, so they all lived happily ever after.
———
And so on. Given how ho-hum the logo is, the overhyped press release sounds even sillier than usual. Key quote:
The logo includes a wolf head shown howling, the act of which is the glue that keeps wolf packs together. A wolf howl is used to warn outsiders to stay away, to communicate with the pack, or as a rally cry to reinforce bonds with family.
And there's more:
The open mouth with the teeth showing represents the fierce energy of not just one Wolf, but a collective unit. To show aggression and fearlessness to the future. The green of the eyes is a nod to the green that surrounds the state whether that be through Northern Lights, reflection of ice crystals in the winter or the flourishing of buds of trees in the spring.
Uh, right. Because none of the other 49 states have tree buds (or grass, or any other green vegetation). On the plus side, the Timberwolves have created a nifty interactive page to introduce the new look. These snappy web packages have become a standard thing for NBA teams with new logos and/or uniforms, and they're really terrific. Good for the league, and here's hoping the other leagues take notice and follow suit.
New uniforms and a new court design will follow this summer.

The Ticker
By Alex Hider
Baseball News : The Blue Jays debuted new batting helmets with a white front panel last night. They're reminiscent of what the team used to wear in the '80s and '90s, however, the panel isn't tapered to the visor like the old ones. … The Indians' stated plan to wear the red block-C cap with their navy jersey at home this season didn't even last one game. Shortly before yesterday's home opener, they announced that they'd be wearing the block-C cap — and then promptly took the field wearing their Wahoo caps. Not surprising that they went with Wahoo (players received AL Championship rings yesterday, and the team wore Wahoo caps with navy jerseys throughout the playoffs), but strange they would tweet the wrong combo. … The Cardinals are auctioning off that ball that got stuck to Yadier Molina's chest protector last week (from Mike). … Yoenis Céspedes became the first Met to wear the team's new skyline sock design last night. And given that he hit three home runs, expect to see more of that look. … Speaking of the Mets, they usually let the starter pick the team's jersey combo for the day. Matt Harvey has been known to prefer blue alts, but the Mets wore grey during his start last night (from Tezza). … Spotted in Chicago: a White Sox street sweeper (from Anthony Nuccio). … Here's a video about the #PonleAcento movement that has resulted in a number of Latin players adding accent marks to their NOBs (from Mauricio Davila). … North Carolina has added 3D batting helmet logos (from James Gilbert). … Speaking of the Heels, they went color-on-color against South Carolina last night (also from James Gilbert). … A fan at last night's Mets/Phils game was wearing an interesting Phillies/Flyers mash-up T-shirt (from John M).
Football News : Here's some more evidence that the Saints will be ditching the collar horns next season (from Pipes Guice). …University of Phoenix Stadium, home of the Cardinals, will likely be getting a new name soon (from Brinke). … Mark Sanchez will wear No. 6 for the Bears — the number previously worn by Jay Cutler (thanks Mike). … That Steeler's poster Brinke featured in yesterday's installment of Collector's Corner featured logos on both sides of the helmet (from Brice Wallace). … New field design for Colorado State (from James Gilbert). … New logos for Rice. They'll also continue to use the Old English R. … New lids for Indiana Wesleyan, an NAIA school (from friend of the site Seth Austin).
Hockey News : The “Montreal” sign on the city's Trudeau Airport has been rendered in Canadiens colors for the playoffs (thanks Mike). … The Rangers have an official “locker room T-shirt” for the playoffs. Note the signature block shadow (from The Goal Net).
NBA News : Tony Romo made a visit to the Dallas Mavericks yesterday — in full uniform. That led to an amusing Rondo/Romo situation. … Steph Curry's jersey is the NBA's top-seller for the second straight season (from Phil). … The site of the original Ben's Chili Bowl in DC has been given a Wizards-themed makeover. Note that the mural shows the Wizards players wearing their stars/stripes uniforms, which the team will be wearing throughout the playoffs.
Soccer News : Interesting bit of history sent along by Denis Hurley: Throughout 1986 World Cup qualifying, players for the Republic of Ireland ended up wearing nine different jerseys in eight games. Irish players wore more than one style of jersey in at least one match.
MORIOKA, Japan — Simone Bolelli and Fabio Fognini defeated Ben McLachlan and Yasutaka Uchiyama in Saturday's doubles as Italy took a 2-1 lead over Japan in the first round of the Davis Cup.
After splitting Friday's opening singles, Italy gained the advantage after a 7-5, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (3), 7-5 doubles victory.
The winning country advances to the quarterfinals while the loser will have to win a playoff to remain in next year's World Group.
Japan must now win both Sunday's reverse singles to advance and end a three-year drought that includes losses to Canada, Britain and France.

BOSTON -- The hits keep on coming for the Boston Bruins.
Just prior to Monday's home matchup against the the Columbus Blue Jackets, the Bruins announced that forward Rick Nash will not play due to an upper-body injury. He is considered day to day going forward.
Nash, acquired on Feb. 25 in a deal with the Rangers, has primarily skated on Boston's second line with David Krejci -- tallying six points (three goals, three assists) over 11 games with the Bruins.
With Nash out, rookie Ryan Donato will make his NHL debut Monday on the wing with Krejci -- with Danton Heinen serving as the other winger.
In a corresponding move, the Bruins recalled forward Anton Blidh up from Providence on an emergency basis.
The 23-year-old winger has skated in 59 games with the P-Bruins this year, scoring nine goals and adding 13 assists while posting a plus-nine rating. Blidh appeared in 19 games with Boston last season, tallying a goal and an assist.
Nash is just the latest Bruins skater to go down with an injury, with the veteran joining a growing list of sidelined Boston players that include Patrice Bergeron, Zdeno Chara, Charlie McAvoy, David Backes and Jake DeBrusk.
Seven suspects were arrested by police at the Kliptown Bagdad flea market on Friday for being in possession of suspected stolen property belonging to the City of Johannesburg.
The suspects will appear in the Kliptown Magistrate's Court on Monday.
Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba said that a concerned Joburg citizen had contacted the city's Group Forensic and Investigation Service (GFIS) Department on Friday morning and informed the team about a group of people who stripped off building material from the vacant Kliptown RDP houses in Soweto.
“A team was immediately dispatched to Kliptown Bagdad flea market and it was confirmed that the building material was stripped off the RDP houses. The material was then being sold to the public in the market. When the suspects were questioned about where they got the building material from‚ they became violent and threatened the team‚” Mashaba said.
“An operation was then set up by GFIS‚ the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) and SAPS. The flea market was raided and building material belonging to the City was confiscated by JMPD.
“Not very far from the flea market is the Soweto Country Club where thieves stole 12 panels of clear view fence in December last year. On Friday‚ we arrested one suspect who is allegedly involved in the theft of the fence‚” Mashaba added.
LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — The Kentucky Race Track Chaplaincy has instated a new bilingual chaplain team to serve Spanish-speaking workers.
WAVE-TV reports (http://bit.ly/2oHYtAz) that about 85 percent to 95 percent of those working behind the scenes at Churchill Downs speak Spanish. In addition to leading prayer and preaching in the chapel on the grounds, chaplains will operate a clothing closet and food pantry for workers.
Chaplain Joseph del Rosario says his aim is to help the workers who keep operations running smoothly in any way possible. He also says that representation of women among the workers is growing.
The chaplaincy was founded in 1989 to specifically serve the workers in the barn and training areas.
"I have dogs and they're terribly afraid of storms, so they were on top me all night," said Key, an airport office manager.
Radar showed rain extended as far south as the Gulf Coast, where the storm came ashore at the Florida Panhandle on Monday, to the Great Lakes region.
Forecasters warned the leftovers of the Atlantic hurricane season's first named storm were still capable of causing treacherous flooding as heavy precipitation spreads deeper into the nation's midsection. Flash flood watches and warnings were in effect for parts of several states from Alabama through Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, the Carolinas and Virginia and West Virginia.
In the mountains of western North Carolina, McDowell County Emergency Management deputy director Adrienne Jones said about 200 residents spent the night in three shelters, set up in Marion, Old Fort and Glenwood. She said five minor injuries have been reported during water rescues as creeks and streams overflowed their banks and rock slides closed roads.
Five vehicles were caught in mud on Interstate 40 Tuesday night, but no one was hurt. The main east-west route through North Carolina was closed for several hours, Gov. Cooper said.
Two Department of Transportation workers also survived a close call when their dump truck was swept away by a mudslide in McDowell County while trying to clean debris from an earlier slide. The men were able to climb from the overturned truck and stand on its side in the Catawba River until they were rescued, the governor said.
Authorities in Cuba say Alberto left four people dead there as the storm drenched the island in heavy rain. Interior Minister Julio Cesar Gandarilla said late Tuesday they died as a result of "recklessness" during the storm. He gave no details. The deaths occurred as authorities worked to contain an oil spill in central Cuba's Cienfuegos Bay that followed the flooding of nearby oil refinery.
The big, messy storm caused more than 25,000 power outages in Alabama, many of which were caused by trees rooted in soggy soil falling across utility lines.
"We've had a lot of rain, but we got lucky. It was a constant rain but not a heavy rain," said Regina Myers, emergency management director in Walker County northwest of Birmingham.
Alberto was more of a rainstorm than a wind threat, but the National Weather Service said at least one tornado had been confirmed.
The weather service said its meteorologists confirmed a weak tornado with maximum winds of 85 m.p.h. (147 km/h) hit an area around Cameron, South Carolina, on Monday afternoon. No one was hurt.

Minister of State for Information, Broadcasting and National Heritage, Marriyum Aurangzeb has wished the nation a safe and happy 2017.
She prayed to Allah that he may shower his infinite blessings on the people of Pakistan and bestow upon each of us the wisdom and ability to work towards peace, prosperity and progress of Pakistan.
She said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has driven an agenda that is catapulting Pakistan towards an economic turnaround and making great strides in the areas of energy, infrastructure, health and education.
Terrorism, she said is being thwarted and Pakistan, owing to the brave men and women of the military and armed forces are winning the war against terrorists and extremists.
She hoped that 2017 will be a year, where, whilst respecting our differences, we unite and work towards a prosperous Pakistan.
Monday's planned news conference started late, then was cut short, leaving unanswered questions about the deployment to the UN's most dangerous mission.
Sajjan also confirmed a previously announced plan to deploy one or two military transport aircraft to Entebbe, Uganda, to support UN operations in the region.
Freeland said the Canadian contributions will have a “tangible impact” on the ground.
Confirming plans that have been in the works for months, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland made the announcement Monday on Parliament Hill.
OTTAWA—Canada's military will deploy helicopters and a personnel to Mali as part of the Liberals long-delayed promise to support United Nations peace operations.
The deployment will also include a “number” of troops who will facilitate medical evacuations and provide logistical support for that mission but Sajjan could not say how many will deploy.
“Talks have begun with the United Nations to determine an appropriate deployment date,” he said.
For example, while the deployment is expected to happen later this year, although Sajjan said the exact date has yet to be worked out.
Even the number of helicopters appears up in the air; Sajjan said it will be two Chinook transports and four-armed Griffon choppers to act as escorts. But Gen. Jonathan Vance, the chief of defence staff, said the final number has yet to be determined.
“The number of helicopters is to be confirmed once we conduct a recce (reconnaissance). It is intended to support the mission as a whole in the transport of people, equipment, as well as to support air medical evacuation of any casualties and wounded,” said Vance, who was present at the news conference.
The UN mission in Mali, known as MINUSMA, which includes troops from Burkina Faso, Bangladesh, Niger, Togo and Chad, has been assisting Malian forces with training, logistics, intelligence and co-ordinating operations.
It ranks as the UN's deadliest mission as162 peacekeepers have been killed there, 99 as the result of a “malicious” act.
“We are very aware of the complexities and the difficulties of the situation in Mali. . . . We have been very thoughtful, very prudent in our decision to undertake that mission and we have taken the time necessary to be careful,” Freeland said.
Sajjan said the personnel headed to Mali would have the “appropriate training and more importantly, they have the proper rules of engagement and the mandate to be able to making sure that they can protect themselves.”
Conservative MPs were quick to criticize the announcement for its lack of details around key questions such as the rules of engagement for Canadian personnel and the chain of command.
MP James Bezan, the party's defence critic, said with the possibility of troops being put in harm's way, the deployment should be put to a debate and vote in Parliament.
“Let's be clear: Mali is a war zone. There is no peace to keep,” Bezan told reporters.
He accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of using troops as “political pawns” in his “selfish political ambition” to win Canada a seat on the UN Security Council.
This deployment has been years in the making.
The Liberals pledged in the 2015 election to “recommit” to UN peace operations, in part, by providing specialized capabilities, such as medical teams and engineering support. That promise was followed in August 2016 by a commitment to deploy up to 600 troops and 150 police officers to UN operations.
The Star reported in November, 2016 that, responding to a direct appeal by the United Nations, the government was close to a decision on a Mali mission with a commitment likely to include helicopters.
But the decision was put off. This was blamed, in part, on the surprise election of U.S. President Donald Trump and questions about the direction of U.S. foreign policy.
At a peacekeeping summit last November, Trudeau said the government would take a “smart pledge” approach that will offer training and air support to other nations, boost female troop deployments and target the demobilization of child soldiers.
But he had no details on where or when a deployment would happen.
Poverty isn't a crime in Ontario. But you wouldn't know that from the fact the heartless Safe Streets Act is still on the books almost two decades after it was passed by the former Harris government. The law, passed in a panic about so-called squeegee kids, is aimed at halting “aggressive” panhandling — whatever that is deemed to be under this vaguely worded statute.
A person walks by a panhandler on at Richmond and Simcoe. It's time the Safe Streets Act was repealed. ( David Cooper / Toronto Star )
Not surprisingly, it's not having the intended effect. After all, those who don't have money for food are hardly going to stop asking for donations, no matter how often they are ticketed. Instead, it succeeds only in clogging the courts, draining public coffers, and drowning the homeless in a sea of debt that makes it even harder for them from to get back on their feet. Now a Toronto legal clinic has launched a constitutional challenge to the law in Ontario Superior Court, arguing that the law is discriminatory. After all, the largely middle-class people who aggressively solicit on the streets on behalf of charities are not charged.

It should never have come to this. The law should have been repealed long ago.It will be up to the next provincial government to do so before the the Fair Change Community Legal Clinic spends any more of its meagre resources to fight it. Consider the costs of maintaining the status quo. First, the act punishes the poor. A 2014 study found that between 2000 and 2010, nearly 70,000 tickets were issued in Toronto, each for at least $500, placing a significant financial burden on those who can least afford it. Those who are convicted of a second offence can face jail time, which threatens whatever employment, educational or housing prospects they have. In other words, in a catch-22, it actually prevents them from escaping the poverty that is the root cause of their panhandling. Second, the law is expensive to enforce. It cost the Toronto Police Service about $1 million between 2000 and 2010 to implement. Over that same period the city collected about $8,000 in fines. That doesn't include the cost of enforcing this bad law in the court system. If the next provincial government truly wants to stop panhandling it should put in place social measures to end poverty rather than criminalizing it. The poor deserve help, not persecution and punishment.

Criticism on judiciary should be avoided: Saad
Multan
Railways Minister Khawaja Saad Rafique said on Saturday that criticism on judiciary should be avoided. Addressing a press conference here at Railways Regional office, he said they had great respect for the Supreme Court. The leadership of his party had struggled for the restoration of independent judiciary and underwent imprisonments in this regard, he said and mentioned that he himself underwent imprisonment and was lodged in Bahwalpur and Mianwali Jails.
He said each and every decision of the judiciary should be accepted by everyone. The Minster said that the elements, who approached court for resolving political issues, were responsible for the current political situation in the country. He said that all institutions should have to work in their constitutional domains for the betterment of the country. Replying to a question about upcoming general elections, Khawaja said that an impartial caretaker setup would be made with the consultation of not only opposition leadership but also all political parties having representation in the Parliament.
The impartial caretaker set-up, having confidence in all political parties, would ensure free and fair elections in the country, he added. He claimed that Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) would win the coming general elections on the basis of its performance. As people know very well that which party had delivered and who had done the politics of allegations and lies, he observed. Replying to another question regarding upcoming Senate elections, he said that some elements were trying to take seats more than their quota but PML-N would try to take all its seats as per quota with the help of its like-minded parties.
However, he mentioned, if someone takes seats more than its quota his politics would be exposed on March 4 and ultimately it would badly affect them in the general elections. Responding to a query about privatisation of Pakistan Railways, the minister said the government was not going to privatise Pakistan Railways but some trains would be outsourced to increase the revenue. He said that efforts were being made to increase the salaries of Railway Police employees but there were some budget issues, adding, their demands were genuine as salaries of railway police was comparatively less than other police.—APP

But with ever-changing OSHA requirements, confusion around American National Standards Institute(ANSI) effective dates, and plenty of blah-blah-gobbledygook-speak designed to cast doubt or discredit some testing and compliance programs, it can be downright baffling to keep up.
This special report is designed to change that.

A homeless woman who died after she was found slumped outside an abandoned shop was unable to get immediate help from paramedics because three men threatened them, an inquest heard.
Donna Marie Sharp's life met a tragic end after she mixed a cocktail of drugs and alcohol, and was found in the shop's doorway by her aunt.
A man eating a bag of crisps was sat next to the 32-year-old, and police found drug paraphernalia, including a syringe and a wrapper with the label "Insane Joker", at the scene.
The inquest heard that paramedics trying to treat Ms Sharp were prevented from doing so by three men, the Grimsby Telegraph reports.

Humberside Police were called and arrested three men, one aged 49 years and two aged 36 years, on suspicion of supplying drugs.
A post mortem examination revealed the mother of three died from cardiac respiratory arrest after taking morphone, codeine, diazepam and dihydrocodeine.
She also had a level of alcohol in her system equivalent to being three times the drink drive limit.
Concluding that the death was accidental due to ingestion of a number of drugs and alcohol at the same time, Grimsby and North Lincolnshire assistant coroner, Mark Kendall said, although just 32 years, Ms Sharp had “a long history of addiction to drink and, in later years, to drugs."

He told how she was separated from her parents at the age of 12 years and that had a significant effect on her.
The assistant coroner said the drugs individually were not fatal, but cumulatively, in conjunction with alcohol caused the cardiac failure that led to her death on July 6 last year.
Mr Kendall said she had three children during her life but because of her addiction she lost them all.
He added: “Despite the best efforts of her family, it seems nothing could be done for her. She was assisted by her aunt Michelle Miles to find accommodation, but the attempt was unsuccessful and she agreed to spend the night in a doorway with someone she may have known."
Giving evidence, consultant pathologist Dr Martin Peters said Ms Sharp had been found unconscious in a street in cardiac arrest.

He said: “Threatening behaviour by men in her presence prevented CPR. Police came and they were arrested."
But Ms Miles, who discovered her niece, said she had not seen the men prevent the ambulance crew from treating her.
Ms Sharp's cousin, Kelly Haggerty, told how her cousin grew up on the Grange estate in Grimsby but went to live with her grandmother when she was 12 years old, having separated from her parents.
She told how she started drinking from about the age of 14 years.
Later, while in a relationship she had two children. She had another child later on.
She said: “She was a really good mum. She tried her hardest.
“One day she dropped off her son at a friend's house and did not come back. She lost custody of her children. She was floating about with the wrong type of people."
She added: “She was upset at losing her children. She had her demons and she could not cope."
Ms Miles told the hearing her niece had been evicted from accommodation at The Landings on July 3 because of bad behaviour.
She wept as she told how she tried in vain to find her alternative accommodation with the help of an agency in Kent Street, but she was approached by a man as they left and she went with him after he offered to look after her.

She told how she visited her again around 3.30pm on July 5, which was when she saw her niece slumped.
PC Simon Holmes of Humberside Police told the inquest three men were arrested and drugs were recovered. He confirmed no charges were laid in relation to the events that happened at the property.
The officer told the inquest: “We were trying to find if the three people were involved in the supply of drugs to Donna. But there was no evidence to substantiate that."
He said he was not aware of any difficulties the paramedics may have had getting to the patient.
He listed the drug paraphernalia found at the property, including the herbal drug Insane Joker.
HOTEL and accommodation developments, a cruise liner terminal, an Aboriginal cultural centre, an artificial diving reef, a kid's water park and a new arterial road leading from Howard St to the Jetty Foreshores ...
These are some of the great concepts and suggestions that have already been raised in an online community consultation portal helping to map out the future of the harbour and its surrounds.
After the release of the online portal last month, community drop-in sessions will now be held on Friday and Saturday.
Member for Coffs Harbour Andrew Fraser has today encouraged the community to take advantage of drop-in sessions this week to help people have their say on a new vision for the Coffs Harbour Jetty Foreshore precinct.
"This is all about putting the community at the centre of the decision-making process," Mr Fraser said.
"The face to face drop in sessions will support the current online consultation which we launched in February.
PACIFIC PLAYGROUND: Public consultation on the Jetty Foreshores project has seen great ideas put forward via an online map. ghdcoffs.com
"We've had a great response so far with more than 1700 people visiting the online "Social Pinpoint" consultation platform and the face to face sessions will help to build on the local community's ideas and provide opportunity for even more feedback.
"Ideas and comments from the online consultation, examples of development in other regions, and other information will be on display at the face to face sessions to encourage ideas and allow the community to have further input."
The Face to Face sessions will take place at The Cavanbah Centre, 191 Harbour Drive, Coffs Harbour on Friday 23 March from 3pm to 6pm, and Saturday 24 March, from 10am to 1pm.
"Following the drop-in sessions, ideas will be further discussed and then ranked in community workshops to be held during May 2018. Locals will be able to register their interest in attending the workshops at the drop-in sessions," Mr Fraser said.
Community members are encouraged to continue to have their say about the future of the Jetty Foreshore Precinct using the Social Pinpoint platform at https://ghdcoffs.mysocialpinpoint.com/ideas
The Social Pinpoint platform is the easiest way to share and comment on ideas and will remain open until 9 April 2018. So far more than 1000 comments have been posted on the platform.

The US has formally banned the trade of Venezuela's new state-backed cryptocurrency.
The announcement came after an executive order by the Trump administration that lists the cryptocoins among the items prohibited by a new set of sanctions on the South American country.
"All transactions related to, provision of financing for, and other dealings in, by a United States person or within the United States, any digital currency, digital coin, or digital token, that was issued by, for, or on behalf of the Government of Venezuela on or after January 9, 2018, are prohibited as of the effective date of this order," the executive order reads.
Venezuela announced its own cryptocurrency, the Petro, in February as part of an effort to get around international sanctions and kick-start its economy. Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro claimed at the time that merely announcing the coin raised $735m for the country.
The Petro will see its price linked to the current cost of oil, a move the government hopes would help to stabilize the cryptocurrency and avoid runaway speculation.
Now, before it even gets off the ground, the Petro is going to face a massive hurdle in being excluded from the US market and its cryptocurrency exchanges.
Buying, selling, or trading the Petro is now illegal, though the State Department has been advising against investing in the currency since it was first unveiled in January. The department called it "another attempt to prop up the Maduro regime, while further looting the resources of the Venezuelan people."
The Monday executive order builds on the sanctions against Venezuela the Trump administration rolled out in August. Citing the conduct of the Maduro regime, including its crackdown on protesters, the White House put economic sanctions that, among other measures, suspended US businesses from trading in Venezuela's debt. ®

THOSE familiar with Qatar's history with its neighbors know that finding a solution is easy – unlike what is being said and reported. I will tell you what the solution is in the end of my article. First, however, I will sum up the history of the crisis. It all started at the beginning of the 1990s when the Qatari dispute with Bahrain over islands emerged again. In 1995, the coup in Doha happened and the new emir, Hamad, rejected Saudi Arabia's mediation and insisted to go to the International Court of Justice.
This was in Bahrain's interest as the verdict allowed it to gain control of most of the disputed land. If Qatar accepted the mediation of King Fahd (may he rest in peace) it would have gained more, at least half of the land.
Qatar's government then turned its eyes on Saudi Arabia and renewed its disputes over new border positions after the first dispute was resolved following the mediation of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak as Saudi Arabia gave up to Qatar's demands in 1992. Doha then stirred a new dispute that was settled upon mutual consent in 2001. Qatar then broke its promises and launched inciting battles through its media outlets. It adopted figures who are hostile to Riyadh and supported al-Qaeda and its leader Osama Bin Laden who called for changing the regime in Saudi Arabia by force.
Despite the reconciliations, Doha continued to fund and support opposition groups that want to topple the Saudi and Bahraini governments. Following the Arab Spring revolutions in 2011, Qatar expanded its inciting activity and targeted the UAE by supporting opposition against it. It then focused on Egypt in such an unprecedented and obvious manner vowing to topple the regime of Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi.
There are conditions to restore relations to normal but this time these four countries will not accept the same reconciliation approach adopted in 2013 and 2014 when Qatar signed a vow that consists of around 20 items in Riyadh and only implemented one
Change via democracy: It may seem understandable if Qatar's government itself accepts to change via democracy or force but the problem is that it's the least tolerant Gulf country. It sentenced a Qatari poet to 15 years in prison because of a poem he wrote. In the end, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt said enough is enough and they severed ties with Qatar.
There are conditions to restore relations to normal but this time these four countries will not accept the same reconciliation approach adopted in 2013 and 2014 when Qatar signed a vow that consists of around 20 items in Riyadh and only implemented one.
Truth is, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt can live in peace without any relations with Qatar but it seems that the latter cannot bear the severance of ties. This could be seen from its uproar after last week's statement to cut ties with it was issued.
The question is how would it be possible to solve the problem and how can Qatar exit this dilemma? It wants to continue adopting its old approach by including mediators and making vows and perhaps altering its work but then resuming its attempts to topple the four countries' regimes or incite against them.
In its last Riyadh agreement, Qatar pledged to put an end to the incitement machine. It did in fact have Al-Jazeera channels calm down for the past three years but it secretly established alternative television channels and websites to assume that old task.
Qatar excluded a number of Gulf opposition members from Doha but it had them settle in Turkey and London and funded them and supported them via secret networks they established inside these countries!
While dealing with the current crisis, and as per its same old approach, it sought the help of Kuwait's emir Sheikh Sabah but these countries have learnt the lesson and said they are determined to resume cutting ties with Qatar and living in peace without it, adding that they will work to end everything that's related to it and destroy its internal networks.
Doha has two choices to resolve this crisis: Either fully give in to the demands of the four countries or live in isolation from its surroundings.

Low-cost carrier AirAsia India is offering tickets for as low as ₹1,299 on key routes connecting key cities such as New Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Jaipur and Chennai.
Mumbai: Airlines are offering flash sales and discounted ticket prices during the traditionally lean monsoon season, despite rising oil prices and the falling rupee as they hope to attract more passengers and make as many advance bookings as possible to feed the capacity that has been added by them in the past couple of months.
The Ajay Singh-led no-frills carrier, SpiceJet, on Wednesday said it would offer tickets on domestic routes starting at ₹999 for bookings made between 4 July and 8 July for travel between July and October. Low-cost carrier AirAsia India is offering tickets for as low as ₹1,299 on key routes connecting key cities such as New Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Jaipur and Chennai. The airline is also offering international travel to Kaula Lampur from cities such as Bhubaneswar, Chennai and Hyderabad at fares as low as ₹3,999 and to international destinations such as Bangkok, Phuket, Pattaya and Krabi at ₹4,299.
“As the demand has dropped during the lean monsoon season, airlines are incentivizing people to travel during the season by offering discounts,” said Sharat Dhall, chief operating officer (B2C) of travel portal Yatra.com.
“Despite the rise in fuel prices and fall in rupee (against the dollar), ticket prices this quarter are similar to the same quarter of the previous year,” Dhall said. This, he added, is because of the capacity additions made by Indian airlines.
Indian airlines have added several new planes and leased aircraft to their fleet this year to take advantage of the growth the market has to offer. With about 170 planes in its fleet, market leader IndiGo is preparing to add another 400 or so aircraft, including A320s and ATRs, to its fleet during the next seven-eight years.
SpiceJet would add 107 B737-800s and 50 Bombardier Q400s during the 2018-2023 period. Budget carrier, GoAir, which is yet to take off on overseas routes, would induct 119 A320 aircraft during the period 2018-2022, while AirAsia India would induct 60 planes in the next five years.
India's largest airline by market share, IndiGo, last week offered fares as low as ₹1,200 for domestic bookings till the end of June.
While Jet Airways had slashed domestic fares by up to 25% and international ticket prices by up to 30%. Wadia Group-owned no-frills airline GoAir too offered domestic fares as low as ₹1,199 during a flash sale last week.
“In comparison to 2017, we have observed a spike in bookings to all of these (popular holiday) destinations. This can be attributed to the fact that most airlines are tapping the increase in demand because of the holiday season, by using big discounts and offers to attract travellers,” said Aloke Bajpai, chief executive and co-founder of online travel portal Ixigo.
One of the fastest growing aviation markets, the domestic passenger demand in India is the highest among the major aviation markets, according to the International Air Transport Association. The Indian domestic market grew at 22.9% during the January-March 2018 period, as compared to that of the previous year
‘Valentine' which features the sibling pop group Haim is directed by Paul Thomas Anderson.
“Are we rolling? Sorry, I was waiting for Action.”
So begins the 14-minute music video/short film Valentine, featuring the sibling pop group Haim and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. It's understandable that one of the Haim sisters (Este, Danielle, Alana) is looking for a formal cue for action at the start—this video is, after all, being directed by perhaps the greatest American film-maker of his generation.
Valentine is the opposite of a high-concept video; Anderson simply shoots the band recording Right Now, Something To Tell You and Nothing's Wrong in the studio. Yet, it's executed with the sort of unobtrusive mastery that could make a neophyte weep.
Just as he matched the jittery hand-held camera to the raw sound of Junun, his 2015 music documentary with Jonny Greenwood, Anderson now finds the appropriate visual metaphor for a band recording live. Almost the whole of Right Now is shot in an unbroken take that goes on for over 4 minutes, snaking around the studio as the Haim sisters play various instruments while simultaneously singing lead or back-up (it's thrilling to watch Alana and Este put down guitar and bass and launch into the drums at the end). In Something To Tell You, a similar shot goes on for almost two-and-a-half minutes. The uptempo Nothing's Wrong is more conventionally shot, with short glimpses of each band member. Throughout, the studio glints with a hard blue light that seems intuitively right for Haim's Fleetwood Mac-like pop-rock sound.
Paul Thomas Anderson.
Anderson has been directing music videos intermittently since 1997. In 2016, he collaborated on three lovely bare-bones videos with Radiohead. The year before that, he directed two videos for Joanna Newsom and made Junun, essentially an hour-long music video shot in Rajasthan. He has also collaborated with Fiona Apple (experimenting with slow-motion in Across The Universe), Jon Brion (Here We Go, using out-takes from his film Punch-Drunk Love) and Michael Penn (Try, a complicated single take).
Ad films, shorts, videos: These are useful ways for directors to try out new techniques between film projects. Some start with music videos, and have continued to dabble in the form: Spike Jonze (R.E.M.'s Crush With Eyeliner, Beastie Boys' Sabotage), Michel Gondry (The White Stripes' Fell In Love With A Girl), David Fincher (Madonna's Express Yourself). Gondry and Jonze could conceivably vie for the title of greatest video-turned-feature director. Even they would be hard-pressed, though, to come up with something as effortlessly striking as Valentine.
Valentine can be seen on YouTube.

The PCB has decided to take legal action against the BCCI for not agreeing to play two of Pakistan's home series and not fulfilling the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) they had signed in 2014. The PCB will seek compensation from the Indian board and also confirmed that Pakistan would not tour India next year as scheduled in the FTP because the cycle of bilateral fixtures had to start with Pakistan as hosts.
The last scheduled series between the two countries, in December 2015, was scrapped amid political tensions though the PCB kept the window open to fulfil the commitment. The PCB had offered India the choice of the UAE or Sri Lanka as a venue but India neither agreed to nor denied the proposal.
“Our board has authorised us to take legal action against BCCI for not fulfilling their MoU,” PCB Chairman Shaharyar Khan told reporters after the governing board meeting in Karachi. “They had signed to play six series in eight years, out of which two have already been missed. So now we are preparing a case against them so that we can say clearly that we deserve to be compensated.
“We are also involving the ICC in the case because they were party to our bilateral agreement and they were the witness to our signing. Now it's their responsibility to support us and settle our losses.”
ESPNcricinfo understood that the PCB would send a legal notice to the BCCI and is likely to engage lawyers to pursue the matter in London. The PCB was encouraged to take a legal route only after the ICC recently awarded six points to the Pakistan women's team after the BCCI failed to establish “acceptable reasons” for not participating in the planned bilateral series, which was a part of the ICC Women's Championship.
“We did try to talk to them in meetings but never got a response so our patience ran out,” Najam Sethi, the head of the PCB's executive committee, said at the same press conference. “So in the recent meeting we had intimated them that if it won't go ahead we have no other option but to move on … enough is enough. When I signed the agreement I gave a roughly-estimated figure that these four series are going to fetch us $150-200 million, so we are suffering huge losses.”
According to the PCB, the BCCI had signed an MoU in 2014 to play six series with Pakistan between 2015 and 2023, with the first to be hosted by the PCB at a mutually agreed neutral venue. As has often happened in the past, strained political tensions put the series in doubt. The last full series between the countries, including Tests and ODIs, was when Pakistan toured India in 2007. Since then Pakistan have played only one limited-overs series in India, in 2012-2013, and the teams have only met in multi-nation competitions and ICC tournaments. India's refusal to play has cost the PCB, according to the board's estimate, over $80 million in terms of broadcasting and other commercial deals.
The PCB had agreed to the proposed ICC revamp – pushed through by India, England and Australia in 2014 – on the condition that it would be included in bilateral series against all Full Members, including India, in the new cycle. According to Sethi, the PCB president at that time, the board estimated Rs 30 billion (around $310m) from the bilateral agreements, including four series against India.—Agencies

Danny Welbeck will have no problems dealing with the long, empty hours of a World Cup camp… he once had to spend two months mostly on his backside.
While his England team-mates were heading out to Euro 2016, Welbeck was beginning an eight-month rehabilitation from another serious knee injury.
That is why World Cup 2018 will be all the sweeter for one of the most popular players in the England squad.
“If you get a big injury, it is not easy at all to deal with,” says Welbeck. “At the time, I didn't think it would be that bad but after you've had it checked out and had the surgery, you know you are going to be out for a long time.
(Image: Action Images via Reuters)

“That is pretty hard to take, especially after I'd been out the season before with a knee injury.
“It's difficult. It's a lonely period. You are doing what you love doing. You play football for a reason. I am passionate about it.”
Even by the standards of this smiley squad, Welbeck is an upbeat character and he has managed to take the positives out of his injury struggles.
(Image: Getty)
He recalls: “I couldn't put weight on my leg for two months so I was just sitting around reading books.
“But I read more books then than I did when I was in school - sports mentality books and autobiographies. I read a few autobiographies, not just football. I like the Mike Tyson one. He's a mad man, he's a fighter.”
So is Welbeck a fighter?
(Image: PA)
“I'm not just a fighter, I like to give love as well. I'm a lover too,” he laughs. “But you fight for competition in sports and you kind of see in different athletes and players different mentalities and you take bits from each one.”
Heading to Russia, England will certainly need a positive mentality after the calamities of Brazil four years ago and France 2016.
While Welbeck missed the disaster in France, he is one of only five veterans of England's last World Cup campaign.
(Image: Getty)
“That was a disappointing tournament for us,” he said, with considerable understatement. “But this squad can't be carrying the burden of disappointments and the negative side of things.
“We have such a great, attack-minded squad and the players are going to up their games. We don't want to set any limits on what we can do in this tournament.”
That has become the mantra of this squad, one in which Welbeck, at the age of 27, can consider himself a senior professional.
“We were just chatting about that - me, Youngy and Phil Jones,” he said. “The environment has changed with the new manager and new players, but the squad is very exciting with a lot of talented players in each and every single position.
(Image: AFP/Getty)
“You can see in training how intense it is and how competitive everybody is. We demand a lot from each other as well.”
It is certainly competitive enough for Welbeck not to be considered a favourite to start the opening group match against Tunisia on June 18.
But the Arsenal man, who started two of three games at the ill-fated tournament four years ago, is determined to force his way in.
He says: “I want to be there, competing for a place. I want to make an impact on the pitch.
(Image: PA Wire)
“Obviously, it is a proud moment to be called up for an England squad and it is something that I have done since I was 14 or 15 - been called up – and I still get a buzz, but I don't just want to be picked for the squad.”
One of the books Welbeck particularly enjoyed during his long recovery was the work Relentless , by famed sports psychologist Tim Grover.
Its full title is Relentless: From Good to Great to Unstoppable .
Might be a good idea if Danny lends it to the rest of the squad before the big kick-off.
The scams most likely to catch customers out have been revealed by NatWest as it works to raise awareness of the common tricks used by fraudsters.
The bank said its records show nearly 7,000 customers have become the victims of scams since the start of 2016.
Among these cases, “goods not received” cases – when someone pays for items or services that never turn up – were the most common.
These account for around three in 10 scams carried out against NatWest customers.
Such scams can happen on online auctions and marketplaces, NatWest said.
It said customers can protect themselves by checking the item description carefully and reading the website's dispute resolution policy before buying.
Customers should also use recognised, official payment services and not pay via direct bank transfer off-site, the bank said.
Business customers can also be victims of scams, with invoice fraud carrying the potential to cause cause particularly big losses.
Invoice fraud happens when a business receives an invoice that appears to be from a trusted trading partner but is actually fake.
The fraudster typically says that payment arrangements have changed and that the customer should pay the outstanding balance to the new account, which is operated by the fraudster.
Each business targeted loses, on average, £30,000 to this type of fraud.
The findings were released as NatWest was holding an event in Westminster to highlight fraud.
The company is supporting an initiative from National Trading Standard called Friends Against Scams.
Les Matheson, NatWest chief executive of personal and business banking, said: “We know scammers can be convincing and they work round the clock to persuade their victims to part with money.
“We have hundreds of people working 24/7 to detect and stop fraud, but it's very important that, as individuals and businesses, we know how to protect ourselves.”
What are the top five scams affecting Natwest customers?
1. Goods not received – You pay for goods or services but do not receive them from the seller.
2. Advance fee fraud – Fraudsters ask you for an advance or up-front payments for goods, services and/or financial gains that do not materialise.
3. Spoof payment requests – You receive a fraudulent request, purporting to be from someone senior in a company or a client, for payment or draw down of funds.
4. Invoice fraud – You are tricked into believing an invoice is from a trusted trading partner when it is not. The fraudster will tell you their payment information has changed and you should pay the new account.
5. Holiday scam – You book a holiday, usually online, to find out later that the holiday is not real.

HALIFAX—A weatherman says he got more than he bargained for during a recent trip to a Costco in Halifax after finding a live scorpion in a bag of bananas.
Nathan Coleman, a reporter for The Weather Network, says he was unloading groceries when his 11-year-old daughter spotted something squirming in a plastic bag.
Coleman says he dismissed the rustling until his mother put the bananas away and noticed the scorpion.
He says he double-bagged the arachnid and drove to the Nova Scotia Museum of Natural History, where it has been jarred for observation.
Coleman says a warehouse manager has apologized to him and says Costco is looking into the incident, but he thinks the product should be pulled from the shelves in the interest of safety.

With the Giants' playoff hopes having been extinguished long ago and the Jets all but officially out of the postseason hunt after Sunday's no-show in Denver, the common theme among fans of both teams is virtually identical: Let's get a look at the young quarterbacks.
Giants fans are anxious to see third-round rookie Davis Webb. And with Josh McCown's terrific season over because of a broken hand that will require surgery, the calls grow louder to see 2016 second-round pick Christian Hackenberg.
So what will Steve Spagnuolo and Todd Bowles do?
They will not commit to their untested young quarterbacks, even though only three games remain and both teams are playing only for pride.
Which tells you this: The answers are hiding in plain sight.
Spagnuolo has named Eli Manning his starter against the Eagles on Sunday and has given every indication that Webb's practice reps will be similar to what they've been the entire season. So the rookie out of California will get few, if any, snaps and will continue his apprenticeship, mostly by watching and learning from Manning and Geno Smith.
Spagnuolo's head admittedly is spinning as he navigates the adjustment period of running the defense to running the entire team. He made it sound as if Manning will start the rest of the way. When asked if he is sticking with him, Spagnuolo said Monday, “Absolutely. Yeah, that's a pretty safe assessment.”
Spagnuolo acknowledged that he's still not well versed in the nuances of the Giants' offense, and coordinator Mike Sullivan and quarterbacks coach Frank Cignetti may very well recommend that Webb suit up for the first time. But even before Ben McAdoo was fired last week, he didn't recommend that Webb's practice schedule change when it was decided that the Giants would get a look at what life would be like after Manning.
Subscribe to Sports Now newsletter By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.
McAdoo's eyes told him Webb wasn't ready. There's no shame in that, because not all quarterbacks develop at the same rate. So if a coach doesn't believe a young passer could function adequately in a game, he is under no obligation to play him.
The Bills' Sean McDermott miscalculated fourth-round rookie Nathan Peterman's readiness and started him last month against the Chargers. Peterman threw five interceptions in the first half and had to be replaced by Tyrod Taylor, who never should have been benched.
Is it OK to give Webb some spot duty just to get him acclimated to the speed of the NFL game? Sure. But you also have to trust that the coaches are seeing enough in practice to know whether a quarterback is close to being ready, and that hasn't happened with Webb.
Same situation with the Jets.
Hackenberg didn't get a whiff of game action last year in what amounted to a redshirt freshman NFL season. He was woefully overmatched while with the starters in the 2017 preseason. He wasn't ready then and he's not ready now.
Petty showed an improved grasp of offensive coordinator John Morton's West Coast system as the preseason progressed, and the fact that Bowles said immediately after Sunday's game that Petty now is his No. 1 quarterback tells you that the coaches simply don't believe Hackenberg can run the offense with any reliability.
He undoubtedly has an NFL-caliber arm but is overmatched by NFL defenses and might never become a serviceable player. It will be difficult enough for Bryce Petty to function Sunday at the Superdome against the vastly improved Saints team. Asking Hackenberg to handle that would be like throwing a kid into the deep end before he's learned to swim.
Coaches know when it's time, and Spagnuolo and Bowles are telling you that time is not now for Webb and Hackenberg.

Last week we launched our Bristol and Bath Health and Care Awards in the search to find some of the cities' incredible healthcare heroes.
In 2017, you nominated some truly remarkable people – from nurses and GPs to volunteers and researchers – across all corners of the public and private sectors.
One such person was Dr Dominique Thompson who went on to win Healthcare Professional of the Year at the event.
Up until this year, Dr Thompson was director of the student's health service at the University of Bristol.
As well as her work as an on-campus GP, Dr Thompson has been active in promoting student health and welfare in Bristol for many years.
Her story, which was brought to our attention by former patient Gareth Griffith who nominated her, was one that struck a chord with us, our readers and ultimately our judges.
In short, Dr Thompson's expertise, along with her empathetic stance and listening ear, saved Gareth from doing something irreversible while battling depression at university.
“While I was in Bristol I felt pretty alienated a lot of the time, and she was one of the people who made me feel comfortable thinking of myself as someone who was struggling rather than a traditionally stoic ‘keep calm carry on' type, which almost killed me,” explained Gareth in his nomination.
“She was also one of the first people who made me feel like it wasn't a weakness to ask for help.
“She made some of my issues bearable and understood that the process of recovering from years of feeling so low wasn't instant.
“She encouraged me to get counselling, encouraged me to talk to friends and family about it, and eventually supported my decision to suspend my university studies for a year.”
Thankfully, Gareth's meeting with Dr Thompson kick-started a road to recover which has allowed Gareth to complete his studies and even finish a PhD scrutinising mental health measurement and modelling at-risk groups across the country.
He added: “For me, Dr Thompson normalised mental health experience, and had such an instinctive grasp of the associated guilt and shame that can come with it.
“That guilt and shame and stigma really does hinder our ability to improve as individuals whilst we live with mental illness, and she demystified that a huge amount for me.
“I think beyond those initial meetings where I was a scared student on the verge of suicide, she has become more - a friend.”
2018 has brought a career change for Dr Thompson, although her positive influence on Bristol's mental health services are still very-much felt.
She has now set up Buzz Consulting – a company that offers advice and support to firms wanting to improve their understanding of young mental health issues.

Her work has taken her to schools, where she has spoken to teachers, governors and even parents on caring for generation Z and why we as a society are seeing more cases of young people with mental health issues.
She has also offered workshops to GPs to allow them to better support patients with more complex needs.

Don't forget, if you've received support worth shouting about or care from an incredible team, we want to hear from you. You can nominate anyone from the healthcare sector for an award by visiting http://www.bhealthandcareawards.co.uk/
The government of Thailand has banned all scrap plastic from entering its ports, amid a major increase in shipments to the country and others in Southeast Asia.
According to a June 24 news release, Thailand's Department of Industrial Works “has issued a prohibition on further imports of electronic and plastic waste effective immediately, and will be proposing to the Ministry of Industry to issue an indefinite ban on these imports in the near future.”
There are 26 companies that have been legally permitted to import scrap plastics into the country, but they are now prohibited from any more imports, according to the release. Officials will begin inspecting recycling facilities across the country.
Thailand and a number of other Southeast Asian nations have seen substantially more scrap material flow into its ports this year because of China's disappearance as a downstream destination. Census figures show U.S. exporters shipped 132.8 million pounds of scrap plastic to Thailand in the first four months of 2018, up from 4.6 million pounds shipped during the same period a year earlier.
DeMar DeRozan was never going to be the best three-point shooter in the NBA, nor was he going to be the worst, and the search for whatever middle ground the Toronto Raptors all-star wing will eventually occupy goes on. The prolific scorer, who has increased his three-point attempts and percentages this year as the team moves to more long-range shooting and a varied attack, had fallen on difficult times of late, right after one of the best stretches of his career. And then he got more than untracked on Friday night. Tying his career high with six three-pointers, DeRozan shook off a bit of a scoring lull with a nifty 35-point outing as the Raptors routed the Portland Trail Blazers 130-105 at the Air Canada Centre.

In 10 games before Friday, DeRozan had made just five of 34 three-point attempts, a Pascal Siakam-like 14.7 per cent. That's bad by any stretch of the imagination and a shocking drop-off from his 10 previous games, when he had made 22 of 46 shots from beyond the arc — 47.8 per cent proficiency which, over the course of a season, would put him among the very best distance shooters in the game. The middle ground will certainly come — the 20-game average of 33.7 per cent is passable, if not extraordinary — and DeRozan will undoubtedly end up having the best three-point shooting season of his nine-year career. Friday, everything fell into place.
“Move the ball. We took what they gave us. We were aggressive. We didn't really force much. We got shots that we wanted,” DeRozan said. “It was a combination of all them things — we played well, too.” DeRozan was 11-for-22 from the field overall as Toronto blitzed Portland with a 76-point first half and answered every run the Blazers made. Toronto ended up with a season high of 19 three-pointers from nine different players, none of whom was three-point specialist C.J. Miles, who missed a third straight game with a sore knee. “Make shots, everything's easy,” coach Dwane Casey said. “You make shots, it makes up for a multitude of sins. “That's the difference in the game: vault up and shoot shots with conviction, play with force, play with pace, and we stayed with our triggers and played through our continuity stuff and found the right person. “That's the way you have to play.”

The Raptors defence might not have been at its best — although some credit has to go to an explosive Portland offence – but Toronto was able to score almost at will, especially whenever the Blazers made it look like they were climbing back into the game. “Defensively, I thought we dug in at the right time,” Casey said. “(Damian) Lillard and (C.J.) McCollum is two of the most dynamic guards, along with our guys, in the league. “You know they're not going to stay cold all night. We knew that was coming, and we just had to tighten up some things and make sure we dug in defensively.” Lillard finished with 32 points and McCollum 21, but they were hardly dominant. The Raptors also benefitted from holding off every Portland run early, so that neither Lowry nor DeRozan had to play at all in the fourth quarter. They had logged 35 and 38 minutes, respectively, on Thursday but only played 26 and 30 on Friday. “We've got an early game on Sunday (noon against Memphis). It gives them some time to bounce back from the back-to-back, then we've got Boston coming in here Tuesday,” Casey said. “We've got a string of games here where as much rest as we can get is important. I'm concerned about the early start on Sunday. Gotta get jump-started. That's a key concern.” The bench group, which had been unimpressive Thursday in Washington, rebounded with a solid game as Fred VanVleet had 16 points and Pascal Siakam 13. “I'm really proud of the way the bounced back and played,” Casey said. “We need them. We need their energy, their focus, their attention to detail, their execution, because it's contagious.”

THE word extremism is defined as a belief in and support for ideas that are very far from what most people consider correct or reasonable. In the light of this definition, when a person or a group of persons tries to enforce their ideas about a subject or an event on another person or persons using violence, which is against the existing beliefs, and laws of a society/country, it can be considered as an act of violent extremism or terrorism. Although there are other definitions of extremism also, this definition is the one that can be easily understood. But one has to keep in mind that according to this definition the implied meaning of the world extremism will be different in different societies/countries having different religious and ethnic backgrounds. However, the concern is compounded when violence is used by some person or a group of persons to advance its extremist ideas or ideologies
Since last many years, various forms of the violent extremism have become one of the major causes of prevalent terrorism in this region and other regions of the world. In our region the occurrence of violent extremism started mainly due to instability in Afghanistan prevailing for the last three decades. However, the violent extremism got intensified as a fallout of the war on terror being fought in Afghanistan in the post 9/11 scenario. As a consequence, violent extremism also proliferated in Pakistan, including sectarian violence, that had taken the form of organized terrorism. In fact, Pakistan was the most affected country being a close neighbor to Afghanistan having age old ethnic bonds with that country. Later, India and other hostile forces started sponsoring this terrorism in Pakistan using Afghan soil.
To root out terrorism from its affected areas, particularly the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) near the Afghan border, since last about ten years Pakistan has been fighting this war on terror. The military operations against terrorists, have been remarkably successful and as a result of previous operations and operation Zarb e Azb, supported by the national action plan (NAP), the affected areas have been fully cleared of terrorists, although at a heavy cost of loss of more than 70000 lives, including 6000 military personnel and suffering an economic loss of above $ 100 billion. The military's success story is evident from the fact there has been a 80 % decrease in instances of violent extremism in Pakistan. Now, operation Raddul Fassad is continuing to eliminate any terrorists who cross over from Afghanistan to launch terrorist attacks in Pakistan.
Pakistan military's excellent performance in the war on terror was also well praised during a conference organized by the European Commission in Brussels in November 2017 titled “Building Counter-Narratives to the Violent Extremism: Lessons Learnt from Outside Europe”. The conference was attended by representatives from different EU institutions, media houses and NGOs/ INGOs, including two speakers from Pakistan. The Pakistani speakers amply highlighted the achievements of Pakistan's military in eliminating terrorist networks and defeating their agenda. Although the Pakistan military has done an excellent job in breaking will of the terrorists to fight, but to discourage the tendency of violent extremism and sectarian violence in some sections of the society in Pakistan, a national effort based on a well structured national policy having a comprehensive counter narrative, in line with the beliefs and ground realities of Pakistan is required To formulate and implement an effective national policy, there is a need to keep many important points in focus.
It is necessary that after its successes in the war on terror, Pakistan's soft image at international level should be projected on priority. For this purpose there is a need to advance Pakistan's image projection based on a well structured plan to be implemented by our foreign office and other departments. The effective image projection of Pakistan should be based on its agenda of peace and economic development based on CPEC-related regional connectivity, foreign investment and trade related development of agriculture, industry and tourism industry and interstate relations. To make the national policy more effective it is also important to revise the present education system, under supervision of HEC after consulting educationists and psychologists. In this context madrasas across the country should also be brought under the national education system.
Moreover, to facilitate proper implementation of the national policy all media stakeholders should be bound to abide by the policy. Instead of becoming part of the negative propaganda campaign, the media houses should extensively refute that propaganda and shape the domestic public and international opinion. In this regard, a team comprising of think tanks should be formulated to orchestrate the national policy and all media facets including film industry be channelized under the realm of this policy to contribute positively towards the national cause. As part of the national policy on ending violent extremism, the existing National Action Plan (NAP) should also be implemented in true letter and in spirit.

The BMW M3 and M3 are about to become a little less special as both the sport sedan and coupe will switch from carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) driveshafts to fairly commonplace steel components. BMW says the reason behind the switch involves emission standards and future compliance.
The CFRP driveshafts are wider than steel units and take up more space under the car. BMW plans to add a particulate filter to the exhaust system in the near future and the CFRP driveshafts simply don't mesh with the emissions equipment.
However, BMW assures enthusiasts that the steel units have been developed with M performance attributes in mind while being narrower to make the particulate filters fit. Inevitably, the M3 and M4 will likely gain a few pounds with a shift to steel construction.

It should be noted the change will not affect the BMW M4 CS and BMW M4 GTS, both of which represent more track-focused interpretations of the M4. For those who simply can't put a CS or GTS in their garages, BMW again reassured "the superlative performance and handling qualities" found in the regular M3 and M4 will not change. True, most drivers may not notice a difference, but for some, it may represent a more sour note just in principle.
BMW plans to introduce the steel driveshafts beginning in November. From there on out, all M3 and M4s (aside from the CS and GTS) will be equipped with the steel units. If CFRP is a must, it's best to locate a current example before inventories dry up.

Bangkok — They couldn't award it to Kim Jong-un or Donald Trump; that much was certain.
But the granting of the Nobel Peace Prize to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons opened itself to a clear interpretation across Asia: When it comes to the nuclear-saturated war of words on the Korean Peninsula, attention must be paid and treaties must be signed. And it must be done in a preventative way, at top speed, before something happens that can't be undone.
Looming in the background of the award announcement Friday was the sometimes scalding, sometimes tepid, never silent geopolitical scuffle this year between the young leader of the third-generation Pyongyang regime and the always voluble president of the United States.
Even the Nobel committee's language keyed in on that. It sounded like a plaintive cry to push parties to the negotiating table — to fix something that's already cracked before it's completely, irreversibly shattered.
The head of the group listed an assortment of the world's nuclear nations when she spoke after the win. But it was easy to find significance in the two she mentioned before all others — North Korea and the United States.
And this was the immediate assessment from a Nobel historian: “The panel wants to send a signal to North Korea and the U.S. that they need to go into negotiations.” The prize, Oeivind Stenersen suggested, was also “coded support” of the Iran nuclear deal.
This year's Geneva-based winner, known as ICAN, was cited “for its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition of such weapons.”
From the vantage point of the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding countries, where people shudder weekly at volleys of intemperate words and missile or bomb tests, such a treaty seems a distant dream. And few of the key players seem anywhere near a Nobel Peace Prize.
North Korea just conducted its sixth and by far the largest nuclear test, moving closer to its goal of mounting a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile. It has repeatedly threatened to obliterate the United States from the map.
Such bellicose language from the North is common. It has spent years issuing over-the-top dispatches through its propaganda apparatus promising to destroy the United States.
In recent months, however, Pyongyang's invective has been matched almost blow by blow for the first time by equally aggressive language from Washington under the Trump administration, or at least Trump himself. The U.S. president has shown no hesitation in cutting through the niceties of diplomatic lingo to excoriate the North and threaten to wipe it out of existence.
He has dubbed Kim “Little Rocket Man” and said his regime may not be long for this world. The U.S., of course, has one of the world's largest nuclear arsenals, even after significant reductions since the Cold War. It remains the only nation on the planet to use nuclear weapons during a war.
In the past four weeks alone, Trump has used words like these, in a recent tweet: “Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!”
And Kim, who bestowed upon Trump the rarely used insult “dotard” and pronounced him senile, has used words like these:
“Now that Trump has denied the existence of and insulted me and my country in front of the eyes of the world and made the most ferocious declaration of a war in history that he would destroy (North Korea), we will consider with seriousness exercising of a corresponding, the highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history.”
Public posturing, sure. But not exactly language that points the way toward common ground, either.
The tension in word and deed between Washington and Pyongyang has faded slightly in recent days as the in-the-moment news cycle marches forward, but history shows that to be temporary. Another early-morning missile test, another intemperate remark or worse will put it right back on center stage.
The awarding of the $1.1 million prize to ICAN helps that happen, too, though even the group's executive director, Beatrice Fihn, said she “worried it was a prank at first” when she got the call from the Nobel committee.
Against this backdrop — and in Northeast Asia, a region that remains the only place where nuclear weapons were used against a civilian population during a war — the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in this manner implies one key point.
The influential body, which often uses the prize to set the agenda of where the light gets shone, is saying to Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, among others: We've got our eye on you, and the world needs to look harder, too.

President Donald Trump authorized the release and declassification of a memo written by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) that paints the FBI and Justice Department as being politically biased against him. FBI Director Chris Wray said he had "grave concerns" about the memo's accuracy, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi questioned the accuracy of the memo. But conservatives argue the American people have the right to know if the FBI is working against the president. What do you think?
PERSPECTIVES
The White House has declassified the Nunes memo, allowing for it to be released in full.
The White House says it has declassified a GOP-authored memo on the Russia probe. That clears the way for the House Intelligence Committee to release the document, which is based on classified information and alleges the FBI abused U.S. government surveillance powers in its investigation into Russian election interference.
The Latest: AG Sessions defends deputy amid Trump criticism
Earlier this week, House Republicans voted to release the memo, written by Rep. Devin Nunes, that allegedly paints the FBI and Justice Department as being politically biased against President Trump.
Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee voted Monday to release a memo that paints the FBI and Justice Department as being biased against President Donald Trump... The memo was written by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), and it reportedly frames special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation as an FBI effort to hurt Trump.
Read the full text of the Nunes memo
FBI Director Christopher Wray urged against the release of the memo, stating he had "grave concerns" about its accuracy.
"The F.B.I. was provided a limited opportunity to review this memo the day before the committee voted to release it," the bureau said in a statement, referring to the House Intelligence Committee. "As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy."
And House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan that the memo was likely inaccurate due to reports that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes has altered the memo.
It was revealed that [Rep. Devin Nunes] altered the contents of a reckless, partisan memo released to the White House after it had already been voted on by the Committee and presented to House Members. Chairman Nunes' action is a violation of House rules and is part of a partisan pattern to discredit the investigations into the Trump-Russia scandal. Both the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation have warned against the release of Nunes' memo, stating grave concerns about the accuracy of the memo and its misrepresentation of classified information.
But conservatives argue Democrats and FBI didn't have a good reason for the memo not to be release other than the fact that its contents would make the FBI look bad. As Andrew McCarthy argues in the National Review, if the FBI has nothing bad to hide, why should they care if the memo is released? Shouldn't we want assurance that the FBI is not politically biased?
The point here is to preserve and protect the FBI as an institution, which requires getting to the bottom of any potential effort to exploit the FBI for purposes of electoral politics. Democrats used to think diligent oversight of the FBI's exercise of national-security powers was pretty important.
Democrats have traditionally been in favor of more transparency, especially when it comes to the Justice Department, yet suddenly they are arguing against public accountability of officials if it doesn't fit their interests.
It's almost as if the press cannot get behind public accountability unless it is the New York Times, rather than a congressional committee, deciding what gets published and which government operations warrant careful examination.
Trump and his supporters have argued the FBI and Justice Department are politicized, and now they feel vindicated.
The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. Rank & File are great people! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2018
It's confirmed. The FBI and Department of Justice lied and used the dossier so Hillary could spy on Trump. This is what the Dems didn't want you to know. #FBI #Scandal #SteeleDossier -- John Washington (@JohnWashBlog) February 2, 2018
But others argue the attack on the FBI and DOJ by the president and congressional Republicans is extremely dangerous to our democratic institutions.
The attack on the FBI and Department of Justice is an attack on our safety and security, all to save a cult figure. There are now "Trump Lives Matter" enemies of the state. They will destroy us to save Trump. #MemoDay -- Hayden_C_J (@Hayden_C_J) February 2, 2018
Plus, the memo is deliberately misleading and hardly reliable. It's release proves nothing but threatens our national security.
The #NunesMemo was written and selectively edited by those with a stated agenda of protecting the President above all else, even our national security. -- Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBooker) February 2, 2018

Dallas Voice has compiled responses from North Texas elected officials and candidates, and from GLAAD, to Trump's State of the Union on Monday, Jan. 30. This is not a comprehensive list; it is simply responses sent to the Voice.
From John Duncan
Monday night, President Trump declared in the State of the Union that he and his administration have been “making America great again for all Americans,” and he called for unity in Washington. However, the Trump Administration continues to fail to treat all Americans with dignity and respect or to follow through on any promises of unity.
In his response to the State of the Union on behalf of the Democrats, Rep. Joe Kennedy III declared that America should not be treated as a zero-sum game. As Democrats, we will “choose both” and fight, stand, protest and work for everyone.
I stand in solidarity with the Democrats who steadfastly protested President Trump last night. To the members of the House Democratic Women's Working Group, the Congressional Black Caucus and all others who vowed to hold this president accountable for his words and actions, I say, “Thank you.” The all-black attire, the kente cloth, and the “Recy” and “Time's Up” pins you wore served as important reminders that we must continue to fight for true unity, inclusion and progress.
There is still much work to be done. President Trump's immigration plan supports an expensive and unnecessary border wall and puts strict limits on family reunification. America isn't about building walls between people and separating families.
President Trump claims he “ended the war on beautiful, clean coal,” but he fails to support renewable energy or the reduction of carbon emissions.
To truly unify as a nation that supports all, we must continue to fight for women, minorities, the LGBTQ community, immigrants and all families, workers and patients regardless of their socio-economic status.
John Duncan is a Democratic candidate for the Texas 6th Congressional District.
From Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson
On Transportation/Infrastructure:
Almost an entire year has passed since President Trump first addressed a joint session of Congress. Yet, we are no closer now than we were then to seeing a concrete plan on how the administration plans to shore up our nation's infrastructure. The $1.5 trillion infrastructure package that President Trump alluded to [Monday night] sounds great on its face. However, the devil is always in the details, and there is still no substitute for direct federal spending when it comes to infrastructure, especially when we are talking about helping our rural areas.
In its last report, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) estimates that there is a current infrastructure gap of $1.5 trillion needed by 2025. The U.S. Department of Transportation also estimates that more than $800 billion is needed today just to bring our existing roads and bridges to a state of good repair. This is serious, and our country is exposed to greater risk every single day that we do not act.
The U.S. economy relies heavily on a vast network of infrastructure to move people, goods and services. Without a robust transportation network, we are putting our nation's economy and its people at risk. The time to act is now. This administration owes it to the American people to deliver on his campaign promises to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.
On the Economy:
Now more than ever, we need to be protecting our most vulnerable — particularly communities of color. Our economy should be working for every American, not just a select few. Yet President Trump's only major legislative accomplishment during the first session of Congress was passage of a tax bill that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations. This bill will end up costing the American people at least $1.5 trillion over the next decade, a heavy burden that future generations will be forced to bear for decades to come.
On Immigration:
I am deeply disappointed in the president's tone towards immigrants and the disregard to how they contribute to our nation. President Trump seems to forget that this country's history has been about tearing down walls, not building them up. The fate of 1.8 million young people should not be considered a bargaining chip for the president to use so that he can permanently reconfigure our legal immigration system by eliminating the diversity lottery and family reunification.
President Trump should not use the hopes and dreams of thousands of DACA recipients within my district as a tool to erect an expensive wall. For too long, these young people have only known the United States as their home. Congress must swiftly pass a bill to protect these individuals without damaging our reputation abroad as a place where dreams of a better life can come true.”
On Healthcare:
President Trump signed the Republican Tax bill into law on Dec. 22, 2017. His tax bill is just the beginning of the Republicans' plan to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. The individual health care mandate, which is the primary enforcement mechanism under the ACA for individuals, will be repealed beginning in 2019. As a direct result of this repeal, more than 10 million Americans can reasonably expect to experience increased premiums. Ultimately, this will result in fewer Americans having health care coverage for their families.
Within the next year alone, Medicare will be cut by $25 billion — effectively placing the burden of these tax cuts on the backs of our senior citizens. Sadly, Republicans in Congress and President Trump have demonstrated once again that they are willing to put the interests of a select few [the wealthy] ahead of the greater good of the American people. This bill will have a devastating impact on future generations for decades to come. We must continue to find a way to work with Republicans in a bipartisan manner to come up with real policy solutions to repair the Affordable Care Act and ensure all Americans have access to affordable and effective healthcare.

From Sarah Kate Ellis
Managing to read a pre-written speech off a teleprompter does not make one presidential or lend a single ounce of legitimacy to Trump's anti-LGBTQ agenda. Trump has spent the past year targeting vulnerable communities and surrounding himself with anti-black, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-women and anti-LGBTQ activists with the goal of exacerbating discrimination and erasing LGBTQ Americans from the fabric of this nation.
Sarah Kate Ellis is president and CEO of GLAAD, the world's largest LGBT media advocacy organization.
From Rep. Marc Veasey
The American Dream that the president tried to inspire all families to achieve is undermined by the very policies he so proudly claims as victories. From making Americans less safe on the job to stacking the deck against them to line the pockets of Wall Street and CEOs, he's failed to put hardworking families first. It's hard to believe that the president can stand before Congress and emphasize family values when he's trying to tear apart the families of our nation's DREAMers. I will continue to do everything I can to keep the Trump administration from deporting mothers, fathers, sisters, and brothers from the only country they have ever known and make sure they can continue contributing to our communities.
While I want to remain open-minded that we can reach across the aisle on an issue like infrastructure, any plan that comes before Congress needs to actually put Americans to work. The reality is teleprompter Trump and Twitter Trump have proven to be two different people. The version Democrats want to work with cannot go back on his word or take back the promises he's made tonight to the American people.

It's bad enough that the cost of membership is so high to put your backside into a Porsche. On top of that, for more than a decade, it was extremely hard to do it virtually. After years of exclusivity, Porsche has been unleashed to cross various video game franchises. Now, gamers will be able to pilot their favorite Porsche models in Playstation's "Gran Turismo."
EA held exclusive rights to Porsche vehicles through a licensing deal that lasted the entirety of the 2000s and most of this decade. Occasionally, a Porsche would slip through to various other titles, but the licensing deal meant the closest thing to piloting a digitized Porsche was often via RUF in games outside of "Need For Speed."
With the deal unsealed, Porsche will be one of many marques featured in the highly anticipated "Gran Turismo Sport" title coming later this year. Playstation officially tweeted the news of Porsche's inclusion while confirming beta testing for the game would begin in the U.S.
As for which models will be recreated in pixelized perfection, we've only been guaranteed the 911 GT3 RS thus far. "Gran Turismo Sport" will include 140 cars initially, but gamers should expect Sony and Polyphony Digital to offer up more vehicles through downloadable content.
"Gran Turismo Sport" was originally slated for release in 2016 but has been postponed to "late 2017" for now. Still, the delay hasn't stopped Sony from teasing the majesty of graphical beauty that is "GT Sport" through various trailers and the aforementioned beta that is currently underway. Hopefully, we'll get some official news on when we can expect to dive into the latest game during the annual E3 conference this June.

COLUMBUS, Ga (WRBL) — Some Muscogee County students were injured on December 11th in a bus crash at the intersection of Chalbena Avenue and Josephine Street around 8:15 a.m.
The Muscogee County School District says a van struck the bus that was on its way to East Columbus Magnet Academy.
Some students reported minor injuries. The driver of the van was issued a citation at the scene. Police continue to investigate.

Erin, Wis. — Dustin Johnson wrapped up his final-day practice round for the U.S. Open just as the sky began to rumble and the horn sounded to stop play at Erin Hills.
The timing couldn't have been better for the world's No. 1 player, as it has been the past two weeks.
As much as he hates missing cuts, the Memorial two weeks ago was a good time for Johnson to have a weekend off. It allowed him to spend two days in Wisconsin getting to know the longest course in U.S. Open history, realizing he would be a late arrival to Erin Hills because of some important family matters.
River Jones Johnson, his second son, was born on Monday.
He finds out Thursday whether his game is in shape for Johnson to become the first back-to-back U.S. Open champion in 28 years, but his mood couldn't be better. About the only thing to fear, outside of the thick fescue that frames the fairways at Erin Hills, is the house where he is staying.
It has a double-spiral staircase.
“I sit down when I go down the stairs now,” Johnson said with a smile. “I slide down on my butt.”
Stairs were the only thing that could stop him earlier this year. A winner of three straight tournaments — against the strongest fields of the year — Johnson slipped in his socks going downstairs to move his car in the rain on the eve of the Masters and bruised his back so badly he had to withdraw the next day.
He hasn't won in four starts since then, and his game hasn't looked as sharp as it once did. He concedes he lost some momentum.
Even so, he is the betting favorite at the 117th U.S. Open on a course that would appear to suit his game perfectly, especially with more rain Wednesday afternoon and a forecast for occasional storms on Friday and Saturday. The greens are soft enough that Johnson is getting yardages to the hole, knowing his shots won't bounce away too far.
“I hope they play it all the way back on every hole,” he said. “Why not? It's going to be soft. I hope it's windy. I hope it's long, but it doesn't matter.”
Johnson isn't one to feel much pressure — he doesn't show much, anyway — even playing his first major as the No. 1 player in the world.
If anything, the pressure is on the USGA in how they set up the golf course, and the meteorologist to give an accurate forecast of the wind. There are a few holes at Erin Hills where if the tees are all the way back and the wind shifts into the players, some won't be able to reach the fairway or will face blind shots.
“It's nerve-wracking, honestly, more than most Open sites,” USGA executive director Mike Davis said.
Johnson isn't the only long hitter whom Erin Hills favors. Rory McIlroy, who crushed U.S. Open scoring records on a rain-softened course at Congressional in 2011, was delighted to feel the soft turf under his feet.
Jason Day is starting to turn his game around, finally. Along with his power, Day is an expert with the short game, which should come in handy around the greens that feature shaved slopes instead of dense rough.
Johnson, however, is such an intimidating figure even Curtis Strange is a little nervous.
Strange, who now works for Fox Sports as the on-course analyst, won the 1989 U.S. Open at Oak Hill to become the first player since Ben Hogan (1950-51) to win the U.S. Open in consecutive years. “Move over, Ben,” Strange famously said after his second title.
“I've got to tell you, it's tailor-made for Dustin Johnson,” Strange said after his first look at the course.
The Masters (three times) and the PGA Championship in stroke play (twice, by Tiger Woods) have fewer back-to-back winners than the U.S. Open, but it's the major that has gone the longest without a repeat winner.
The closest call for Strange was in 2005 when defending champion Retief Goosen had a three-shot lead at Pinehurst No. 2. He shot 81 in the final round. Four-time champion Jack Nicklaus never went back-to-back. Neither did Woods.
“You've got to be lucky, have it be the right time,” Strange said. “Dustin is more dominant than anybody who has ever done it back-to-back because of his length and the whole bit. But you still have to do it.”
Johnson starts out with the last two U.S. Open champions, Martin Kaymer and Jordan Spieth. It's a comfortable group, especially with Spieth, a close friend, his partner from the Presidents Cup and his regular pro partner in recent years at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.

ACT UP At 30: Reinvigorated For Trump Fight
Enlarge this image toggle caption The New York Historical Society/Getty Images The New York Historical Society/Getty Images
Donald Trump's presidency is less than three months old, but in that time there have been massive turnouts for the Women's March and for Tax Day protests in cities across the country demanding that Trump release his returns. This coming Saturday, on Earth Day, scores of March for Science protests are expected.
Helping to guide these actions are veteran activists with the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power — better known as ACT UP. Thirty years after the coalition's founding, some seasoned activists are dusting off their bullhorns and updating their direct-action playbooks to tap into the new wave of activism energized by opposition to Trump's policies.
Founded in 1987, ACT UP never settled for trying to push change quietly or behind the scenes.
It was loud, demanding and in-your-face with telegenic direct action, a protest that got serious attention and, occasionally, laughs.
Like the time members engulfed the suburban Virginia home of their nemesis, the late Republican Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, in a giant canvas condom that read "Helms Is Deadlier Than A Virus."
Or when ACT UP members posed as news executives and bum-rushed Dan Rather during a live broadcast of the CBS Evening News at the start of the Gulf War.
Then there was the time they stormed the National Institutes of Health, pushing for changes in AIDS research, funding and clinical trials. Over an NIH foyer, activists unfurled a giant banner with their logo and slogan: Silence=Death.
I'm "the snarky, Machiavellian dude behind the Silence=Death image," New York artist and writer Avram Finkelstein says with a chuckle.
That slogan — black and white with a pink triangle — presaged the formation of the radical AIDS advocacy group ACT UP. The slogan helped change the way the world looked at AIDS. At one point, Silence=Death was the most powerful protest slogan around. It became an iconic backdrop to the group's chant for "ACT UP, FIGHT BACK, FIGHT AIDS!"
Now, at 65, Finkelstein is one of several ACT UP veterans from the 1980s and '90s who today are helping shepherd new protesters, training and strategizing, including the anti-Trump collective Rise and Resist.
"Many people are younger people who work with organizations that were formed by ACT UP. Or were in ACT UP themselves," he says.
He recently led a teach-in on design and imagery for Rise and Resist.
YouTube
"All of the civil disobedience training is being done by the same exact people who did them at ACT UP," Finkelstein says. "So here is this perfect cross-section of this moment. Here is an intergenerational activist organization. And its meetings are in the community center a spitting distance from where the original ACT UP meetings took place."
In January, Rise and Resist took one of its first actions: Scores of members booked brunch reservations at restaurants in several Trump-owned properties including Trump Tower. Over eggs Benedict in the crowded eateries, protesters began to cough and cough some more. The "cough-in" protesters held up signs saying "Trumpcare is making us sick."
"That's the kind of mediagenic sort of action that ACT UP used to needle their opponent," says filmmaker and writer David France, who is behind the book and film How To Survive A Plague. "And Trump is an easy target for needling, and they're working on trying to exploit that weakness of his. The more time he spends in the early morning hours fashioning his tweets in response to perceived slights, the less time he has to advance his agenda."

France and others note that the feeling of total powerlessness in the face of Trump and Republican control of Washington echoes the early days of the AIDS crisis.
"Younger generations, the millennials, and even Gen X and Gen Y, have the sense of never having had power, really," France says. "And it's kind of a learning experience for them to realize that there were times in history when others felt the same, and were yet not dispirited by it but found a way to plow through it and find that power."
ACT UP was certainly not immune to internal fissures and strategic stumbles. Some members broke off into subgroups. But ACT UP remained steadfast in its strategy of being bold, persistent and willing to be unpopular to foster change. It's a template Rise and Resist is trying to emulate, France says.

"I think what they're doing, especially at Rise and Resist, is taking those tactics and strategies and bringing them to the modern era, and making them appropriate for the particular struggles being faced today," he says.
Grass-roots anger at Trump's policies has galvanized protesters on the left, including many new to political action.
While ACT UP is best-known for its direct-action protests, the group's potency came from a clear-eyed strategy and its well-organized committees, says Maxine Wolfe — another veteran gay-rights activist from ACT UP's earliest days who are now involved in Rise and Resist.
ACT UP had committees on health, research, PR, housing and more. They did their homework, Wolfe says, and helped ACT UP create a potent "inside-outside" strategy: demanding a seat of power alongside politicians and Big Pharma while keeping pressure up through creative street protests. The strategy helped turn HIV from a death sentence to a manageable condition.
"We had a women's committee, a people of color committee, the treatment and data committee," Wolfe recalls. "We lobbied peoples, we did civil disobedience. The idea there was that you could use not a huge number of people but a varied playbook," she says. "And [you] would keep coming at it until we won. Which we did."
What's not clear just a few months into Trump's presidency is which tactics and actions by Trump "resisters" will actually have an impact on public opinion and policy. There are sharp tactical disagreements within the inchoate grass-roots opposition to Trump's policies over what might prove most effective and sustainable.
Go with massive rallies or small, direct actions? Focus on urban population centers or the rural and suburban swing areas that helped elect Trump?
There are ongoing Trump boycott efforts such as Grab Your Wallet as well as the get-off-the couch group Run For Something.
"It's the movements that are willing to take risks and willing to do bold action over time that are the most successful," says writer and activist L.A. Kauffman, author of Direct Action: Protest and the Reinvention of American Radicalism.
"Obviously you can't stay in crisis mode and at a fever pitch for year after year," she adds, "but I see a lot of people recognizing that this is the long haul. What the movements are doing together is creating a crisis for the Trump administration, and in so doing, managing to slow down some of the worst of the harm."
While ACT UP's activism centered on an array of complex issues, the central focus of HIV and AIDS was a unifying and organizing force. But anger at Trump is broad, diffuse and across a range of issues from health care to climate change.
"It's a different animal — there's not one single thing to organize against," Wolfe says. "What we need is how to sustain focus. You can't just do one action, let's say, against [senior presidential adviser Steve] Bannon. You have to do many such actions."
"We know now that nominally democratic governments don't have to listen to social protests," says activist and writer Micah White, who helped launch the Occupy Wall Street protests. "You can get 4 million people into the streets and there is no requirement in our Constitution or in our laws that the president has to listen. He's able to say, 'Thanks. Now go home.' And they go home."
White now advocates a rural, Internet-enabled progressive movement where activists get elected to local offices and prove they can govern.
"As social protesters, we need to stop with this naive belief that if we just get more people into the streets, then we'll get what we want. It's not true!" White says.

Finkelstein notes that he did not come up with the Silence=Death logo quickly on the back of a napkin one night over a beer. It was, he says, a deliberative, iterative process with five friends that took about six months to produce.
He is not against big marches like January's massive Women's March in cities across America and the world, or the upcoming Earth Day March for Science.
But his lesson from creating the iconic ACT UP logo: There is tremendous power in smaller actions that can reverberate in unexpected ways.
"If that million people were broken into small groups of four and five, think of the power that could have," Finkelstein says. "Pussy Riot was four people with a boombox, and it totally changed the way we thought about Putin's administration."
Rise and Resist and several other anti-Trump groups are still groping, in these early days, with which tactics might have a real impact with a famously media-savvy mogul turned president, who may be thin-skinned but knows how to punch back.
"A lot of supersmart people that I know are so distracted by the scorching lava flow of Trump's campaign, and now his first days in office, that they seem to be unable to think strategically about it," Finkelstein says. "That surprises me, frankly. The toolbox for doing so is right in front of us."
The Hollywood Foreign Press Association received backlash today after nominating five white men for a Golden Globe award under the Best Director: Motion Picture category. Online critics called out the HFPA for ignoring standout female and black directors who deserved the nod.
Among the snubbed filmmakers were Greta Gerwig, who helmed the witty Lady Bird starring Saoirse Ronan, Patty Jenkins, who directed Wonder Woman (which became the highest-grossing live action film directed by a woman—ever), Dee Rees, who directed the critically-acclaimed Mudbound, and Jordan Peele, who's brainchild Get Out became a modern cult favorite.

Though missing from the prestigious directing category, these films earned nods in other categories. Lady Bird, for example, is in the running for Best Screenplay and Best Motion Picture: Musical or Comedy. Get Out is also a contender in the latter category, and lead actor Daniel Kaluuya earned a Best Actor nomination. Mudbound's Mary J. Blige earned a nomination for Best Supporting Actress.
The lack of women director nominees comes as a disappointment after people have pushed for more diversity—and gender equality—in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against powerful men in Hollywood. The Oscars Academy responded to the scandals by instilling "standards of conduct." Meanwhile the HFPA nominated five well-known white men for Best Director: Guillermo del Toro (The Shape of Water), Martin McDonagh (Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), Christopher Nolan (Dunkirk), Ridley Scott (All The Money in the World), and Steven Spielberg (The Post).
Twitter didn't hold back:
Where is @PattyJenks? Where is Dee Rees? Where is Greta Gerwig? This is a year when women directors are making it to the finish line in awards season, and STILL they can't break through. https://t.co/LvcJWagHEK — Melissa Silverstein (@melsil) December 11, 2017

#GoldenGlobes Film Snubs:
Get Out didn't get nominated for its screenplay.
No women directors got nominated despite an incredible year (Patty Jenkins, Dee Rees, Greta Gerwig).
Only 4 black actors/actresses nominated across the 8 acting categories.
Really no surprise nods. — Ernest Owens (@MrErnestOwens) December 11, 2017
The main thing the Golden Globes give a nominee is visibility. Another reason why it's depressing they went with an all male director category. Few women directors will achieve power of Spielberg, Nolan, Scott without the opportunity to be seen. — Rebecca Keegan (@ThatRebecca) December 11, 2017

Saoirse Ronan, a Best Actress nominee, stood up for her Lady Bird director. "And I think that Greta [Gerwig] should have been nominated for directing," she said in a statement. "As a filmmaker, the work she has done is really extraordinary. The film's nomination that's really her nomination and so well-deserved."

LOS ANGELES (AP) -
Monday, December 11, 2017 at 5:00 am |

As Southern California enters its second week engulfed in flames, fire officials anticipate more growth and danger due to continued strong wind gusts, no rain and decades-old dry vegetation.
A powerful flare-up on the western edge of the largest and most destructive wildfire sent residents fleeing Sunday, as wind-fanned flames ripped down hillsides toward coastal towns northwest of Los Angeles. New evacuations were ordered as the fire sent up an enormous plume near Montecito and Carpinteria, seaside areas in Santa Barbara County.
“The winds are kind of squirrely right now,” said county fire spokesman Mike Eliason. “Some places the smoke is going straight up in the air, and others it's blowing sideways. Depends on what canyon we're in.”
Southern California's gusty Santa Ana winds have long contributed to some of the region's most disastrous wildfires. They blow from inland toward the Pacific Ocean, speeding up as they squeeze through mountain passes and canyons.
Gusts of up to 40 mph (64.3 kmh) are expected through Monday, according to the National Weather Service.
Containment increased Sunday on other major blazes in Los Angeles, Riverside and San Diego counties. Resources from those fires were diverted to the Santa Barbara foothills to combat the 270-square-mile fire that started Dec. 4 in neighboring Ventura County.
As of late Sunday, the Thomas Fire had destroyed 790 structures and damaged 191.
Fires are not typical in Southern California this time of year but can break out when dry vegetation and too little rain combine with the Santa Ana winds. Though the state emerged this spring from a years-long drought, hardly any measurable rain has fallen in the region over the past six months.
“This is the new normal,” Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown warned Saturday after surveying damage from the deadly Ventura fire. The governor and experts said climate change is making wildfires a year-round threat.
High fire risk is expected to last into January.
The air thick with acrid smoke, even residents of areas not under evacuation orders took the opportunity to leave, fearing another shutdown of U.S. 101, a key coastal highway that was closed intermittently last week. Officials handed out masks to residents who stayed behind in Montecito, the wealthy hillside enclave that's home to celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Jeff Bridges and Rob Lowe.
“Our house is under threat of being burned,” Ellen DeGeneres tweeted at midday Sunday. “We just had to evacuate our pets. I'm praying for everyone in our community and thankful to all the incredible firefighters.”
Ojai experienced hazardous levels of smoke at times and officials warned of unhealthy air for large swaths of the region. The South Coast Air Quality Management District urged residents to stay indoors if possible and avoid vigorous outdoor activities.
In San Diego, which is 130 miles to the south, the Lilac Fire was 75 percent contained. The flames erupted suddenly Thursday in the Fallbrook area, known for its avocado groves and horse stables in the rolling hills.
The fire swept through the San Luis Rey Downs training center, where it destroyed more than 100 homes — most of them in a retirement community. Three people were burned trying to escape the fire that continued to smolder Sunday.
Despite the size and number of wildfires burning in the region, there has only been one confirmed death: A 70-year-old woman, who crashed her car on an evacuation route, is attributed to the fire in Santa Paula, a small city where the Thomas Fire began.
Most of last week's fires were in places that burned in the past, including one in the ritzy Los Angeles neighborhood of Bel-Air that burned six homes and another in the city's rugged foothills above the community of Sylmar and in Santa Paula.

Quetta
In the wake of a bomb last in Quetta on Saturday night, Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal has said that it was time for country's political leaders to unite against terrorism instead of going after each other. “In the last four years, the government has broken the backbone of terrorists through military operations,” he said during a press conference in Quetta after chairing a meeting to review the security situation. “Some remaining terrorists are carrying out such cowardly attacks for the mere sake of their existence. However, they too will be wiped out and there won't be such attacks anymore,” he added. “We're in a state of war and need to be united internally. However, some political elements have been trying to weaken the country by creating internal rifts,” the minister remarked. “We have achieved great success through operations Zarb-e-Azb and Radd-ul-Fasaad and rendered many sacrifices for this purpose. It's time that we unite to bring down terrorism instead of dragging each other down.” The interior minister said the enemy was cunning and had clear objectives. “The Centre will work with the provincial governments in the fight against terrorism,” he added. Iqbal said security personnel were on high alert and terrorists were surrounded. “They [terrorists] can't escape and we will bring them to justice.”

Volkswagen Atlas five-passenger concept Enlarge Photo
Volkswagen announced on Monday that it will build a five-passenger SUV based on the Atlas. Volkswagen's press release says the new SUV will be a variant of the seven-passenger Atlas, and it will be be designed and engineered for the American market, just like the current Atlas.
VW didn't say if the new model will also be called Atlas or if it will have a new name.
A concept version of the new model will be shown at the New York auto show later this month, and Volkswagen has released an illustration of that vehicle (see above). The concept seems to just show a shorter version of the current vehicle, though like all design sketches, it has larger wheels and sportier proportions. We also see a more attractive grille that dips down instead of shooting straight across, larger front air intakes, and sleeker roofline that drops down a bit in the rear.
CHECK OUT: 2018 Volkswagen Atlas Review
A shorter, five-passenger Atlas would compete against models like the Ford Edge, Jeep Grand Cherokee, and Nissan Murano instead of the three-row version's Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Nissan Pathfinder, and Ford Explorer rivals.
Like the current Atlas, the new model will be based on the MQB platform that is also used for the current Golf, Passat, and Tiguan.
MQB is a front-wheel-drive-based platform that also offers all-wheel drive. The current Atlas is available with a 2.0-liter turbo-4 rated at 238 horsepower or a 280-hp 3.6-liter V-6. Pricing starts just over $31,000.
The five-passenger SUV will join the seven-passenger Atlas and the Passat as the third model built at VW's Chattanooga, Tennessee, manufacturing plant. Volkswagen will invest $340 million into the facility to build the new model, after investing $900 million to build the Atlas. The Atlas went on sale last year.
No on-sale date has been given for the new five-passenger Atlas.

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — Notre Dame has leaned on its running game to spark a turnaround from a four-win season. Now the 21st-ranked Fighting Irish bring one of the nation's best ground attacks to face a North Carolina run defence that has struggled for stops.
Notre Dame (4-1) enters Saturday's game at UNC ranked second nationally with 20 rushing touchdowns, third in yards per carry (7.14) and seventh in rushing yards per game (301.4). Those numbers are all up significantly from last season, and coach Brian Kelly points to that success as a reason why the Irish has been one of the nation's best red-zone offences, too.
"I think it has a lot to do with the running of the football and then what we're setting up off of the run, more so than trying to take shots on first down in the end zone," Kelly said. "We're staying ahead of the chains there."
Junior running back Josh Adams has led that attack, ranking third nationally by averaging 131.6 yards per game. Quarterback Brandon Wimbush — whose role is in question Saturday due to a foot injury — is second at better than 80 yards per game.
Compare that production to 2016, when Notre Dame averaged just 163.6 yards rushing and had 18 touchdowns on the ground for all last season. The Irish averaged about 31 points per game, roughly 10 points fewer than this season.
"I think as an offence, I think we know we can do more," Adams said. "I think we have guys that want to do more. We're never just satisfied with where we're at. We always want to do better. We always want to improve. I don't think we're even close to being at the level we know we can be at."
Notre Dame could be set for a big afternoon against North Carolina (1-4), which ranks 112th nationally by allowing nearly 222 yards rushing per game. The Tar Heels surrendered 403 yards rushing to Georgia Tech's triple-option attack last week.
"You're going to have to do the best job we can," UNC coach Larry Fedora said. "We're going to have to be very disciplined in our gaps. Our guys are going to have to get off the blocks and our guys are going to have to get multiple hats to the ball. We need to create turnovers and limit their possessions."

Here are some other things to know about Saturday's Notre Dame-UNC game:
WESTPORT, CT (CBS Local) – The family of a 96-year-old in Connecticut has found a hidden treasure trove dedicated to every book the grandmother ever read.
Stefanie Dreyfuss of Westport passed away in mid-May, leaving behind several relatives and in-laws. Her daughter-in-law posted a photo on Twitter of the stunning find in the woman's home. Each book review had been categorized using a completely original code created by Dreyfuss and filed away on hundreds of index cards over the years.
I lost my mother in law last week. She was 96 and one of my best friends. A lifelong lover of books, she kept track of all she read on index cards and recorded her opinion in code. This is the key to her code and the cards we found among her belongings. pic.twitter.com/Iabmek9B7F — Lauren Tarshis (@laurenTarshis) May 26, 2018
Lauren Tarshis' post of the find quickly went viral, with over 18,000 fellow book lovers liking the post and over 2,500 people re-tweeting the image. “She kept track of all she read on index cards and recorded her opinion in code. This is the key to her code and the cards we found among her belongings,” Tarshis tweeted. Tarshis is the author of the New York Times Bestselling series “I Survived“, a fast-paced historical fiction from the perspective of a boy or girl who lived through a historical disaster.
The biggest takeaway from the 96-year-old's coded collection is that she was a very tough grader. The numerous codes included:
RP: Readable Piffle
NFM: Not For Me
G: Good didn't hold my attention
NMS: Not my style
RR: Readable
WOT: Waste of Time
The opinionated reader's daughter-in-law shared another photo a few days later after discovering a second hidden collection. Dreyfuss (who immigrated to the U.S. in 1947) had also saved her favorite quotes over her many decades in America.
Televangelist Jesse Duplantis says God told him he needs a new private jet.
Did we mention, it would be his fourth private jet? And at a cost of around $54 million.
No why would a televangelist need a fourth private jet? Because according to Jesse, he's been burning through jets for the Lord - and if Jesus were alive today he wouldn't be riding a donkey.

It seems only five minutes since the season closed on March 14 yet here we are ready for the start of a brand-new fishing season on rivers right across the country and of course closer to home on our unique Fenland drains.
June 16 is still a magical day in the world of angling as there are still many who don't wet a line during the close season.
So what can we expect this year? With so many venues and so much water to choose from we really are spoilt for choice.
Looking at the River Nene first, it's a little disappointing we haven't had a little more rain to give it a good flush through which in turn would give it colour and flow.
I expect roach to be conspicuous by their absence for the first couple of weeks. That's what usually happens. So many out in the first few days will be targeting skimmers and bream.
At the top of the Peterborough & District AA waters, Stibbington and Water Newton could be worth a try but you could well have better luck at Alwalton and my favourite for a proper net of fish, Orton Downstream.
The bailiffs have put a lot of time and effort in over the past few weeks preparing for the new season below the locks so cutting a new swim out will not be a problem.
The River Welland was once one of the all-time favourites for early-season bream action and might still be, but you will need to pre- bait and make sure the weed is not too bad, particularly in the once hot pegs above Crowland Bridge.
On the Fen drains I expect the Twenty Foot Drain to produce skimmers and bream at Beggars Bridge then further down on the March sections around the old swimming pool down to the bridges.
If you are after tench then the Forty Foot Drain could be well worth a visit, but don't stray too far from the Narrows.
You may have to get there very early though as regulars and locals will be up bright and early to get to the hot pegs.
The North Level Drain could well be the place to head for early season if you are after tench and bream. It rarely fails to produce and if you get it right on the pole or feeder you can expect a great day's sport.
Ferry Meadows will be busy at the weekend. It's not been in great form recently but any time now the bream will be back on the feed with prospects for this weekend very good indeed as the bream and skimmers will have finished spawning.
JVAC
In the JVAC match fished on the Oak Pool at Decoy Lakes it was the middle pegs producing the leading anglers.
Out in front fishing close in with caster and maggot was Jim Wilmot with 126lb 13oz. A close second was Chris Saunders, who fished short with cat meat for 16lb 3oz, followed by Jim Regan on 104lb 9oz.
OVER 55s
The Decoy Over 55s match on the Willows at Decoy saw Mike Mitchell top the list with185lb 2oz from peg one. He caught close in on cat meat.
Deeping rod Ray Torrington came in second on peg 25 with 170lb 11oz, followed by Steve Dorks on 167lb 2oz.
DEEPING ST JAMES
Phil Price won Sunday's Deeping St James' match on the Match Lake at the North View Fishery with 79Ib 7oz.
Fishing to the island he found a small cut out and caught fish regularly all day using maggot over loose fed maggot.
Second was Brian Johnson with 72lb 13oz from peg 14, with Ray Torrington third on 65lb 7oz.
Old City Hall to become Toronto museum, Feb. 2
I like museums, but how many do we need in Toronto? Looking at Wikipedia, I see 76 currently in Toronto, likely all getting tax dollars. I'm sure the rich and untold stories of Toronto could be added somewhere in the existing 76.
The architecture of Old City Hall could be better preserved and more of an attraction as a private interest, with the money from the sale used to better maintain existing attractions.

Residents of the “twin towns” of Malton and Norton in North Yorkshire are being asked to vote on possible measures to ease congestion ahead of an increase in rail traffic at the end of next year.
The level crossing on Castlegate, where the York to Scarborough line passes through the centre of Malton, is partly blamed for the gridlock in the area. The frequency of trains on the line is due to be doubled – meaning crossing barriers could be down for up to ten minutes every hour.
North Yorkshire and Ryedale councils hired consultants to sift through proposals that would ease congestion and also harvest benefits from the extra trains. The most feasible ideas form part of an consultation that goes live on Ryedale's website today.
They include projects to improve the junction with the A64, build a second station platform at Malton and a footbridge over the railway line, and to encourage people to make shorter journeys by foot and bicycle.
Last year, another firm of consultants suggested that drivers should scrap their old cars and swap them for cleaner electric vehicles.
Coun Luke Ives, Ryedale Council's policy chairman, said: “Congestion is already a huge concern for people in Malton and Norton, and the doubling of train services in 2019 means there's potential for the situation to get even worse.
It's clear the road layout around the railway crossing continues to divide opinion, and while there's no straightforward solution, we all agree that much more needs to be done to improve the flow of traffic.
“There are a number of quick wins that could be implemented, such as signalling improvements to reduce barrier downtime.”
Coun Don Mackenzie of the county authority said: “The doubling in frequency of rail services is to be welcomed.
“However, we have to support this alongside measures to mitigate the impact of existing and future congestion on residents and businesses.”
Hervé L. Leroux, creator of the bandage dress and founder of Hervé Leger, has passed away at 60 years old. The Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode announced his death today.
The French fashion designer met Karl Lagerfeld in the early '80s, and worked as his assistant at Fendi and Chanel before launching Hervé Leger in 1985. It was here that he created the bandage dress, a bodycon silhouette that launched his brand into international fame, as models and celebrities sported the design through the '90s and 2000s. A 1993 runway review called the dresses Leroux's "specialty," describing them as as "elastic strips of fabric sewn together to make girdle-tight dresses" and even nicknamed them "the sexy mummy look."

Even with his own label, Leroux still continued to work as a freelance designer for Lanvin and designed accessories for labels like Swarovski, according to his official bio. He also notably designed stage and ballet costumes through the '90s and made ready-to-wear, swimwear and hosiery for Wolford at the end of the decade.
In 1999, BCBG Max Azria acquired the Hervé Leger brand and Leroux lost the commercial rights to his name. However, he continued designing dresses for celebrities like Cate Blanchett, Taylor Swift and Jessica Chastain.
His longtime client Dita Von Teese posted a heartfelt tribute to the designer on Instagram today. "He made the most exquisite dresses that showcased a woman's beauty, rather than distracting from it," she wrote.

The designer opened a new label (with a Parisian boutique) under his own name, Hervé L. Leroux, in 2000. Under this line, the couturier founded a new dress staple, the draped jersey dress—an elegant departure from the skin-tight silhouette of the bandage dress. He entered the couture calendar in 2013.
Jessica Alba was "driven" to succeed by feeling underrepresented.
The 'Sin City: A Dame to Kill For' star decided to go into acting because she wanted to banish the stereotypes faced by women from Latina heritage.
She told the July issue of InStyle magazine: "What drove me was that I felt like I wasn't represented. There were a lot of girls out there who looked like me and weren't represented in pop culture, you know? ... When I started, I was labeled 'exotic.' That was it. It was like you had to be mysterious and sexual. Back in the day, if you were Latina, it was always a stereotype."
And whilst the 37-year-old actress - who has Honor, nine, Haven, six, and Hayes, four months, with her husband Cash Warren - loves to work hard, she recently admitted she is "missing moments" with her children because she's always working.
She said: "I think feeling like you're missing moments, like, well first off, you feel bad when you realise they are wearing shoes that hurt them because you're like, 'Oh, I didn't even realise that you've been wearing shoes that are too small for you for like 3 - 4 months, my bad.' Some of those milestones or moments, you want to be there for every single one and it's not realistic when you're working, but for me, that's what gets me. Even the everyday little things like picking them up from school are a big deal, so I drop them off at school most mornings and try to get home for bedtime. But the weekends is really when I get to spend the time with them."
AGUANGA – A brush fire that broke out today alongside state Route 79 in Aguanga scorched about three acres before crews got it under control.
The non-injury blaze was reported about 11:30 a.m., just east of state Route 371, according to the Riverside County Fire Department.
Crews were able to fully contain the flames within a half-hour. No homes or other structures were damaged.
The cause of the fire was under investigation.

An ex-City of Nanaimo senior manager says he has submitted a human rights complaint against his former employer, claiming that his rights were violated and that he was fired without cause.
Brad McRae, former chief operations officer, told the News Bulletin that he filed a human rights complaint with the B.C. Human Rights Tribunal on Friday morning, accusing the city of violating his human rights by holding a termination hearing without him being present and then firing him without cause.
McRae, who was fired while on medical leave in January, said he's asking the tribunal to declare that his rights were violated and that he should be reinstated as chief operations officer with the city.
“My rights were violated under both the human rights code and the community charter, by the city holding a termination hearing in my absence after I was not cleared medically to attend,” McRae said in a prepared statement.
According to the community charter, as an officer with the city, McRae was permitted to have a hearing in front of city councillors regarding any changes to his employment status and could not be dismissed without at least two-thirds majority vote by councillors. However, McRae was technically not an employee of council, therefore any recommendation calling for his termination would have come from the city manager, who, under the community charter, is considered to be council's only employee.
Following McRae's termination, city chief administrative officer Tracy Samra acknowledged that the COO had been on leave but did not provide any explanation for the decision to fire him. Instead, she told the News Bulletin then that his responsibilities with the city changed to public safety in September 2017, but she elected to to leave his title as chief operations officer.
“I didn't rename his title to director of public safety,” she said.
McRae has hired employment lawyer Fred Wynne, from the Vancouver-based law firm HHBG Lawyers. Wynne could not be reached for comment.
McRae said he cannot provide additional comments about his case against the city other than what he said in his prepared statement, explaining that he was acting on the advice of his lawyer.

LEBANON, Ohio (AP) — An Ohio judge has modified a house arrest order for a former high school cheerleader accused of killing and burying her newborn near her family's home.
Attorneys for 19-year-old Brooke Skylar Richardson previously filed a court motion in Warren County to lift the house arrest restriction. The judge ruled Monday that Richardson will now have a curfew of 9 p.m. through 7 a.m. and will be supervised via GPS monitoring and random home visits.
Richardson is accused of burying her full-term baby last July shortly after giving birth in Carlisle, a village about 40 miles north of Cincinnati. Her defense attorneys argue the infant was stillborn.
The trial was scheduled to begin Monday, but has been delayed while an appeals court rules on a medical testimony dispute.

Shea Patterson will transfer to Michigan, he announced Monday on Twitter.
"Thank you to the wonderful people, teammates and coaches at Ole Miss," Patterson wrote. "It is a special place and I will always have great memories of my experiences in Oxford. I am now excited to announce my commitment to continue my athletic and academic career at The University of Michigan. It's time to go to work."
Patterson, who spent his first two seasons at Ole Miss, visited Michigan over the weekend along with two other potential Ole Miss transfers, Deontay Anderson, a safety, and receiver Van Jefferson.
The three players are exploring transfer options in light of Ole Miss' latest NCAA sanctions that include missing another bowl next season on to of a self-imposed bowl ban this season.
Patterson, the No. 1-rated quarterback in the 2016 class, played in seven games at Ole Miss this fall before suffering a posterior cruciate ligament injury. The 6-foot-2, 203-pound sophomore completed 63.8 percent of his passes for 2,259 yards, 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions.
It is unclear whether Patterson will be immediately eligible to play next season. The NCAA waived the transfer rule for rising seniors at Ole Miss allowing them to play right away, but Patterson will be a junior.

If he is eligible to play, he would begin competing this spring for the starting job with redshirt freshman Brandon Peters and freshman Dylan McCaffrey.
ESPN college football analyst Greg McElroy, the former Alabama quarterback, told The Detroit News last week he thinks Patterson will flourish under Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh.
“This kid is extremely special when it comes to being able to improvise,” McElroy said in a telephone interview Thursday. “One thing I think that has held Michigan back, in today's game, it's hard to expect quarterbacks to operate solely in the offense. Shea's best qualities are creating on his own. Sometimes that gets him in trouble, but for the most part he's an electric player.
“With Jim Harbaugh's leadership and tutelage, he could be a real a star.”

Patterson was born in Toledo, and his grandfather, George Patterson, played for the Detroit Pistons in the 1960s. His family moved to Texas when he was in fifth grade, and then to Louisiana. He completed his high school career at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla. That sounds familiar to Michigan fans for many reasons, considering that's where Harbaugh took the team for the final week of spring practice in 2016, and freshman offensive lineman Cesar Ruiz, the No. 1 center out of high school, was Patterson's center at IMG.
More: Ole Miss transfers would be ‘great addition' for UM
Ruiz hosted Patterson, Anderson and Jefferson during their visit at Michigan over the weekend. Ruiz said it was like a high school reunion with Patterson, who he thinks would make a smooth transition.
“I think he'd be a good fit in anybody's program,” Ruiz said. “He is a great quarterback.”

In three separate incidents spanning from Sunday evening to Monday morning, two teenagers were shot and a third was robbed, police said.
At 7 p.m. Sunday, in the area of Lauder and Florence, a 16-year-old male was walking when he "heard shots and felt pain" in his left wrist said Officer Dan Donakowski, a Detroit police spokesman. The area is on Detroit's west side, south of McNichols and east of Greenfield.
The boy ran home after being shot, and his mother drove him to an area hospital.
Then on Detroit's east side, north of Mack and east of Alter, just before 1 a.m., an 18-year-old man was walking on Maryland near Lozier when a red Chrysler Sebring pulled alongside. Two masked men got out of the vehicle, one of them armed, and the men ordered the victim to the ground, and told him to give up what he had.
That consisted of an iPhone and white LeBron James gym shoes, Donakowski said.
The suspects are described only as black males who wore black masks and black or dark clothes. The victim was not hurt.
Back on the west side, on the 8500 block of Grand River, a 17-year-old male was shot in his lower back and leg outside of a liquor store.
The victim had encountered four black males inside the store. Police believe the men arrived and left in a brown Chevy Tahoe.
After the encounter, one of the suspects started firing shots, at least two of which connected with the victim. Medics transported him to an area hospital, where he was in serious condition at last report.
The Tahoe took off in an unknown direction.
The shootings and robbery come at a violent time for teenagers in Detroit.
Last Saturday, four teens were shot at the Noel Night celebration, allegedly by a 16-year-old Detroit boy. All are expected to recover.
The next day, a 19-year-old man on the city's east side was fatally shot while trying to run from an armed robbery.

Republican Helen Brady announced Tuesday that she will run against Massachusetts auditor Suzanne Bump, a Democrat, in the 2018 election.
Brady, who lives in Concord, is the sales and business director for the Boston Pops. She has worked for the Boston Symphony Orchestra for 30 years.
Brady said she is running on a platform of "transparency, neutrality and full accountability."
Brady, in a press release, criticized Bump for accepting a pay raise passed by the Legislature last year and for not doing enough on waste, fraud and abuse.
"I am stunned at the State Auditor's inability to play an active and aggressive role in rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse," Brady said in a statement. "The Auditor's refusal to stand up and fight for taxpayers is made all the more shameful by her willingness to accept a massive increase to her taxpayer-funded salary.
"As a political outsider, I'll be accountable to my constituents, not the Beacon Hill bureaucracy," Brady said.
Her slogan is "Give 'Em Helen."
Brady has previously made small donations to the Republican State Committee, Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, State Rep. and U.S. Senate candidate Geoff Diehl, R-Whitman, and State Rep. David Nangle, D-Lowell.
Brady formed a campaign committee in 2016 to run for state representative in the 14th Middlesex District. She won the Republican primary unopposed, but lost to Democrat Cory Atkins, 60 percent to 36 percent, in the general election.
She grew up in South Weymouth and attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
Bump was elected auditor in 2010 and re-elected in 2014. She is running for a third term.
Autumn McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for Bump's campaign, said Bump is a national leader among state auditors and her work in auditing and information technology innovation has won national awards. She has identified millions of dollars in public assistance fraud.
"Her office has identified more than $1.3 billion worth of savings, inefficiencies, misspending and fraud and has changed state agency operations in fundamental ways," McLaughlin said. "Throughout her time in office, she's grown a grassroots network of supporters, ready to spread her message of increasing accountability and improving government performance."
Officials Warn Of Exposure To Measles At Two Ann Arbor Restaurants
April 17, 2017
Following Friday's confirmation by state health officials that a Livingston County resident had contracted the second case of measles in Michigan this year, officials in Washtenaw County are warning the public that people may have been exposed to the disease at two Ann Arbor restaurants recently.
The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services announced the second confirmed case Friday. Livingston County Medical Director Dr. Don Lawrenchuk says the individual was on the same airplane as a young child who was not vaccinated and returning from a country where many measles cases were reported. State officials say the two individuals are not related but both were passengers on the same flight when the first individual was contagious. Because it's believed the Livingston County resident was a customer at two restaurants while contagious, Washtenaw County health officials say anyone who was at Mark's Midtown Coney Island on Plymouth Road in Ann Arbor between noon and 3 p.m. April 6 or at Benny's Family Dining on Industrial Highway during the same hours the following day should monitor themselves for rash with fever or other symptoms consistent with measles for 21 days. Since the health department can't contact other customers individually to alert them, it is sharing information publicly.
Measles is an extremely contagious disease caused by the measles virus and can cause complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis as well cause miscarriages or premature delivery in pregnant women. State and local health officials say the best line of defense is vaccination and encourage it for all persons, especially those traveling internationally. (JK)
MMA News: Amanda Nunes criticises Rousey's coach Edmond Tarverdyan after UFC 207 debacle
The Lioness went after Rousey's camp after dismantling her at UFC 207
@AdithyaPai_ by Adithya Pai News 02 Jan 2017, 10:37 IST
A Lioness' flawless victory.
What's the story?
Amanda Nunes stunned the entire MMA community as she dismantled the UFC star Ronda Rousey to successfully retain her strap at UFC 207.
After the victory, The ‘Lioness' didn't take long to point a finger at her opponent's head coach, Edmond Tarverdyan.
According to Themaclife.com, Nunes was quoted stating the following:
“Yeah, because she thinks that she's a boxer, you know? He(Tarverdyan) like put this thing in her head and make the girl believe in that. I don't know why he did that. She has great judo, and she can go far in this division, but he put some crazy thing about boxing, and her career started to go down.
And if I win that, I am the real striker. This is the only thing I wanted to look at him, to say it.”
In case you didn't know...
This isn't the first time someone has slammed Tarverdyan. Most notably. Rousey's mother, AnnMaria De Mars, had expressed her reservations about him. Many fans and pundits have also been unconvinced by the Armenian's methods.
Tarverdyan has been a part of Rousey's career way before her rise to stardom. He is best known to the MMA community as her boxing coach. But most of Ronda's fights ended with her superior judo skills that her opponents had no answer to.
The heart of the matter
At UFC 207, it was painfully obvious that Rousey hadn't repaired the chink in her armour that Holly Holm had exposed a year agi. The former champ was clearly staggered as the Brazilian rocked her with blow after blow, granting Ronda her second consecutive loss.
What next?
Amanda Nunes has successfully defended her title. And now according to Dana White, Nunes' popularity will reach new heights. The champ had previously mentioned that she would be willing to grant ‘Rowdy' a rematch if she would defeat her. The manner of her victory, however, has left little doubt as to how their rematch would go.
Ronda Rousey, on the other hand, has much to contemplate about. With many corners touting her retirement, Rousey put out a message post-UFC 207 stating that she needs some time to reflect and think about where to go from here.
This has come amidst many fighters urging her not to call it a day, and to fight through this testing phase.
Sportskeeda's Take
Ronda Rousey needs to take a good, hard look at herself and her career now. She had been resolutely sticking by Tarverdyan when everyone else was slating him, but the time has come to perhaps consider the notion that moving to another fight camp would do her a world of good.
ESPN's Jeff Legwold reported after the Senior Bowl that he spoke to three NFL general managers that said they would be unwilling to trade for Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib because the team may be forced to release him if they can't find a trade partner.
Rotoworld Football published a story about Legwold's report and Broncos general manager John Elway liked their tweet:
Elway has since unliked the tweet, perhaps a sign that it was an accidental like in the first place. Regardless of what the background story is, this isn't the first time Elway has liked a tweet about NFL news.
Last August, Elway liked a tweet about former Philadelphia Eagles running back Ryan Mathews being cleared to play and released:
Among the 17 tweets that John Elway has liked . . . coincidence? pic.twitter.com/cZbbLHeAJr — Jon Heath (@JonHeathNFL) August 15, 2017
Again, that may have been an accidental like, or Elway may have just been happy that Mathews was getting healthy. Whatever the case may be, Elway's perhaps now more aware that whatever he does on social media will be scrutinized.

MILWAUKEE — Sami Niku had a goal and two assists as the Manitoba Moose won their fifth straight game, downing the Milwaukee Admirals 5-1 on Saturday in American Hockey League action.
Brody Sutter, Nic Petan, JC Lipon and Brendan Lemieux also scored for the Moose (31-10-5) while Eric Comrie stopped 39 shots for the win.
Emil Pettersson found the back of the net for the Admirals (21-20-4), who are on a six-game slide. Anders Lindback kicked out 32-of-37 shots in defeat.
Manitoba went 1 for 6 on the power play while Milwaukee failed to score on three chances with the man advantage.
A warm front is lifting north into the region this afternoon bringing temperatures back into the 80s and dew points back into the 60s. The front will also bring a few thunderstorms later on today some of which could be strong. The full break down is below.
Today & Tonight
Temperatures are on the rise again as a warm front inches closer to us. Highs have rise into the upper 70s and lower 80s with plenty of middle 80s possible before the day is done. In addition to a rise in temperatures we are also seeing a rise in humidity. Dew points are back in the 60s so the muggy feeling from earlier in the week has returned.
With all the heat and humidity around this afternoon thunderstorms are continued to develop. We have seen thunderstorms since this morning and the chance exist all day long, but the best chances will be during evening hours and overnight. The storms we are seeing this afternoon are slow moving and may drop some heavy rain, but they are just a precursor to stronger storms we'll see tonight.
Thunderstorms tonight are also expected to be slow movers, which means locally heavy rainfall is possible. Gusty winds and small hail will be possible as well. With these threats, the Storm Prediction Center has placed Mid-Michigan in a Marginal Risk (5%) for severe weather this evening and tonight.
A Marginal Risk suggests severe weather is not expected to be widespread, more of the exception and not the rule. As always, if any updates are issued on our severe weather chances or if any warnings are issued, you'll know about them on-air, online, and on social media.
Rain and storms will be possible throughout the night and lows are expected to stay mild in the upper 60s during the overnight period.
Thursday
Thunderstorms will remain in the picture as we head into the day tomorrow. Once the initial line of storms rolls through tonight we will see a short break from the rain late tomorrow morning. It will be short lived of course because the chance for thunderstorms will return Thursday afternoon.
Storms tomorrow are not expected to be strong or severe, but they could pack a punch with gusty winds and heavy rain.
Highs will be hot again in the middle to upper 80s. Humidity will also stick around making it feel muggy outside.

The Ulster Unionist Party has announced it will ‘strongly and vehemently' oppose any efforts by DAERA to begin charging farmers for their first TB test each year.
Contained within the current public consultation on eradicating Bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) is a proposal that the cost of the first annual herd test would be passed to each farmer.
The party's agriculture spokesperson Robin Swann MLA said tackling bTB has supposedly been a Government priority for years now, yet the situation locally is still only getting worse rather than better.
He continued: “The current DAERA consultation includes a number of new measures intended to tackle the disease. It couldn't have come soon enough as bTB continues to blight our local agricultural industry.
“The discovery of a reactor is often a hammer-blow to the operation of any farm business and for years now there has been an appalling head in the sand attitude from consecutive Agriculture Ministers at Stormont.
“That is why I am particularly frustrated that DAERA have decided to use the opportunity to introduce what is nothing more than an underhanded money raising ploy. If the Department get their way local farmers will be charged £54.50 for the first animal tested and £2.50 for all others up until 100. Given the average size of a herd in Northern Ireland is 82 that means local farms will typically have to pay £257 each and every year moving forward.
“I would have slightly more sympathy for the Department if we could be sure that the savings being made were going to be redirected towards other measures aimed at tackling the disease, but we know that just won't happen. Even if they came out today and said that this would be the case, I still wouldn't believe them – there are dozens of examples across Government Departments where money was supposedly raised for one thing but then spent on something entirely different,” added Mr Swann.
“I understand the Department is under pressure financially – just like all the others – but instead of trying to fill the gap by charging farmers, the more reasonable thing to do would be to reduce their shocking administrative costs.
“Until DAERA can prove that it is actually determined to make significant progress to wiping out the disease it is wrong for them to try to pass the responsibility of paying for the disease onto hard-pressed farming families.
“I'm also aware that there are some within the industry suggesting an annual levy of £1-£3 per animal, but again my experience of working with DAERA and other Executive Departments is that this would simply be a cloak to raise additional income each year. If we are not careful farmers could very easily end up talking themselves into a mandatory levy but with absolutely nothing in return.
“Eradication of bTB will never be achieved with piecemeal efforts and unfortunately I remain to be convinced that DAERA are approaching this issue with the right attitude and priorities. This is an important opportunity to get the right approach to tackling TB. We can't afford to let it slip by, but equally we can't afford to let DAERA get away with nothing other than money raising ploys.”
QUESNEL, B.C.—The SPCA says 16 dogs that were kept in crates too small for their size have been seized from a couple in Quesnel, B.C., who had already been banned from owning animals for 20 years. The organization's chief prevention and enforcement officer Marcie Moriarty says Karin and Catherine Adams were convicted of animal cruelty two years ago but were recently found to have kept dogs in a poorly ventilated area, with little or no access to water and with feces and urine-soaked matting.
B.C. SPCA chief prevention and enforcement officer Marcie Moriarty also announced two charges of animal cruelty against a man who allegedly neglected 46 dogs and puppies. ( Twitter )
She says the dogs, including German shepherds, bull terriers, standard poodles and corgi-border collie crosses, are in SPCA shelters and new charges of animal cruelty will be recommended against the Adams. Moriarty has also announced two charges of animal cruelty against a man who allegedly neglected 46 dogs and puppies that were seized in February from his rural property north of Williams Lake. She says Terry Baker kept dogs including American Eskimo, border collie, husky and Samoyed breeds, all of which were highly unsocialized and lacked shelter.

Garden City tied the game in the 19th minute on a goal from Goretti Mendez and took the lead on a Abigail Jarmer goal in the 32nd minute.
The two teams went scoreless in the second half. Hays High had some late chances but could not find the back of the net. The Lady Indians drop to 5-3 on the season and 1-2 in the Western Athletic Conference and will hit the road again on Thursday to take on Liberal.

Neighbours offer to help erase graffiti, April 16
I simply don't understand how love can bear such hate; how people can vandalize with the pure intention of belittling someone for loving another. Canada is known for its acceptance, but while imperfections still lie within people who can't seem to treat the LGBTQ community with any decency, it warms my heart to hear of the many people who volunteered to help clean up the sickening vandalism. When we act as a community, it shows that we're stronger together and proves that our humanity isn't completely lost.

A father at his "wits end" strangled his teenage daughter after being unable to cope with her severe anxiety problems.
Richard Kray felt he could no longer let his daughter Olivia, 19 and known as Livvy suffer with her mental health problems when he killed her.
He admitted he just "blacked out" but knew what he was doing before he lay in wait and tried to do the same to his partner and Olivia's mother Damyantee "Sheila" Cowan.
But she managed to escape and fled to a police station where Kray followed her and confessed.
(Image: BBC)
The 64-year-old denied murder but admitted the manslaughter by diminished responsibility of Olivia and the attempted murder of his partner Ms Cowan.
Today Judge Philip Statman sitting at Maidstone Crown Court indicated he would pass a "hybrid" order to allow Kray to be treated in hospital under the Mental Health Act before being transferred to prison.
Prosecutor Simon Taylor told the court Kray had made efforts to help and care for his daughter.
Doctors said Olivia's anxiety was "severe, always needing her father with her whenever she wanted to go out."
Mr Taylor added: "Mr Kray and Sheila had reached the end of their tether with her."
Last March he told Olivia's carers he could no longer cope with her behaviour and the next month was signed off sick from work with exhaustion because of Olivia's high dependency on him.
For example last April Olivia called the Community Health Trust nine times and the police once because her father had left her for a break, the court heard.
Then on May 11 and 12 she made eight calls to the police and two to the trust asking where her dad was.
Mr Taylor said: "It is clear the pressure was taking its toll on Mr Kray."
(Image: BBC)
Olivia's demanding behaviour continued and Kray's "ability to cope with his daughter's illness was rapidly diminishing."
Then in July as the three returned from the Bluewater shopping complex Kray, while being badgered by his daughter, said: "Let's crash the car. Let's all be killed together."
Just three days later Kray told the mother of Olivia's friend: "You know what, I've even thought about killing the pair of them.
"Obviously, I wouldn't. I love her, she's my daughter. It's my bloody fault. I've let it go on too long."
Then three days after the comments Kray killed Olivia inside the caravan she lived in at Westlands Caravan Park in Herne Bay on July 21
After strangling Olivia he went to Ms Cowan's home and waited for her to come home before trying to strangle her too as she cried out to see her daughter.
Ms Cowan managed to kick out and escape and when Kray arrived at the police station, he said: "You can arrest me. I've killed her.
"Yeah, yeah, in Herne and I came round to kill Sheila as well, but she was too strong for me and I couldn't do it - and that's the top and bottom of it.
"I'm just at my wit's end with her and everything and my mental health problems, and disturbing the neighbours honestly.
"We've had months and months and months of mental health problems with my daughter and Sheila, and it just comes to a head and I couldn't stand it any more, and I just did it.
"And I come round here as cold as you like to do it to her as well, and I couldn't."
After his arrest, he replied: "I'm guilty. I couldn't let her suffer any more, so I just, I know it sounds callous, but I couldn't think of anything else to do.
"I'm at my wit's end for months and months. I know it's no excuse.
"I just blacked out. I knew what I was doing."
He told the custody sergeant: "I want to die."
Judge Statman said Kray worked with children who had difficulties and it was not a case where Olivia failed to get treatment and he was keen for her to have therapy .
"I would not want it thought the medical services failed her in any way."
In mitigation barrister Oliver Saxby QC said: "He is someone with regret and remorse for what he has done.
"A sentence of some length is inevitable."
The judge said he would think "long and hard" over the weekend and pass sentence on Monday.

Aging gracefully involves much more than just good genes. (Photo: Shutterstock)
The concept that “good genes” are the key to aging gracefully is simply not true. There's a lot you can do to stay in top shape as you get older. In fact, the real secrets to avoiding chronic illness, having a good quality of life and maintaining your appearance lie in simple everyday habits:
One of the most important habits I recommend is maintaining a diet rich in plant-based foods. To understand why, let's start with your gut – specifically the large intestine, which is home to what doctors call the microbiome. Here, your body maintains trillions of good bacteria that help support biological processes, such as digestion, that keep you alive. Eating meals consisting largely of fruits, vegetables and whole grains ensures that bacteria in the microbiome are well-nourished and working hard to keep you feeling great.
Other habits that can help you age gracefully include:
· Staying hydrated: From our brains to our stomachs, cells throughout the body need water to function properly. I tell patients to divide their weight in half and aim to drink this many ounces of water every day. For example, a 180-pound person should drink 90 ounces of water every day.
· Exercising regularly: The benefits of exercise extend beyond your heart and vascular system. Anything you do to build muscle – including resistance training and going for regular walks – also protects your bones. Exercise has the added benefit of helping you maintain balance and perform everyday activities, like walking upstairs, with ease. I advise aiming for 30 to 90 minutes of activity every day. Choose the right type of exercise for you – find activities that you enjoy so you will consistently keep at it and ones that will help you reach your goals.
· Getting enough sleep: Your body works hard to support you as you move through your busy life. This is why it's so important to get 8 hours of sleep every day. While you're sleeping, your body can restore itself and clear out waste, including damaged and worn out cells, which allows you to feel your best at any age.
· Managing stress levels: It's hard to avoid stress entirely, so I help my patients find good ways to manage it. Research shows that just a few minutes of deep breathing throughout the day can lower levels of the body's stress hormone, cortisol. This is one of many ways you can de-stress your life.
· Keeping your brain active: Taking care of your brain helps you maintain short- and long-term memory. Simple activities such as crossword puzzles, knitting and maintaining close relationships with loved ones are all good for brain health.
· Selecting gentle skin care products: Taking care of your skin helps you maintain a healthy glow, but that's not all: From regulating temperature to experiencing sensations from the world around you, your skin does so much for your well-being. Pamper your skin by using mineral-based makeup and petroleum-free hygiene products.
It's never too early to start adopting habits that help you age gracefully. Learn more about what you can do by talking with your doctor or one of our functional medicine experts. Functional medicine uses a holistic approach – considering mind, body and spirit – to help adults of all ages achieve optimal health and wellness.

African countries have been challenged to employ modern technology interventions in addressing issues of tax non compliance as the world is embracing the advent of global technology transformation.
Secretary to the Treasury, Ben Botolo, made the call at the Bingu International Convention Centre (BICC) in Lilongwe Wednesday, where he opened a two day long 18th Forum for Value Added Tax (VAT) Administrators in Africa (VADA).
He explained that the power of VAT extended beyond the face value contribution to a country's fiscal policy and that electronic fiscal devices in monitoring tax compliance were critical in optimizing tax revenue collection.
Botolo said of Africa's main challenges was that most countries were still cash economies saying; “In non-cash economies where (for example) monitory transactions are conducted through electronic cards, taxes are already embedded in those services as opposed to income tax where people still use cheques to pay tax. If we too can reach that stage then tax collection will be easier.”
He said Malawi had covered a commendable positive mileage in migrating to electronic monitoring of tax compliance, and disclosed that the Tax Administration Act was in the offing to further harmonise tax collection compliance, though he was quick to mention that there was still room for improvement.
Chairperson for VADA and who is also Uganda's Commissioner for Domestic Taxes Department, Henry Saka underscored the need to formalize regulatory strategies of how businesses operate and comply with tax revenue payments.
He pointed out that, “We would look at several schemes that are used to evade tax, and design African solutions to them.”
Saka said VADA provides technical support and expertise to at least 12 non-member countries, and amongst the 10 member countries are Malawi, Zambia, Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda.
VADA Forum brings together the 10 African member countries' Commissioners and Administrators of the VAT to share and analyze tax non compliance challenges, and propose accordingly interventions, with a view of improving domestic revenue resource mobilization for economic development.
It was reported that these individuals had worked hard for Thomas D'Alesandro's reelection to Congress and on his campaign at that time to become Mayor of Baltimore. It was stated that John Cataneo and Magliano during the time of this campaign were under Federal indictments for violation of the Selective Service Act and for fraud against the Government and were subsequently convicted in Federal court. Cataneo allegedly admitted giving large sums of money toward the Democratic campaign and stated that he would receive the sanitation contracts for Baltimore if Mr. D'Alesandro was elected mayor.
Supervisor Orrin H. Bartlett advised me that while talking to Congressman Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr. (D., Md.) on March 26, 1946, the Congressman advised Agent Bartlett he was running for Congress again in the fall 1946 election and that in 1947 he was running for the office of Mayor of Baltimore. Congressman D'Alesandro advised Agent Bartlett that since he had been on the Appropriations Committee, he has been back of the Director and the Bureau one hundred percent, and further, that he was vitally interested in and completely satisfied with the results of the Bureau's work.
Thank you very much for message congratulating me on my election as Mayor of the City of Baltimore. I was most pleased to receive your good wishes and assure you that I will do my utmost to give the people of Baltimore an efficient and outstanding administration. I, too, will miss you and many other friends in Washington but I am grateful for the proximity of our two cities which will afford the opportunity for frequent visits when and if time permits. Whenever you are in Baltimore, please make it a point to visit me at City Hall.
During the summer of 1953, Mayor D'Alesandro's son, Franklin Roosevelt D'Alesandro, aged twenty, was one of fourteen youths charged with having committed rape or perverted practices on two girls, aged eleven and thirteen, during July of that year. It was reported that Franklin Roosevelt D'Alesandro was the only one of twelve of those tried at that time who was successful in obtaining an acquittal. Following this acquittal, a Baltimore, Maryland, Grand Jury indicted Franklin Roosevelt D'Alesandro on charges of having committed perjury in that he had lied during the afore-mentioned trial on charges of rape. In addition, James H. Pollack, Baltimore City political boss, was reportedly also indicted on the charge of obstruction of justice in that he had attempted to influence testimony of several of the youthful defendants who had been tried with Franklin Roosevelt D'Alesandro. It was reported that Franklin Roosevelt D'Alesandro was tried on the above charge of perjury at Salisbury, Maryland, during 1954, following a change of venue, and was found not guilty.
Nancy Pelosi's father Thomas D'Alesandro Jr. allegedly was a "constant companion" of notorious mobster Benjamin "Benny Trotta" Magliano and other underworld figures during his political years in Baltimore, MD. D'Alesandro was a Congressman for five terms from 1938 to 1947, and Baltimore mayor for three terms from 1947 to 1959.In 1947 the FBI investigated Magliano for securing a draft exemption from Selective Service for himself and prizefighters he controlled by falsely representing they had essential employment at American Ship Cleaning Company which was operated by John Cataneo.At that time the FBI never investigated D'Alesandro concerning this or numerous other allegations involving hoodlum associations and public corruption. Of course, while in Congress D'Alesandro sat on the appropriations committee and was a friend of Director J. Edgar Hoover. For example, an FBI memo dated March 27, 1946 from E. G. Fitch to D. M. Ladd provides:Hoover sent warm congratulations to D'Alesandro upon his November 1946 re-election to the House and then his May 1947 election as Baltimore Mayor, and after leaving Congress for City Hall D'Alesandro wrote Hoover by letter dated May 14, 1947:Meanwhile, the allegations against D'Alesandro continued to pile up.President Kennedy wanted to appoint D'Alesandro to the United States Renegotiation Board which was a government watchdog against profit gouging by defense contractors. A February 6, 1961 memo from Hoover to the Baltimore and Washington Field Offices cautiously advises: "The White House has requested that we proceed with a special inquiry investigation but that if substantial derogatory information were developed, we should report this and discontinue any further inquiries because substantiation of any of the allegations would eliminate D'Alesandro."For example, Peter Galiano, the convicted boxer involved with Magliano's draft-dodging scheme who told Special Agent James V. Sullivan in January 1947 that D'Alesandro was a "constant companion" of both Magliano and Cataneo, more than a decade later when pressed by the FBI said on February 8, 1961 his statement was "only rumor and hearsay," and "he could not recall who gave him this information or whether or not there was any truth to these allegations." However, there was independent corroboration for at least some of Galiano's earlier allegations. The FBI notes that "during the investigation" of the Selective Service fraud caseMoreover, Special Agent Sullivan in 1947 had received from another informant "similar information" concerning D'Alesandro's ties to Cataneo and Magliano, and this informant further advised that "CATANEO also supposedly was well-regarded by D'ALESANDRO because he had control of a large Italian vote in Baltimore."D'Alesandro also was accused by highly-credible police officers of providing protection to Baltimore hoodlums. For example, "in 1945, Captain JOHN R. ROLLMAN, Western District, Baltimore Police Department, Baltimore, Maryland, furnished information to the Baltimore Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning one CHARLES F. CAMMARATA, who until a short time previously had operated a tavern at 641 West Baltimore Street." According to Captain Rollmanand "CAMMARATA was alleged to be gambling in various crap and card games in Baltimore."A March 15, 1961 FBI memo reports that Cammarata may have been last seen in Havana, Cuba in the mid-1950s where he allegedly "had some connection with Clark's Tropicana Night Club," and may now be residing in Miami, FL where he "reportedly owned apartment houses"; however, perhaps content to let sleeping dogs lie, the FBI never followed up on these tips in an attempt to reach Cammarata about the alleged protection he received from D'Alesandro while operating in Baltimore in the 1940s.The developer later explained that the payments were legitimate loans to Mrs. D'Alesandro to finance her cosmetics business which since had been fully repaid, and he doctored the documents only "to save" the D'Alesandro family "from embarrassment and from further trouble" given a criminal investigation into his business practices. In April 1954 Piracci "was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud the city of $42,996 in connection with the construction of an off-street parking garage in Baltimore," and also found guilty for "obstruction of justice in that he submitted to a Baltimore City Grand Jury a 'completely phony' ledger to conceal $35,000 in weekly payments to the Peoples Holding Corporation" whose officers "were also charged with conspiracy to defraud Baltimore City in an off-street parking garage contract."The Piracci trial at which Mrs. D'Alesandro testified immediately was followed by a child gang rape trial against the Mayor's 20-year old son Franklin Roosevelt D'Alesandro. The FBI describes the ugly case in a January 30, 1961 memo as follows:A Feb 27, 1961 FBI memo states that according to one informant "the consensus of opinion among persons connected with law enforcement that appointee's [D'Alesandro's] son acquitted of rape because of brilliant fashion case handled by defense attorney." Franklin Roosevelt D'Alesandro was represented by Joseph Sherbow who managed to sever his client from the other defendants and ensured his trial went first so any convictions against the others would not prejudice him.The corruption charges and his son's rape trial all had become more than Mayor D'Alesandro could bear, and he suffered a nervous breakdown. D'Alesandro was admitted to the Bon Secours Hospital in Maryland where he rested from March 10 through July 12, 1954. During this period according to an FBI memo "the Balitimore City Police Department had two men assigned to protect the appointee [D'Alesandro] and also had two men guarding his home" at 245 Albemarle Street for unknown reasons and "a local paper carried a picture of him in his hospital room seated in front of a television set, dressed in a dressing gown."Most of the FBI's "special inquiry" into D'Alesandro involved brief interviews with his political cronies, personal friends and family members who insisted the Mayor was a swell guy. The allegations against D'Alesandro involving public graft and hoodlum associations were conveniently ignored or gratuitously explained away, and on March 28, 1961 he was sworn in as a member of the United States Renegotiation Board by President Kennedy. D'Alesandro's wife and their 21-year-old daughter Nancy were by his side.
US PRESIDENT Donald Trump has spoken out on the cancellation of the Roseanne reboot over a racist tweet by the star.
Mr Trump took to Twitter despite the White House claiming the US President had more important things to focus on then the axing of Roseanne to paint himself as a victim.
"Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that "ABC does not tolerate comments like those" made by Roseanne Barr. Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologise for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn't get the call?" he tweeted.
Comedian Roseanne Barr saw her self-titled show axed, despite high ratings, after she posted a tweet calling former Obama Administration official Valerie Jarrett like "the Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby."

Ms Jarrett said Mr Trump needs to share the blame over Barr's racist tweet about her, saying that "tone does start at the top."
Fox News reports that Ms Jarrett spoke out during MSNBC's town hall on Everyday Racism in America.
She said she was "fine" after Barr's racist tweet.

But, without mentioning Mr Trump by name, Ms Jarrett suggested "tone" starts with him.
"We like to look up to our president and feel as though he reflects the values of our country, but I also think every individual citizen has a responsibility, too," Ms Jarrett said. "And it's up to all of us to push back. Our government is only going to be as good as we make it."
Barr, who claims she was under the influence of Ambien while she was tweeting, also falsely claimed that Chelsea Clinton ​is married to billionaire George Soros' nephew.
She then repeated a false rumour that the billionaire investor, who is Jewish and survived the Holocaust, is a Nazi sympathiser and assisted the organisation during World War II​ despite the fact he was 13.

Earlier, when asked what the president's reaction was to Barr's tweets, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the president has been "focused" on North Korea, trade and the economy.
"The president is focused on North Korea. He's focused on trade deals. And he's focused on rebuilding our military, the economy. And that's what he's spending his time on; not responding to other things," Ms Sanders said.
Asked whether the president thought Roseanne's show should have been cancelled, Ms Sanders said: "That's not what he's spending his time on. And I think that we have a lot bigger things going on in the country right now."

Barr apologised following her tweet on Tuesday.
"I apologise to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans. I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me - my joke was in bad taste," Barr tweeted, noting she was "now leaving Twitter."
But Barr returned to the social media platform, apologising again and blaming her tweet on the prescription sleeping pill Ambien. She also claimed that she thought Ms Jarrett was white.
ROSEANNE SLAMS HER TV FAMILY
Barr accused her onscreen kids of throwing her under the bus in comments they have made about her racist tweets.
She also took aim at Michael Fishman, who has played her on-screen son since the show's start in 1988.

Fishman wrote: "Today is one of the hardest days of my life. I feel devastated, not for the end of the Roseanne show, but for all those who poured their hearts and souls into our jobs, and the audience who welcomed us into their homes.
"Our cast, crew, writers, and production staff strives for inclusiveness, with numerous storylines designed to reflect inclusiveness."
Barr took exception to that.
"I created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it. ME. You throw me under the bus. Nice!" she tweeted.
She also had a crack at Sara Gilbert, who plays her daughter Darlene and who was the driving force behind the Roseanne reboot, after she called her onscreen mum's comments "abhorrent".

Emma Kenney, who played Barr's granddaughter Harris Connor-Healy, wrote she was "hurt, embarrassed and disappointed," calling Barr's comments "inexcusable."
She also claimed in a since-deleted tweet that she was set to quit the show right before it was cancelled.

Co-showrunner Whitney Cummings and guest star Sandra Bernhard have also spoken out against Roseanne.
John Goodman and Laurie Metcalf however are yet to comment.
Roseanne executive producer Tom Werner, who was involved with the series' original run and revival season, expressed his support for ABC's decision to cancel the series on Tuesday in the wake of Roseanne Barr's racist tweets.
"I support ABC's decision to cancel the show in the wake of Roseanne Barr's most recent reprehensible tweets," he said in a statement to Deadline. "Our goal was to promote constructive discussion about the issues that divide us. It represented the work of hundreds of talented people. I hope the good work done is not totally eclipsed by these abhorrent and offensive comments, and that Roseanne seeks the help she so clearly needs."
AMBIEN MAKER: OUR PILLS DON'T MAKE YOU RACIST
Ambien maker Sanofi Aventis has fired back at Barr overnight after she blamed the sedative for the racist tweetstorm that got her show cancelled.
"People of all races, religions and nationalities work at Sanofi every day to improve the lives of people around the world. While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication," the France-based pharmaceutical company tweeted.
Barr isn't however the only celebrity to blame Ambien for controversial tweets.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk went on a Twitter rampage in June 2017, Mashable reported. He started the series of tweets by discussing his excitement over a Tesla shareholder meeting and went from there. He admitted to having a "little red wine, vintage record, some Ambien … and magic!" He tweeted a year earlier that he has learned that "tweeted on Ambien isn't wise."

Academy Award-winning actor Sean Penn admitted to being on Ambien during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in March, People reported.
"I'm doing well," Penn told Colbert. "You've inherited a little of the Ambien I had to take to get to sleep after a red eye last night."
Embattled golf star Tiger Woods was arrested for a DUI in 2017 after deputies found the athlete who was parked curiously on the side of the road, asleep. During a sobriety test, Woods slurred, couldn't walk a straight line and appeared "out of it." A toxicology test showed Woods had a number of prescription drugs in his system, including Ambien.
It was also widely speculated that Mr Trump's infamous "Covfefe" tweet was a result of the sleeping pills - his doctor, Ronny Jackson, confirmed during a press conference in January that Mr Trump occasionally takes Ambien.

India face Thailand in four-nation youth football tournament tomorrow
New Delhi, Jul 4 (PTI) After losing narrowly to China, the Indian U-16 football team will now lock horns with Thailand tomorrow in the four-nation Hua Shan Cup CFA International Youth Football Tournament in Wei Nan City, China.
The invitational four-nation tournament is a part of an exposure tour for the young Indian team ahead of the upcoming AFC U-16 Finals slated to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September.
Yesterday, India U-16 team went down fighting by a solitary goal to U-17 China national team and head coach Bibiano Fernandes said that the boys have been consistently creating chances in every match.
"We have been consistently creating chances in every game we have played so far, even against top opposition," Fernandes said.
"The match against China was no different as we had our chances and if we could convert those chances, it would've been a different result at the end of the day," he maintained.
The Indian boys have been on a series of exposure tours, all facilitated by the AIFF and the SAI and headed to Wei Nan on the back of two consecutive triumphs in invitational tournaments in Serbia and Hong Kong earlier.
Bibiano said the match against mighty China was "a learning experience for the U-16 boys" and gave "ample proof that the boys are improving both mentally and physically".
The unity and togetherness within the team is our core strength. The boys always have stood by each other helping one other to collectively improve as a team and move forward, the coach said.

If you're one of those people who always chooses more expensive supermarket items over cheaper versions, you could be paying as much as 86 per cent more for an identical product.
An investigation carried out by MirrorOnline found shoppers in four major British supermarkets could be paying over the odds for products such as cornflakes, butter, corned beef or UHT milk as cheaper varieties of these items had no difference in ingredients or nutritional value.
There were no differences in nutritional value or ingredients between price tiers and in some cases, own-label and value products actually came from the same factory.
James Walker, of complaints website Resolver, said: “Flogging the same products at different prices is misleading for shoppers.”
Both Morrisons and Asda said there were differences between products in different price ranges. Asda said products had the 'same overall ingredients' but 'gradings differed', while Morrisons confirmed its Savers butter is sourced from inside and outside the UK but its standard butter is 'always' British. It also claimed its long life milk has 'clever' packaging.
A Tesco spokesperson told the Liverpool Echo: "We want all our own-brand products [to] offer real value and are reviewing our approach to these."
A Sainsbury's representative also added: "There are many factors which inform product specification. This will dictate the range it is in."

DUBLIN — West Bladen used a ferocious fourth-quarter rally to take Friday's Three Rivers Conference game with visiting St. Pauls to overtime, then outscored the Bulldogs 11-8 in the extra time to earn an 80-77 win.
West Bladen improved to 5-17 overall, 2-13 in conference.
St. Pauls opened the game with a 13-4 run, but Jimmy Williams drained a three-pointer during a 9-2 Knights burst that cut the deficit to 15-13 going into the second quarter.
Williams canned another three-pointer for West Bladen that kept the Knights close at 28-24, but St. Pauls finished the half on a 7-4 run to take a 35-28 advantage into the intermission.
The Knights got a three-pointer from both Keshawn Lewis and Williams, along with two bombs from Shyron Adams in the third quarter to match the Bulldogs scoring trough the third quarter. But the visitors still maintained a 54-48 lead going into the fourth frame.
St. Pauls stretch its lead to 60-48 early in the final period, but West Bladen used the final 6:30 to go on a 19-9 run fueled by three-pointers from Williams and Adams and knot the game at 69-69 as time ran out.
In overtime, West Bladen went on a 7-2 run and then used crucial free throws from Tyre Boykin and Williams to seal the win.
Williams led the Knights with a season-high 24 points, while Boykin finished with 13 points; Adams scored 13 points; and Jonathan Robinson had eight points with six rebounds and three steals.
West Bladen will travel to Tabor City on Tuesday for a conference game with South Columbus at 8 p.m.
There are a lot of perks to having a cat. Like any other pet, a feline sidekick can serve as a source of unconditional companionship and plenty of laughs. When a cat's in the mood, they'll be your best friend and the ultimate snuggler. They'll keep the weird bugs in your apartment at bay. Occasionally, they'll roll around on their back in a super dramatic way while you're trying to throw a party and your friends will think it's the funniest thing they've ever seen. The downside of cat ownership is pretty clear, and it's the litter box. But how often should you change your cat's litter box? The answer will be seriously useful in helping you weigh the pros and cons of having a cat... and in keeping your home (and all the living creatures in it!) clean and healthy.
According to The Humane Society of the United States, the general rule of thumb for optimal litter box hygiene is that you clean it about twice per week. Like most general rules of thumb, though, there's room for variation here. Your particular needs might differ based on how many cats you have, how many litter boxes you have (if you have multiple cats), and what kind of litter you use in them.
Start off with a twice-weekly schedule, but pay close attention to the state of your cat's bathroom spot for signs that adjustments might be necessary. The bottom line, per The Humane Society, is that a litter box that's especially smelly needs to be changed, no matter how recently you've cleaned it. If the litter is more wet or clumpy than usual, it's also time for a change. If you have multiple cats using a single box, you'll probably find that you're better off refreshing the litter more frequently than twice per week. After all, a little extra cleanliness can't hurt. You might as well err on the side of hygiene, no?
Some sources actually suggest what seems like near-constant hygiene. Dr. Stephanie Janeczko D.V.M., medical director for animal care and control of New York City, wrote in Petfinder that litter boxes should be scooped at least once or twice daily. Ideally, she said, you should try to clean up after your pet as soon as they've done their business. But let's be real — very few of us actually have the time for that.
If you like the idea of sticking to Dr. Janeczko's advice but aren't excited about the idea of monitoring your cat's every trip to the bathroom, you might consider checking out a self-cleaning litter box. These gadgets use a sensor to initiate an automated cleaning process, and while some cats might find them a little scary, they definitely have the potential to make your life a lot easier... and your home a lot cleaner.
Here are a few self-cleaning options you might want to consider:
If you're skeptical of going the self-cleaning route — or you're worried that your cat will be skeptical of it — there are other ways to stay ahead of the litter box mess to make the cleaning process easier on you. Animal Planet suggests putting a thin layer of baking soda in the box before the litter. This will help absorb icky odors. The Humane Society notes that box liners can make cleaning more convenient, but that some cats actually claw at them, which will have the reverse effect when you try to pick up the box's contents. Resist the urge to put more than two inches of litter in your cat's box. Felines don't actually need more than that, and the litter you have, the more you'll have to clean... and buy. And who wants that

The coldest, snowiest week of the year so far requires the most cosseting food and Bar Buvette ticks every wintry comfort box there is.
This discreet French wine bar on Baldwin Street started as a pop-up a couple of years ago but such was its popularity that it's now a full-time business with an ever-growing following.
With its wooden parquet floor, green-painted wall panelling and red Formica-topped tables, the colour scheme is unintentionally festive, too, which makes it an ideal pit-stop in the run-up to Christmas.
“That was a really good shout mate,” beamed one well-fed diner to his friend as they passed me on the steps outside, clearly well refreshed after their dinner.
With the arched windows steamed up and the air heady with the tantalising smells coming from the tiny open kitchen in the corner of the dining room, Bar Buvette certainly reels you in from the outset.
There are ten regional French wines chalked up on the board, all of them served by the glass and bottle, and two available by the carafe. The Loire Chenin Blanc and La Sorga Rouge from the Languedoc were especially impressive wines full of character and complexity.
Whether this is a wine bar that serves food or a restaurant that specialises in good wine, I'm not so sure. Both food and drink seem to get equal billing here but it's the sort of relaxed place where you can grab a stool and enjoy a quick glass of wine and a basket of bread (excellent stuff from the Baked bakery in Totterdown) or adjust your waistband, tuck your feet under one of the mismatched tables, order three courses and call for a second bottle of red.
Twenty years ago, it was easy to find this sort of rustic French food in Bristol but it's increasingly hard to track down unless you go to Le Poivrot, a newish wine bar on Colston Street, or a reliable old-stager like the Glassboat.
And yet this is the sort of food I yearn for, especially in the colder months. I want artery-hardening dishes that warm me to the bone rather than fiddly, fancy-pants food decorated with frothy foams, arty squiggles of sauce and a battalion of chefs plating up food with tweezers.
Bar Buvette serves robust and ballsy food like Tartiflette (the hefty Alpine dish of potatoes, Reblochon cheese, bacon and onions) and thick sourdough cheese toasties to die for.
My braised pork shoulder and white beans (£9.50) was precisely what was required on the coldest of December evenings. Served in a vintage yellow bowl, the creamy, nutty beans were immersed in a rich, meaty broth topped with a pile of juicy pork and a tangle of mustardy ribbons of chive-flecked fennel with a pleasing crunch and freshness.
This might be a kitchen that majors on warming rib-stickers in winter but it also has a more sensitive side, as displayed by a plate of sweet and earthy beetroot (roasted and pickled) teamed with bitter and crunchy castelfranco radicchio leaves and crumbled 1924 blue cheese, a creamy, salty Roquefort with a seriously rich and fruity finish.
There was also a plate of hot steamed winter greens (£6.50) - assorted cabbage and kale under a snowdrift of finely grated Pecorino dribbled with fruity olive oil and a squeeze of lemon.
To finish, chestnut riz au lait (£5.50) - a thick, cold and creamy chestnut rice pudding with bite was decorated with segments of zesty clementine segments to cut through the richness.
THE VERDICT:
As I called for the bill, Lou Reed had made way for some crazy 1960s French organ-driven jazz and the group of hipsters behind me were ordering more plates of charcuterie, cheese toasties and wine. The buzz of the place was as intoxicating as the Breton cider they were quaffing and I really didn't want to leave.
In fact, so good was my weekday dinner at Bar Buvette that I returned for Saturday lunch purely in the name of forensic research. I had the Brussels sprouts, toasted hazelnuts and mustard vinaigrette followed by the calf tongue with pickled beetroot, horseradish and cucumber, finishing off with an absolutely perfect vanilla creme caramel. It was as all good and as impressive as the dinner I had earlier in the week, which shows just how consistent the place is.
RATINGS:
Overall: Four
Food: Four
Service: Four
Ambience: Four
Value: Four

SCRANTON — A would-be robber left Joe's Kwik Mart, 300 Meadow Ave., empty-handed early Saturday when a clerk warned him he had already pushed a panic button to alert authorities, city police said.
The suspect was described as a man, 5 feet 5 inches tall, about 135 pounds, wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt and a camouflage face mask. He plopped a blue backpack on the counter and twice demanded money, but never showed a weapon and left without incident. The incident happened about 12:05 a.m.

Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has today recognised Muhammad Ayub, representing Pakistan, as the 54th Commonwealth Point of Light in honour of his exceptional voluntary service improving the education and life chances of young people in Islamabad.
As part of the legacy of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London 2018, Her Majesty The Queen – as Head of the Commonwealth – is thanking inspirational volunteers across the 53 Commonwealth nations for the difference they are making in their communities and beyond, by recognising one volunteer from each Commonwealth country each week in the two years following the summit.
Mr Ayub is a fireman who runs an open-air school for children who would not otherwise be able to afford an education. He first started teaching a group of four children in an Islamabad public park over thirty years ago.
The school roll has since grown to over 250 students, with lessons running free of charge from noon to sunset.
Children are taught a range of subjects including Urdu, English and Maths and thousands of children have taken government accredited exams allowing them to go on to higher education, or secure higher-paid jobs. Ayub has now mobilised a team of volunteers to further support his teaching programmes and to help fundraise for a permanent school-building.—PR

(CNSNews.com) – Hurricanes Harvey and Irma are long gone, and despite dire predictions, they did not dampen the September jobs report in most key areas.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday said the labor force participation rate of 63.1 percent reached a high for the year in September, up two-tenths of a point from August.
The number of employed Americans reached 154,345,000 in September, setting a sixth record since January. As the number of employed Americans reached an all-time high, the number of unemployed Americans in September -- 6,801,000 -- hasn't been this low since May 2007.
The already low unemployment rate dropped another two-tenths of a point to 4.2 percent last month. That is the lowest since early 2001.
BLS noted that the recent hurricanes had "no discernible effect on the national unemployment rate."
The number of Americans not in the labor force declined a bit in September to 94,417,000. The record, set in the final full month of the Obama presidency, stands at 95,102,000 Americans not in the labor force.
On the negative side, BLS said no new jobs were added in September: In fact, BLS counts a job loss of 33,000, and it blamed the net effect of the two hurricanes for the negative jobs-added number.
BLS noted that a “steep” employment decline in food services and drinking places and below-trend growth in some other industries likely reflected the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. Employment rose in health care and in transportation and warehousing.
BLS said job gains have averaged 91,000 over the past three months.
And wages are going up: In September, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 12 cents to $26.55. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 74 cents, or 2.9 percent,, BLS said.
In September, the nation's civilian noninstitutionalized population, consisting of all people age 16 or older who were not in the military or an institution, reached 255,562,000. Of those, 161,146,000 participated in the labor force by either holding a job or actively seeking one.
The 161,146,000 who participated in the labor force equaled 63.1 percent of the 255,562,000 civilian noninstitutionalized population.
Ahead of Friday's report, President Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday: “Stock Market hits an ALL-TIME high! Unemployment lowest in 16 years! Business and manufacturing enthusiasm at highest level in decades!”
Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult men (3.9 percent) and Blacks (7.0 percent) declined in September. The jobless rates for adult women (3.9 percent), teenagers (12.9 percent), Whites (3.7 percent), Asians (3.7 percent), and Hispanics (5.1 percent) showed little change.

Willian scored twice as Chelsea claimed a record-equalling 13th consecutive Premier League victory by beating Stoke 4-2, while Liverpool kept in touch with the leaders after a 1-0 win over Manchester City. Stoke twice hit back to level after falling behind at Stamford Bridge, but Willian's second goal and a late Diego Costa strike saw Chelsea match Arsenal's run of 13 wins in the same season from 2001-02.
Antonio Conte's side remain six points clear of second-placed Liverpool heading into 2017.
“Congratulations go to my players. To win 13 games in a row in this league is very difficult,” Conte said.
“Now they are fantastic and we are proud, but we must concentrate on the second part of the season. Numbers are not important if you do not win the title.”
At Anfield, with Jurgen Klopp and City boss Pep Guardiola meeting for the first time in the Premier League, the clash of managerial heavyweights was a tense affair. Third-placed City had star striker Sergio Aguero back from suspension and they dominated possession for long periods.
But it was Klopp's team who delivered the knockout blow when Dutch midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum headed home from Adam Lallana's cross in the eighth minute to seal Liverpool's fourth successive win.
“When you invest so much in a game like this at the end you want to have it all. Thank God we got it because we play again on Monday,” Klopp said.
“It was difficult. We couldn't create too many chances. We defended really well. It was a wonderful goal.”
Guardiola added: “The first chance they had they scored so it was always difficult.
“In the second half, we were a little better. In this kind of games, the little details make the difference.”
Manchester United came perilously close to seeing their own winning streak end, only for late goals by Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba secured a 2-1 home win over Middlesbrough.
It was sixth-place United's fifth straight league win and took them to within a point of fourth-place Arsenal, who host Crystal Palace on Sunday.
“My players were phenomenal. We managed to do something I love -– bring the fans to the pitch. The last 15 mins were 70,000 on the pitch against 11,” United manager Jose Mourinho said.
Chelsea welcomed back N'Golo Kante and Costa from suspension for the visit of Stoke and took a first-half lead when Gary Cahill headed in a corner from Cesc Fabregas.
Bruno Martins Indi equalised within seconds of kick-off in the second half, slotting in after Peter Crouch nodded down Charlie Adam's free-kick.
After Willian had restored the hosts' lead, lashing in from Eden Hazard's lay-off, Crouch drew Stoke level again in the 64th minute when he tapped in Mame Biram Diouf's cross.
But Willian put Chelsea back in front a minute later and Costa's late strike sealed the victory.
At Old Trafford United produced a comeback reminiscent of the glory years of the watching Alex Ferguson to continue their recent upturn.
But they had to do it the hard way, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic denied an 18th goal of the season in a contentious incident late in the first half.
Leaping to meet Martial's left-wing cross, the Swede jabbed the ball past goalkeeper Victor Valdes at the near post, only for referee Lee Mason to rule it out.
United's players and Mourinho contested the decision, and there was worse to come when Grant Leadbitter drilled Boro in front from Alvaro Negredo's knock-down in the 67th minute.
But Martial levelled in the 85th minute and barely a minute later Pogba headed in the winner from Juan Mata's cross. Champions Leicester City claimed a much-needed win, beating West Ham United 1-0 courtesy of Islam Slimani's 20th-minute header to climb six points clear of the relegation zone.
Swansea City made a demoralising start to life without sacked manager Bob Bradley, slumping to a 3-0 home defeat against Bournemouth that kept them at the foot of the table.
Andre Gray became the first Burnley player to score a Premier League hat-trick as Sean Dyche's men beat third-bottom Sunderland 4-1 to climb to 11th place.
Matt Phillips and Wales's Euro 2016 star Hal-Robson Kanu scored as West Bromwich Albion came from behind to win 2-1 at Southampton, who had centre-back Virgil van Dijk sent off. —AFP

FEDERALLY Administered Tribal Areas or popularly known as FATA is the semi-autonomous tribal region in the north western area of Pakistan, comprising seven tribal agencies and six frontier regions. FATA was considered as a no-go area decades ago as the colonial powers introduced Frontier Crimes Regulation (FCR) for this area. According to FCR, a political agent would be responsible to look after the administration of area and work as a connexion between tribal heads, local populace and colonists. However, it proved difficult for the colonial government to establish its writ in the tribal areas and the introduction of laws were named as black laws as they were without any justification.
British vacated the subcontinent but left their imprints and despite being part of Pakistan, people of FATA felt underprivileged. Under the Constitution, FATA is included among the territories of Pakistan (Article 1). It is represented in the National Assembly and the Senate but remains under the direct executive authority of the President (Articles 51, 59 and 247). Laws framed by the National Assembly do not apply here, unless ordered by the President, who is also empowered to issue regulations for the peace and good government of the tribal areas. FATA for the long time continued to be governed primarily through the Frontier Crimes Regulation 1901 and was also administered by the Governor of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) in his capacity as an agent to the President of Pakistan, under the overall supervision of the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions in Islamabad.
Recently, in a historic move FATA was merged with KP province, therefore people living in FATA will now be able to get rid of centuries' old draconian laws, or Frontier Crimes Regulation. President of Pakistan has signed new set of rules for the region which is now FATA Interim Governance Regulation, 2018. This new ‘FATA Interim Governance Regulation, 2018' is a set of interim rules that apply to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) until it merges with Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa “within a timeframe of two years”. However, the president will have the jurisdiction over FATA and the Provincially Administered Tribal Areas (PATA) until he signs Constitution (Thirty-First) Amendment Bill, 2018, which proposes abolishment of Article 247 of the Constitution. As per Article 247, the executive authority of the federation shall extend to FATA and PATA. This bill was passed by KP Assembly in its final phase and prior to the passing by two-thirds majority, it was approved from the upper and lower chambers of the Parliament.
As both the National Assembly and Senate have passed the bill, this breakthrough step will bring the tribal boundaries which comprises of seven agencies and six frontier regions within domain of the higher courts. The main purpose of FCR was to protect the interests of the British rulers and counter the opposition of Pashtuns to their rule, especially in KP which earlier was NWFP and Baluchistan and their adjoining tribal areas. However, after independence, KP and Baluchistan gradually got rid of FCR, but FATA remained its only hostage. FCR consummate dissociates tribespeople from approaching the formal courts as it states that appeal, wakeel (lawyer) and daleel (evidence) are not applicable for its residents. The other vilest feature of this Black Law is its collective responsibility clause, which is imposed on anyone in the tribal areas for a crime committed by his or her relative or anyone in from the same tribe.
Moreover, officials of the political administration relish unchecked powers under the FCR and the orders given by a political agent cannot be challenged before the high courts. With the FATA merger it is expected that people of these tribal areas will now be able to enjoy equal rights as Pakistani citizen. This merger of FATA isn't a one day giant leap but it took many years for the people of FATA to struggle for their rights. Last year in 2017, FATA Reforms Committee, approved the proposals for administrative structure of FATA and FCR. The most striking feature of the reforms is extension of courts' jurisdiction to FATA without disturbing the traditional Jirga system. The purpose of the plan will be to strengthen administrative structure, mineral development, healthcare, education and industries. The reforms envisaged provincial assembly polls in FATA in the 2018 elections, local bodies' polls and spending of 30 percent development funds through the elected representatives.
This historic merger comes with both opportunities and challenges too. There are many opportunities for the people of FATA now as COAS also mentioned in meeting with FATA youth that the mainstreaming of FATA shall facilitate bringing enduring peace, stability and socio-economic development to the long neglected and terrorism rid tribal area. He also emphasized that youth has to remain aware of inimical forces which want to exploit fault lines and try to reverse our gains. This unification of FATA with KP will bring socio-economic change in FATA with a lot of job opportunities and other social uplift programmes. Though challenges also exist, so the first challenge for this merger of FATA is timely implementation and usage of funds so that common man from particular areas can benefit from it. Interestingly, this merger of FATA gives a big shout out to people like Manzoor Pashteen who are polluting young minds against the state and launching false allegations time and again through social media. As this area remained part of proxy war and was badly hit by terrorism, therefore regional powers having interest in this area because of its location, and they might try to destabilise peace initiatives in FATA. Hence, government has to be more watchful and monitor all the aspects of merger properly.

FOR those who prefer to clean the house in style (or accessorise in that oh-so-chic washing up way), Calvin Klein's $515 rubber gloves are here just for you.
As shown in the brand's spring/summer '18 collection, which showed at New York Fashion Week in September, these pink rubber gloves have finally hit the market, available now on Ssense for a cool $515. Available in a "rose pink" and complete with the Calvin Klein logo at the cuff, the gloves are certainly statement-making, and will go perfectly with the brand's yellow rubber T-shirt or skirt (both $3280), for a full Hitchcock-esque take on daytime dressing.
The rubber gloves by Calvin Klein.
In the Calvin Klein show where the gloves made their debut, the audience was treated to designer Raf Simons' take on horror, with a collection packed with scary-movie motifs straight out of The Shining as well as references to prom gone wrong. Drawing off the season's huge PVC trend (which peaked with Chanel's plastic-focused spring/summer '18 show in Paris) the gloves are yet another take on turning the ordinary into extraordinary - Balenciaga's $2000 Ikea bag, anyone?
So if you're looking for the perfect gift for someone who really, really loves to wash up (or just want to channel serious horror movie feelings with your next purchase), then what are you waiting for?

Tigers pitcher Drew VerHagen (Photo: Robin Buckson, Detroit News)
Arlington, Texas — No regrets.
Right-hander Drew VerHagen, after missing most of last season with Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, went to the Tigers toward the end of spring training and asked them to let him return to being a starting pitcher.
Manager Brad Ausmus, former pitching coach Jeff Jones and current pitching coach Rich Dubee, think his stuff, especially his ability to get ground ball outs, plays better out of the bullpen.
But VerHagen felt the best way to get back to being himself on the mound was to be stretched out as a starter — even though that meant he'd be forfeiting any chance of making the big-league club out of spring. If he was going to start, it would be at Triple-A Toledo.
“I'm happy I did that,” he said. “I got back to being myself on the mound.”
But that's over now. VerHagen accepts his reality now. If he's going to pitch and have success in the big leagues, it's going to be in a relief role.
“Yeah, I think right now that is the case,” he said. “I like being in the 'pen. So if that's where they want me, it's good with me. I want to pitch up here.”
VerHagen made two starts filling in when Michael Fulmer went on the disabled list. He gave up two runs in five innings in his first start, then six in 3.2 innings in his last start. It was after that start that Ausmus decided two things:
VerHagen was going to stay on the roster when Fulmer got back, and that he was going to work out of the bullpen. Bruce Rondon was sent back to Toledo on Sunday.
“I talked with Drew the other day,” Ausmus said. “I said, if he wanted to be a starter, that was up to him. This is just one person's opinion, but I think he'd be better in the bullpen. And he agreed.”
It wasn't a hard sell.
“They're smart, they've been in the game a long time,” VerHagen said of Ausmus and Dubee. “I respect Brad's opinion. If he thinks this is where I'm best suited, I'll go with it.”
Ausmus said he believes VerHagen can be effective both in long relief and also as the seventh-inning set-up man. His fastball velocity, when he pitched out of the bullpen in 2015, was up to 96-97 mph, and with his 12-to-6 breaking ball, he got a high percentage of ground balls.
He's also added a slider to his arsenal, which remains a work in progress.
“It's coming along,” he said. “It's real good when I play catch and throw off flat ground. I need to be better off the mound. I'm trying to make it too nasty instead of just throwing it and trusting my grip.”
What a journey
In the span of a year, right-hander Jeff Ferrell has been injured, rehabilitated, released and re-signed by the Tigers.
But now he's back.
“It was a bit of a different year,” he said. “I was hurt, DFA'd, signed back. I just wanted to get healthy and show that I can pitch.”
He's done that, going 3-1 with a 2.28 ERA at Double-A Erie and Triple-A Toledo this year. He pitched a scoreless inning on Sunday, his first big-league game since the end of 2015.
“I just needed to get some innings under my belt before I could start feeling better,” he said. “I basically took a year off, was hurt all year, and it took a while to get back in a groove. But once I did, I kind of felt it (click).
“I could feel it on the mound and it went from there.”
He finally got to the point where all he was thinking about was getting the batter out and executing pitches — not about how his shoulder felt.
“For guys like Ferrell, VerHagen, Joe Jimenez, they have an opportunity to prove they deserve to be on a major-league roster,” Ausmus said. “Really, the only guys in the bullpen with any kind of track record are Shane Greene and Alex Wilson.”
No Miggy
Miguel Cabrera missed his second straight game with stiffness in the right side of his back.
“He was originally going to play today,” Ausmus said. “But he texted me this morning and said his back tightened again.”
Cabrera will be evaluated again Tuesday. Ausmus explained that this is new pain — located on the right side, opposite the chronic issue he's dealt with on his left side.
“The old injury was more in the (left) hip and can be fixed by realignment,” he said. “This is more muscle in the lower back on the right side.”
Ausmus said there were no plans to put him on the disabled list at this point.
Around the horn
Mikie Mahtook entered the game Monday tied with Mike Trout with the third highest batting average among all center fielders since July 14. His .343 average in that span is bested only by Colorado's Charlie Blackmon (.398) and the Philadelphia Odubel Herrera (.384).
…Daniel Norris will make a rehab start for the Mud Hens on Wednesday.

ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — A rifle-wielding attacker opened fire on Republican lawmakers at a congressional baseball practice Wednesday, wounding House GOP Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana and several others as congressmen and aides dove for cover. The assailant, prepared with "a lot of ammo," fought a gun battle with police before he, too, was shot and later died.
Scalise dragged himself off the infield leaving a trail of blood as colleagues rushed to his assistance.
The shooter was identified as James T. Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old home inspector from Illinois who had several minor run-ins with the law in recent years and belonged to a Facebook group called "Terminate the Republican Party."
Shortly after the shooting, Bernie Sanders, the former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, said on the Senate floor that the shooter apparently was a volunteer for his campaign last year. Sanders said he denounced the violence "in the strongest possible terms."
Capitol Police officers who were in Scalise's security detail wounded the shooter, who was taken into custody. He later died of his injuries, President Donald Trump told the nation from the White House.
"Everyone on that field is a public servant," Trump said. "Their sacrifice makes democracy possible."
Scalise, 51, the No. 3 House Republican leader first elected to the House in 2008, was in stable condition and undergoing surgery. The popular and gregarious lawmaker is known for his love of baseball and handed out commemorative bats when he secured the No. 3 job of House whip several years ago.
Texas Rep. Roger Williams, who coaches the GOP team, said that one of his aides, Zack Barth, was shot, but "is doing well and is expected to make a full recovery." Two Capitol Police officers were also injured but were expected to recover, along with a former congressional aide who was hospitalized.
Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina said he had just left the practice and encountered the apparent gunman in the parking lot before the shooting. The man calmly asked which party's lawmakers were practicing and Duncan told him they were the Republicans. The man thanked him.
The gunman had a rifle and "a lot of ammo," said Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who was at the practice.
The shocking event left the Capitol horrified and stunned. The House canceled proceedings for the day. Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California both spoke on the floor issuing calls for unity. "An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us," Ryan said.
The shooting occurred at a popular park and baseball complex in Alexandria, Virginia, where Republican lawmakers and others were gathered for a morning practice about 7 a.m. They were in good spirits despite the heat and humidity as they prepared for the congressional baseball match that pits Republicans against Democrats. The popular annual face-off, which raises money for charity, is scheduled for Thursday evening at Nationals Park across the Potomac River in Washington, and will go forward as planned.
The team was taking batting practice when gunshots rang out and chaos erupted.
Scalise was fielding balls on second base when he was shot, according to lawmakers present, then dragged himself into the outfield to get away from the gunman.
Rep. Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican, said his colleague "crawled into the outfield, leaving a trail of blood."
"We started giving him the liquids, I put pressure on his wound in his hip," Brooks said.
Texas Rep. Joe Barton, still in his baseball uniform, told reporters a shooter came out to the practice and opened fire, shooting at Rep. Trent Kelly, R-Miss., who plays third base.
"He shot at Steve Scalise, our second baseman. He hit Steve Scalise," Barton said, "Scalise's security detail and the Capitol Hill police immediately returned fire, and Alexandria Police also immediately came and began to return fire. They shot the shooter. The security detail saved a lot of lives because they attacked the shooter."
Barton said the shooting lasted 5-10 minutes, and there were dozens or more of shots fired.
"It was scary," Barton said.
Lawmakers took cover in the dugout. Barton said his son, Jack, got under an SUV.
Texas Rep. Mike Conaway, who was at the game, described what sounded like an explosion, then lawmakers scattering off the field as police roamed in search of the gunman and engaged him.
"The guy's down to a handgun, he dropped his rifle, they shoot him, I go over there, they put him in handcuffs," Conaway said, adding that if the shooter had "gotten inside the fence, where a bunch of guys is holed up in the dugout, it would have been like shooting fish in a barrel."
FBI special agent in charge Tim Slater said it was "too early to say" whether it was an act of terrorism, or whether Scalise was targeted.
Speaker Ryan identified the wounded Capitol Police officers as David Bailey and Crystal Griner. Also wounded was former congressional aide Matt Mika, who now works for Tysons Food in its Washington office. Mika's family said the lobbyist was shot multiple times and was in critical condition and in surgery.
After the gunfire stopped, Sen. Flake, of Arizona, said he ran onto the field and also tried to come to Scalise's aide. After medical personnel arrived, he said he retrieved Scalise's phone and made the first call to Scalise's wife to notify her of the shooting. He said he did so to ensure that Mrs. Scalise would not find out about the shooting through the media.
Falisa Peoples was just leaving the YMCA next to the ball field when she saw the shooter open fire.
"He was just very calm. He was just walking and shooting," she said of the man, whom she described as white and wearing a T-shirt and shorts. She said he was using a long gun and exchanging fire with law enforcement officers, one of whom yelled for her to get down.
Lawmakers were stunned in the aftermath of the event, which raised questions about the security of members of Congress. While the top lawmakers, including Scalise, have security details, others do not and regularly appear in public without protection. The last time a lawmaker was shot was when Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona was hit in the head and grievously injured while meeting with constituents at a supermarket parking lot in 2011.
Following the Giffords shooting, lawmakers have held fewer open town halls and have been advised to increase security at such events.
Thieves left a trail of destruction in their wake after stealing two large dumper trucks from a building site in Leeds last night.
The stolen vehicles were used to plough into CCTV camera posts and bollards leading to a subway under the M1, before being driven across Temple Newsam Park Golf Course.

Police were alerted just before 10.50pm when one of the dumper trucks was driven into a Leedswatch CCTV camera mounted on a post in Kendal Drive, Halton Moor.
The camera was knocked down and the front section of the vehicle overturned.
Two further cameras in the area were later found to have been damaged in the same way.
With support from the National Police Air Service helicopter, the second vehicle was found crashed and abandoned in woodland off Halton Moor Road.
Inspector Mick Preston, who heads neighbourhood policing in east Leeds, said: “The two vehicles that were stolen are very large earth moving machines and the way they were driven over some considerable distance could quite easily have resulted in someone being killed or seriously injured.
“As it is, the incident has caused many thousands of pounds worth of damage to council-operated CCTV cameras, to the golf course, to the two vehicles themselves and to other objects, such as fences, along the route they took.
“We are carrying out extensive enquiries to identify those responsible and are appealing for any information from the public that could assist the investigation."

Enquiries established that the two articulated dumper trucks had been stolen from a construction site in Knowsthorpe Lane.
It was found that they had been driven from the site onto Pontefract Lane through concrete bollards leading to a subway under the M1 and across the golf course, causing damage to the course itself.
Both vehicles were then driven through woods off Halton Moor Road where one vehicle was abandoned, before the other continued on to damage the CCTV cameras.
Forensic examination of both the dumper tracks has taken place.
Insp Preston said: "Witnesses have reported seeing a large number of people around the vehicle at the time it was used to damage the cameras and we are interested in speaking to any of those people.
“This has clearly been a deliberate attempt to disable the CCTV cameras which are there to deter and detect crime and assist in keeping people in that area safe.
“We know the law-abiding majority of people in the area will not condone this sort of behaviour and will support our efforts to find those responsible.
“We have put additional patrols in place to reassure the community while work is carried out to repair and replace the cameras.”

Spoilers ahead for The Handmaid's Tale Season 2 Episode 12. Since returning from the Colonies on The Handmaid's Tale, Emily has quietly endured as a Handmaid again. After one Commander died during a ritual rape, she's off to a new household with a particularly eccentric new figure. So who is Commander Joseph Lawrence on The Handmaid's Tale? Bradley Whitford's character is a wild card in many ways.
While taking Emily to his house, Aunt Lydia describes Lawrence as "a very brilliant, very important man" who is known as the "architect of Gilead's economy." What does that mean, exactly? Later, it is revealed that he had something to do with the labor camps in the Colonies. Handmaids are part of the economy as well — remember Season 1, when the girls feared they were going to be traded to Mexico?
"We're not sure where this guy is coming from," executive producer Warren Littlefield said in an interview with TV Guide. "He is an economic architect of Gilead, and yet he has regrets. He's in a complicated marriage, and Emily is assigned to be a Handmaid at his household. He just doesn't play by any of the rules, and so we are whipsawed with his character, wondering, 'Good guy? Bad guy? I'm not sure.' And that plays to a wonderful conclusion in Season 2."

The vibe at Commander Lawrence's house is bizarre right off the bat. If you were yelling at Emily through the screen to Get Out, you probably aren't alone. It's not the sterile, overtly polite and pious atmosphere that we are used to on The Handmaid's Tale. Lawrence's Martha, — who is missing an eye — sasses Lawrence back when he threatens to beat her. There's eccentric art everywhere, and Lawrence himself is somehow more fashionable than other men in Gilead with an ascot. He doesn't allow Lydia to stay a moment longer than necessary. What is he thinking? Is he hiding something? Is he complicit, evil, or secretly part of the resistance? This man is near impossible to read, and brings an energy to The Handmaid's Tale unlike anything we've seen before.
Lawrence asks for her opinion on laws like penalizing women for first offense reading by cutting off a finger. Later, the two have a frank discussion at the table. While Lawrence is unpredictable, and that can be frightening in Gilead, compared to June's always coded conversations with Fred Waterford in his study, this scene feels a bit more relaxed. "We value privacy in this house," he says to her. He has has clearly read up on Emily's history, somehow. He knows what happened to her before and after Gilead's rise. He also asks her about her circumcision — and, while certainly menacing, it's still unclear what his deal is in that moment.
George Kraychyk/Hulu
The creepiest thing about Lawrence is his wife, who is "ill" and retiring upstairs for the majority of the episode. She talks to Emily in the middle of the night. "Don't tell Joseph that I came out," she whispers, in what feels like a moment of gothic horror. "He doesn't like it when I talk to the girls."
"He did something terrible," she says. "Terrible! He came up with the whole thing. The Colonies. He planned everything. He figured the whole thing out, and I said — real people are digging up that dirt, and it's poison!" At that point, Lawrence intercepts her and takes her back to her room as she screams, calling him disgusting. Do you think that he agreed to take in Emily as a Handmaid because she has been to the Colonies? Is this some kind of self-punishment or attempt at redemption?
"Life didn't turn out the way she wanted it to," Lawrence says to Emily about his wife. "She was an art professor. She wanted everything to be beautiful." How often do you think they get into these arguments?
He also asked Emily what it felt like to run over a guard — is he thinking about rebelling himself, or is he just sadistic? He definitely can't be trusted, but he certainly is an interesting character to watch. With only one episode of The Handmaid's Tale left this season, who knows what will happen with Emily next.
“Unity of the entire Filipino nation is needed particularly those who suffered so much because of the earthquake. The Government and its forces lean forward to provide the fastest and most expeditious assistance our suffering citizens in Surigao need at this time and distractions from criminal activities by armed groups would not be in their best interest,” said Andanar.
Arik Air has suspended its international flight operations to the London and Johannesburg routes.
The spokesman of the Asset Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON), Mr Jude Nwauzor, made the announcement in a statement issued on Tuesday in Lagos.
AMCON had on February 9 taken over the airline following its huge indebtedness to the company and other creditors, both local and foreign.
Nwauzor said the suspension would enable Arik Air to find permanent solution to problems facing its passengers and carry out a thorough assessment of its situation.
He said :”The strategic business decision is meant to realign our operations and refocus on satisfying our domestic and West Africa and other international passengers.
” It will also present Arik with excellent opportunity to engage and discuss with creditors who have become restive since the intervention and have also understandably exhausted their patience due to non-payment of accumulated debt and non-performance on services and contracts.”
Nwauzor said consequent upon this, arrangements were being made to refund all international passengers of the airline that were affected by this decision.
“To our international creditors, Arik is most grateful for your patience and understanding.
“We reassure them that all pending issues with the airline will be duly addressed as a matter of priority as we plan to engage them in this regard,” he added.
According to him, the international route is very critical for the strategic turn around, growth strategy and stability of the airline.
Nwauzor said the airline intends to revisit the routes immediately it addresses all the problems inherited, which was affecting and creating more dissatisfied passenger base.
“We appeal to all passengers to kindly bear with us as the decision is to ensure that the airline adheres strictly to international aviation best practices,” he said.
Flee-Bitten
For three months, things were going really well with this man I was dating. He'd introduced me to his daughter. We'd even planned a trip together. And then he just disappeared. I eventually texted him to find out what happened, but he simply texted back, “Really busy, all good.” This isn't the first time this has happened to me or my girlfriends. Why do men do this? Why don't they tell you what's really going on?
—Upset
When a guy just cuts you off like a bad tree limb, it's tempting to come up with ego-cushioning explanations: He's in a coma! He's trapped in a wooded gully in his crashed car! He's being interrogated at a CIA black site! (“Sorry…Mr. Jones is getting a series of painful electric shocks to his nipples right now and cannot come to the phone.”)
However, the best explanation for this man's disappearance is probably textbook stuff — psych textbook, that is, and specifically a couple of personality traits. One of these is “conscientiousness.” And the bad side of the spectrum is being “low in conscientiousness” — psychologists' term for a person who is careless, irresponsible, impulsive, and lacking in self-control and who habitually ducks his obligations (as if they were flaming arrows).
The other trait is the unfortunately named “psychopathy.” Though it calls to mind shower-stabbing hobbyists, it doesn't necessarily lead to murderous rampages. Still, it isn't exactly the personality trait of angelic hospice nurses, as it's marked by exploitiveness, aggression, poor impulse control, self-centeredness, and a lack of empathy.
Low conscientiousness and psychopathy partner up into an inability or unwillingness to admit to being wrong. Apologizing takes emotional strength and character strength — the conscientiousness and empathy that leave the wrongdoer feeling borderline queasy until they come clean and express remorse to the person they hurt.
It isn't just men who do the disappearo thing; it's anyone low on conscientiousness. The problem is, when love appears to be on the horizon, we want to believe more than we want to see. It's helpful to take an almost pessimistic approach to any new relationship: Assume a man has flaws; figure out what they are; and decide whether any are dealbreakers. This takes observing his behavior over time (at least a year) in a variety of situations — especially crisis situations. You want to know that when the chips are down, a man'll have your back — and not just to use you as a human shield so the SWAT team snipers won't pick him off.
Shudder Speed
Every photo my boyfriend takes of me is horrific (one eye kind of shut, bad angle of my face, etc.). My female friends take decent pictures of me, so it's not like it's impossible. I know my boyfriend loves me and thinks I'm beautiful. Could he be trying to keep other men from being attracted to me?
—Occasional Bride Of Frankenstein
You'd think you wouldn't have to give a man who loves you a detailed list of instructions for photographing you — down to “immediately erase any shots in which I look like I'm having a seizure or bear a strong resemblance to a surprised goat.”
In fact, you are far from alone in complaining that the man you love takes terrible pictures of you — or in worrying that it means something. However, this worry of yours probably comes out of what I call our mind's neatfreakitude. Research by cognitive neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga suggests we get so itchy over mental chaos — being in a state of uncertainty about someone or something — that we're quick to sweep aside inconsistencies and ignore missing information in service of creating a coherent narrative. And then (conveniently!) we turn right around and go with the story we've created — in this case, the suspicion that your boyfriend is plotting to make you look uggo in photographs.
The reality is, if you aren't a professional model being shot by a professional photographer, it sometimes takes dozens of shots to have even one you don't want to delete in horror. (Shoot my long face from above, as my boyfriend sometimes forgets and does, and I look like a movie star — the horse that played Seabiscuit.)
Because men evolved to prioritize physical attractiveness in women and women coevolved to expect this, women are extremely sensitive to being photographed in ways that don't show them off at their sparkliest. That's probably why, if you glance at various 20-something women's Instagram pages, you'll see that many strike the very same pose in photo after photo (having figured out their exact best angle, to the micrometer). Sure, some men are as acutely sensitive about engineering their perfect pose — mostly those whose work attire is a sequined evening dress, a ginormous feather boa, and chandelier earrings the size of New Jersey.

The Serbs can still secure first place with a home win against Georgia on Monday. But Wales was only a point behind Serbia, and Ireland was another point back and still alive after defeating Moldova 2-0 in Dublin.
Wales and Ireland meet on Monday to decide their fate.
GROUP G
Spain defeated Albania with first-half goals by Rodrigo, Isco, and Thiago Alcantara in a match marked by mixed reaction toward Pique, who was booed and applauded by different parts of the crowd of nearly 30,000 fans in Alicante.
Many fans have targeted Pique for being openly critical of the Spanish government's handling of the independence referendum organized by Catalonia on Sunday, when authorities and voters confronted each other in violent clashes.
Italy's chance of winning the group ended with a surprise draw in Turin. Defender Giorgio Chiellini put the Italians ahead shortly before halftime but Macedonia substitute Aleksandar Trajkovski equalized near the end.
"The jeers at the end were deserved looking at how we played after the break," Italy coach Gian Piero Ventura said.
Liechtenstein fell at home to Israel 1-0 for its ninth straight loss. Liechtenstein has been outscored 35 to one.
GROUP I
Iceland was at the top of the group after its stunning 3-0 win at Turkey.
With Finland surprisingly holding Croatia to 1-1 away, and Ukraine taking three points from Kosovo after a 2-0 away win, the tightest group in European qualifying will have to be decided on Monday in the last round of matches.
Iceland leads with 19 points, and Croatia and Ukraine are two points behind. Turkey is out of contention with 14 as well as Finland with 8.
Iceland is a clear favourite when it hosts last-placed Kosovo in its last qualifier, while Croatia has to travel to Ukraine.

The Bulls have lodged complaint with Super Rugby's controlling body Sanzar about what they perceive as deliberate delaying tactics and faking of injuries by the Rebels during their match at Loftus on Saturday.
The Pretoria side beat the Rebels 28-10 to move second on the South African Conference behind the Lions with 19 points and their third victory in a row‚ but the match was spoiled by the Australians' tactics of slowing the game down.
Only two of the five tries scored on the afternoon came in the second half as the Rebels slowed the game with tactics that contributed to what turned out to be a dull affair.
Coach John Mitchell said the negative style of play by their visitors had the potential to hurt the Super Rugby brand.
“I have taken the strategic option by the Rebels to Sanzar‚” Mitchell at Loftus as the Bulls continued preparations for the visit by the Highlanders on Saturday.
“I think it was close to 87 seconds the average stop to start. There was something like over 24 stoppages.
"But we will hear from Sanzar what they say about the future of that development and hopefully common sense will prevail.
“We don't get players faking injuries‚ doctors controlling the speed of the game.... clearly the law that states that player welfare and safety is first and foremost.
"But when it's faked‚ on a frequent basis and is premeditated‚ for me is not where the game should be going. I hope Sanzar sees the common sense in that area.
"I am not sure that it is good for the product if that continues.”
Match referee Ben O'keefe allowed the Rebels players to get away with antics that spoiled the match and Mitchell said he should have stamped his authority and allowed the match to flow. “You must move the guy to the sidelines and we get going‚ it's pretty simple‚" he said.
"Get the guy to the sidelines and we play on.
"If you look at the statistics of the Rebels‚ in the third and fourth quarter they fall away because they are trying to last in the game.
"I don't know if the Highlanders will play that sort of strategy‚ it is not within their mindset to play slowly even though they like to control with the kicking game.”
Rebels coach Dave Wessels admitted after the match on Saturday that they used delaying tactics to try and get advantage.
“Our job is not to come here and entertain the Loftus crowd‚ it is to win for the people of Melbourne‚" Wessels said.
"I should be clear that we wanted to slow the game down at appropriate times and play at the appropriate time.
"For me we are a team that is learning and hoping to get better with time‚ the big learning after this match was the improvement we showed in certain areas but we need to keep on working.”

Hobart City Council is set launch an $800,000 upgrade to the Tasmanian capital's parking system.
Smart Parking is teaming up with Australian Parking and Revenue Control to provide 2,100 sensors that give residents real-time data on available parking spaces. APARC, which is the sole distributor of Parkeon Parking Meters in Australian and New Zealand, will integrate the sensors with Parkeon's 7-inch colour screen parking meters.
According to APARC, Hobart's meters will be the first in Australia to accept payment by Apple Pay. Smart Parking's flush mounted sensors transmit live data to parking enforcement officers and connect to a fully streamed back-office, which can be remotely monitored from any location.
APARC will handle both payments through SimplePay, which is part of the APARC group, and partner with Alternative Dispute Resolution for enforcement.
Smart Parking has over 40,000 vehicle detection sensors installed in 17 countries.

Dawel Lugo (Photo: Mike Janes / AP)
The Tigers are giving Nick Castellanos a shot at playing the outfield, and another position switch might solidify their lineup in the future.
Dawel Lugo, the third baseman acquired from the Diamondbacks in the J.D. Martinez trade, started at second base Sunday for Double-A Erie. It is his first start at second in his pro career.
“Lugo has never played second before but he's a good enough athlete they want to take a look at him for a few games,” Erie manager Lance Parrish told the Erie Times-News. “It all comes down to the needs of the major-league level if they need to shoot him up there.”
Lugo went 1-for-5 with a two-run single in Erie's 14-9 victory over New Hampshire. He did not make any errors. Lugo, 22, who was hitting .244 at Erie entering Sunday, now has four homers and 18 RBIs with the SeaWolves. He's working with infield coach Scott Fletcher at second.
If Lugo can transition to second and Castellanos can move to the outfield, that would leave a clear path for Jeimer Candelario, acquired last month from the Cubs, to take over at third base.
A new study finds roughly half of those enrolled in Michigan's Medicaid program since its expansion have jobs and another quarter unemployed are likely to be in poor health. (Photo: .)
Detroit – A new study finds roughly half of those enrolled in Michigan's Medicaid program since its expansion have jobs and another quarter unemployed are likely to be in poor health.
Authors of the study released Monday by the University of Michigan Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation say the findings raise concerns about work requirements for Medicaid enrollees. The Trump administration urges states to consider changes to Medicaid programs to encourage work and independence and some have asked for work requirements or other waivers.
Lead author Renuka Tipirneni asks if screening and tracking enrollees are worthwhile when a minority aren't employed and are potentially able to work.
The peer-reviewed study is based on surveys of about 4,000 people enrolled in Michigan's program. The findings were published in JAMA Internal Medicine.

London Marathon runners had to battle soaring temperatures as well as the 26 miles of tarmac in a gruelling race on Sunday.
The iconic race saw record temperatures this year as scores of runners bravely battled against the conditions.
Jo Morris
David Hardiman, Matron of the Specialist Medicine Unit and former Cardiac Ward Manager at Peterborough City Hospital was raising money for The British Heart Foundation.
He said: “Sunday was extremely difficult. Not only did we have to train in the worst winter on record we then had to run the hottest London Marathon on record. The heat was something we were all not used to. I started ok but i soon realized that it was just going to be about getting to the finishing line not about a finishing time
“It was so hard and at times I wanted to quit, I hit a wall many times and had severe cramp towards the end,
“How i carried on I don't know. There were people dropping out everywhere. “
Despite the conditions David completed the course in four hours 22 minutes, and reached his £3,500 target for charity.
Jo Morris was another Peterborough runner who struggled in the heat - but was kept going by the support of the crowds lining the streets.
Jo was running for The Teenage Cancer Trust, and has raised nearly £4,000.
She finished the race in four hours 34 minutes, and said: “ It was so hot, even when we left our hotel at 7am, totally clear blue skies, a perfect day but not for a marathon! I felt that it zapped my energy from just a few miles in, we had all trained in such a cold winter and spring - oh the irony
“‘I'm pretty stiff and sore, tired and hungry! Sports massage made a difference but I am taking a rest from running for a few days.”

Radical Gold Underinvestment 4 – Adam Hamilton – Zeal, LLC
Global investors are radically underinvested in gold today. Years of relentless stock-market rallying to endless new record highs have left this classic alternative investment deeply out of favor. But this gold-demand ebb is ending. The same central banks that fueled these extreme stock markets through epic easing are reversing to massive and unprecedented tightening. As stocks roll over, gold investment will return.
Gold is a unique asset class established over millennia that should play a critical role in every investment portfolio. Unlike virtually everything else, gold generally rallies when stock markets inevitably suffer their periodic major selloffs. That effectively makes gold the anti-stock trade. A substantial gold allocation is essential and necessary to diversify and protect stock-heavy portfolios, moderating their overall volatility.
But late in major stock bulls after years of rallying on balance, complacent investors mostly forget about gold. If stocks apparently do nothing but rally indefinitely, then why bother with counter-moving gold? Thus their collective gold allocations gradually slump to unsustainable lows as stock euphoria mounts. The lack of gold investment demand leaves it languishing at relatively-low prices, deeply out of favor like today.
Like nearly everything else in the global markets, gold prices are heavily dependent on investment capital flows. When investors are buying gold in a meaningful way, demand exceeds supply which drives gold's price higher. When they're materially selling, supply trumps demand thus gold's price naturally retreats. This past year or so has been stuck in the middle, with gold investment flows generally neutral on balance.
The definitive arbiter of global gold supply and demand is the World Gold Council. It publishes quarterly Gold Demand Trends reports with the best gold fundamental data available. As these typically come out 5 to 6 weeks after quarter-ends, the Q4'17 GDT hasn't been released as of this writing. But 2017's world gold investment demand current to the end of Q3 still reveals the radical underinvestment in gold these days.
During the first three quarters of 2017, global gold investment demand ran 935.0 metric tons. That was down sharply year-over-year, collapsing 32.6% or 451.4t from the comparable 9 months of 2016! This plunging gold investment demand was more than responsible for the entire 388.1t drop in overall total gold demand in that span. Investment demand is further split out into traditional bars and coins and new ETFs.
Physical-bar-and-coin demand actually proved strong in the first 3/4ths of 2017, rising 13.0% or 87.1t to 755.3t. But ETF demand cratered a catastrophic 75.0% or 538.5t YoY! Due to their ease of trading and trivial commissions compared to physical gold, ETFs have become the gold vehicle of choice for stock investors. And with stock markets surging extraordinarily on taxphoria last year, gold was largely shunned.
Gold exchange-traded funds act as conduits enabling vast amounts of stock-market capital to slosh into and out of physical gold bullion. These big changes in collective buying or selling really move gold. Since the gold ETFs seek to mirror the underlying gold price, they have to shunt excess ETF-share supply or demand directly into actual gold bars. There's no other way for gold ETFs to successfully track their metal.
The world's leading and dominant gold ETF is the venerable American GLD SPDR Gold Shares. Every quarter the World Gold Council also ranks the world's top-ten gold ETFs. At the end of Q3, GLD alone accounted for a whopping 36.9% of their total gold-bullion holdings! GLD was 3.8x largerthan its next biggest competitor, which is the American IAU iShares Gold Trust. GLD is the behemoth of the gold-ETF world.
The supply and demand of GLD shares, and all gold ETFs, are totally independent from underlying gold's own supply and demand. So when stock investors buy GLD shares faster than gold is being bought, the GLD share price starts decoupling from gold to the upside. That is unacceptable, as GLD would fail its mission to track gold. So GLD's managers must vent this differential buying pressure directly into gold.
They do this by issuing sufficient new GLD shares to meet the excess demand. All the money raised by these GLD-share sales is then plowed into physical gold bars that very day. This mechanism enables stock-market capital to flow into physical gold. Of course this is a double-edged sword, as excess GLD-share selling pressure forces this ETF to sell real gold bars to raise the capital to buy back its share oversupply.
What American stock investors are doing with GLD shares is the primary driver of gold's trends! GLD has grown massive since its launch back in November 2004, and acts as a direct pipeline into gold for the vast pools of stock-market capital. Nothing is more important for gold prices now than GLD inflows and outflows. These are very transparent, as GLD reports its physical-gold-bullion holdings daily in great detail.
I call stock-market capital inflows into GLD as evidenced by rising holdings builds, and outflows as seen by falling holdings draws. In recent years there have been plenty of quarters where GLD builds and draws alone accounted for the entire global change in gold demand! Rather incredibly, GLD has grown into the monster tail that wags the global-gold-price dog. American stock investors dominate gold's fortunes.
Amazingly many if not most investors still don't grasp GLD's critical role in gold price trends. They attempt to understand today's gold's price action in historical pre-gold-ETF-era terms. But for better or for worse, the gold world is radically different now. GLD, and to a lesser extent the other large gold ETFs trading in foreign stock markets, changed everything. Gold investors ignoring GLD's holdings are flying blind.
This chart drives home this critical point. It superimposes GLD's daily physical-gold-bullion holdings in blue over the gold price in red. Carved into calendar quarters, gold's performance in each one is noted above GLD's quarterly holdings changes in both percentage and absolute terms. The correlation between GLD's physical-gold-bullion holdings and gold prices is very strong. GLD capital flows explain much for gold.

Detroit — City, community and business leaders kicked off Detroit's annual Angels' Night campaign Friday.
They're looking for a few good men — and women — to volunteer to patrol the city for arsonists and other criminals during the three days around Halloween.
"Each year, we have seen the fires decrease," said Detroit City Council President Brenda Jones. "We're not going to have any this year because you guys are going to keep our streets safe."
Jones made the remarks during a 12:15 p.m. news conference at Hope Park, next to the Crowell Recreation Center on Lahser Road near West McNichols Road on the city's west side.
She was joined by councilman James Tate, Detroit Police Chief James Craig, Detroit Fire Commissioner Eric Jones and other community officials.
Stephanie Young, manager of District One in the city's Department of Neighborhoods, said the campaign had 6,000 volunteers last year and hope to match that number this year.
She said volunteers can drive or walk on patrol or they can even help just by keeping watch from their front porches.
Keith Johnson, 45, and a lifelong Detroiter, said he volunteers every year because it's a way for him to help his community. He encourages others to join him.
"I'm trying to bring the city back," he said. "I'm a homeowner and I want to do something to give back."
Craig reminded residents there will be a curfew in effect for all residents under the age of 17 from 6 p.m. Oct. 29 to 6 a.m. on Oct. 30 and from 6 p.m. Oct. 30 to 6 a.m. Oct. 31. Minors who violate curfew will be ticketed and held until parents or guardians can pick them up. Parents and guardians may also be ticketed.
The deputy fire commissioner also reminded residents there is an ordinance that restricts adults 18 years-old and older from dispensing gasoline into portable containers between midnight Oct. 27 and 11:59 p.m. on Oct. 31. except for emergencies
Officials also announced the city has expanded activities on Halloween for children at all police precincts, several fire stations, recreation centers and parks.
For example, Trunk-or-treat events are planned for each of the city's 11 police precincts and three fire stations on Halloween. There will also be a haunted park at Varier Park, 15639 Thatcher near West Outer Drive and West McNichols Road, and a Halloween Extravaganza at Rouge Park's Brennan Pool. Details will be announced later this month.
Traditionally known as Devil's Night, the night before Halloween was associated with youths pulling pranks and general mischief.
But from the 1970s through the 1990s, the night took a darker turn in Detroit, where Oct. 30 became more known for vandalism and arson. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the city saw between 500 and 800 arsons on Devil's Night.
After fires ravaged the city on Devil's Night in 1994, then-mayor Dennis Archer launched the Angels' Night campaign, calling on stepped-up police patrols, setting a curfew and recruiting thousands of volunteers.
Last year, the city had only 40 fires on the first two days of the Angels' Night campaign. In 2015, there were 52 fires from Oct. 29-31 and only 23 of them were considered suspicious.
"We've changed the whole mentality of Devil's Night," council President Jones said. "It's Angels' Night now."

And the players don't hide that fact. They don't have an inferiority complex, just a realization of how difficult it will be to reach the semifinals in their first shot at European soccer's elite competition, let alone returning in the near future.
Unless a 1-0 deficit can be overturned on Tuesday, it's likely to be a long, long wait before the Champions League returns to the King Power Stadium.
“We are small Leicester,” defender Christian Fuchs said Monday. “Playing in the Champions League is already great, then being in quarter-finals is outstanding. We just enjoy the time that we have. We might never be here again.”
While Atletico is third in La Liga, Leicester has sunk far from the Champions League places in England — 12th in the Premier League it won so unexpectedly last May.
Losing would close a chapter on an improbable eight-year ascent for the Premier League champions.
The quarter-final second leg is being played eight years to the day since the club secured its passage out of English soccer's third tier by beating Southend United.
“The journey has been incredible,” said caretaker manager Craig Shakespeare, who was in his first season on the coaching staff when Leicester won 2-0 at Southend on April 18, 2009. “Where this club has come from has been remarkable.”
That's why writing off the Foxes can backfire.
They were expected to falter in last season's Premier League title race, but the 5,000-1 shots not only improbably lifted the trophy for the first time but seized top spot by 10 points.
Even as Leicester slid down the standings this season, plunged into a relegation fight that cost manager Claudio Ranieri his job, the team still defied expectations in Europe.
As English teams were eliminated — first Tottenham, then Arsenal and Manchester City, Leicester defied the odds once again. It's the last English team standing, but only given about a 3-1 chance of going through with bookmakers while Atletico is the overwhelming favourite.
“Let's show they have got it wrong tomorrow,” Shakespeare said. “We will start as underdogs because of the history of Madrid but we are quite comfortable with that, we know what we have got to do and let's hope we can earn people a few bob (pounds).”
And not crack under the pressure, Fuchs said in response to an Easter egg-themed question.
“That's what everyone is expecting from us anyway, what they expected last season,” the 31-year-old Austrian said. “We have such a great team spirit we don't let it affect us. There's a lot of pressure all the time, this year it was fighting against relegation and we came out of that. We're just looking forward to the game and trying to give everything.”
Captain Wes Morgan could return after missing the last six games with a back injury, including last Tuesday's first leg when Antoine Griezmann's penalty gave Atletico the advantage.
Griezmann was clipped by defender Marc Albrighton but the striker appeared to be just outside the penalty area when contact was made.
“It's not gnawing away, the referee gave his decision and the last thing the club and players need is me harping on about it,” Shakespeare said. “We have to get on with it. The referee made his decision, although it's there for everyone to see it's the wrong one. We have to make sure we're ready and focused for the game.”
WEEI radio host Mike Mutnansky was arrested on Aug. 7 in Saratoga, N.Y. and charged with driving while intoxicated.
Per a press release posted by the New York State Police, troopers observed a gray Toyota Camry that was failing to stay in its lane while traveling down East Avenue in Saratoga. After conducting a routine vehicle stop and subsequent interview, troopers observed that Mutnansky, 37, "illustrated signs of impairment."
Mutnansky, who admitted to officers that he consumed alcohol earlier in the evening, was eventually given several standard field sobriety tests and was arrested for driving while intoxicated. Later testing revealed that Mutnansky had a 0.16 blood alcohol concentration -- well above the legal limit of 0.08 in New York. He is scheduled to appear in the City of Saratoga Court on Friday.
Mutnansky, who hosts WEEI's Red Sox pregame show and was on air Monday as a third host on the "Kirk and Callahan Show," told the Boston Globe's Chad Finn that he was not ready to comment on the situation.
"At the present time, on the advice of counsel, I have no comment," Mutnansky said in an email to the Globe. "As the process plays itself out I will address it at the appropriate time."

Nicky Henderson looks to have another outstanding chance of winning the Scilly Isles' Novices' Chase with Terrefort.
The five-year-old was very impressive when winning for the first time on these shores at Huntingdon last time and for all that this is a big step up in class, the Seven Barrows handler isn't one to tilt at windmills.
The Heroes Handicap Hurdle at 15:00 looks competitive enough but 4/1 favourite Melrose Boy has obvious claims, winning a Class 4 hurdle last time by 50 lengths. He's been well-backed on all his starts and is clearly highly thought of although I wonder if he's better suited to heavier ground than he'll get on Saturday.
Paul Nicholls has enjoyed success in this race in recent years and his Topofthegame is worth a second look stepping up in trip but I'd be concerned about the amount of weight he has to lump here in a big field.
The one that catches the eye at a big price is Okotoks for last year's winning trainer, Fergal O'Brien.
His first run for the yard last month since leaving Tony Martin in Ireland wasn't anything to write home about.
But he was well found in the market that day and subsequently drifted in the betting towards the start of the race suggesting something may have been amiss.
He was unfortunate not to finish third in the Grade 2 Monksfield Novice Hurdle earlier in his career and at 20/1 it's worth chancing that O'Brien can squeeze some more improvement out of him.
In addition, he gets the services of Sean Bowen in the saddle who is yet to finish out of the money in two rides for the yard.
Lucy Wadham and Venetia Williams have accounted for the last four winners of the Masters Handicap Chase at 15:35 and Yala Enki can make it back-to- back victories on Saturday for Williams in the race at 8/1.
Don't forget, Betfair are offering a free bet to the same stake (max £25) with every winner you back at SP 3/1 or bigger on all live ITV races.
He's acquitted himself well in Listed and Graded company so far this campaign and now finds himself back on his last winning mark at a track he's gone well at in the past – he finished third in the aforementioned Heroes Handicap Hurdle in 2015.
6/1 market leader Final Nudge will likely go well dropped in distance but I have concerns about how much the Welsh National will have taken out of him given the awful conditions that day.
Cheltenham Ante Post View – Arkle Chase
Currently the 6/4 favourite for the Arkle, Footpad will look to cement his claims this weekend at Leopardstown as he faces off with old rival Petit Mouchoir, who is currently 7/1 for the Cheltenham prize.
Fourth in last year's Champion Hurdle, Footpad has begun his chasing career with aplomb, winning both his starts by 11 lengths, the most recent being the Grade 1 Racing Post Novice Chase on Boxing Day.
Victory on Saturday will no doubt see his Arkle price contract further and while there's some talk of him perhaps being re-routed to the JLT due to the same owners having current second favourite Sceau Royal 5/1 also entered, it seems likely that they'll both line up in March.
At a bigger price, Dan Skelton's North Hill Harvey has already won twice over fences at Prestbury Park this season and while he was put firmly in his place at Sandown by Sceau Royal, the 16/1 currently on offer makes plenty of each-way appeal.
Lawmakers Weigh Pros And Cons Of Mandatory Screening For Postpartum Depression
Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Wendy Root Askew Courtesy of Wendy Root Askew
Lawmakers in California will begin debate next month on a bill that would require doctors to screen new moms for mental health problems — once while they're pregnant and again, after they give birth.
But a lot of doctors don't like the idea. Many obstetricians and pediatricians say they are are afraid to screen new moms for depression and anxiety.
"What are you going to do with those people who screen positive?" says Dr. Laura Sirott, an OBGYN who practices in Pasadena. "Some providers have nowhere to send them."
Nationally, postpartum depression affects up to 1 in 7 women during or after pregnancy, according to the American Psychological Association.
And of women who screen positive for the condition, 78 percent don't get mental health treatment, according to a 2015 research review published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology.
Sirott says her patients give a range of reasons why they don't take her up on a referral to a psychologist: " 'Oh, they don't take my insurance.' Or 'my insurance pays for three visits.' 'I can't take time off work to go to those visits.' 'It's a three-month wait to get in to that person.' "
She says it's also hard to find a psychiatrist who is trained in the complexities of prescribing medications to pregnant or breastfeeding women, and who is willing to treat them, especially in rural areas.
"So it's very frustrating," Sirott says, "to ask patients about a problem and then not have any way to solve that problem."
Moms are frustrated, too. After the baby comes, no one asks about the baby's mother anymore.
Wendy Root Askew struggled for years to get pregnant, and when she finally did, her anxiety got worse. She couldn't stop worrying that something would go wrong.
"And then, after I had my son, I would have these dreams where someone would come to the door and they would say 'Well, you know, we're just going to wait two weeks to see if you get to keep your baby or not,' " Root Askew says. "And it really impacted my ability to bond with him."
She likes California's bill, AB 2193, because it goes beyond mandated screening. It would require health insurance companies to set up case management programs to help moms find a therapist, and connect obstetricians or pediatricians to a psychiatric specialist.
"Just like we have case management programs for patients who have diabetes or sleep issues or back pain, a case management program requires the insurance company to take some ownership of making sure their patients are getting the treatment they need to be healthy," says Root Askew, who is now advocating for the bill on behalf of the group 2020 Mom.
Health insurance companies haven't taken a position on the legislation. It's unclear how much it would cost them to comply, because some already have infrastructure in place for case management programs, and some do not. But there is consensus among insurers and health advocates that such programs save money in the long run.
"The sooner that you can get good treatment for a mom, the less expensive that condition will be to manage over the course of the woman's life and over the course of that child's life," Root Askew says.
Some doctors still have their objections. Under the bill, they could be disciplined for not screening. Some have said they worry about how much time it would take. What if a doctor asks a mom how she's sleeping, and she's in tears for the next 30 minutes?
The health care system, and the incentives, aren't set up for this sort of screening, Sirott says.
"Currently, I get $6 for screening a patient," she says. "By the time I put it on a piece of paper and print it, it's not worth it."
It's not clear the direct and indirect costs of screening would be worth it to the patients either. Four other states — Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and West Virginia — have tried mandated screening, and it did not result in more women getting treatment, according to a study published in Psychiatric Services in 2015.
Even with California's extra requirement that insurance companies facilitate care, women could still face high copays or limits on the number of therapy sessions. Or, the new mothers might be so overwhelmed with their care for a newborn, that it would be difficult to add anything to the busy schedule.
What does seem to work, according to the study of mandated screening in other states, is when nurses or mental health providers visit new moms at home.
"Despite abundant good will, there is no evidence that state policies are addressing this great need," the study's authors report.
Supporters of California's proposed bill, however, say doctors need to start somewhere. Screening is the first step in recognizing the full scope of the problem, says Dr. Nirmaljit Dhami, a Mountain View, Calif., psychiatrist. Women should be screened on an ongoing basis throughout pregnancy and for a year after birth, Dhami says, not just once or twice as the bill requires.
"I often tell doctors that if you don't know that somebody is suicidal it doesn't mean that their suicidality will go away," she says. "If you don't ask, the risk is the same."

Iran Should be Dealt in Different Way
The United States new President Donald Trump decision to quickly slap new sanctions on Iran after it conducted a ballistic missile test clearly signals the hard turn the new administration intends to take with Tehran. Neutralizing the Iranian threat in the Middle East has been an American aim since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Arabs and Israelis alike will cheer Trump's current hard line on Iran. But Iran is among the toughest foreign policy challenges United States have faced and President Trump should be careful to avoid ill-planned early actions against Iran which may turn out to be blunders. The Trump administration is totally mistaken if it believes that a ratcheting up of pressure, coupled with closer policy alignment with Israel and Saudi Arabia, will force an Iranian retreat in the region. The Islamic Republic is too deeply entrenched in the region's conflict zones and it will nearly impossible to impose any a quick retreat. By all credible accounts, Iran can firmly stand its ground even if it risks a major crisis in US-Iranian relations. Iran is a hardened adversary, despite its political isolation it is very much required to eradicate the Islamic State from the region. So rather than being isolated Iran should be engaged.
The U.S. and other world powers took years to find a common ground with Iran, which prevented the country from acquiring nuclear weapons in return for removal of international sanctions. The deal, which was called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) allowed Iran to mend ties with European countries, boost its oil production and trade with other countries, thereby minimising the pain its people had suffered due to economic sanctions. This resulted in empowering the hands of Iranian moderates who wants integration of Iran with Western economies. This progress stands threatened by President Trump's current hostility towards Iran. Recent sanctions could strengthen hard-liners in the Iranian regime who are seeking to escalate tensions with the United States. There is a certain equation between the US and Iran. If Iran provokes and the US does not react, Iran's deterrent power goes up because it learns it can do these provocations with no consequences. Surely Iran has carried out provocative activities like- carried out additional missile tests, stepped up its military presence in Syria and tries to provide “game-changing weapons” to Hezbollah.
This all should not be ignored by the United States but it should not be dealt in the way like Trump administration is doing now. All the current measures which has been taken are counterproductive. There is an urgent need to develop some new options to deter and contain Iranian activities of concern. Some of the measures which can work in current situation are following:
Diplomatic engagement– The White House and State Department should look for opportunities to expand bilateral contacts, and to identify areas for cooperation. Beginning with work in multilateral settings on global and transnational problems may be more productive than an early focus on regional or bilateral issues, which will remain fraught for all parties.
Heavy US Military Presence- Heavy military presence in the region will be an essential part of the US strategy, even if deployment numbers and other quantitative metrics vary over time. The larger message to Iran, will be that the United States has vital interests in the region, an enduring commitment to regional stability, and an interest in preventing interstate conflict and intrastate destabilization.
Negotiations on ballistic missiles program – The strategy will need to delineate what aspects of Iran's long-term commitment to developing this capability are unacceptable. Iran is unlikely to entirely roll back this program, which derives from its vulnerability to Iraqi missiles in the Iran- Iraq war. But the United States may be able to define some parameters to reduce the risks of miscalculation by Iran or its neighbours. While urging Iran to reduce the size and scope of the program, and make clear its conventional weapon only mission.
No country in the Middle East has Iran's combination of geographic size, strategic location, large and educated population. Iran has been the most effective country at leveraging the ongoing disorder across the Middle East to expand its regional influence. Tehran has done this by providing substantial political, military and financial backing to allies and proxies in Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Iran now stands at the apex of arc of influence stretching from Tehran to the Mediterranean, from the borders of NATO to the borders of Israel and along the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula. It commands the loyalties of tens of thousands in allied militias and proxy armies. They have been joined by thousands of members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran's most prestigious military wing, who have acquired meaningful battlefield experience in the process. So it is nobody interest to press Iran to behave more militantly rather it should be engaged at various levels to promote the Islamic republic to play a constructive role to strengthen stability in the region.

A former championship body builder has been found guilty of sexually assaulting a child aged just four-years-old.
Jenev Varghese, 32, a personal trainer from Luton, was convicted of two counts of sexually assaulting a child under the age of 13 at Luton Crown Court on Friday.
During the trial the jury heard how Varghese sexually assaulted the young girl on a number of occasions and threatened to kill her family if she spoke out.
Detective Constable Samantha Shane, of the Bedfordshire Police Public Protection Unit, said: “Varghese took advantage of a young child in the worst and most sickening way possible and I am pleased that he will be made to pay for his actions.
“We are absolutely committed to tackling child sex abuse, clamping down on dangerous individuals such as Varghese while providing support and justice to victims. I'd like to praise the victim and her family for the bravery they have shown in coming forward and having to relive the experience in court.”
Varghese was remanded in prison ahead of sentencing on 8 September.
Iowa gov orders flags to half-staff for newspaper deaths
DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has ordered flags on state grounds to be flown at half-staff to honor five employees of a Virginia newspaper shot to death last week.
The Iowa order asks that U.S. and state flags be flown at half-staff Tuesday until sunset.
Iowa will join Annapolis, Maryland, and other states lowering U.S. flags in honor of those killed at the Capital-Gazette. President Donald Trump has also ordered U.S. flags on federal property to be flown at half-staff.
Jarrod Ramos is charged with murder in the attack Thursday in Annapolis.
Authorities said Tuesday that Ramos had sent letters the day of the shootings to two judges and an attorney, seeking to justify the shootings as vengeance after losing a 2012 defamation lawsuit against Capital Gazette Communications.

JAKE DANNA STEVENS / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Kathleen Haikes, left, is running the Steamtown Marathon in honor of Reese Thomas. For more marathon coverage, see Sports Pages B1, B8-12.

As Kathleen Haikes tests her limits during the last few miles of the Steamtown Marathon on Sunday, she'll repeat one name in her mind.
“Reese Thomas. Reese Thomas. Reese Thomas.”
When the Scranton woman thinks of the 45-year-old resident of St. Mary's Villa in Elmhurst Twp., she thinks of strength.
Haikes, 43, met Thomas in August, when she brought a group of volunteers to the skilled nursing facility where he recently moved after suffering severe brain injuries in a 1990 car crash. He wore a Steamtown Marathon shirt. She caught a glimpse of his smile
as she handed out bingo prizes.
“You stole my heart that day,” Haikes told him recently. “You're what gets me through this.”
Thomas smiled.
That smile reminds Haikes of the smile of her brother, Matthew Newell, who died at 24 in 2010. After his death, Haikes and her family started the nonprofit organization Matthew's Mission and hold annual breakfasts with Santa, which supports the purchase of Christmas gifts for children with special needs. Thomas' birthday — Aug. 19 — is the same day Newell died. After Newell's death, Haikes, the volunteer coordinator for Traditional Home Health and Hospice, started running to clear her mind of grief.
At 17, Thomas was a passenger in a vehicle that crashed. The impact threw him from the vehicle. His parents, Betsy and Reese, didn't know if their son would make it. The then-junior at Riverside who excelled on the football and baseball fields suddenly had a very different future.
“If Reese didn't fight, he wouldn't be where he is today,” his mom said. “It wasn't his time.”
After nearly 30 years, countless therapy sessions and support from others, his sense of humor remains. He smiles when someone tells a joke and speaks occasional words. Thomas enjoys attending RailRiders games with his dad and loves to watch his nephew, Adam Samitz, play football for Old Forge. Thomas is the proud uncle of two nieces and four nephews.
Betsy Thomas said she is honored that her son inspires someone.
“She's a wonderful person,” the mom said of Haikes.
After hopefully finishing the 26.2-mile race on Sunday, Haikes plans to give the medal to Thomas.
“The medal signifies strength, and he has such strength to live his life,” Haikes said. “The more I hear about his life. ... He's stronger than I'll ever be because of the life he's been given.”

North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has been briefed on a plan to fire missiles near Guam, home to US air and naval bases, Pyongyang's state media said Tuesday.
Kim "examined the plan for a long time" and "discussed it" with commanding officers on Monday during his inspection of the command of the Strategic Force in charge of the North's missile units, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
North Korea's military said last week that it would finalise by mid-August its detailed plan to test-fire four intermediate-range ballistic missiles in an "enveloping fire" around Guam and report it to its leader for approval.
Tensions have been mounting since the North tested two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month, which appeared to bring much of the US within range.
Responding to the tests, US President Donald Trump warned Pyongyang of "fire and fury like the world has never seen".
The North in turn threatened to test-fire its missiles towards the US Pacific island of Guam.
The war of words has sparked global alarm, with world leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping urging calm on both sides.
South Korean President Moon Jae-In also waded in on Monday, calling for calm in the standoff with North Korea, saying there should never be another war on the peninsula.

US will take out any missile seen as hitting Guam: Mattis
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said that the United States would know the trajectory of a missile fired by North Korea within moments and would "take it out" if the missile looked like hitting the US Pacific territory of Guam.
Mattis told reporters that war could break out if North Korea were to fire a missile at the United States.
"If they fire at the United States, it could escalate into war very quickly," Mattis said. The United States would know the trajectory of a North Korean missile "within moments" and if a missile is assessed to be hitting Guam, "we will take it out," he said.
Mattis said that if a North Korean missile were headed toward the waters near Guam, instead of aimed directly at the island, then the president would decide what action to take.
Concern that North Korea is close to achieving its goal of putting the mainland United States within range of a nuclear weapon has caused tension to spike in recent months.
Tension on the Korean peninsula eased slightly on Monday as South Korea's president said resolving North Korea's nuclear ambitions must be done peacefully.
World stocks rose along with US Treasury yields and the US dollar as investors regained an appetite for riskier investments amid an easing of Korea tensions.

YERUSHALAYIM (Reuters) - Police are expected to question Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu at his official residence in Yerushalayim on Monday on suspicion of receiving gifts from businessmen in breach of his role as a public servant.
The move was authorized by Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit, who decided after a preliminary probe that there was sufficient evidence for a criminal investigation, Haaretz newspaper reported. The questioning will take place on Monday evening, Israel Radio said.
The police and Justice Ministry would not confirm when the interview would take place or the nature of the investigation, details of which have appeared in the media in recent days. Netanyahu's office has denied any wrongdoing.
“All the supposed affairs will turn out to be fiction,” his family spokesman said on Monday. “We are repeating: There will be nothing, because there is nothing.”
Photographers were camped outside the heavily guarded residence, hoping to get pictures of investigators arriving. Black screens were erected inside the gates of the property to block the view.
Haaretz and other newspapers said the probe related to gifts worth “hundreds of thousands of shekels” given to Netanyahu by Israeli and foreign businessmen.
Channel 2 said the investigation was one of two cases now open against the prime minister, although it said details of the second remained unclear.
Netanyahu is not the first prime minister to be questioned in a criminal case.
Ehud Olmert, who held office from 2006 to 2009, is currently serving 18 months in prison after being convicted of breach of trust and bribery in 2014.
Former prime minister Ariel Sharon was questioned while in office in 2003 and 2004 over allegations of bribery and corruption involving him and his two sons. In 2006, his son Omri was convicted of corruption and served time in prison.
Netanyahu's police appointment drew a barrage of commentary from the opposition MKs, with politicians calling for him to go.
Ahead of a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu responded, saying, “I suggest the opposition calm down.”
Israeli commentators pointed out that while Netanyahu may be questioned, it has happened many times in the past and prime ministers have gone on governing, sometimes for years.
What if I were to tell you that we knew all the best practices for software development? That they've been proven by actual industry use over the past 25 years? But that, oddly, these practices are not widely done? Well, if you read these pages, you'd probably say: "Sound about right."
Agile is much spoken of, but not as broadly practiced as you may think. It's as if we all knew that the best way to cook a fine T-bone is to first let it come to room temperature – perhaps with a healthy handful of the de Camargue – but instead we just regularly yank it out of the fridge and throw it on a cold pan.
O rly? You've been doing agile since AS/400s?
When I talk with large organisations, all too often they legitimise themselves by telling me how many certified Scrum Masters they have. From the hundreds I hear about, they've setup some kind of factory that's just rolling them off the line. Now, there's nothing wrong with scrum or certification, but it is an odd thing to use as a marker for agility. What matters more, of course, is if the developer teams are actually doing it.
Commenting on his team's experience doing agile, Lt Col Enrique Oti explained the situation this way: "'Agile'. That word should not be used in the government. It's used everywhere. Everyone in the government now does agile training. Every organisation I go to [claims to do] agile development. I went to an organisation recently who'd been working on a project for six years doing agile. They had a Scrum Master! And I said: 'When does your user ever see your code?' and their answer was: 'Never.'"
Although he's talking about the US government and military, in my experience his statement applies many large organisations.
Surveys back this up as well, such as Gartner's annual agile survey. What's astonishing about this survey is how honest respondents apparently are: looking over the results you quickly get a picture that just about half of the organisations surveyed are agile. Summing it up this past June, Mike West points out that 41 per cent of respondents is doing agile with 41 per cent more doing waterfall, and the rest doing other methodologies.
Perhaps it's the $1,295 price tag on these 15 pages of astounding findings from our friends in Stamford, but a shockingly low amount managers seem to be sandbagging on finally moving to agile after a quarter of a century. (Of course, for the cheap, the DevOps Reports can get you a free version of these findings, plus a wonderful selection of Portland hipster visages.)
In general, then, it's wise to be sceptical of any claims about an organisation being agile.
Wagilefall
Even when development teams have nailed agile, pumping out builds weekly gleefully (or, monthly for the languid), as Oti points out above, they often are not able to actually deploy their code to production.
In cases like this, as venerable agile expert Israel Gat told me: "Organisations learned how to fake agile. Many of the agile implementations I witness are actually waterfall on top of agile, waterfall using agile terms." The teams are speedily working through things, seemingly moving fast, and that's what agile's all about, right? They're an agile dynamo trapped in a decadent waterfall process: wagilefall.
Mismatches like this are widespread and, to my mind, are a massive reason why DevOps is so attractive to those who dare enter that labyrinth of definitional confusion. It's been illustrative to think about this divide between fast-moving developers and never-wanting-to-deploy ops teams as a "wall": developers throw the build over this all to release management, walking away dusting off their hands as if everything is done.
Rather than bricks, this wall seems to be built out of help desk tickets. Filing away those requests to set up staging and production environments, let alone even the simplest resources like a licence for an IDE. And when it comes to actually deploying a build to production, file all the tickets you want, bub, you'd better schedule up some meetings if you want something that ground-shaking.
But think of all those 'nice gates'”!
Resistance to change is, of course, not a new occurrence when it comes to IT. That said, again, the memos have been circulating for a good 25 years. Despite this, it's wise to be empathetic to staff who see going agile as simply more busy work for them. Donna Fitzgerald quoted one of her clients as saying: "It meant throwing away everything I spent years building. All my nice gates and all my vast number of required documents. It meant changing out the tools we use. It also meant that we needed to change our mindset about what was important and what the organisation actually wanted us to do."
Yes, indeed, there's much work to be done after the old artefacts of comfort are thrown out. I recently had a conversation with a similarly beset person in a large organisation. There were so many agile methodologies in practices, along with the existing "waterfall" processes, that a team had been put together to map and rationalise this rat's nest of processes into a unified handbook of sorts. You can imagine how that project was turning out.
Blame management
As ever, one of my core theories about improving how software is done is that, more than likely, management is largely at fault for previously hollow victories. In addition to the numerous reasons for staff resistance, management is often unwilling to follow through on the changes needed to bust through a wagilefall.
Do the infrastructure Morlocks hide behind a wall of tickets? Well, the developers aren't going to be able to change that: they'll need management to come in and burn down that wall. Are you getting ensnared in compliance and enterprise architect dead-ends? Again: management.
There are plenty of enlightened managers, but you'd be wise to figure out if you're working for them whether you're on some sort of path to agile awesomeness. If you find them wanting in vim, perhaps they're kind enough to take suggestions – if you're lucky.
Sure, it'll get worse before it gets better
When I talk to people who have reached the other side of going agile, they tend to find that they're accomplishing the same goals of quality software, even with the same benefits of governance and discipline. They're just able to do those tasks more efficiently. Instead of doing audits after the fact, staying up late into the night and working through the holidays, compliance people can automate much of the raw information collection and leave work on time. With smaller chunks of code in each cycle, operations staff realises that diagnosing any errors in deploys is more straightforward. Project managers, previously beset with putting together complex status reports that no one seems to ever actually read, find much more meaning in their work.
Somewhere in there, you'd hope, there's also an improvement to the actual software and the end user's experience, which usually trundles along for the ride. The studies tend to bare this out. As West put it commenting on the agile survey: "Successful agile organisations show significantly higher use of unit testing, DevOps, continuous delivery, continuous integration, test-driven development and refactoring, when compared with unsuccessful organisations."
More importantly: please, let the T-bone rest for a while before cooking it. Otherwise, you could have just gotten by with a much cheaper flank steak. ®

National Zero Waste Council says consumers are confused about what best-before
A national study says confusing and unnecessary best-before labels are a major cause of food waste in Canada.
The National Zero Waste Council says consumers are confused about what best-before labels actually mean.
It says most dates that appear on products refer only to peak quality and have little to do with whether the food is healthy to eat.
Research has found that almost 400 kilograms of food per person are lost or wasted in Canada every year — one of the highest totals in the world.
The council says consumers are responsible for almost half that waste.

A former Biggleswade carer has been sentenced to four months imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, after being found guilty of the neglect of a vulnerable adult.
Ramatu Sarah Airemen, 61, of New Bedford Road, Luton, was one of two night staff on duty at a care home in Biggleswade on 22 June 2011. During her shift, an 86-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease fell off a chair and needed assistance.
However, upon finding him, Airemen swept around him and spoke to colleagues, leaving him on the floor for over an hour. Airemen's colleague then fetched a wheelchair, and both hauled the elderly man into it without a hoist, disregarding the correct procedure. Relevant documentation, including accident forms and handovers, were not completed.
The incident was caught on CCTV by a camera fitted by the care home manager, who had become concerned with the standard of Airemen's work.
Airemen was dismissed and when interviewed by police, she told officers she had used a hoist to lift the victim into the wheelchair - then initially denied she was the person on CCTV when confronted with the evidence.
Even though she knew of the patient's medical history, having read his care plans, and knew he was prone to falls, she told officers she had assumed he had put himself on the floor.
Airemen was convicted of neglect following a trial at Luton Crown Court. She was sentenced last week to four months' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, and ordered to carry out 200 hours' unpaid community work. Her co-defendant, a 42-year-old woman was convicted at an earlier trial.
Detective Constable Ian Clarke from Bedfordshire Police's Child Abuse & Vulnerable Adult Abuse unit (CAVAA), said: “Airemen was fully aware of the patient's medical history, and knew a previous fall had required hospital treatment for a hip injury. By assuming he had put himself on the floor and not attempting to communicate with him, she completely neglected his welfare.”
Kendrick Lamar's victory lap continues. The rapper closed the first weekend of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival Sunday night — like most Coachella performers, he'll return at the same time next weekend — with a set that blew through social media thanks to live-streaming and widespread interest in his new material. Lamar's intensely anticipated new album, DAMN., came out Friday (stream it here), and live debuts of its songs highlighted and bookended his sprawling, career-spanning, 19-song set list.
As they are with DAMN. itself, fans are still digesting Sunday's performance, pieces of which are scattered across the Internet via YouTube footage. Given the setting, high-profile guests (including ScHoolboy Q, Future and Travis Scott) were a given, but fans were also treated to high-wire acrobatics and an appearance by the "Kung Fu Kenny" alter ego who pops up throughout DAMN. Reviews of his set have been effusive, while footage of Lana Del Rey enjoying the set went momentarily viral overnight.
In other first-weekend news, Lorde premiered a new song called "Homemade Dynamite" and briefly covered Kanye West's "Runaway." Someone (definitely not Lorde) was arrested for allegedly stealing more than 100 cell phones. Drake accused a country club of racial profiling on Instagram before deleting the post.
So what will next weekend's Coachella bring, besides most of the same performers and hopefully not quite so much pick-pocketing? Stay tuned.
A stuntwoman has been killed after a motorcycle stunt went wrong on the Vancouver set of the movie Deadpool 2.
A female stunt driver has died on the set of Deadpool 2 in downtown Vancouver during the filming of a stunt on a motorcycle.
Local media reported that the stuntwoman appeared to lose control of the vehicle, which drove off the set and through the window of a building across the street.
A representative for movie studio 20th Century Fox, a unit of Twenty-First Century Fox, did not immediately respond to Reuters for comment.
The sequel to the 2016 superhero movie Deadpool starring Ryan Reynolds is being filmed in Vancouver. Production began in late June.
"Vancouver police can confirm that a female stunt driver has died on the set of Deadpool during a stunt on a motorcycle," the Vancouver PD said in a statement on Monday.
The news follows another stunt accident reported by TMZ on Sunday when Tom Cruise crashed into a wall while filming Mission: Impossible 6, and appeared to walk away with a limp. The extent of his injuries are currently unknown.
Gruelling days on the campaign trail may be for the birds, but at least NDP Leader Andrea Horwath now has a place for them to eat. Horwath was presented with an elaborate red oak birdhouse in Sarnia on Wednesday.

It was handmade by local craftsman Bob Stennett, who said he spent “95 to 100 hours” building it. “It's a special one I made for her,” Stennett said proudly. “I do a lot for sick children and charities and special people. She is a very special person and I made it for her. You want to believe it — she's going to be the premier.”

Call it puppy love. The NDP has featured some cute pups at their campaign stops, and on Wednesday, the PC tour stopped at a family farm near Sarnia with a 4-month-old beagle Snoopy, whose story stole everyone's hearts. Snoopy's mother gave birth to a litter of 10 pups, and he was the sole survivor. “The other pups just weren't developed, they only lived for four or five days,” said Linda Reid, whose family hosted the Doug Ford campaign event in Reeces Corners. “He was the biggest of the litter — he's a fighter.” They bought small baby bottles and fed him special formula from the pet store, around the clock — every four hours — starting when Snoopy was two days old. “It was like having a baby,” she laughed. “And he'd let you know it — he'd start crying” when he got hungry. Snoopy was named by one of the grandchildren, “because she said he was always snooping around everything.”

February 2, 2018 (JUBA) -South Sudanese warring parties have renewed clashes in the oil-rich town of Tharjath, south of state capital Bentiu several eyewitnesses and area residents have told Sudan Tribune on Friday.
The clashes erupted in the western part of Tharjath, an oil facility located 60 kilometres away south of Bentiu town.
“This morning we could hear heavy artilleries coming from Tharjath toward Bieh and Buow. It is heavy fighting as we speak, we are hiding in the swamp,” a resident of told Sudan Tribune when reached by telephone.
SPLA-IO deputy spokesperson Col. Lam Paul Gabriel confirmed the fighting and accused South Sudan Army of the attacking their forces in the area.
“This afternoon at about 13:00hrs, the regime forces attacked our positions in Bieh, Mirmir, and Buoh in Koch County, Liech State,” he said.
He claimed their forces have repulsed the assault after three hours of fighting, stressing that civilians were fled their homes fearing to be caught in the clashes.
“Many civilians have been displaced into the bushes and nearby swamps for protection. This is a confirmation that the regime is not for peace but war,” he added.
Meanwhile, on Thursday he said government troops that came from Kaya camped in Dudulabe with the intention of attacking their positions around Yondu, Morobo county, in the Yei River State.
He renewed calls on the ceasefire monitor body (CTSAMM) to investigate what he termed as "cowardice attack" in Morobo and Koch counties ahead of upcoming peace talks.
The newest fighting occurred as the U.S administration announced a ban on arms sales to South Sudan days before the peace revitalization talks to resume next Monday.

The Agriculture Ministry confirmed an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N6 bird flu at a duck farm in Yeongam, South Jeolla Province, Monday.
This is the fourth confirmation of highly pathogenic bird flu this season.
The government on Monday culled some 76,000 ducks at five farms located within a 3-kilometer radius of the original farm where the highly pathogenic strain of bird flu was detected. Since Monday midnight, a transportation ban was issued on all livestock industry persons across Daejeon, Gwangju, Sejong, South Chungcheong and South and North Jeolla provinces.
Authorities vaccinate duck farms (Yonhap)
Yeongam is about 380 kilometers south of Seoul. The rural region is home to one of Korea's biggest duck farms. Together with the adjacent Naju, the area accounted for 52 percent of the entire domestic duck produce in the third quarter of this year.The farm where the virus was detected is one that supplies breeding ducks to other farms. About 10 farms were found to have taken ducklings from this farm in recent month. The trucks that transported the baby ducks made visits to some 30 other farms over the month, raising the possibility of secondary infection.By Lim Jeong-yeo ( kaylalim@heraldcorp.com

BRAWLEY — The nominees for Brawley City Council's election on the November 7 ballot have been announced with two seats up for grabs.
Incumbent Sam Couchman, now serving as mayor, and Helen Noriega, mayor pro-tempore, are both running for re-election. Their terms end December 31, 2017.
New candidates Roman Castro and Luke Hamby will challenge the incumbents for their seats.
Castro is a professional organizer at the Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 569.
Hamby is a local construction business owner and musician/actor.
Also on the ballot is Measure W, the Brawley Utility Users Tax (UUT.) The current UUT is four percent and funds approximately 15 percent of the city's general fund. It is set to expire in May 2018.
According to Brawley City Manager Rosanna Bayon Moore, if the UUT measure fails to pass in November's election, the result will cause a reduction in many city services, including fire and police services.
Additionally, Measure X on the November ballot poses a question to voters on whether the office of the Brawley city treasurer should become an appointed position instead an elected one.
Other items on the November ballot include school board and Imperial Irrigation District seats throughout Imperial County.
Dear Amy: My boyfriend and I have been on/off for the last five years.
During the time we were apart, he had another girlfriend. I didn't know about her. He and I maintained a “friends with benefits” relationship during our breaks.
After I became pregnant with his child, I found out that they were very serious. I learned that she was pregnant, too. Our sons were born nine days apart.
They are no longer together, and he and I are trying to work things out, but I can't seem to let their relationship go.
I know that Facebook isn't “life,” but it bothers me that their entire relationship was broadcast on FB, but he won't even acknowledge us as being in a relationship.
He has never posted a picture of us or of our son.
He says he's ashamed of himself (not of me), but I can't help but feel like he's not being truthful. I think he's ashamed of me.
He tells me all the time: “You're not her,” which makes me feel like he wishes he wasn't with me. He says I'm being insecure, and that he's never going to care about Facebook.
I just don't get why he could care about his Facebook status when he was with her, but not with me?
Am I being stupid?
— Worried
Dear Worried: When you ask me if you're being “stupid,” you run the risk of supplying me with a descriptor I'd rather not apply to a woman with a young child. However, this whole situation is unfortunate — because Rome is burning and you're worried about your Facebook status.
I do agree that this status is a sign of where your guy's priorities are, and while I'm not inclined to side with him, I do appreciate his embarrassment over fathering two babies (days apart) with two different women. Yes, he should feel embarrassed. He deceived both women (I imagine), and now his ability to be a good parent to both of his sons is compromised because one baby's mother is insecure and threatened by the other. This impedes his ability to be present in his sons' lives.
Your guy is not in charge of Facebook. You should post whatever photos you want the world to see. When people start to realize that your partner has two sons the same age with different women, he (and you) will face some questions.
Please understand that parenthood will not magically change your guy's character. You should get all of your legal, custodial and financial ducks in a row regarding the child, encourage this man to be a good father to both of his children, but understand that he may not intend to lead a monogamous life.
Dear Amy: My “adult” 23-year-old son is home for the holidays.
He leads a more liberal lifestyle than my husband and me, and suffice it to say not only do our politics not match up, but neither do our hygiene practices.
To be blunt, his BO is killing us! I didn't raise him this way and I absolutely can't stand it.
I just can't embrace not showering daily and not using a daily dose of antiperspirant.
How do you address an awkward and difficult topic with a person who is also awkward and difficult?
— Mother of the Smelly Kid
Dear Mother: I assume you have heard the term “adulting.” This is a recently minted verb to describe the process that people in their 20s are now undertaking to finally exit their lengthy childhoods. Adulting refers to assuming some life skills, such as doing dishes, paying bills, and — yes, cleaning oneself.
I'm assuming that you did teach your son these skills, but your fear of mentioning this now indicates that you are actually afraid to relate to him both as a parent and as a fellow adult.
(This doesn't have anything to do with your politics — or his — by the way.)
Tell your son, “We love having you home. But you've got to wash yourself — and your clothes — while you're here. Let me show you how to use the washer, and let's put in a load.”
Dear Readers: My own life is probably a lot like yours. I've experienced poverty, prosperity, marriage, divorce, remarriage, step-parenting, caretaking, loss and grief. If you've ever been curious about the life behind the advice column, I hope you'll consider picking up my memoir, “Strangers Tend to Tell Me Things: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and Coming Home.” (2017, Hachette).

(Reuters) – Over the last two weeks, every household in Sweden received a booklet of instructions on how to prepare for war. Issued by the government and including instructions for every Swedish resident to resist an invader by all means necessary, it was a dramatic sign of just how quickly the recently unthinkable has become something Europe's Nordic governments in particular feel they must address.
“For many years, the preparations made in Sweden for the threat of war and war have been very limited,” says the Swedish brochure. “However, as the world around us has changed, the Government has decided to strengthen Sweden's total defense… The level of preparedness for peacetime emergencies is an important basis of our resilience in the event of war.”
For most of the continent, Russian President Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea and war in Ukraine four years ago was seen as a wake-up call, but not a potentially existential threat. Countries like Germany, Britain and France have reconsidered their defense postures, often also lightly increasing military spending. By and large, however, even within their security establishments, few see a genuine imminent risk of an overwhelming Russian conventional military attack on their homelands. Moscow's military might be at its most active since the Cold War, but its tanks and troops remain a comfortingly long way away.
That clearly isn't the case in the Nordics, much closer geographically to Russia. Norway has appointed a senior special forces officer to lead its Home Guard, a territorial defense force separate from the mainstream military and specifically intended to fight any invader. Finland has reorganized its military, forming its troops into larger companies to allow them to better handle the large number of casualties expected in any attack. Both countries have long had conscription for able-bodied young men — and now theoretically neutral Sweden is also reintroducing National Service for both men and women.
It's a dramatic change from only a handful of years ago, when Nordic militaries were much more focused on humanitarian and counterterrorism interventions overseas, including U.N. peacekeeping.
Neither Norway, Sweden nor Finland could hold a Russian invasion at the border. To varying degrees, their strategy presumably would be to cede much of the country to invaders — then fight back with hit and run attacks, and gradually bleed them to death.
It is not that any of those countries think war is truly imminent …. Rather than launching an overwhelming military strike, most European security analysts expect Moscow to continue its current more asymmetric tactics, supporting extremist political parties, conducting periodic cyberattacks and other forms of disruption.
For NATO, a much greater focus is on defending the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, once part of the Soviet Union and seen as much more likely targets of Russian aggression, not least because of their geographic proximity and significant Russian-speaking populations. German, Canadian and British-led battle groups are now based in those countries, joined this month by a hefty U.S. and wider European military presence as part of major military exercises.
The Nordic states, too, hope they would not be facing any assault alone. Norway is a long-standing member of NATO, and while Sweden and Finland are not, they are now discussing membership and have dramatically increased military and other ties to the alliance. All three nations are also members of the Joint Expeditionary Force, a UK-led group of Nordic, Baltic and northern European nations that could operate militarily separate to the NATO alliance.
What their preparations at home point to, however, is the largely unspoken nervousness amongst the Nordic and Baltic nations that those arrangements might not prove reliable. Such worries inevitably intensified with the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, as well as the rise of far-right parties in Germany, France and elsewhere. The Nordics' real fear is that sometime in the not-too-distant future — perhaps in the next decade — the European and transatlantic structures they have long relied on could collapse.
“The purpose of a military is simply national survival,” one senior Nordic officer told me last year, making it clear that while it relied on allies, it would fight for itself alone if it had to.
Russia clearly isn't the only danger to be worried about — the Swedish leaflet also explicitly refers to terror attacks as a danger, and refers throughout to the risks of unspecified “crisis” as well as war. But it's apparent from the document what worries the Swedish authorities most — an overwhelming attack, coupled with a powerful foreign misinformation campaign that tells the populace the war is over and lost before it even starts.
The Swedish leaflet states explicitly that any messages of surrender after any invasion should be ignored. “If Sweden is attacked by another country, we will never give up,” says the brochure. “All information to the effect that resistance is to cease is false.” For all the criticism of the leaflet and accusations of scaremongering, that is clearly a message the Swedish authorities want to get through. The leaflet has been translated into Arabic, Somali, and a host of other languages to reach recently arrived migrants, and those communities will also find their young men and women conscripted into the armed forces.
While much of the leaflet's tone is reassuringly bland, the underlying message is unmistakable. In the event of attack, everyone in the country is expected to do exactly as they are told — whether that's helping provide medical and other support, or fighting and dying.
It's an unexpected throwback to the dark days of the 1940s, when Finnish and Norwegian resistance fighters battled Soviet and Nazi occupations and neutral Sweden feared both. But it's also an alarming reminder that in this most liberal, progressive and peaceful corner of Europe, those in charge now fear an era of gloom could return.

Ozubulu youths under the aegis of Ozubulu Youths Association, OYA, yesterday, protested the reopening of St Philip's Catholic Church, Amakwa Ozubulu, Anambra State barely a week after gunmen attacked worshippers, alleging what it called attack on their people without provocation and police inability to bring the perpetrators to book.
This is even as a human rights group, International Society for Civil Liberties and the Rule of Law, Intersociety, yesterday, said it has investigated last Sunday's killing of a policeman and a motorcyclist at Oguta Road in Onitsha, near the Assemblies of God Church and discovered that the attack was not targeted at the church worshippers.
The youths, who marched from Ozubulu motor park opposite Ekwusigo Local Government headquarters in Ozubulu, to Ozubulu Police station, and to the palace of the traditional ruler of the community, Obi Fidelis Nnamdi Oruche said they have had enough of attacks on innocent people of the community.
Addressing newsmen shortly after the peaceful protest, President of OYA, Mr Emeka Anakwe, a Port Harcourt-based Clearing and Forwarding Agent, said it was worrisome that a church, where over 13 people were killed by gun-men, would be reopened for service one week after the attack, when investigation into the matter has not been concluded, contrary to the earlier promise by the Nnewi Diocese.
Anakwe who condemned the attack on the innocent worshippers, said “the youths of Ozubulu are concerned about the attack because the entire people of Ozubulu are now living in fear. We cannot sleep comfortably any more because of fear of recurrence.
"We have in the past, seen a situation where a security man was caught with fresh human head and was arrested but when we did not see him being prosecuted, we started asking questions, but we were told that the matter is in the court.
"We are not happy that when incidents like this happen, it is swept under the carpet. We are peaceful people, we are not into crime. In the past, people from Nnewi, Nnobi, Oraifite and other neighbouring towns came here to drink and relax because of the peaceful atmosphere. Our town has always played host to people from other communities in the state because of its peaceful nature, but today that situation is being eroded with these nasty stories of killings here.
"Some of these things are happening because the elders of this town have neglected the youths for so long, and we will no longer accept such disposition from the elders of the community as we are prepared to play active role in the issues that affect the community and our people. We must take our destiny in our hands.
Samsung Electronics‘ Galaxy S8 is facing complaints from some customers saying that the display panels of their new phones have a reddish tint.A number of customers who preordered the Galaxy S8 wrote on online communities that their new phones have a reddish screen that did not improve even after correcting the color display settings.One user said, “After I read articles that there are many reddish panels, I checked mine. I was also unlucky. Should I change it?”Posting a photo of his new device, another asked, “Can you please check mine, whether this is too red or not?”Samsung said, "It is not a quality problem and it can be adjusted with the phone itself. If the color still appears to be reddish, customers can change it at the service center."However, some users still claimed they were not able to adjust the color because the display panel was already optimized."Samsung uses deep red technology to have color balance for Galaxy S8. It seems they were not able to adjust the color balance well because they were in a hurry to mass produce them," said an industry watcher.By Shin Ji-hye (shinjh@heraldcorp.com)

A nurse dubbed the Deacon of Death has been jailed for 27 years over the 'mercy killings' of five patients- including his own mother.
Ivo Poppe, 61, was found guilty of the murders of his 90-year-old mother, his 80-year-old father-in-law, two great-uncles aged 79 and 81 and another patient aged 79.
Poppe told a court that he was "very sorry" for what he had done.
He said his victims had not asked for help dying but said his only motivation was to make their deaths less painful.
The Roman Catholic deacon and nurse was sentenced by a court in Bruges in the western Belgian province of West Flanders.
Public prosecutors had demanded life in prison but the judge accepted that there were mitigating factors such as Poppe's bad health, difficult youth, previously clean record and small risk of re-offending.
He was acquitted of a sixth murder charge.

According to his lawyer, Poppe acted out of "boundless empathy" with his victims.
The case first came to light in 2013, when Poppe reportedly told a psychiatrist that he had performed euthanasia on several people while working as a nurse. He said it was a maximum of 20, according to reports.
The court case only concerned six cases, and no exact death tally is known. None of the victims or possible victims were named publicly.
Poppe was a nurse in a hospital in Menen, also in West Flanders, in the 1980s and 1990s.
He said he carried out the killings by injecting air into the patients' veins.
The method was also used in wartime Nazi Germany to execute mental patients in a way that was hard to detect.
Poppe could be eligible for early release in just six years, according to reports.
In Belgium, convicts can ask for an early release on probation after serving a third of their sentence, nine years in his case.
Given Poppe has already spent more than three years in pre-trial detention, he might attempt to ask for an early release in under six years from now.
BOSTON -- Boston Celtics forward Marcus Morris believes his team landed a quality addition Friday by striking early on the buyout market.
Boston agreed to sign 27-year-old big man Greg Monroe for the remainder of the season after he reached a buyout with the Phoenix Suns earlier this week. By using their disabled player exception, the Celtics were able to land Monroe on a $5-million contract -- more than any other suitor could offer.
"I think that's a great pickup for us," Morris said Friday before hosting the Atlanta Hawks. "Veteran player. Knows how to play the game. He's been around the league awhile so I think he'll add to our size down low, scoring ability. I think it's a great pickup."
RELATED VIDEO:
Monroe has averaged 13.9 points and 8.7 rebounds over an eight-year career. Splitting time with the Milwaukee Bucks and Suns this season, he has averaged 10.4 points and 7.4 rebounds over 21.8 minutes per game.
"Yeah, I mean, he's a big body," Morris said. "Even if he's not scoring, he's carving space for other guys to be able to drive. He's well respected around the league so that goes a long way. I think he's going to be a great piece for us going forward."
Celtics head coach Brad Stevens declined to comment on the impending Monroe signing because it is not yet official. The veteran is fully expected to clear waivers Saturday.

More than 1,000 trees to be chopped down for road construction

At a time when the government conducted public hearing on the Metro bus track from Peshawar Mor to New Islamabad Airport, the National Highways Authority (NHA) has already begun constructing tracks for the project without mandatory approval from the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA). This was highlighted during the hearing and participants questioned the legitimacy of the public hearing, which though is mandatory in the act, as an NOC has already been granted.
Describing the hearing as eyewash, they argued that work on the track began in violation the Environment Protection Act. Section 12 of the act states that developers are bound to file an environment impact assessment report before beginning any mega development project. The report is necessary to assess the likely damage to the environment before the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) approves the project. The public hearing, which is also mandatory according to the act, was arranged by Pak-EPA. Representatives from the National Highway Authority (NHA), the executing body of the project, responded to the concerns raised by the environmentalists and affected residents. The metro bus service track is being developed at a cost of Rs16 billion, and is expected to be complete by August 14, when the new airport becomes operational.
The project will destroy nearly 1,000 shisham, jacaranda, fiddlewood, citrus and amaltas trees and will cost wild boars, jackals, foxes, rats, hares, porcupines, cheeked bulbuls, cuckoos, sparrows and several reptiles their natural habitats. Civil society representative Jamil Bhatti asked what was the use of the public hearing, when Pak-EPA has already been issued a no objection certificate?” Munir Ahmed, a development communication consultant and an environmentalist who is also from the civil society, demanded punitive action for starting work on the project without environmental clearance.
Pak-EPA Director General Farzana Altaf Shah told the hearing that approval to widen Kashmir Highway was issued when environmental clearance for the new airport was given in 2009.
“This public hearing is being called after NHA changed the design of the new lanes seven kilometres from Peshawar Mor. Pak-EPA a fresh EIA from the NHA to assess damage to the environment from the new changes in the design,” she said. Numerous suggestions poured in, from utilising the already widened Kashmir Highway for bus lanes to abolishing the project.
NHA General Manager Design Asim Amin urged the participants to consider the long term positive aspects of the projects. “All options were considered. Developing [the metro bus service] is the best solution to provide cheap transportation services to the masses. The project has long term economic benefits besides ease of travel for the common man, especially for those who will be working at the new airport once it becomes operational,” Mr Amin said, arguing that all airports around the world were connected with efficient transport systems. However, participants maintained that the public hearing was too late when the environment had already been damaged and the Rs16bn project was too expensive for a project that is not a priority.
A vote over a controversial zoning debate may be coming soon and it could have a big impact on students and residents in Mt. Pleasant.
The city is considering an ordinance that would shift some areas away from student housing and towards single family homes.
Under the proposal, each home would house a family or at the most “two non-related” people, targeting students with multiple roommates.
The plan would affect homes on University, Franklin and Lansing.
The area has 64 rental properties.
However, those existing student housing properties would only be affected in three instances - if the owner decides to change the living situation, if it goes unused for a full year, or if it gets damaged and has to be rebuilt as a single-family dwelling.
Supporters say the current ordinance is out of date and hasn't been revised since 1984.

Mexico Catches One Of Several Fugitive Former Governors After A Half-Year Hunt
Enlarge this image toggle caption AFP/Getty Images AFP/Getty Images
When Javier Duarte stepped down from office last October, the former governor of Mexico's Veracruz state vowed to fight the mounting corruption allegations that unraveled his tenure.
"The circumstances created by false accusations ... force me to dedicate myself full-time to clear my name and that of my family," Duarte said on Oct. 13, according to The Yucatan Times, just one day after he ended his term six weeks early.
Then, Duarte disappeared.
It would be another half-year before the surfaced — this time in handcuffs, escorted from his hotel at a lakeside resort in Guatemala on Saturday night. Authorities say he had been squirreled away in a hotel room with his wife, attempting to pass as a tourist.
Now he is in a prison cell in Guatemala City, awaiting his widely expected extradition back to Mexico, where Reuters reports he'll face allegations that he diverted public funds for his personal enrichment. That includes a luxury ranch — packed with paintings by masters such as Joan Miro and Leonora Carrington, the BBC reports — that authorities say was paid for by siphoned dollars.
During his roughly six years in office, Duarte's Gulf Coast state also earned the inglorious distinction of becoming "one of the world's most lethal regions for the press," according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The CPJ estimated last year that at least 12 journalists were murdered during Duarte's tenure; other organizations have placed that number even higher.
A 2012 dispatch from CPJ correspondent Mike O'Connor explains the atmosphere that took shape under Duarte:
"Veracruz is a beautiful, long, thin state on the Gulf coast of Mexico where many journalists are terrified not only of the rampant organized crime groups that kill and control, but also of the state government. Fear that state officials will order them murdered for what they investigate or write has forced about a dozen journalists to flee the state, claiming that fear also puts a clamp on coverage for those who remain."
And that's not to mention the mass grave discovered outside Veracruz city last month that contained 252 bodies, many of which are believed to have been buried years ago.
Strikingly, Duarte's allegation-plagued tenure was by no means uncommon. The politician isn't the only former Mexican governor to draw prosecutors' attention — nor was he the only former leader in his own party, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, to go on the lam for an extended period.
Scandal-plagued former governors Enlarge this image toggle caption Marco Ugarte, Eduardo Verdugo, Susan Montoya Bryan, Harry Cabluck, Israel Leal, Guillermo Arias/ AP; Monica M. Davey, P.

Former Tamaulipas Gov. Tomás Yarrington was caught in Florence, Italy, just last week after five years on the run. U.S. prosecutors have alleged he "accepted millions of dollars in drug cartel bribes and invested it in Texas real estate," according to The Associated Press. And The Wall Street Journal, citing orders issued by state police, says that Yarrington had been assigned eight law enforcement officers as bodyguards as late as last year.
Meanwhile former Chihuahua Gov. Cesar Duarte — no relation — has still eluded authorities after he stepped down last year. Once a rising star in the PRI like Javier Duarte (who was suspended from the party around the time of his disappearance) and Yarrington, Cesar Duarte is being pursued over embezzlement charges.
All of this makes for a rather persistent problem for the party's leader, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, who has been battling historically terrible approval ratings.
So it's not too much of a surprise that, as the AP reports, the PRI cheered the capture of the former Veracruz governor, who the party said should "be punished in an exemplary fashion, as well as anyone who is confirmed to have taken part in his criminal ring."
Still, it will do little to erase the rather unexemplary records of many governors across Mexico — and not just those in the PRI. The Duartes have plenty of company.
The Los Angeles Times breaks it down: In a country of 31 states and one federal district, nearly a dozen governors recently out of office are on the lam, under investigation or already in prison.
The White House on Wednesday shook off criticism of the emergency response to Hurricane Maria following a Harvard study that estimated the death toll from last year's tragedy in Puerto Rico may have reached 5,000.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, asked about the startling numbers in the Harvard study, defended FEMA's response to the storm that slammed into the island as a Category 4 hurricane Sept. 20, two weeks after the island was ravaged by Hurricane Irma.
Sanders said the government responded to the storm with the largest FEMA effort in history.
"We have been supportive of Gov. Rosello's efforts to ensure full accounting and transparency, and those who have suffered from this tragedy deserve nothing less," she added.
National Nurse United, the nation's largest union for registered nurses, said the study confirmed what volunteer nurses who went to the island in the days and weeks after the Sept. 20 landfall witnessed — residents "left to die" by a federal response that "failed its own American citizens."
“Nurses on the ground saw that people were dying," said Bonnie Castillo, executive director of the union. "Our volunteer RNs came back to the U.S. and said again and again, ‘The people of Puerto Rico are dying. Do something!'"
Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., who serves on the House Committee on Homeland Security, called the Harvard estimate "heartbreaking" and blasted the federal response to the storm as "woefully inadequate."
FEMA assistant administrator Michael Byrne defended his agency's effort before a House committee two months ago.
Byrne testified more than 19,000 federal staff from 80 agencies were on the ground at the height of the emergency effort. More than a billion dollars in commodities, such as food, water, tarps, and construction materials "were delivered by air, off-road vehicles and on foot, making it the largest and longest commodity delivery mission in FEMA's history," he said.
Maria destroyed thousands of buildings and knocked out power to virtually the entire U.S. territory of more than 3 million people. Researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health released a study this week based on a survey of more than 3,000 households on the battered island.
The researchers determined at least 4,645 "excess deaths" occurred during the storm and the weeks that followed as the island struggled to provide basic services such as food, water and medical care. The researchers also said the number was probably conservative, and that the total could have exceeded 5,000.
By comparison, more than 1,800 people died when Katrina roared across the U.S. Gulf Coast as a Category 5 hurricane in 2005.
Christy Delafield, a spokeswoman for the global humanitarian organization Mercy Corps, has spent time in Puerto Rico since Maria. She said her group always believed official numbers seemed low, but "Harvard's numbers are worse than we feared."
"The lack of electricity and basic services meant that people couldn't get the help they needed for a long time after the storm," she said. "The elderly, people with health problems and the very young were at particular risk."
Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, said the Puerto Rico government welcomed the study and would analyze it further. He said officials expected the number would be much higher than previous counts, and a team at George Washington University has been conducting a review of the death total that is due soon.
"As the world knows, the magnitude of this tragic disaster caused by Hurricane Maria resulted in many fatalities," he said. "Both studies will help us better prepare for future natural disasters and prevent lives from being lost.”

India's chief selector has put the heat on MS Dhoni, saying he's no longer an automatic choice in one-day internationals as he eyes the 2019 World Cup.
MS Dhoni is no longer an automatic choice in one-day internationals and the former India captain needs to keep performing to be involved in the 2019 World Cup, chief selector MSK Prasad has said.
The wicketkeeper-batsman announced his sudden and stunning retirement from Test cricket midway through an Australia series in 2014, with the Boxing Day match in Melbourne being the last of his 90 appearances in the longer format.
He has continued to compete in 50-over and Twenty20 internationals but questions are being asked in the local media if Dhoni, who will be 38 in 2019, will still be in the India side at the England and Wales-hosted tournament.
"I was just reading (Andre) Agassi's book "Open", his life actually started after 30 years," Prasad told reporters in Pallekele on Monday as India completed a 3-0 Test series sweep of Sri Lanka.
"Till then he won two or three (grand slams). His actual life started after that.
"He lived with media pressure, 'When are you going to retire?' But he played till 36 and he won so many grand slams. So you never know.
"We don't say it is an automatic this thing... but we will see. We are all stakeholders. We all want the Indian team to do well. If he is delivering, why not? If he is not, we will have to look at alternatives."
Although Dhoni remains supremely fit and his glove work is still of the highest quality, opinions are divided over whether age is catching up with his batting abilities.
Prasad said the selection committee has had discussions about Dhoni but refused to answer when asked if he would also be occasionally rested as India worked towards their core group for the 2019 World Cup.
"We will see, we will see. The legend that he is, we don't want to make it... but yes we have a plan," he said.
India omitted 35-year-old batsman Yuvraj Singh from their squad for the upcoming limited-overs series in Sri Lanka but Prasad clarified it was part of their rotation policy ahead of the 2019 World Cup.
WALTHAM, MASS.—Celtics all-star point guard Isaiah Thomas plans to play in Game 2 Tuesday night against the Chicago Bulls, then head to Washington state to be with his family and help complete funeral arrangements for his sister.
Thomas attended the team's film session and short walk-through Monday, but did not speak with the media. Coach Brad Stevens said that after services for Thomas's sister, the star guard intends to rejoin the team Friday for Game 3 in Chicago. The coach adds that all plans are subject to change depending on how Thomas feels.
Chyna Thomas died early Saturday in a one-car accident outside Tacoma, Washington. No funeral date is set, and Stevens says the Celtics organization hopes to attend.
Teammate Avery Bradley said it's important now to pick Thomas up on and off the court.
“I feel like it's better to show with your actions than your words, especially after a loss,” he said.
During the Season 2 finale, This Is Us provided fans with some flash-forwards of the Pearson family. One of those was Kevin traveling with Beth's cousin Zoe to Vietnam, where his father once served. In a new interview with Entertainment Weekly, Milo Ventimiglia discussed Jack's Vietnam backstory that will be a big feature of This Is Us Season 3. Because even though Kevin let out the breath he had been holding in since his father's death, the Pearson son will still be searching for some answers about Jack's past in This Is Us Season 3. And through Kevin's journey, fans will gain much more insight into Jack's life.
"I really don't want to hint because I want people to be surprised," Ventimiglia told EW about what will happen to Jack during the beginning of Season 3. Yet, the actor did admit that he was taken aback when creator Dan Fogelman and showrunner Isaac Aptaker told him what would happen during his character's Vietnam War backstory. He said,
"But what [Fogelman] laid out for me — I didn't see it coming. I really didn't see it coming. And I had a pretty good understanding of what it was going to be. As he was unfolding the story — and Isaac [Aptaker] was there, and they were explaining everything — I went, 'Oh. Holy sh*t. Holy sh*t. Holy sh*t!'"

Ventimiglia probably had an understanding of the fact that Jack's brother Nicky died while seemingly fighting beside him in the war. Nicky was introduced in the Season 2 episode "Brothers," and Jack revealed in a later episode that Nicky had died in Vietnam. But perhaps why the actor was so shocked is because This Is Us hasn't been giving viewers the whole truth about what happened to Nicky. (After all, the NBC drama has kind of made a habit of misleading fans.) Kaitlin Reilly of Refinery29 previously theorized that perhaps Nicky didn't die in Vietnam like Jack has said. That could certainly be one explanation for Ventimiglia's reaction.
One of the directors for "Brothers," Glenn Ficarra, spoke to EW after that episode aired. Ficarra said at the time, "Jack, as we're showing this season, has an ability to emotionally compartmentalize things, and his relationship with his father and brother, those are definitely related. He has a tendency to keep in a secret, which is manifesting itself in his son, Kevin." So perhaps when Kevin travels to Vietnam with his new girlfriend, he finds out a major secret about his father and uncle.

As for why Kevin is going to Vietnam, in March, EW spoke to executive producer Elizabeth Berger after the Season 2 finale, which Berger co-wrote. She explained what motivates Kevin to travel to Vietnam in the future. "Obviously Kevin still feels like there's a lot about his dad that he didn't get to know, and there was a lot that was left unsaid between the two of them, and there's definitely a curiosity that's still burning within him," Berger said.
Berger continued, "He also has his movie coming out when we come up in Season 3, which is a war movie, so he's going to be living in a world where people are asking him about what it was like to play a soldier. So I think the combination of all these things percolating is going to lead him towards this journey of discovering a bit more about his father."

Besides Jack's time in the Vietnam War, Ventimiglia discussed with EW how Season 3 will show more of Rebecca and Jack during their dating phase. "I know that's an area that Mandy and I have always enjoyed playing around with," Ventimiglia said. "It would be fun to see the discovery of these two people and past that blow-back-your-hair, first moment of sight." In a separate EW interview, Mandy Moore confirmed that in Season 3, "We are going to examine a lot more of Jack and Rebecca's origin story."
But while Rebecca and Jack dating will most likely be heartwarming, expect the Vietnam War story to be harrowing. "There is a lot to Jack's history that shapes who he ultimately becomes," Ventimiglia said. And as Kevin retraces his father's past, he'll find that one of the things that shaped Jack Pearson is what happened between him and his brother during the war.
