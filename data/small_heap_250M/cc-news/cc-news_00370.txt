Stealing the spotlight was the debut of bitcoin futures contracts, allowing investors to bet on the price of the cryptocurrency in one, two or three months.
The one-month contract, the most-traded on the Chicago-based CBOE Global Markets exchange XBTc1 opened at $15,850 on Sunday night – a gain of 21 percent.
It was last quoted at $18,600, while bitcoin itself hovered at $16,431.76. BTC=BTSP
Bitcoin has rocketed up a gravity-defying 1,600 percent since the start of the year, attracting institutional interest – and concerns that it is a bubble in the making.
“The one-month contract is trading at around an 11 percent premium to the underlying bitcoin, and for me that's a clear indication that there's no connection between the two markets,” said Lukas Daalder, chief investment officer at Robeco.
Several online brokerages have not yet allowed trading of the new futures.
“I can understand you don't see that many people who are willing to offer this contract, because you can't hedge your underlying risk if you can't short it,” Daalder added.
“This only adds to the bitcoin phenomenon. It's interesting to watch, but not a market that I would like to touch.”
While frantic trading kept bitcoin volatility dizzying, a gauge of S&P 500 volatility .VIX dipped below 10 to its lowest in more than two weeks, nearing the record low hit in November, Reuters reports.
If you're having an emergency in north Fort Worth, don't use your iPhone's default map app to navigate to the police station, police say.
Just use it to dial 911.
That's because the Apple Maps navigation app is having trouble locating the station at 8755 N. Riverside Drive, instead providing directions to a vacant location about a mile to the south.
The issue doesn't affect Google Maps, as seen in the map below.

The new police station, which opened on April 3, is just north of Light of the World Lutheran Church on the west side of North Riverside.
A local media outlet first brought the issue to the attention of police, said Sgt. Chris Britt, who added that he is not aware of any residents getting lost trying to find the station.
Police immediately began working with Apple representatives to resolve the issue, North Division Commander Neil Noakes said.
"We want to remind everyone, though, that calling 911 is usually the best option in an emergency since our facility isn't open to the public 24-7," Noakes said.
He said the police IT department has also offered to assist Apple.
As of Wednesday morning, searches on two iPhone Apple Maps still gave the wrong location for the station.
"The last thing we want is for someone to be directed to the wrong location, especially when in need of police assistance," Noakes said.

A 29-year-old Indian national fell to his death while ascending Yosemite National Park's famous Half Dome trail, the US National Park Service has said.
Asish Penugonda, who lived in New York City, was hiking with friends up the steep north side of Half Dome in the park when he slipped from the cables and fell to his death, his roommate and close friend was quoted as saying by the Mercury News.
The hiker was on the trail's Half Dome cables, the park service said in a statement. He was hiking with another person during thunderstorm activity around when he slipped and fell.
The cables take hikers up the last 400 feet to the summit of Half Dome, which rises nearly 5,000 feet above California's Yosemite Valley.
Park Rangers were notified that the hiker had slipped and fallen from the popular hiking route, the statement said. Rangers arrived on the scene and provided assistance to the second hiker.
The Yosemite National Park Rangers recovered the victim's body last Tuesday.
Asish was a graduate of Fairleigh Dickinson University and worked as a biochemist with Siemens Healthcare, New Jersey. He was a native of Andhra Pradesh. His friends have created a ‘Go Fund Me' campaign to help pay for his funeral in Fremont, transport of his body home to India, and assistance to his mother and elder brother, the report said.
This is the first fatality since 2011 from the cables up the granite dome and the first visitor fatality in 2018, according to information from Yosemite National Park. Half Dome is a granite dome at the eastern end of Yosemite Valley in Yosemite National Park, California. It is a well-known rock formation in the park, named for its distinct shape. The slope of the Half Dome cables, which are 200 yards long, is about 45 degrees.
A Clinton-area teenager accused of killing his parents has been found dead at the Clinton County Jail.
Eighteen-year-old Gavin Glasz of rural DeWitt was found early Sunday morning hanging by a bed sheet tied to the cell bars. He was found by a Clinton County jailer who was making his regular rounds. Clinton Fire Department paramedics attempted to revive Glasz but were unsuccessful.
Glasz was being held in the Clinton County Jail on two counts of murder in the first-degree. He was arrested on June 13, 2017 in connection with the death of his parents. “The homicide case against Gavin Glasz for the deaths of Brian and Michelle Glasz will be dismissed due to Gavin's death,” said Clinton County Attorney Mike Wolf.
An investigation into the death of Gavin Glasz is being conducted by the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation and the Clinton County Sheriff's Office. “There is no suspicion of foul play due to a note that was written by Gavin prior to his death,” said Clinton County Sheriff Rick Lincoln. The cause and manner of death will be determined by the Iowa Office of the State Medical Examiner pending an autopsy.

The St. Louis Blues announced on Tuesday that the team had agreed to a one-year, one-way contract extension with forward Robby Fabbri, according to Jeremy Rutherford.
The Blues and Robby Fabbri have agreed to terms on a one-year contract extension. Fabbri hasn't played a regular-season game since February 2017, when he suffered the first of his two ACL injuries. #stlblues — Jeremy Rutherford (@jprutherford) July 3, 2018
The deal reportedly carries an annual average value (AAV) of $925,000 which is a slight increase in cap hit and decrease in AAV from his entry-level contract that expired following the 2017-18 season.
Fabbri Remains a Question Mark
The 22-year-old from Mississauga, Ontario, has had a rough start to his NHL career – playing 72 games in his rookie season before just 51 in 2016-17 when he tore his left ACL on Feb. 4, 2017. He missed the entire 2017-18 campaign after re-injuring his surgically-repaired knee which likely led to him signing this one-year extension.

When he's been healthy, Fabbri's played some impressive hockey for the Blues. He had a career-high 37 points in his rookie season in 2015-16 and was on pace for an even better year when he tore his ACL back in 2017.
Through his first 123 regular season games in the NHL, the young forward has 29 goals and 66 points. On top of that, he's posted a 52.1 Corsi-for Percentage (CF%) over that span with 15 points in 20 playoff games during the 2015-16 season.
Fabbri Getting Ready for Return
Along with the announcement of his contract extension, it was also announced that Fabbri was cleared to participate in hockey-related activities as both the Blues and Fabbri ready themselves for training camp in September.
“He's doing very well,” said Blues' general manager Doug Armstrong according to NHL.com. “He is up in Toronto working very hard and time is going to tell on this one. It's very difficult, you feel for Robby. He was projecting to be such a good player and then these two injuries kept him out a year and a half. We want to make sure we're not putting him in a position to fail when he comes (to training camp). He'll come back in and be hoping for the best, but expecting a little bit of readjustment. But health-wise he's doing good.”
The extension will carry through to the end of this season at which point Fabbri will, once again, become a restricted free agent with his rights belonging to the Blues. With his history of injury already playing a role, the Blues will surely wait and see if Fabbri can make it through the season unscathed.
If, in fact, Fabbri can return to the form that landed him worthy of the 21st overall pick in 2014, he could be one of the biggest bargains of this NHL season. After all, the young forward will have something to prove after sitting for more than a year and a half. The question will be which Robby Fabbri will the Blues get when the puck drops on the upcoming campaign?
A man is dead and a woman is in custody after a shooting in northwest Iowa. Plymouth County Sheriff Mike Van Otterloo says it happened shortly after midnight, Friday morning, at a home in rural Akron.
Thirty-three-year-old Becky Hebert is facing charges that include second-degree murder. “The investigation allowed officers to learn that Hebert and the deceased had been arguing and they were having a disagreement prior to the shooting,” Van Otterloo said at a news conference Friday afternoon.
The identity of the victim, a man in his 40s, is expected to be released sometime Saturday. There were others in the home at the time of the shooting — believed to be Becky Hebert's children. “There was a witness to the shooting…neither the witness nor any others in the residence at the time were injured in any way,” Van Otterloo said.
Hebert was arrested over the noon hour on Friday in LeMars. Van Otterloo said police have been sent to rural Akron home in the past on domestic abuse calls. He also confirmed there was a no contact order in place for the individuals at that residence.

B.C. voters will be given three new voting systems to choose from in the mail-in referendum on proportional representation this fall.
Attorney General David Eby has decided the ballot will contain two questions, the first being a choice between the current “first past the post” system for choosing MLAs, and a proportional representation system.
The second question is a choice of three systems, determined after review of more than 90,000 submissions. They are:
• Dual member proportional, where neighbouring pairs of districts in B.C. would be combined into one two-member constituencies, except for the larger rural districts, which would remain unchanged.
• Mixed member proportional, which combines single-member districts with party list candidates, added to give each party the number of seats determined by their share of the province-wide vote in an election.
• Rural-urban proportional representation, with multi-member districts for urban and semi-urban areas, with voters choosing their MLA on a ranked ballot. In rural areas, a mixed-member proportional system using candidate lists chosen by parties would be used.
The complexity of the options means voters will not have an official map of the new voting districts when they make their choice. Eby said if voters choose to change to a new system, the district boundaries would be determined by the independent Electoral Boundaries Commission.
B.C. Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson called the options an “alphabet soup” of systems, some never heard of before. He said Premier John Horgan broke two promises, including one in last year's election campaign to offer people a simple yes-or-no choice.
The other was that regional representation would be protected in the referendum, which will now be decided in a simple majority of province-wide results where rural regions of the province are vastly outnumbered by urban centres.
“You'll notice that they've launched this question the day before the legislature is scheduled to rise for the summer,” Wilkinson said. “That is a sleazy and manipulative step that they've taken to avoid public debate on this issue.”
Eby said his recommendation to cabinet is that parties that receive less than five per cent of the total popular vote would not get an MLA.
He said organizations in favour of proportional representation and in favour of the current system are “ready to go” and he hopes to have the formal campaign underway as soon as Elections BC can administer it.
Advocacy organizations will have a spending limit of $200,000 each and political parties will be subject to the same restrictions as an election, with no corporate or union donations permitted.
Details of the options are in the government's release here.

In case you haven't heard, “Avengers: Infinity War” is heading towards an opening weekend that could end all opening weekends.
The Marvel superhero adventure is eyeing a debut weekend of $225 million to $245 million, with a possibility of even crossing the $250 million mark. If numbers reach the end of that range, “Infinity War” could have one of the biggest debuts of all time. The hefty launch should go a long way to justify its wildly expensive price tag of somewhere from $300 million to $400 million.
As of now, the biggest opening weekend of all time belongs to “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” which bowed with $248 million in 2015 and went on to make over $936.6 million domestically. Only five films in history have hit the $200 million mark in their debuts.
“Infinity War” picks up two years after the events of “Captain America: Civil War” with the Avengers teaming up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop the evil Thanos from inter-galactic dominance. The heroic ensemble cast includes Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth's Thor, Chris Evans' Captain America, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther, Chris Pratt's Star Lord, Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange, and Mark Ruffalo's Hulk.
Joe and Anthony Russo directed from a script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. “Infinity War,” the sequel to 2012's “The Avengers” and 2015's “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” is the 19th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The original “Avengers” had the highest opening to date for a Marvel film, debuting with $207.4 million. Its sequel, “Age of Ultron,” launched with $191 million. The first movie earned $623 million in North America, while the second made $459 million.
“Infinity War” comes on the coattails of the Disney-owned Marvel's most recent success, “Black Panther,” which opened to a massive $202 million in February. Ryan Coogler's tentpole continues to shatter records, and has earned an impressive $1.3 billion worldwide.
Naturally, no other studio considered a wide release for the superhero-intensive weekend. “A Quiet Place” will likely drop to the No. 2 slot in its fourth frame. The surprise hit, directed by John Krasinski and co-starring Krasinski and Emily Blunt, has made $131 million in North America. Other recent releases, such as Amy Schumer's “I Feel Pretty” and Dwayne Johnson's “Rampage” should also see drops as “Infinity War” will presumably gobble up the rest of the box office.

It is a scandal, a shame and a terrible indictment of our press (who are doing so much to reveal the problems of the country) that the change in the greatest crisis in our country, HIV infections, has gone so under-reported.
On 12 March, the Institute for Race Relations released a report about the fall off in new HIV infections. In nine years this has fallen by 39%. New HIV/Aids infections declined countrywide from 437,705 to 266,931 between 2009 and 2016. This news, on an illness which has crippled the lives of more South African families than any other issue, hardly got a mention in the media. It is a scandal, a shame and a terrible indictment of our press (who are doing so much to reveal the problems of the country), that the change in the greatest crisis in our country has gone so under-reported.
HIV/Aids affects the vast majority of South Africans more than anything else that has been covered in the last months. Forget Jacob Zuma and his legal battles. Forget Julius Malema and land grabs in the name of political expediency. Forget Cyril Ramaphosa grappling with the Medusa of ANC graft and corruption. Forget Tom Monyane and Jonas Makwakwa's SARS affairs. Forget Steinhoff's race to disaster. Forget Patricia de Lille and Day Zero.
For average South Africans, and let's be specific that means poor black South Africans, the disaster of HIV/Aids has shaped their lives more than failing education, appalling service delivery, paralysing poverty, and unbridled unemployment.
The country has the largest HIV/Aids epidemic in the world. We have 19% of the global number of people living with HIV/Aids, 15% of new infections and 11% of Aids related deaths. This is a humanitarian, political and social failure of epic proportions.
Over seven million people are living with HIV in South Africa today. (To put that in perspective that is the same as the entire population of Namibia, Botswana, and Lesotho). I am not the world's best “Googler”, so I have not been able to find out what the financial cost is to the country – but between anti-retroviral treatment, the costs of TB treatment, lost days of productivity and the costs of caring for the dying we cannot be looking at less than tens of billions of Rands per year. Yes, even more than the sewers of SoE's that drain our national fiscus. I am sure that Mark Heywood who has done such superb work in fighting this human rights abuse has these numbers dripping off his tongue.
That is just the financial cost. The social cost is almost immeasurable. And the ANC has to stand up and take the blame. The fact that our country is worse affected than any other is a stain on our country forever. We are the second largest economy in Africa, with the best infrastructure and communications network on the continent, and it took us 15 years to do what impoverished countries did 10 years ago. And without foreign intervention and local activism this would have been even worse for the country if it had been left to the government.
From Mbeki's denialism, to Zuma's infamous “anti Aids” shower after unprotected sex, the ANC leadership has shown a competed disregard for facts and a complete lack of respect for their voters.
The fall off in infection rates is great news! At last it seems we might be catching up to Uganda and other countries in educating our people. But the fact that ‘only' quarter of a million people were infected with HIV is last year is disgraceful. Disastrous. Unforgivable.
And sadly, I think one of the reasons why everybody is so quiet about this, is because this, the greatest medical, political and social tragedy in our country, is a post-apartheid problem. This is a post-1994 problem, and the only ANC leader who attacked this with impassioned commitment was Madiba when he called this the greatest threat to our nation since apartheid (paraphrasing from many remarks/speeches he made).
This is an abuse that has nothing to do with the past. This is an abuse that could be dealt with now. This is an abuse of every poor voter. This is an abuse of every family who has a member who has suffered or died from this disease.
It is a tragedy that it has taken 20 years to start winning this battle. If this is the rate that we solve our other problems then we are in trouble. This is the best example of how policies fail. In our personality obsessed politics (Can Ramaphosa, Gordhan and Nene save us? Will Floyd Shivambu and Malema send us into a quagmire if distraction? Will Mmusi Maimane and Athol Trollip straddle the crevices of coalition?), we need to be reminded constantly that policy makes the country.
And our HIV/Aids policy has been a tragedy. The Nazis killed six million Jews, gypsies and gays in a hideous act of deliberate genocidal Policy. We in South Africa have over seven million people who now live with a fatal disease, from a lazy blind-folded policy of denial. Apartheid was an active policy of disaster. The disaster we have today is because of an inactive policy of myopia. The one is clearly a moral monstrosity. The other? History will write that judgement.
And in the meantime – let us write the news, our young girls and women in particular are still paying the price! It might be a fact of life, but it is not normal. It is not right! It is not right! It is terribly, horribly wrong! DM

Antonio Callaway (Photo: Kevin C. Cox, Getty Images)
Gainesville, Fla. — Florida has suspended troubled receiver Antonio Callaway and six others for the team's season opener against Michigan.
A person familiar with the situation told the Associated Press the players were suspended for misusing school-issued funds. The person spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity Sunday because Florida did not release details of the suspensions.
Callaway, defensive end Keivonnis Davis, defensive lineman Richerd Desir-Jones, linebacker James Houston, linebacker Ventrell Miller, defensive lineman Jordan Smith and offensive tackle Kadeem Telfort won't be allowed to play Sept. 2 against the Wolverines in Arlington, Texas.
Last season Callaway had 54 catches for 721 yards and three touchdowns.
Coach Jim McElwain said: “We have a small group of players that have made some choices that are extremely disappointing. Action has been taken: They have missed some practice and will miss the Michigan game. We will use this as a learning opportunity and we will have some players step up as we move forward.”

NEW DELHI: Non-resident Indians (NRIs) and Indians returning from abroad will have to physically show the junked 500 and 1,000 rupee notes to Customs officials at the airport and get a declaration form stamped before they can deposit the demonetised currency in the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) during the grace period.
The Indians, who were abroad during the 50-day window provided from November 9 to December 30 to deposit the old currency, have been given a three-month grace period till March 31 and NRIs six months till June 30 to deposit the junked notes at RBI's offices in Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata and Nagpur.
“For the period from up to March 31, 2017, or June 30, 2017, as applicable, a declaration form will need to be filled by resident Indians and non-resident Indians coming to India and carrying Specified banknotes (SBNs) for depositing these SBNs in the specified offices of RBI in India,” a Finance Ministry notification said.
A one-page form has been worked out for the purpose.
“The Customs officer shall strictly count the number of notes and tally the total amount mentioned before stamping the form submitted by the passenger,” the notification said.
While there is no limit on deposit of SBNs by an Indian national, who was abroad when the 50-day window was in operation, NRIs can deposit only Rs 25,000, an RBI notification said. However, this facility is not available for Indian citizens resident in Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, a separate notification added.
Indians abroad will have to produce a “copy of passport with immigration stamp as proof of the individual's absence from the country during the period November 9, 2016, to December 30, 2016” as also copies of all bank account statements evidencing that no SBNs of 500 and 1,000 rupees were deposited during the 50-day window. Valid ID proof and Aadhaar number along with the applicant's KYC-compliant bank account details are also to be submitted, it said.
“On ascertaining that the tenderer was abroad during the period from November 9, 2016, and December 30, 2016, the account is KYC compliant, fulfilment of other conditions and the genuineness of the notes tendered, admissible amount will be credited to the account under advice to the tenderer,” the RBI notification said.
For NRIs, in addition to the proof of being outside the country, they will have to produce “a certificate issued by Indian Customs on arrival through Red Channel after December 30, 2016, indicating the import of SBNs, with details and value thereof.” The Finance Ministry notification said: “At the airport/land Customs stations etc on entry, Customs stamp on the said forms shall be affixed and the same shall be submitted along with other documents to RBI offices.” Since the form to be filled in by the passenger bearing the Customs stamp will be crucial in subsequently facilitating the deposit of SBNs at the specified issue offices of RBI, it asked the Customs formations to keep a copy of the same, preferably in scanned format.
Although you may at first say "Hey, this is an unlikely pairing," hold your horses. One could argue that the buyer of a BMW M2 or Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 would never cross shop each ride.
Well, how do you know? If you've got money burning a hole in your pocket and you're a REAL car enthusiast, you don't care about brands. You care about fun no matter how it's delivered and how it's labeled.
For about $50-60,000, the M2 and GT350 pose an interesting proposition. Both are wildly different from each other but it's impossible to say that they do not deliver on the fun quota.
So, WHICH sports car would you rather have? The BMW or the Shelby?
**Click "Read Article" below for the FULL story!
Which Car Wins? Both the M2 and GT350 are world-class products that deliver plenty of smiles per gallon, but which one claims victory in this Quick Comparison? Well, much like voting in Florida on election night, it's too close to call. We simply can't decide which is a better choice, as we love each of them for different reasons. The BMW is a joy to drive, refined, civilized and nearly telepathic. But the Mustang's wailing engine, scary speed, and sexy styling are just as easy to fall for. That may sound like a copout, but luckily, you can't go wrong with either one.

Katja (Diane Kruger) and her lawyer brace themselves for a terrorism trial in the volatile political drama ‘In the Fade.'
Diane Kruger's revelatory performance steels the poignant thriller ‘In the Fade'
ARNOLD WAYNE JONES | Executive Editor
jones@dallasvoice.com
It's Oscar season, which is when established celebs start the talk-show circuit ginning up sympathy for their blockbusters while indie and foreign films scramble for the kind of attention that doesn't just pad their pockets, but helps their product turn a real profit. A nomination for actress or screenplay or foreign language film can be just the ticket to sell tickets.
The German film In the Fade certainly had reasonable hopes at such an awards bump. It won the Golden Globe and was short-listed for the Oscars, but failed to grab any nominations. That's kind of remarkable, because Fatih Akin's politically-charged revenge drama is one of the most viscerally arresting emotional rides of the year.
We only spend a few minutes with Nuri (Numan Acar), a Turkish Kurd working as a translator in Hamburg, and his son Rocco before a terrorist's fertilizer bomb rips through Nuri's office, killing them both. The lone survivor of this small family is Katja (Diane Kruger), a white German national devastated by the murders. But her tragedy is continually multiplied as the investigation only generates more horror.
First she's met with suspicions by the police about the “innocence” of her foreign-born husband. Wasn't he a former drug runner? Was he political? Wasn't he a Muslim? Was he, in short, “asking for it”?
Writer-director Fatih Akin's compelling drama repeatedly redefines itself without ever veering afield of its basic thrust: A character study of the lengths we will go to when hatred drives others and emotion blinds our judgment. He divides the film into three segments, each of which play out as a mini-thriller. In the first, Katja deals with her turmoil of loss and accusation; in the second, she steels herself for a courtroom drama; and in the third, her despair fuels her desire for vengeance.
And at the center of all three is Kruger. I'll confess I have always thought of her as a capable actress whose abiding beauty allowed her to coast through big-budget spectacles like Troy, National Treasure and even Inglourious Basterds. She showed some chops in the slow-paced border mystery series The Bridge, but nothing really prepared me for the fierceness of her Katja. Kruger writhes in bottomless grief, eventually allowing Katja to be reckless, selfish and pitiable. She then explodes into a primal fury that's as arresting as anything you'll witness in a theater. (“Is there any other actress this year who gave as emotionally raw a performance as that one?” asked a friend who screened the movie with me. I admit I was at a loss to name one.)
While the fates of Dreamers dangle amid Washington in-fighting, In the Fade presents a powerful study of how anger and violence against those who are different is terrifying but also wrongheaded and pointless. The Oscar voters might not have seen it, but you still can.

UCLA is hiring Michigan assistant coach Jedd Fisch to be its offensive coordinator, a source confirmed to ESPN.
Fisch and UCLA are still finalizing a contract agreement. Fox Sports first reported the hire on Monday.
Fisch spent the past two seasons at Michigan, where he coached quarterbacks and wide receivers and served as passing game coordinator. The 40-year-old previously spent two seasons as offensive coordinator with the NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars and also has been an offensive coordinator at Miami and Minnesota.
Fisch replaces Kennedy Polamalu, who was dismissed after only one season as UCLA's offensive coordinator. UCLA went 4-8 and finished 127th out of 128 FBS teams in rushing offense.
Looking around the automotive landscape these days, it seems that one thing holds true across just about every automaker. Sedan sales are down and sport-utility vehicles sales are up.
Frankly, this doesn't come as much of a surprise to us as we've been calling sedans stale for a bit now. That's why we've championed cars like the first-gen Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class and Audi A7.
They're different and they make you feel something.
Now with gas prices lower than they were, consumers have run back — in a BIG way — to SUVs. You just can't compare a standard sedan to something that has greater ride height, more space and more utility. There's no two ways about it, people like to 1) feel safe, and, 2) use their autos for as many things as possible.
Can you imagine trying to move Jimmy or Janie into their freshman dorm only with a BMW 5-Series at your disposal? You'll quickly find yourself at a U-Haul rental location.
Looking at brands like Acura, Cadillac and Infiniti, it seems like their SUVs are really the big winners — and, of course, they come with fatter margins. Given the market right now, and in the foreseeable future, is the BEST strategy as an auto executive to discontinue poorly selling sedans and replace them with crossovers and SUVs?
What say you, Spies?
Renewal period volatility is giving Barracuda a headache as the cloud-focussed protection and security outfit follows its customers away from box sales towards annual subscriptions. Growth has been, well, moderate.
It made $89.3m in revenues in its final fiscal 2017 quarter, 6.7 per cent up on the year before but just an 0.6 per cent increase on the previous quarter. Profits were $3.2m, identical to the year-ago number and 77.8 per cent higher compared to the third 2017 quarter.
Full-year revenues of $352.6m were 10.12 per cent higher than 2016 revenues. Profits were $10.2m, a nice increase on the $4.4m loss made in the prior year.
So we see good but maybe uninspiring results in a still growing business. President and CEO BJ Jenkins mentioned "a solid fourth quarter" in his prepared remarks. "Our performance led to record earnings and the highest free cash flow in our company's history at $58.9 million," he said.
Within the fourth quarter results subscriptions dominated:
Subscription revenue grew to $69.4m, up 12 per cent from $62.1m in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, representing 78 per cent of total revenue
Appliance revenue was $19.9m, compared with $21.7m in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016
Full-year appliance revenue was $82.7m, compared with $89.3m in fiscal year 2016
Gross billings were $103.2m, compared with $95.8m in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016,
Billings for core products increased 21 per cent to $63.8 million, compared with $52.6 million a year ago
The number of active subscribers grew approximately 15 per cent year-over-year to reach 321,000 as of February 28, 2017, with 12,000 net new subscribers in the quarter
The dollar-based renewal rate was 89 per cent (90 per cent on a constant currency basis)
William Blair analyst Jason Ader commented: "Renewal rates were again weaker at 89 per cent, mainly due to impacts from shorter duration contracts, transition to cloud, currency headwinds and legacy business declines. Annual dollar-based renewals, at 97 per cent, remained healthy, unit-based renewals were constant, and customer additions were otherwise healthy at 15 per cent, or 321,000 subscribers."
The outlook for the next quarter was for 5.9 per cent growth in billing, between $103m to $105m, and revenues of $90m to $92m, which means 5 per cent year-on-year growth at the $91m mid-point. Steady as she goes, cap'n.
Barracuda quarterly revenues and profits. Click to enlarge.
The chart of quarterly revenues and net income shows a recent flattening in quarterly revenues growth. The annual picture still shows a neat year-by-year growth pattern:
What we see is a company that has reacted to its customers moving away from on-premises appliances towards public cloud and subscriptions, and is enjoying less than stellar profitability as a result. It grew its subscriber base by 12,000 quarter-on-quarter and almost 43,000 year-on-year but profits stayed exactly the same; $3.2m, reflecting the loss of appliance sales.
Ader writes: "Barracuda once again beat Street consensus expectations for billings, revenue, and EPS, driven by solid execution... We were pleased to see the company show progress in its transition to becoming a public/private cloud security and infrastructure provider, as evidenced by 21 per cent billings growth in the company's core business and reaching the 1,000 customer milestones for public/private cloud."
Earnings call
Jenkins talked of a cloud and security focus in the earnings call. "Barracuda's vision is to be the leading security platform for the mid-market. To achieve this, we are aligning our investments, product portfolio and routes to market to address our customers growing adoption of cloud, SAAS and managed service, IT deployment models with pay-as-you go and ratable billing options."
"Security" here spans e-mail security and management, network and application security and data protection. "E-mail security and management is a cornerstone of our platform," Jenkins said. "E-mail continues to be the primary threat factor and is one of the first applications companies move to the cloud... We now have over 1000 customers leveraging our security solutions in the public cloud."
Responding to a question he said some three and five-year subscription deals were being replaced with annual ones, or even shorter term ones. There is more variability in deals with some, for the Intronis MSP offering, paying by the month.
CFO Dustin Driggs showed Barracuda was a US-centric business. "On a geographic basis, we derived 76 per cent of total fourth quarter revenue from the Americas, 18 per cent from EMEA and 6 per cent from Asia Pacific," he said. That looks like an opportunity.
He added: "Our free cash flow for the year was $58.9 million, up 42 per cent compared to last year."
Ader writes: "The company is making clear progress in its business transition from on-premises appliances to cloud-based solutions [but] while the company has made progress in reaccelerating growth in the core businesses, the public cloud portion of the business is still nascent, and Barracuda's leadership position in the enterprise market is not yet fully proven." ®
Venezuelan City Launches Its Own Currency Amid Cash Crunch
Enlarge this image toggle caption Federico Parra /AFP/Getty Images Federico Parra /AFP/Getty Images
As Venezuela reels from hyperinflation that has caused a severe shortage of cash, one city is trying to mitigate the problem by printing its own currency.
Elorza, in western Venezuela near the border with Colombia, is selling its own bills featuring the image of an independence leader from the area, according to Reuters.
Venezuela's national currency, the bolivar, has lost the vast majority of its value in just the last year — and it is expected to continue to drop. "Inflation is projected to have exceeded 2,400 percent in 2017 and to rise to about 13,000 percent in 2018," the International Monetary Fund said in January.
Prices have skyrocketed, making it hard for people to afford basic necessities such as food or medicine. And even if people do have the money, it's hard to actually find enough cash to buy the goods.
"People don't have bolivares to spend, that's why we have created bills of two denominations," Mayor Solfreddy Solórzano told the BBC.
Elorza has a festival that starts Monday, according to the broadcaster, and local authorities and businessmen were worried that the cash crunch would cause the city to lose business.
"Now those who want to buy just a sweet or even a whole cow from the barbecue, will be able to do so," cattle breeder Canuto Garcia told the BBC.
The mayor's office is selling the local currency at an 8 percent commission, according to Reuters, which can be purchased with bolivars using a card or bank transfer. "People will be able to return the tickets to the mayor's office and claim a bolivar-denominated refund," the wire service adds.
This isn't the first local currency to launch in Venezuela recently. As Venezuela's El Nacional newspaper reports, economist Jose Guerra says that the hyperinflation is causing what he termed "mini central banks" to emerge.
Last December, one neighborhood of the capital, Caracas, started issuing an alternative currency, which it called the panal. As The Associated Press reported, that currency could only be used in a few stores and was meant to help the struggling area buy basic staples such as rice.
At the time, opposition politician Guerra expressed concern that multiple currencies in the country could further deepen the crisis by creating "monetary chaos," the AP added.
Last month, President Nicolás Maduro also proposed a state-sponsored cryptocurrency to ease the cash crunch.
Reporter John Otis told Morning Edition that each unit of the currency would be backed by one barrel of oil. The president has touted the currency as a new innovation, Otis reports, though it has been met with skepticism by some critics who note that the oil "backing" the currency has not actually been taken out of the ground yet.
On Monday, the White House imposed new sanctions on Venezuelan cryptocurrency. The executive order prohibits transactions by U.S. citizens using "any digital currency, digital coin, or digital token," issued by Venezuela's government since January.
As Reuters reports, Maduro's government "blames the country's crisis on an 'economic war' being waged by Washington and the opposition, aimed at toppling his government."
But critics say strict currency controls are a major factor contributing to the crisis. The Council on Foreign Relations explains:
"By selling U.S. dollars at different rates, the government effectively created a black market and increased opportunities for corruption. A business that is authorized to buy dollars at preferential rates to purchase priority goods like food or medicine could instead sell those dollars for a significant profit to third parties."
The country recently reintroduced currency auctions to try to address hyperinflation and foreign currency shortages, as Bloomberg reports, leading to its official rate's losing 80 percent of its value in February. Bloomberg adds that rate was still about 10 times stronger than the black market rate.

2010 mini e electric vehicle ev la auto show 010 Enlarge Photos
BMW Group's Mini brand was an early pioneer of mainstream electric cars. Some readers will recall the brand leased the Hardtop-based Mini E electric car on a trial basis late last decade to help gather feedback from users.
The BMW Group used the gathered feedback for the i3 launched in 2014. But with electric cars increasing in popularity, helped along by the hype surrounding the Tesla Model 3, it's now Mini's turn to launch an electric car.
Mini's new electric car is due in 2019. It will be based on Mini's signature Hardtop body style and be built at the brand's main plant in Oxford, United Kingdom. The powertrain will come from the same plants in Germany responsible for the i3's hardware.
According to Autocar, we'll get an early look at Mini's electric car in the form of a concept at next month's 2017 Frankfurt auto show. The concept is expected to preview both technical aspects and styling elements that will differentiate the electric Hardtop from the regular versions. The range on a single charge should be at least 200 miles.
The BMW Group is hoping that around 15-25 percent of its sales are made up by electrified cars, i.e. hybrids, plug-in hybrids and pure EVs, by 2025. Most of the core models in the BMW and Mini brands will offer hybrid or plug-in hybrid powertrains in the coming years, and more and more pure EVs will be launched in the same period. For example, following the electric Mini will be an electric BMW X3 due in 2020 and the much-hyped BMW iNext due in 2021.
The BMW Group currently offers nine electrified cars and sales of these totalled 50,711 units in the first seven months of 2016, an increase of 74.8 percent on the same period last year. This is the first time the BMW Group has sold more than 50,000 electrified cars in a single and year, and it also makes the BMW Group the world's third-biggest when it comes to sales of electrified cars.

Peru's attorney general has ordered the arrest of two suspects in the killing of 41-year-old Sebastian Woodroffe
A retired doctor who spent years treating drug addiction says he has seen the healing powers of a psychedelic plant that a Vancouver Island man was studying in Peru before he was killed by a mob that blamed him for a shaman's death.
Dr. Gabor Mate said ayahuasca grows in the jungle and is brewed with other plants into a thick concoction people drink at ceremonies in countries such as Peru, Costa Rica and Brazil.
The drug is illegal in Canada. Health Canada said in a statement that ayahuasca is a controlled substance that is considered to have no medical benefit.
Mate said the hallucinogenic medicine is used as part of ancient aboriginal practices to help people tap into childhood trauma with support from a leader, and he has seen its power at work in Peru, and Costa Rica, from where he returned two weeks ago after facilitating ceremonies involving the plant.
“I've known people whose addiction has stopped,” he said, adding he has worked with ayahuasca for 10 years. “I know people who've recovered from medical diseases that otherwise they got little help for. I know a woman who tried to kill herself 17 times, who is no longer suicidal.
“It's not like a drug you give to somebody. It's more that it opens up portals into yourself, understanding self in a new way and having a deeper vision of reality. It's that understanding of the self and a clearer view of reality that helps you heal.”

Peru's attorney general has ordered the arrest of two suspects in the killing of 41-year-old Sebastian Woodroffe, who had travelled to the Amazon rain forest to study hallucinogenic medicine. Officials said forensic experts were studying Woodroffe's body to determine whether he had any involvement in the death of Olivia Arevalo, an octogenarian plant healer from the Shipibo-Konibo tribe in northeastern Peru.
A Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research study published in 2013 in Canadian Drug Abuse Reviews says ayahuasca-assisted therapy delivered in 2011 in a B.C. rural First Nations community experiencing substance use appeared to show improvements in outlook, hopefulness and empowerment and that more research was warranted.
Mark Haden, adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia's school of population and public health, said the plant helps people gain insight and works toward healing but problems occur in impoverished communities where shamans aren't accountable.
“I think psychedelic drugs should be legalized in Canada and North America within a context that allows for people to experience psychedelic medicines in a supervised setting and the supervisors need to be part of an accountable professional body,” said Haden, who is also executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies.
Mate is an author and international speaker on repressed trauma and the emotional and physical effects of hidden stress. He said many of the illicit drug users he treated in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside became addicted in response to unresolved traumatic experiences in childhood.
The ayahuasca concoction isn't a take-home remedy and isn't for people with a history of psychosis, mania, seizures or heart issues, Mate said, adding he couldn't speculate on what set off the events leading to Woodroffe's death, but alcohol and stimulants, such as crystal meth, are more apt to cause violence.
“I've participated in multiple ceremonies and I've seen the occasional person freak out, but rarely. I know people who've done or led hundreds, maybe thousands of ceremonies and never had any acts of violence.”
RELATED: Peruvian authorities arrest two suspects in killing of Vancouver Island man
In December 2015, a Winnipeg man fatally stabbed a fellow tourist from England after the two drank ayahuasca together in a spiritual ceremony a few hours' drive from where Woodroffe was killed. The men drank the hallucinogenic brew before the British tourist grabbed a butcher knife, leading the Canadian to fatally stab him in what British authorities later determined was self-defence.
Mate said that a decade ago, he led a ceremony involving ayahuasca with members of an Indigenous band in British Columbia who'd experienced multigenerational trauma.
Health Canada told him he would have to do a clinical study on the effects of the plant, but Mate said that would have cost millions of dollars.
“It's a completely different entity,” he said of the plant. ”What I wish they would do is look at it realistically and objectively based on international experience.”
Health Canada did provide an exemption to the drug several years ago for a Montreal chapter of a Brazilian religion for sacramental use of the plant.
Rhonda Nelson of Athabasca, Alta., said she went on a life-changing retreat led by Mate in 2015 to deal with anxiety and depression related to childhood trauma before attending similar ceremonies in Peru in January 2017 where she again drank ayahuasca.
“It would be akin to 10 years of psychotherapy. I was able to get in touch with that deep suffering and what the root of it was,” she said.
Nelson, 45, said she also experienced physical healing and no longer has symptoms of congenital myasthemic syndrome, a neuromuscular disorder.
“When I ingested the plant, it brought up emotion in me that I'd been familiar with me all my life but in such a way that the intensity was similar to the intensity that I experienced when it first originated in early childhood,” she said.

After Pakistan thrashed England in the first leg of the ICC Champions trophy semi-final, social media exploded with tweets in support of captain Sarfraz Ahmed.
The skipper was ridiculed on social media after a leaked video showed an uncomfortable Sarfraz asking whether he was to be questioned by English reporters at a pre-match press conference.
While taking his seat at the press conference, Sarfraz asked: "Saray English mein hain?" — Ahsan Iftikhar Nagi (@ahsannagi) June 12, 2017

Press conference say pehly sarfraz pooch raha tha k Kya saray questions English Mei hon gay? I found it awkward — Asif Khan (@mak_asif) June 12, 2017
This Twitter user went a little too far.
From what backwater villiage did they pull Sarfraz Ahmed from?! The man couldn't even speak English! There was no comparison with Kohli! — Zeeshan Shah (@zeeshan_shah_dc) June 5, 2017
Then Karma struck!
Sarfraz may not know how to speak English but he surly knew how to beat English✌???? — Misbah Abbasi (@MisbahAbbasi7) June 14, 2017

They made fun of Sarfraz English & his team is making fun of English team. Savage#ENGvPAK #CT17 — Ravi Chiku (@chiku_ravi) June 14, 2017
Sarfraz going on to show that speaking English isn't the real talent, beating the English is. Sweet sweet justice — Nauman (@iNaumanDogar) June 14, 2017
Actor Hamza Ali Abbasi even uploaded a video in support of Sarfraz, saying a sportsman should be judged on the basis of his performance and not his speaking skills.
“It is disturbing to see the reactions from some people on how he was ridiculed for not speaking a language that is not even his mother tongue,” he said.
“We need to get rid of this colonial slave mentality and inferiority complexes. It is not important that every Pakistani should speak English.”
He pointed out that the team is there to excel at their game, not to learn how to speak fluent English.
“So, if you want to criticise on something, criticise them on their cricketing skills,” he said.
He added that if there's someone who can convey his message to Sarfraz and other players that they should never be embarrassed about not being able to speak a language that is not their native language.
“The appropriate way to go about it is that you can keep a translator with you.”

Titans players who choose to remain in the locker room during the pregame national anthem have the “entire organization's support,” coach Mike Vrabel said Wednesday.
Vrabel said he addressed the issue with his players earlier in the day, while speaking to reporters for the first time since the NFL last week created a policy requiring players to stand for the national anthem if they're on the field before games.
“We talked about the policy,” Vrabel said. “I wanted to make sure that everybody understood the policy that just came out, so as coaches and players and everybody in our organization, we're fully aware of what the policy is. With that being said, we're also fully aware that we have (controlling owner Amy Adams Strunk's) and the entire organization's support to make a decision based on that policy.”
No Titans players ever have knelt during the national anthem, but a handful have found other ways to participate in the widespread protest against racial discrimination and police brutality, which former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began two seasons ago.
Titans wide receiver Rishard Matthews, whose father is a longtime Marine and whose brother was killed in Afghanistan, remained in the locker room rather than stand for the anthem before nearly every game last season. Matthews declined to speak when approached for an interview last week.
Other Titans have raised a fist in the air once the anthem concludes.
Vrabel said the policy doesn't make his job any easier, and he said the team regularly discusses important off-the-field issues.
“It's going to be something that we'll continue to address,” Vrabel said. “We'll continue to address things that affect our players, that affect our team, that affect our fans. Those things are ongoing. That just doesn't come up once a week. We talk about all types of things in the morning in the team meetings, that I think are important.
“Whether that be our conduct off the field, how we treat women, the decisions that we make when we're out at restaurants and bars and clubs, to not get in an automobile and drive. I try to just teach them every chance I get. If there are things that are on my mind and I don't sleep at night, I usually come in and talk to them about them. Every day there's a situation with workplace misconduct or some mistreatment of a female. So I try to remind our guys that we want to stay away from those types of situations.”

A Texas state representative says he's lucky to be alive after he was hit in the head by a stray bullet in the early hours of New Year's Day. Armando “Mando” Martinez (D-Weslaco) was with his wife and children early Sunday outside of his home, which is just north of the Mexican border, when he told The Monitor that the sound of celebratory gunfire prompted them to seek shelter in a garage. After the shooting stopped, he said they went back outside to watch some fireworks. It was then that he felt something hit him in the back of his head. “It felt like a sledgehammer hit me over the head,” he told CBS 4 News from a hospital. Martinez said he and his wife didn't immediately realize he'd been hit by a bullet. “I grabbed [my head] and she said, ‘What's wrong?' I said, ‘I was hit by something,'” he recalled to The Monitor. He was taken to a hospital, where surgeons found and removed a bullet from his skull after a 45-minute procedure. “Before, the [Rio Grande] Valley wasn't as populated as it is now, and growing up you used to hear gunshots many times,” he told The Monitor, referring to celebratory gunfire. “But you can't do that now because somebody's going to end up getting hurt. Unfortunately, last night it was me who got hurt.” Celebratory gunfire, or any other type of reckless gunfire within a city's limits, is a misdemeanor offense in Texas. A man in Houston was also struck by a bullet just after midnight Sunday. The bullet, which is believed to have fallen from the sky, narrowly missed his heart, the victim's friend told ABC 13 News. According to a post on the Dallas Police Department's Facebook page, a bullet fired into the sky can travel up to 2 miles in the air before falling back to the ground at a speed of 300 to 700 feet per second. “Stray bullets kill dozens of people annually,” it warned. A request for comment from the Hidalgo Sheriff's Office, which is now investigating Martinez's shooting, was not immediately returned Monday.

CHICAGO— Children's injuries and deaths from window blinds have not stalled despite decades of safety concerns, according to a new U.S. study that recommends a complete ban on blinds with cords.
Nearly 17,000 young children were hurt by window blinds between 1990 and 2015, and though most injuries were minor, almost 300 died, the study shows. Most deaths occurred when children became entangled or strangled by the cords.
Injuries continued even after manufacturers adopted voluntary safety standards including warning labels. The industry now has a plan in the works to make cordless blinds the only option at retail stores and online.
The study “should be a huge wake-up call to the public, to the retailers, to the manufacturers and to parent all over the nation to really see how hazardous the cords on the blinds are,” said Linda Kaiser of St Louis. Her 1-year-old daughter died in 2002 from strangulation when she pulled a looped hidden cord from a blind and put it around her neck. Kaiser later formed the advocacy group Parents for Window Blind Safety.
While study's data analysis doesn't show an up or downtrend in injuries and deaths, the fact that they're still occurring shows that safety standards have been inadequate, said lead author, Dr. Gary Smith, who directs injuries research at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.
Paul Nathanson, spokesman for the Window Covering Manufacturers Associ-ation, said a soon-to-be adopted industry standard drafted with input from the Consumer Product Safety Comm-ission will make corded blinds unavailable in stores and online, although consumers could buy them through custom orders.
The safety commission says windows and window blinds are among the top five hidden hazards in U.S. homes and in a statement, it called the draft standard “a major step forward in protecting children.”
That standard is awaiting approval by the American National Standards Institute and is expected to take effect by late 2018, Nathanson said.
Smith said 20 percent are custom blinds and a total ban on corded blinds is needed.
The study was published Monday in the journal Pediatrics .
His research team analyzed 26 years of U.S. government data on emergency room treatment and fatal injuries. The study notes that the dangers have been addressed in medical journal articles as far back as a 1945 report on two accidental hangings in children who survived.
“Seventy years ago we recognized that this was a product that was killing kids,” Smith said. “We should put child safety first.”
Source: No to ambush of cadres: Chombo | The Herald April 17, 2017
Zvamaida murwira Herald Reporter
ZANU-PF organs should not ambush individual cadres they feel should be subjected to disciplinary procedures, but should openly call a properly constituted meeting to discuss their grievances, a senior party official said yesterday.
The party's secretary for Administration Cde Ignatius Chombo said due process should be conducted where a person accused of misconduct should be advised of the pending charges and summoned to attend to make representations to the charge.
Cde Chombo's remarks come in the wake of a decision by some Harare provincial members to pass a vote of no confidence on national political commissar Cde Saviour Kasukuwere, and Harare provincial political commissar Cde Shadreck Mashayamombe at the weekend.
The incident resulted in some skirmishes at the provincial offices.
zanu-pf Harare provincial secretary for administration Cde George Mashavave announced the decision where he accused Cde Mashayamombe of working with the embattled Kasukuwere.
In an interview yesterday, Cde Chombo said he was still to get a full briefing regarding what transpired in Harare, but explained procedures to be followed for a vote of no confidence, which dovetailed with what President Mugabe, who is also First Secretary of the party said a fortnight ago.
“I have just heard about it, but I have not yet seen anything from that province. The issue is how many people attended the meeting. If it is the province it has 120 or thereabout.
“The province includes all organs, the youth wing, women and the main body,” said Cde Chombo.
He said another issue that should be followed was the need for reasonable notice given to provincial members including the person to whom the vote of no confidence is intended.
“Some provincial members can argue that why did you call for such a meeting on Easter Holiday when we were at church. Why not convene it openly.
“Others would say why convening such a meeting when we were preparing for Independence celebrations.
“The President said meetings should be openly called for to say we want to call a meeting on such and such a day in respect of complaints we have against our treasury, for instance. The person concerned should be notified,” said Cde Chombo.
He said charges against the person ought to be read to him in that meeting, which should have a quorum.
“Charges against that person should be read to him and (he) responds. You then assess his response. If it is not satisfactory, you then proceed to pass a vote of no confidence. The people who should attend that meeting should be provincial members and not their friends who would have been bussed and given beer. After that you pass on to the organ above you,” said Cde Chombo.
zanu-pf acting Harare provincial chair Cde Charles Tavengwa said, they would investigate the circumstances surrounding the skirmishes.
He said the meeting to pass a vote of no confidence was not duly constituted and those who called it defied the President's directive to halt all demonstrations.
“I was not aware of that meeting and even if they had approached me, I would not have sanctioned it because the President made a directive not to hold demonstrations,” said Cde Tavengwa who is also a Politburo member.
zanu-pf secretary for Information and Publicity for Harare Province Cde Abisha Ushehwekunze, echoed the same sentiments saying they would convene a meeting this week.
Cde Mashavave declined to comment yesterday and referred questions to Cde Tawengwa.

TUNIS, TUNISIA—A woman from Tunisia's moderate Islamic party was elected on Tuesday as mayor of the capital city, Tunis, the first time a woman holds the post. Souad Abderrahim, a 54-year-old pharmacist of the Ennahdha party, won the post in the second round of voting by the municipal council. She defeated her top rival, Kamel Idir, of the party Nida Tounes, founded by the Tunisian president.

Abderrahim, a former lawmaker and militant for women's rights, doesn't wear a veil. She was the only winner so far among a half-dozen women from the Ennahdha party who competed for mayoral posts in the region around Tunis. Tunisia's municipal elections were held May 6, but newly-elected municipal councils are only now voting for mayors. In 2016, Ennahdha declared that it was separating politics from religion, stepping away from the notion of political Islam typically embodied by Islamic parties.

She also said that the female candidates put forth by her party constitute a “message aimed at reassuring the women of my country” that advances made by women in the North African nation would not be compromised by her party. Tunisia has been the most advanced among Arab nations regarding women's rights since gaining independence from France in 1956, with its first president Habib Bourguiba enshrining some principles of equality of men and women in the constitution. Presidential and parliamentary elections are set for 2019.

On May 4, Slippery Rock's own radio station, WSRU 88.1, “The Voice of The Rock” is hosting their 3rd annual Jesse Muto Memorial Car Smash on the Smith Student Center's patio.
“It's all about good vibes, good people and fun,” said Chandler Sendek, the station's training director. “That's what Jesse was all about,” he continued.
When asked what to expect, both Sendek and the station's general manager Ian Ponitz were very enthusiastic about how big this event is to be this year.
“You can expect live music, Back to the Vape with some live glass blowing, and we're working with student organizations for some student-run art at the event,” Ponitz says. “The past two years it's been at the Ski Lodge, but this is the first year it's going to be at the Smith Student Center.”
“Various arts will be performed there that students will be able to take part of, such as spray painting and other painting,” Sendek says. “They can expect games and giveaways of gift cards and other prizes. There will be pizza– lots of pizza. It's a great way to relieve stress.”
“I think the hype we've built and the new location will carry a lot of foot traffic and help make this event a success,” both Sendek and Ponitz agreed.
The event is being held in the honor of Jesse Muto, a previous DJ at WSRU fm and an SRU graduate who was a valued member of the station, and a very close friend of Sendek. The members of the radio hope to honor him with this event and the proceeds by being able to make a plaque in his memory.
If your organization is interested in having a table at the event, contact Ian Ponitz at imp1003@sru.edu.
For any more information on the event, any member of WSRU will be more than willing to talk about it. Keep up with the radio station by following WSRU fm on Twitter @wsrufm or like them on Facebook at WSRU 88.1 FM.

A counselor is the latest to be indicted by a federal grand jury (Source: WSFA 12 News)
A counselor is the latest to be indicted by a federal grand jury for her role in a Montgomery pill mill investigation.
According to United States Attorney Louis V. Franklin Sr., Johnnie Chaisson Sanders, 48 of Wetumpka, has been indicted on charges of health care fraud and perjury offenses.
Court documents indicate Sanders previously provided mental health care counseling services at Family Practice. While working there, Sanders provided counseling services to patients of Dr. Gilbert Sanchez who were receiving controlled substances.
According to the indictment, Sanders is alleged to have provided bogus diagnoses of mental health conditions for the purpose of allowing Sanchez to support prescribing unnecessary medications. The indictment alleges Sanders would also collect cash payments from patients for counseling services even though she knew that Sanchez's office would bill the patients' insurance companies for the same services.
Furthermore, the indictment alleges that during some of the “unnecessary and ineffective mental health counseling”, Sanders would make romantic advances towards her patients. Such advances included but were not limited to, touching a patient's reproductive parts and removing an article of her own clothing.
As for the perjury charge, Franklin says Sanders allegedly testified before a grand jury and falsely claimed Sanchez did not require patients to undergo counseling sessions with her. Documents say Sanders knew Sanchez required patients who received prescriptions for controlled substances to visit Sanders for mental health counseling.
If convicted, Sanders faces a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment for health care fraud and a maximum sentence of five years on the perjury count. Franklin says she also faces substantial fines and monetary penalties.

KARACHI - Bearish spell prevailed at PSX on Monday as benchmark shares index slumped 452 points or (0.95pc) and to close at 47,125 points, as investors likely priced in the worst possible outcome of the Panama case, broker said.
“Today's Blue Monday-esque closing confirms our view that last week's relief rally was indeed a dead cat bounce as the index has collapsed to a low of 47,125 points (lowest since December 27, 2016 closing of 46,920 points), pushing year-to-date return to -1.4pc vs MSCI EM's higher 11.4pc,” said dealers at Topline Securities.
Maximum downside contribution emanated from HBL (slip 1.8pc), ENGRO (3.4pc), FFC (3.8pc), LUCK (1.1pc) & FCCL (3pc), eroding 215 points from the index; while NESTLE (gain 3.7pc), POL (1.4pc), HUBC (0.7pc), NRL (2.6pc) and UBL (up 0.4pc), added 75 points, they added. ATRL (4.9pc) declined on the back of lower than expected 3QFY17 consolidated EPS of Rs6.15, down 74pc QoQ vs Rs23.83 in 2QFY17, as the market was expecting better earnings post completion of refinery upgradation. FCCL reported 3QFY17 EPS of Rs0.5, down -57pc YoY as gross margins contracted 27ppts due to purchase of outsourced clinker post the silo fiasco.
Analyst Ahsan Mehanti said stocks closed sharply lower amid thin trade on concerns for prevailing political uncertainty. Oil stocks outperformed on surging sales data and record earnings announcement by Pak-Oilfeilds for the quarter-end March 2017. Pre budget uncertainty and concerns over impact of Panamagate case decisions played a catalyst role in bearish close. Overall, volumes increased by 23 percent to 154 million shares, while traded value rose by 14 percent at Rs8.2 billion/$78 million.

Donors who sponsored the first 55 theater seats at the Richards Center for the Arts were recently honored at a dedication ceremony and reception at the former Palm Springs High School Auditorium.
Part of the Foundation for Palm Springs Unified School District's “Grab Your Seat” $5 million capital campaign to support arts programming for students across the district, the seat-naming opportunity launched with the opening of the newly renovated and named facility about a year ago. The first $2 million lead gift to the campaign came from Rozene Supple, who provided the funding for the arts endowment and the naming of the auditorium in honor of her family.
At a ceremony and reception earlier this month, the first 55 seats with new inscribed unrests were unveiled to the donors, several of whom purchased more than one seat to honor family members or friends. Several additional seats have been sold since the ceremony. Supporters Claude Brown and Neil Cohen have underwritten the cost of seat naming at the Richards Center, so 100 percent of the $500 per seat cost goes directly to arts programming.

Community members interested in purchasing a seat can visit Inscribing Arts Center Seats or call (760) 416-8455.
“Campaign supporters who opt to name a seat are enshrining their respect for the arts while displaying their concern for the future of our district's students,” said Ellen Goodman, foundation director.
Purchasing plate inscriptions for particular Richards Center seats is just one of several naming opportunities in the campaign. Members of the public can also place their or loved ones' names on gallery walls, in the lobby and vestibule areas, or even name performers' changing rooms.

The foundation's second annual “Grab Your Seat” concert fund-raiser is slated for 6:30 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 18, at the Richards Center. Produced by Michael Childers with Frank Goldstin, the “Grab Your Seat: Icons & Idols” production pays homage to Janis Joplin, Freddie Mercury, George Michael and Prince. Tickets range from $75 to $125 and are available at Icons & Idols Show.

Here's what they had to say about playing at The Blue Moon:
Wendy and Jay Carraro: "Jay and I were given the opportunity to do what we love and be loved for what we do. We met many great people and formed many new friendships along the way, including Bev and her team who very quickly became family to us and we loved every minute of it."
Sean Ashby: "It was always a treat to play The Blue Moon for Bev. Bev is a great supporter of live music!"
Jack de Keyzer: "It was a charming, funky old place. Of course it's people like Bev Finnegan and the fans who make the venues great, so the good times will still be around. Not just once in a Blue Moon."
Cory Williams: "All I can really say is bravo and thank you to Bev and her crew for hosting all of us for a decade. Ten years is a long time for any venue, and we'll be hard pressed to find a kinder host than Bev.
Fred Smith: "Well, it has been a big part of my life as I started entertaining there regularly in 1985, so over 30 years. A great place to make a contribution. Grateful for the many wonderful evenings with so many wonderful people."
Lynn Jackson: "It was great to play a place that had such a cool history and a welcoming crowd and staff, especially the owner, Bev. She is always a pleasure to work with and is herself a big supporter of local music."
Cheryl Lescom: "The Blue moon has meant different things at different times in my life. A place to stop off for a drink and some food while out for a motorcycle ride, a place to see live music and to play live music over the years, different styles in different rooms. Since Bev's ownership it has become more personal to me. True to her word and great for our community, she made a positive difference. She will be missed."
Mike McDonald: "With the number of live-music venues disappearing at an alarming rate right across the country I can only say "thank you, Bev Finnegan" for supporting live music in the K-W region as long as you have and always treating the musicians fairly with respect."
Don Featherstone: "Bev always treated her musicians like gold — which is not always the case with venue operators. Some treat artists as third-class citizens. Bev always dealt squarely and seemed to honestly care about the people she brought into her 'house'."
Erick Traplin: "For the past 26 years I've had the pleasure of playing for the patrons of The Blue Moon. I've met so many good people from here and all over the world who've dropped in to dine on food that schmecks and catch a few tunes. I'm sure going to miss those good times seeing and playing for my friends on a regular basis and that warm, down home country feeling you get when you walk in and oh yeah! I'll miss the Tree!"
Alana Leonard: "I've performed at The Blue Moon many times and also held a successful community fundraiser there, always knowing Bev would do her best to make sure it was a great night. She's leaving behind a solid legacy of hard work and dedication. She's done this largely on her own and despite many obstacles, facing the unique challenges of being a woman in this industry with humour, courage, generosity and grace."
Mark Willms: "The Blue Moon was much more than a venue; it brought together city and country folk, my friends, into a unique, cheerful atmosphere that felt like home. There was a unique vibe and energy throughout the building which will be missed by performers and audiences alike."

Letter: Dismantle the FAA's involvement in medical certification?
By Jim Posner, Poulsbo, Wash. I have long thought that the FAA should NOT be in the medical certification business, at least for Part 91 operations. Ever since my denial – despite letters from my doctors specifically stating that I am good to go – I have tried to understand why they should consider themselves more qualified to determine my fitness to fly than my own experts.
A "horrible law" requires that children be separated from their parents "once they cross the Border into the U.S."
President Donald Trump wrongly blamed Democrats for his own administrator's immigration policy.
"Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there (sic) parents once they cross the Border into the U.S.," Trump tweeted.
Trump recently told Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, "I know what you're going through right now with families is very tough, but those are the bad laws that the Democrats gave us. We have to break up families."
But there is no law that mandates separating children from their parents. Trump's own administration devised a policy to that effect.
So what is Trump talking about?
Whenever parents are charged with a federal misdemeanor (entry without inspection in this case), or awaiting trial, they are placed in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. Children cannot go to jail, so they are transferred to the custody of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement. They are then placed with relatives, juvenile detention centers or foster care. That's a longstanding Homeland Security policy, DHS told us.
Before the Trump administration, immigrants entering illegally as families were rarely prosecuted, said Sarah Pierce, an associate policy analyst of the U.S. Immigration Program at the Migration Policy Institute. Instead, immigrants were held in family detention centers until they were sent to appear before an immigration court or deported.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on April 6 the Homeland Security Department would now be referring all illegal border crossings to the Justice Department for prosecution. Facing criminal charges, parents would go to detention centers, leaving their children unaccompanied.
It's the decision to prosecute parents that is causing the separations.
"That's a choice they have made that's largely different from what other administrations have done," said Peter Margulies, an immigration law and national security law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law.
When we asked for evidence of policies separating families, the White House referred us to items determining what happens to unaccompanied immigrant minors. But none of the children in question would be deemed unaccompanied if the Trump administration did not decide to prosecute their parents.
The 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement, for example, calls for the release of unaccompanied minors to family members or sponsors who can care for them as their immigration case is resolved. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, which Trump has wrongly called "a Democrat rule," determines that unaccompanied minors be transferred to Health and Human Services custody.
The White House argued such policies encourage parents to send their children into the United States, knowing they will be promptly released.
"The cruel and inhumane open borders policies of the Democratic Party are responsible for encouraging mass illegal migration, enabling horrendous child smuggling, and releasing violent MS-13 gang members into American communities," White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said in an emailed statement.
The Trump administration may believe that Democrats are responsible for policies that encourage illegal border crossing, but we found no law mandating that children be separated from their parents.
Our ruling
Trump said a "horrible law" requires that children be separated from their parents "once they cross the Border into the U.S."
There is no such law. The Homeland Security Department's longstanding policy is to separate children from their custodians when they are referred for criminal prosecution. Trump's administration has decided to prosecute all illegal crossings. Families were rarely prosecuted under previous administrations.
We rate this statement False.
Dave Bautista might be getting in a little trouble with Disney after confirmed his return as Drax in both Avengers 4 and Guardians of the Galaxy 3.
The actor revealed this detail during an interview with Collider, explaining what he said to his friends who had contacted him after seeing Avengers: Infinity War.
If you haven't seen the latest MCU movie then STOP reading here, but for those who have, you will remember that Drax was among the superheroes whose life supposedly comes to an end after Thanos successfully fills his gauntlet with Infinity Stones.
“I got a lot of texts saying, ‘I can't believe you're dead, your character is dead,'” Bautista said.
Several Guardians disintegrated in Avengers: Infinity War, including Drax, Mantis, and Star-Lord More
“They were really like heartbroken and I was like ‘I'm gonna be in [Avengers] 4. I'm gonna be in Guardians 3.' I don't know how they're bringing me back, yeah but somehow I'm going to make it because, as far as I know, I am going to be in Guardians 3, so I have to be back.”
Rocket is the only Guardian left alive by the end of Infinity War (and Nebula), but Gamora was killed by her father Thanos in order to obtain the Soul Stone and Star-Lord, Mantis, Teen Groot and Drax disintegrated, potentially into the Quantum Realm.
Of course, there couldn't really be a third Guardians film without the team so it was inevitable that they would be brought back in Avengers 4, and with Captain Marvel being introduced Brie Larson may well make an appearance in it too.
Carol Danvers teams up with the Guardians on several occasions in the comic books so it would be a fan treat to see them in action on the big screen.
The film might also see Mark Hamill join the cast after the Star Wars actor hung out with director James Gunn over the weekend.

NASA has released a daring new concept for a building that could someday house astronauts on Mars, as the space agency continues push toward its goal of sending humans to the red planet by the 2030s. Dubbed the “Mars Ice Home,” the structure would rely on a protective coating of ice drawn from the surface of the planet. According to NASA, the low-tech building would both protect astronauts from Mars' harmful cosmic radiation and be almost infinitely scalable. Researchers recently said that Mars holds massive reserves of ice frozen beneath its surface, almost as much as in Lake Superior. That's why scientists turned to the material when envisioning a future home for Mars residents. “After a day dedicated to identifying needs, goals and constraints we rapidly assessed many crazies, out of the box ideas and finally converged on the current Ice Home design, which provides a sound engineering solution,” Kevin Vipavetz, the facilitator of a design session at NASA's Langley Research Center that produced the idea, said in a press release. The design is just one in a series of potential concepts for structures on Mars, but the idea has several major boons. The building's structure would be lightweight, able to be deployed using robots and filled with water before any humans arrive, NASA said. The water stored in the building could also be used to craft rocket fuel. NASA is actively working toward a manned mission to Mars. It plans to send another rover to the planet in 2020 to follow up on the work by the Curiosity, and aims to start a series of missions in 2018 near the moon to test human capacity for life off Earth. While the ice home is a novel idea, there are no guarantees what design the space agency will ultimately use on the planet. The dome already has some major drawbacks, namely that it'd take more than a year to fill with ice. But that timeline doesn't seem to worry the principle investigator on the project, Kevin Kempton of the Langley Research Center, who said the dome's design would make it feel “like you're in a home and not a cave.” “After months of travel in space, when you first arrive at Mars and your new home is ready for you to move in, it will be a great day,” he said in a press release.

Dothan police are searching for two suspects wanted for an armed robbery at a restaurant late Tuesday evening.
Investigators say the suspects entered Larry's Real Pit Bar-B-Q on Ross Clark Circle around 9 p.m. and held the manager at gunpoint before shooting him. The victim was later taken to an area hospital where they were treated for injuries and are expected to recover.
Police spent the night canvassing the area, searching for the suspects.
Wednesday morning, investigators released surveillance photos of the pair, as well as the potential getaway vehicle.
Police are asking for any help from the community that may lead to the identity of the robbers, who should be considered armed and dangerous.
Anyone with information should call the Dothan Police Department at 334-615-3000.

Based on Vincent Lecavalier's success early in his career, it seemed impossible that one day fans would say, “I'm relieved we were able to trade Lecavalier.” However, this was the case in January 2016. Philadelphia Flyers general manager Ron Hextall pulled off a near-impossible trade given Lecavalier's contract. More remarkable was that he was also able to include Luke Schenn in the deal to unload another contract.
Lecavalier's contract wasn't cap-friendly and, frankly, he wasn't performing to expectations when the Flyers signed him as a free agent in the summer of 2013. Ridding the team of the financial obligation was a win, not to mention the return that included bringing back Jordan Weal and a third-round pick in the 2016 NHL entry draft. The third-round pick turned into left winger Carsen Twarynski.
The Flyers officially locked Twarynski up to a three-year, entry-level contract on Sunday, March 11, 2018.
Projected NHL arrival: 2020-21
NHL Upside: Top-nine forward
Twarynski Making an Impact with the Rockets
Twarynski is 20 years old and plays with the Kelowna Rockets of the Western Hockey League (WHL). He is in his fourth full season posting career highs in goals (45) assists (27) and points (72) in 2017-18. He is currently tied for seventh in goals in the high-scoring WHL.
The Calgary native hasn't been a major point-producer throughout his WHL career but has contributed and done all of the small things right. What has stood out is his responsible play in his own zone. Throughout his junior career, he has posted an impressive overall plus-minus rating of plus-38.
Often time's junior players try to limit their impact to the scoreboard. However, just as important, is not how many goals you score but how many you keep out. The fact is, good things happen when he is on the ice. Playing defensively responsible leads to opportunities and this season he has buried those opportunities on his way to 45 goals.
The Rockets have a strong team this year and are third in the Western Conference. This is a chance for Twarynski to continue his goal-scoring tear and really solidify himself as a responsible two-way player that can do some damage.
Learning from a Good Hockey Guy
Fortunately, Twarynski has a great coach who many Flyers fans are familiar with, former captain Jason Smith. Smith joined the Rockets for the 2016-17 season when Twarynski was acquired from the Calgary Hitmen. Like any young player, getting traded (from your hometown team, no less) can be difficult. When you have a guy like Smith behind the bench, it makes it a bit smoother.
Smith's presence has had a tremendous impact on the players. Having his NHL experience of leading two separate teams as captain and knowing what it's like to be traded, is an advantage for the team.
Smith, a defenseman, was the epitome of a hard worker, a trait that every young hockey player should try to model their game after and has been evident in Twarynski's play since joining the Rockets. He has excelled under Smith's leadership and has continued his development into an impact player at both ends of the ice.
This season Twarynski has already more than doubled his goal scoring from any other season in his WHL career. His confidence with and without the puck has grown and that is reflective of Smith's trust in him. Expect for Smith to rely on him throughout the Rockets' playoff run.
NHL Upside
My projection for Twarynski is that he will be a top-nine forward. Similar to the recent signing of Maksim Sushko, fans can expect to see Twarynski play in the minors for a couple years and with continued hard work and a little luck, he should make the NHL by the 2020-21 season. The tough part is going to be surpassing some of the Flyers prospects who are more highly touted than he is.
Watching him play, you have to assume he will get a chance to crack the Flyers' lineup when the time is right. Look out for Twarynski in the next few years. He is a Dave Hakstol kind of player who can kill penalties and be put out on the ice at any time. Twarynski will make an NHL impact, it's just a matter of when and where. I'm looking forward to seeing him in training camp with even more confidence.
None of this would have been possible without the genius trade by Hextall. Who would have thought that the Flyers would be still reaping the rewards of the 2016 Lecavalier trade in 2018?
The calendar says Tuesday is the first day of spring but it won't look or feel much like it in Iowa.
Meteorologist Allan Curtis, at the National Weather Service, says much of the state's western third will be seeing snowflakes fly as spring arrives. “Fortunately, this thing coming through tonight into early tomorrow is pretty weak. We're not talking about a lot of snow, one or two, might see three inches,” Curtis says. “Primarily, it's going to be western Iowa and the heaviest amounts will be in the northwest corner, but most people are probably going to see an inch or less.”
Spring will officially arrive at 11:15 A.M./Central time Tuesday but temperatures won't be very springlike for a while yet. “Unfortunately, we're going to be on the cool side this week,” Curtis says. “Tomorrow, Tuesday, will probably be the coolest day where we only top out in the mid-30s to low-40s across the state. We will warm up a little bit, 40s into the low to mid-50s, but we're not really looking at widespread 50s or 60s at least through this week and the early portions of next week.”
Kids who love winter weather who want to have one last snowball fight or cobble together a snowman will have to act quickly. “Certainly, getting snowfall through March and even through good chunks of April, it's not too unusual and the good thing is with any of these spring snowfalls, they usually don't last too long,” Curtis says. “It's the same with this one. When it falls, it'll likely be gone within a couple of days.” Some Iowans are already seeing green tulip and daffodil chutes emerge from the cold ground and that tender vegetation could get nipped.
“It would be a good idea to cover them for the next couple of nights, especially if you're seeing growth already,” Curtis says. “We're going to see lows dip down in northern Iowa into the low to mid-20s, but much of central and southern Iowa will be in the upper 20s. Certainly, if you have things starting to bud, it wouldn't be a bad idea to cover them up.” Stay updated on the changing forecast by logging on to weather.gov.

(AP) — From now on, European Union holidaymakers should return home without that sense of high anxiety about their mobile phone bill: extra fees for using it abroad should have gone.
The 28-country EU should be a seamless area of roaming costs for travelers as of Thursday, following years of negotiations to cut often excessive costs to use a mobile outside the home country. It long was a key example to show the EU market was not close to being seamless.
EU Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said: "Citizens can count on us to make sure the promise of such legislation will be fulfilled."
The EU legislature had its final vote in April on how many operators may charge each other for using their networks for roaming, which should cut costs substantially.

TORONTO -
Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne sued the Opposition leader for defamation Monday, less than six months away from the June provincial election.
The legal action stems from comments Progressive Conservative Leader Patrick Brown made in September, a day before Wynne testified as a witness at a trial in Sudbury, Ont., involving two provincial Liberals facing Election Act bribery charges.
Brown told reporters he hoped Wynne would give answers about the scandal “maybe when she stands trial” and went on to describe her as a “sitting premier, sitting in trial.”
The premier was not on trial and had waived parliamentary privilege in order to testify as a witness.
The Tory leader refused to apologize for the statements both after an initial letter from Wynne's lawyer and following a libel notice in October, saying he would “ignore her baseless legal threat.” His lawyer has said the statements were not defamatory.
Wynne's legal team filed a statement of claim in court Monday that seeks $100,000 in general, aggravated, exemplary and punitive damages. Brown's statements harmed Wynne's reputation, they wrote.
“The deliberate, malicious conduct of the defendant in publishing the defamatory statements is part of an ongoing campaign engineered by the defendant and others to harm the plaintiff's reputation,” Wynne's lawyers wrote.
“The defendant's egregious misconduct in publishing statements that he knew to be false, his ongoing refusal to retract these false statements, and his high-handed and oppressive conduct in stating to media and directly to the world at large that the plaintiff's complaints were baseless and would be ignored, all justify an award of aggravated, exemplary and punitive damages against the defendant.”
Wynne's spokeswoman said the statement of claim was filed to preserve the premier's ability to continue with the legal case.
“We continue to remain hopeful that this issue can be resolved with an apology from Patrick Brown for his defamatory remarks,” Jenn Beaudry wrote. “It should be that simple. However, if he continues to refuse to apologize we will have the ability to continue legal action.”
Brown has not yet filed a statement of defence.
Progressive Conservative Bill Walker also made remarks in September suggesting the premier was under investigation and facing charges in connection with the Sudbury bribery trial. He apologized hours after receiving a letter from Wynne's lawyers.
“Mr. Walker's apology and retraction were widely reported in the media and there can be no doubt that the situation was extensively discussed by (Brown) and his staff,” Wynne's lawyers wrote.
“As a result, the defendant was fully aware that the Walker statements were false, and that Mr. Walker had retracted them and issued a public apology.”
The two Liberals on trial in Sudbury were ultimately acquitted.
Wynne previously sued the former Progressive Conservative leader, Tim Hudak, and another Tory member of provincial parliament after the pair said she oversaw — and possibly ordered — the destruction of documents related to two cancelled gas plants. Those are allegations for which two McGuinty-era staffers are on trial and awaiting a judge's decision.
That lawsuit was resolved in 2015, though it is not known whether it was settled or withdrawn.

Iowa's carnivores are again being urged to nominate restaurants in the 2017 edition of the Iowa's Best Burger Contest.
Katie Olthoff, spokeswoman for the Iowa Cattlemen's Association, says there are a few basic burger guidelines to which the restaurants must adhere.
“We're looking for a 100% beef patty,” Olthoff says. “We don't want any other proteins mixed in there. None of those veggie burgers, we're looking for a beef patty. The condiments and the toppings can be whatever you want but it does have to be served on a bread product.” The nominated burger can be gourmet or down-home style and the beef must be raised in Iowa in order to qualify. The 2016 contest winner was The Chuckwagon in the central Iowa town of Adair.
“Last year, we had over 6,000 votes come in that represented 311 restaurants across the state of Iowa,” Olthoff says. “I think it would be awesome if we could find some more great restaurants, just like The Chuckwagon in Adair. We want to increase the number of nominations and increase the number of restaurants that are represented.”
This is the eighth year for the contest. Iowa may be best known for its pork and corn, but we're also a big beef producer. “Iowa has about 3.85 million head of cattle right now and 27,000 beef producers in the state and we are 4th in the nation for the number of cattle on feed,” she says. All nominations need to be received by March 13th.
There are three ways to nominate your favorite burger: online at www.iabeef.org, by texting the word “BEEF” to 313131 which will provide a link to the online voting page, or by using a paper nomination ballot which may be provided by the restaurant. The winner will be announced May 1st.

Sony announced new details on the latest installment of Capcom's “Mega Man” franchise, which will release on Oct. 2.
“Mega Man 11” ditches the 8-bit style for 2.5D graphics style. Mega Man himself has a revamped, anime-inspired look, which freshens up the iconic blue bomber's style. The upcoming title will see the return of nemesis Dr. Wily and some new tricks from Mega Man, including the new “double gear” system.
“The new Double Gear system allows Mega Man to increase his speed, slowing the world around him to a crawl, or power up his Mega Buster shots to blow away tough enemies,” according to PlayStation's blog post. “You'll be able to tap into these new abilities from the start of the game, which can be helpful aids in tricky situations.”
Also on the PlayStation blog are detailed descriptions of two of Mega Man's enemies and their stages, Block Man and Fuse Man.
This year marks the 30th anniversary of Mega Man. For those who want to catch up on the franchise before the 11th installment in October, all of the previous titles were released in May on the “Mega Man Legacy Collection 1 and 2” for the Nintendo Switch.
“Mega Man 11” will be available on PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and PC. A special amiibo edition is currently available for pre-order for the Switch version, which includes an amiibo figure of Mega Man and other collectibles. Those who pre-order any version at select locations can receive a free alternative, in-game soundtrack for eight of the stage themes.

HBL today declared a consolidated profit after tax of Rs34.2 billion for the full year 2016, with earnings per share ofRs23.23. Along with the results, the Bank declared a final dividend of Rs3.50 per share (35per cent), bringing the total dividend for the year to Rs14 per share.
HBL's balance sheet has grown by 13per cent over December 2015to reach Rs2.5 trillion. Overall, the Bank added Rs250 billion in deposits, while maintaining its CASA ratio. Current accounts increased by more than 16per cent, reaching nearly Rs700 billion with the current account mix improving to 37per cent of total deposits. In 2016, HBL grew its average domestic current accounts by 19per cent over 2015, enabling the Bank to reduce its cost of deposits. With the improved economic climate, lending growth has accelerated with loans growing by over 17per cent, driven by increases in Corporate lending, but with strong support from the SME and Consumer segments. The Bank was thus able to grow net interest income by 5per cent to Rs82.0 billion for 2016.
Fees and Commissions rose by 8per cent to Rs18.7 billion with new records being set in Bancassurance, investment banking and consumer finance. Trade, remittances and general banking related fees continued to make significant contributions to fee income. HBL's prudent lending and active recovery efforts have resulted in a decade low provision charge of less than Rs1 billion, an 81per cent reduction over 2015. Simultaneously, the Bank was able to improve its asset quality as the infection ratio fell to single digits, its lowest level in the last 8 years. HBL's reach now includes 2,000 ATMs and nearly 15,000 POS machines to provide access and convenience to its customers across Pakistan.
The consolidated Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) at the end of 2016 was 15.5per cent, with the Tier 1 CAR at12.0per cent, both well above regulatory requirements. The Bank's local credit ratings remain in the highest possible AAA/A-1+ categories for long term and short term respectively, while international rating agencies have also reaffirmed HBL's rating. These are reflective of the Bank's healthy capitalization ratios, sound liquidity profile and its systemic importance. During the year, HBL continued to receive accolades including Bank of the Year in Pakistan, by The Banker, UK, the Best Domestic Bank in Pakistan by Asia money and the Safest Bank in Pakistan, by Global Finance.
When you're cleaning up after number two, don't forget your number one gadget. NTT Docomo, a unit of Japan's telecom giant, has installed smartphone wipes in restrooms at Tokyo Narita International Airport. Toru Hanai / Reuters A man demonstrates the new cellphone toilet paper. The company even posted a helpful instructional video on how to use Japanese toilets and bidets (which it calls a “shower”) as well as the new smartphone wipes. The company said the wipes will be in some of the Narita bathrooms until March 15. Toru Hanai / Reuters A close-up look at the new smartphone toilet paper. The wipes also double as ads for NTT's wifi service as well as a travel guide app that offers voice translation for visitors to Japan. But no matter where you are, giving the phone a wipe isn't a bad idea: A 2012 study for the Wall Street Journal found poop germs on all eight of the cellphones randomly tested, while a University of Arizona study found that phones are 10 times germier than the typical toilet seat.

It's important to celebrate major life milestones with family — and for actors, with their television families, as well. On Sunday, America Ferrera's baby shower reunited the Ugly Betty family, and the pictures from the event will make you so nostalgic for the show. Ugly Betty, which first aired in 2006, starred Ferrera as aspiring magazine writer Betty Suarez. The series often focused on Betty's family, including her older sister Hilda, played by Ana Ortiz, and her nephew Justin, who was captured by Mark Indelicato. Ferrera shared plenty pictures of the shower to Instagram, and Ortiz and Indelicato were both featured. The two stars posed with Fererra, putting their hands on her belly, and the caption read "The Ugly Betty Family".
The shower took place at Beauty & Essex in Los Angeles, and it looked like a fun and laid-back evening. The actor posed for plenty of photos with friends and family, and wore a bright floral dress for the event. She shared many of these photos on Instagram, and captioned the photo set: "No poopie diaper games here. Just dancing, drinking (water for me), and some of the people we love to celebrate the little human we can't wait to meet."
The event brought together old and new costars, and even though Betty's father Ignacio, played by actor Tony Plano, wasn't able to make the event it was still adorable to see the Suarez family from Ugly Betty back together.
The Ugly Betty cast wasn't the only television family invited to the event, and plenty of Ferrera's Superstore costars appeared, as well. In a group photo, Kelly Stables, Kaliko Kauahi, Nichole Bloom, Ben Feldman, Colton Dunn, Nico Santos, and Lauren Ash can all be spotted posing with the star.
The event also, of course, brought out Ferrera's offscreen friends and family. Her friend Elsa Collins appeared in a photo, and Ferrera thanked her for planning the event in the caption. Her IRL siblings, parents, and her husband all had a pic of their own, too.
Ferrera announced her pregnancy on New Year's Eve, and soon will welcome her first child with husband Ryan Piers Williams. In the adorable Instagram announcement, Ferrera and Williams held up baby clothes and wrote: "We're welcoming one more face to kiss in 2018! Wishing you #MásBesos in the New Year! #babybesos #HappyNewYear."
While the cast of Ugly Betty are certainly excited about their former co-star to be a mother, it's not the star's only recent blast from the past. In early January, she met up with Blake Lively, Amber Tamblyn, and Alexis Bledel, who all starred in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants to celebrate the baby news and promote their work with the Time's Up initiative. Ferrera posted a pic of the four stars gathered on a couch and captioned it: "Starting the New Year off with blessings from my Sisterhood. We've got work to do for the next generation. Let's get to it. #TIMESUP".
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants stars have all gone on to have successful careers of their own. Bledel won a Creative Arts Emmy last year for her role in The Handmaid's Tale, Lively has appeared in many movies and shows over the years, and Tamblyn, who is an activist and writer, will publish her first novel in June. The women likely had lots of great advice for Ferrera, as they all have started families of their own in recent years.
Ferrera's baby shower also wasn't the first time she reunited with members of the Ugly Betty cast recently. In September 2017, she met up with Becki Newton, who played frenemy assistant Amanda, and Michael Urie, who appeared in the series as Marc St. James. She captioned the photo: "Not one ounce of love (or stupidity) lost in the 7 years since the end of #UglyBetty". The two actors might not have made it to the shower, but it's clear Ferrera's friendships with the cast of the show have stayed strong over the years.
The actor hasn't yet revealed the baby's sex, nor has she landed on a name. The couple is also keeping the due date under wraps, but the shower might be a hint that it could be soon. What is clear is when the baby is born, Ferrera's family on and off screen will be ready to celebrate.

ISLAMABAD - Imran Khan on Friday submitted details of bank transactions regarding transfer of UK Pound 562,415 in ex-wife Jemima's account from Niazi Services Limited in the Supreme Court.
A three-member bench had directed the counsel of PTI Chairman Imran Khan to provide banking transaction to prove that UK Pound 562,415 money from the NSL bank account shifted into Jemima's account.
In September 28 proceeding, Naeem Bukhari instead of submitting bank transaction produced two letters, which Imran Khan had written to the Barclays Private Bank Limited on April 11 & 18, 2003, for transfer of UK Pound 38,124 in the Tahir Nawaz's bank account and UK Pound 562,415 in the account of Jemima Khan. However, the court had shown reservation over it. Justice Umar Bandial had said: “You are public office-holder. Please show us something except letters that UK Pound 562,415 went into the account of ex-wife.”
The statement submitted in the apex court on Friday mentioned that Jemima Goldsmith also sent an amount of £79,000 for design of construction of Banigala, adding that such amount has been declared before the Election Commission of Pakistan during the year of 2003, including the detail of loan to Jemima from the NSL and receipt of the funds which Jemima received from the Anglo Irish Bank.
The court has been informed that after payment of loan to Jemima from the NSL account, the remaining amount of £100,000 was spent for legal proceedings' expenditures about London flat after which no amount was left in the bank account of NSL which Imran Khan would have to mention in the tax return and declarations of assets.
Imran Khan submitted that from 2002-2007 he was member of National Assembly, saying neither there was any amount receivable nor he received any amount from the account of NSL during this period.
Details of the documents submitted in the court explained that no amount was in the NSL bank account in 2013 so Imran Khan didn't mention details of the account before the election commission while submitting nomination papers for the 2013 general elections.
Earlier, during the course of hearing of the plea on October 3 the apex court asked Naeem Bokhari, counsel for Imran Khan to submit verified documents of the bank transactions between Jemima Goldsmith and Imran Khan for Banigala land.

Goblin Korean drama episode 10 showcased a very interesting twist in the popular primetime drama series which focuses on Reaper and Sunny. The show proved to be the hottest Korean drama today and it became even more interesting with the revelation of one of the biggest mystery presented since the show first aired: How are Sunny and Reaper linked? He's going home just to call her when he just met her.
???? this Grim Reaper #goblinkdrama #goblin #kdrama pic.twitter.com/vhDi6mAaq6 — WND | #GAMEINC17 (@wnurdayana) December 17, 2016 Fans of the Goblin Korean drama are treated to a very interesting episode during the New Year's Eve as the show revealed Sunny's past through the Grim Reaper played by My Girl star Lee Dong-wook. If you have yet to watch the Goblin Korean drama Episode 10, be warned. Spoilers lie ahead. She said she's Sunny, and I think the Grim Reaper can be Rage. LOL ???? #jonaxx #goblin #goblinkdrama #도깨비 pic.twitter.com/Iumgz8qQtK — JAEYEOL'S (@EXObsess) December 11, 2016 As fans may have already guessed prior to the airing of Goblin Korean drama episode 10, Sunny may actually be the reincarnation of the Goblin's sister, Kim Sun. From what we know, the Goblin keeps a scroll containing the portrait of the young woman who died first the moment he defied the King's order. At first look, this girl appeared to be someone special in the Goblin's like when he was still a mortal known as Kim Shin played by Gong Yoo. But as more episodes were aired where more mysterious characters were unveiled, we soon learn that the lady in white was actually his younger sister. What we have yet to learn before Ep 10 was how she is related to Sunny and the amnesiac Grim Reaper. Earlier in the show, Grim Reaper cried the moment he laid eyes on Kim Sun's portrait owned by the Goblin—the same way he teared up when he first saw Eun Tak's very pretty and carefree boss, Sunny. In the Goblin Korean drama Episode 10, we are treated to a review of the last scene in Episode 9 where Sunny suddenly holds Reaper's hand which then gave him a chance to peek at her past life. Much to his surprise, Sunny was actually the reincarnation of Goblin's younger sister whom he first saw in the old scroll. Now, other clues presented in Goblin Korean drama's previous episodes are gradually making sense and becoming more linked as flashes of Reaper's memory appear where it seemed like he and Sunny were in love during their past lives. omg what if the king is chicken place pretty unnie rather than the grim reaper and he could've been the queen #Goblin #goblinkdrama pic.twitter.com/i6PxaiJ20P — saf (@SenpaiMeU) December 9, 2016 Proof of this is their first meeting where both are attracted to the same ring which worn by Goblin's sister who became the Queen. This particular ring makes its first appearance in the show's pilot episode as it is worn by the Queen when she took an arrow to the heart to support her brother. All these mysterious things occurring in the series centered in interesting the deities featured in show including the handsome but uptight Grim Reaper. In Goblin, Grim Reapers are “recruited” from souls of people who incurred grave sins in their past lives. They are then stripped off of their memory before they serve as Grim Reapers. In Reaper's vision of Sunny's past life, the King was in love with the Queen but was manipulated into ordering the death of his wife's brother, then-General Kim Shin. Could it be possible that the Grim Reaper is actually the King? Is it his sin to allow himself to be manipulated by the evil whispers of his power-hungry counsel and tutor, Park Joong Won? It is possible considering that Samshin, the Goddess of Birth and Fate played by Lee El, mentioned in an earlier episode that the two were fated to meet and love each other. Of course, this is only mere speculation though what we're sure of thus far is that Sunny is truly Kim Sun, the Goblin's sister. Goblin is a Korean drama about an immortal being cursed to live on and become a lonely guardian and protector of souls and would only die and achieve peace if his bride pulls the sword that keeps him immortal. It is by far one of the highest rating Korean primetime drama shows all in South Korea and is quickly becoming a favorite all over the world. [Featured Image by tvN]

Do androids dream of electric sheep? Search me, but obviously they get prenatal advice from Tobor the Great! The press screening for this movie was the first time I've ever been tempted to wear a mask to see a movie and apply for protective services in order to write a review! Warner Bros. found it necessary to instruct those of us in the press to deny that we'd even attended the advanced screening and suggested we avoid revealing the various cameos (although Edward James Olmos is clearly visible in the latest trailer), not to mention who is and who is not a replicant (though after seeing the film I've the vaguest idea), or to talk about Deckard or Rachael, and to generally glaze over the plot – so figure it out for yourself!! Here's a one sentence summation: Officer KD6.3-7 (Ryan Gosling) is assigned to investigate the last gasp of the Tyrell Corporation's fetishized technology, and does so without getting swallowed by a whale! However, despite its façade being awash in redundancy, this film is one long pause after another, full of thinly veiled versions of already familiar characters. And this time around the innovations are as mundane as a detachable sunroof that also serves as a drone camera and a highly calibrated eminator that permits a holographic love interest to move freely about like the emergency medical avatar on Star Trek: Voyager some fifteen years ago! Both the Philip K. Dick book and Ridley Scott's film were about the future; this movie seems to be set in the waning hours of last weekend!

HAFIZABAD - The All-Pakistan Special Persons Federation (APSPF) on Sunday held a demonstration in front of Press Club Hafizabad against the failure of police for not arresting the teacher and his accomplice for allegedly raping a handicapped student.
The girl is student of Government Special Education Centre Hafizabad. The protesters led by Hafiz Muzammal Riaz, the federation's chairman, and its other office-bearers strongly condemned the inhuman act of teacher Zohaib Bashir and clerk Zakaullah of the education centre. They allegedly subjected her to their animal lust for more than a year. They called upon the DPO and chief minister of the Punjab to take prompt measures for their early arrest. They also demanded dismissal of the principal of the centre otherwise they would be constrained to launch a country-wide protest demonstration.
According to the brother of the victim, the police have miserably failed to arrest the accused who have got pre-arrest bail from the district courts on Saturday till January 5. He demanded justice and deterrent punishment to the accused.
Hafizabad termed polio-free district: The district administration has said that Hafizabad is polio-free district of the Punjab as no polio case was reported in the district during the last year. For the success, it credited the anti-polio campaign, health officers, Ulema, social workers, teachers and parents who played their positive role in administration of drops to the children in the district.
The district coordination officer expressed these views while presiding over a meeting of Anti-Polio Committee Hafizabad in district complex. Ali Randhawa said that officers and officials of the health department performed their duties with responsibility and commitment to make the anti-polio campaign successful in the district.
He added that with the special efforts of EDO Health Dr Muhammad Aslam Shaheen, the performance of Health Department had improved. The EDO apprised the meeting that anti-polio vaccine was administered to more than one lakh and ninety three thousand children in the district.
32 SUSPECTS NAILED: The district police have arrested 32 suspects during a search operation carried out in Kasooki Police precinct on Saturday. According to police spokesman, the Kasooki Police nicked 32 suspects during a search operation. Later after biometric verification, 27 of them were released. The police also recovered huge quantity of illicit arms and drugs from six persons and registered separate cases against them, the spokesman said and added that accused Amar, Mujahid, Azam etc had also been involved in robberies and other heinous crimes.
He said that the police have been put on high alert across the district in view of prevailing security situation and new year celebrations.
He said that strict checking is being carried out at all entry and exit points of the district while patrolling has also been increased.
DORTMUND, Germany, Aug 12 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday rejected a proposal made by her Social Democrat rivals to introduce quotas for electric cars in Europe, arguing the implementation of such targets would prove too complicated.
Social Democrat leader Martin Schulz, Merkel's main challenger in the Sept. 24 national election, on Friday called for such a quota - both in Germany and across the European Union, saying it would encourage industry to innovate.
"I don't think that the quota for E-cars - for this technology - has been well thought out," Merkel told supporters of her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the party's employers' arm in the western city of Dortmund.
"Then we would negotiate for ages in Europe. What would we do if it is not adhered to?" she added of the quota. "Could petrol engine cars no longer be bought?"
Instead, Merkel called for a bigger strategy for helping the auto industry make the transition to producing electric cars.
"We need to innovate quickly," she said. "Where companies can't manage it alone, the government must stand behind them and shove things along."
The auto industry is Germany's biggest exporter and provides about 800,000 jobs. But politicians fear Germany's carmakers are failing to invest enough in new technology and infrastructure - concerns that have been mounting since the Volkswagen emissions scandal broke in 2015.
Merkel, whose CDU leads rival parties in opinion polls, is campaigning for a fourth term in office on a platform of economic stability. She has repeatedly warned against "demonising" diesel engines.
Her conservatives have promised tax cuts worth some 15 billion euros ($17.72 billion) annually as well as increased spending on infrastructure, defence and security. ($1 = 0.8463 euros)

Unlike other toys that push cats to move, this one really caters to their minds and imaginations, while also promoting happy play through foraging. Another reason to love this maze and puzzle feeder is that it suits older cats, as well, since they don't have to run or leap around, but can still use their paws in creative ways to get what they really want the most.
3 This Affordable Rainbow Charmer That They'll Chase Anywhere Amazon Cat Dancer Products Rainbow Cat Charmer $4 AmazonBuy Now This cat charmer is one of those hidden gems on Amazon when it comes to pet toys, specifically because it's colorful enough to catch a cat's attention and cheap enough to fit almost any budget. Another major perk to this toy is that it really helps foster a greater sense of bonding with your pet, since the rainbow charmer is attached to a stick that you can shake and move around however you want. Handmade in Wisconsin, this comes with an unbreakable wand and 4 feet of patterned fleece, which cats can bite, claw, scratch, and tug at with as much force as they please. One reviewer describes it as the perfect toy "for even the most jaded cats," while another raves, "my cat who typically gets bored with toys very quickly has been playing with this for weeks and loves it."
4 This Combination Laser Pointer And Ball Tumbler That Also Dispenses Treats Amazon Yofun 3-In-1 Multi-Functional Spinning Cat Toy $16 AmazonBuy Now This three-in-one device functions as a ball tumbler, food dispenser, and laser pointer, so that no matter what type of play your cat enjoys best, they'll get it with this one. The tumbler has a goofy face attached to it and spins around once it's batted, or you can turn on its auto function and get it spinning on its own. As the tumbler spins in a random pattern, the laser pointer flashes on and continues to operate for up to 10 minutes. The dispenser, which is wide enough to fit most cat treats, leaks out food as the toy spins, giving cats even more incentive to keep playing. Ideal for multi-cat households, this is one toy you can definitely get plenty of long-term value out of.
5 This Cat Tunnel That'll Nurture Your Pet's Stealthy Side Amazon Easyology Kitty Cat Tunnel $15 AmazonBuy Now For some kitties, playtime calls for stealthy crawls through small, dark spaces and tunnels. Enter this cat tube toy from Easyology, which is designed to give cats a really thrilling maze-like experience. Reviewers of this nearly0perfect, five-star-rated toy say you should aim to connect at least two tubes or more if you really want to give your pet a play experience to remember.

2018 Chrysler 300 Enlarge Photo
Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne is scheduled to reveal a company-wide strategy Friday at an investor meeting in Balocco, Italy, his last before his retirement next year, and there are rumors swirling the plans might call for the axing of Chrysler, which sells just the 300 and Pacifica.
The rumor was reported Wednesday by Automotive News (subscription required), which cited an anonymous source.
Another Automotive News source said the plans might also call for the pull out of Fiat from the United States and China, as well as a shrinking of the iconic Italian brand's lineup.
This rumor is backed up by a report from Bloomberg published May 25 claiming Fiat's lineup would shrink to just the 500 and Panda, and that production of the affordable cars would be moved outside of Italy to make way for additional higher margin luxury models from Alfa Romeo and Maserati.
Sergio Marchionne Enlarge Photo
The irony isn't lost that the two brands that form FCA's name are two of the most neglected in the automaker's portfolio (the worst is actually Lancia which has one model and operates exclusively in Europe). However, given Fiat and Chrysler's low margins and limited markets compared to FCA's other brands, the result is not at all surprising.
It was in Balocco in 2004 where Marchionne, who had just been named CEO of a Fiat, announced a turnaround plan for the automaker which was struggling at the time. Since then he's merged Fiat with Chrysler and boosted the group's value more than ten-fold.
Also expected in his final strategy to be announced Friday will be more models for current cash cow Jeep, expansion of Ram into more markets, redesigns for Dodge's aging fleet, and possibly greater integration of Alfa Romeo and Maserati ahead of a possible spinoff of the Italian brands.
We should know more tomorrow so stay tuned.

Goodbye, Mr Tottenham.
Seldom, if ever, has a half-­century in football commanded such affection and universal respect.
Fittingly, Steve Perryman bowed out, after 50 years as a player, ­manager and director of football, at Wembley.
He played there in front of 100,000 fans for England schoolboys against ­Scotland in 1967, drove past it every day for 20 years on his way to training at Tottenham and lifted the FA Cup two years ­running as Spurs captain before taking his final curtain at Exeter's League Two play-off ­defeat by ­Coventry.
Perryman won the FA Cup, UEFA Cup and League Cup twice each in 854 games for Tottenham, but he was ­revered way beyond his north London constituency.
He was the bloke next door who played football with ­endearing honesty, ran half a dozen sports shops and became a working-class hero as Tottenham's greatest ­captain since Danny ­Blanchflower.
(Image: Professional Sport/Popperfoto/Getty)
“It's too easy to call people ­heroes these days,” said ­Perryman at home in Devon, holding court in a living room as spotless and ordered as his playing career. “A hero is someone who goes in the trenches and doesn't get fed for three days, but there is always room in life for a code of honour.
“I was lucky to be brought up in a culture of football integrity at Tottenham – from Bill Nicholson and Eddie Baily to Keith ­Burkinshaw and Peter Shreeves – which stood me in good stead and gave me longevity in the game.
“But I can't be party to a lot of the nonsense that goes on now. If we're going to play this game, let's do it right.”
At 66, Perryman is thankful for what he achieved and has no pangs of regret about the titles or England caps that passed him by.
It is six years since he collapsed, at Exeter's final game of the ­season, and spent three weeks in a coma after being airlifted to hospital for life-saving heart surgery.
(Image: MDM)
He laughs at the memory of being transferred, drifting in and out of consciousness and “wires hanging out all over the place” when he was wheeled into a lift by porters and an obtuse Exeter fan, who happened to be in the same elevator, leaning over to demand: “Are we going to sign a centre-­forward, or what?”
With time on his hands, ­Perryman will be a more frequent visitor to his spiritual home in N17.
He said: “I'm going to attend more Tottenham games – I want to go back home where I feel truly ­respected because I like the north London opinion on football. We're not all on the same side in that part of the world, but we are on the same wavelength.
“When I was ill, my wife didn't let me have the phone for six months, and when I went through all the messages and emails, it was humbling.
“I wish Ray Wilkins had read and heard some of the things that were said about him before he passed away, because not only did I dodge the bullet, but I got the chance to read what people were saying.
“The most respectful message of all came from three friends who said, ‘Dear Steve, get well soon, blah, blah, blah, best wishes... and it might surprise you to learn we are ­Arsenal supporters, but we know a good opponent when we see one.' That'll do for me.
“Although I'm a west London boy by birth, that's why I regard north London as home: They don't give you any bull****, they tell you how it is and they know if you're on it, and I was on it at Tottenham.
(Image: Getty)
“Without blowing my own trumpet, I always felt that these were my people and I was ­representing them on the pitch.
“What have I learned most from 50 years in football? Above all, you have to be true to yourself, and when I got a blood clot on my lung at Christmas, I knew it was time to be sensible.”
Naturally, there are aspects of the grand old game Perryman won't miss – dark arts, ­people spouting drivel on the airwaves and interminable coach journeys prominent among them.
“I won't miss the lack of respect to ­wonderful ­managers like Arsene Wenger from people I considered good ­professionals,” he said.
“He deserved ­better than two-faced comments saying he should resign one minute and what a great manager he was the next.
(Image: PA Wire)
“And I won't miss this modern blight of ‘game management', which I detest – it's one of the worst things I've witnessed in ­football.
“People pay hard-earned money to watch matches, and they are being cheated by ways of keeping the ball out of play.
“I'm talking about managers who tell the ballboys not to give the ball back so quickly when their teams are winning, goalkeepers taking a minute over every goal kick, players rolling around ­feigning injury, substitutions ­taking forever. If football has come to all that, you count me out.”
After Perryman's retirement, football is another good man down.

STEVE PERRYMAN ON... LIFTING THE FA CUP
His return to Tottenham as an assistant and then caretaker manager ended in acrimony, but Steve Perryman is glad he spent so much of his career there.
However, he also recalled that he was once so happy to have won the FA Cup with the club that he almost forgot to collect the trophy!

“Do I regret staying at Tottenham for 19 years as a player? Not a chance. Do I regret not playing for England more? Not a chance. I was proud to help make the club as good as I could,” he said.
“I probably could have earned a lot more money by moving around, but I don't regret that, either.
“My highlights would have to include scoring twice against AC Milan, both from outside the box, and going to pick up the Cup first time after Ricky Villa's famous winner against Manchester City.
“I was so delirious I forgot it was my job to climb those stairs to collect it till I got a tap on the shoulder and someone said, ‘Steve, don't forget the Cup!'.”
STEVE PERRYMAN ON.... HIS HERO GREAVESIE
Arise, Sir Greavsie.
Wouldn't it give Tottenham's peerless goalscoring legend a lift in his twilight years if we gave him a day out at Buckingham Palace?
Before the arrival of the Premier League, Jimmy Greaves scored a record 357 goals in English football's top flight – and Steve Perryman says he was an incomparable finisher.
(Image: Allsport/Getty)
He said: “People talk about Harry Kane breaking all scoring records at Tottenham – and that's one for the future to sort out – but Jimmy doesn't need my help to elevate him higher than the rest because he was the best.
“When you are a young player, training on the same field, why would you not look over at a master of his craft, knocking 20 shots into the corner like he's shelling peas? Jimmy was greased lightning over the first two or three yards, which was all he needed.”
Greaves suffered a stroke three years ago and Perryman would “absolutely” support a knighthood for the (scorer) of 44 goals in 57 England appearances.
STEVE PERRYMAN ON... SPURS' CLASS OF 2018
Mauricio Pochettino's current Tottenham side need to give talisman Harry Kane reasons to stay by ending the club's 10-year trophy drought.
Spurs' most decorated player said: “Talented as this group of players is, with a strong element of home-grown lads, the hardest trophy to win is always the first one.
“Until that happens, people will always wonder.
(Image: Getty)
“But Harry is a fantastic example of why no club, even at the top level, should underfund or underestimate the value of home-grown talent.
“Harry seems the type who will stay – and I hope he stays at Tottenham for life – but I will understand if he doesn't. Spurs need to give him reasons to stick around.
“When people used to talk about me being loyal to Tottenham, I would think: ‘It's not really a hardship.' On its own, to play more games for Tottenham than anyone in their history is not enough, but it ain't bad.”
STEVE PERRYMAN ON... THE SHOP FLOOR
England captain Harry Kane will never need to open a chain of sports shops because he can't find his favourite boots.
But that's what Steve Perryman – who started on £18 a week as a professional – did to top up his income.
He said: “My brother and I decided to open a sports shop because when we were buying boots, we could never find the ones we wanted.
“For 30 years we had successful stores in Hayes, Uxbridge, Ruislip and Greenford, and I used to put in a few hours behind the counter.
“If I had known I was going to play for Tottenham for 20 years, we'd have opened one in north London, too.
“You won't see Premier League footballers opening a sports shop now because there's no need. But I was still on £28 a week when I had been in the first team for three years.
“Am I jealous of modern-day wages? Not at all. I was born in 1951, so my early life must have been affected by the back end of rationing – and you were happy to have what you were given.”
Chris Lattner, one of the key creators behind the Apple programming language Swift, is on the move again. After a short six-month stay at Tesla, which he joined last year from Apple to act as VP of Autopilot Software, Lattner announced on Twitter today that his next stop is Google Brain.
Lattner, who worked for more than a decade on low-level software and systems at Apple, revealed in June that he wasn't going to be staying on at Tesla after finding that it wasn't “a good fit.” Lattner then joked that his resume was “easy to find online,” and noted his top qualification: Seven years of Swift experience, which is the longest anyone not on his immediate team at Apple can reasonably claim without outright lying.
I'm super excited to join Google Brain next week: AI can't democratize itself (yet?) so I'll help make it more accessible to everyone! — Chris Lattner (@clattner_llvm) August 14, 2017
Swift isn't Lattner's only major contribution to the world of programming: Prior to his helping hand with Apple's latest coding language, he created the Land compiler and LLVM. In other words, you'd be hard-pressed to find a modern developer whose work hasn't been touched at a fundamental level by something Lattner has created in the past.
Google Brain is the search giant's team focused on deep learning and artificial intelligence. It focused on helping to use AI across a range of products, tackling both research and product integration, working together with teams across Alphabet, including at DeepMind. Its ultimate stated motivation is to advance the field with open source projects, academic collaboration and publication.
Communities affected by mining across South Africa have rallied behind a legal battle to grant residents the power to refuse companies mining rights.
On Tuesday, lawyers in the case between the community of Xolobeni and the Department of Mineral Resources concluded their arguments before the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria.
The date for the final judgement on the case is expected to be announced tomorrow.
Hundreds of people from provinces including Mpumalanga, Free Sate, Limpopo and the North West had travelled to Pretoria to support the people of Xolobeni.
The community is demanding that the courts grant them the power to refuse Mineral Resources Commodities the right to extract titanium from their ancestral land which situated along the Eastern Cape's Wild Coast.
Tshepo Maredi from Theunissen in the Free State said his community understood the plight of the people of Xolobeni.
“Mining companies impose themselves on communities. We don't have a say. We support the community's right to say no,” Maredi said.
Six different scorers led the South Carolina Stingrays (28-11-4-1) to a 6-2 win over the Orlando Solar Bears (19-20-5-1) on Friday during Star Wars Night at the North Charleston Coliseum.
Four skaters had multi-point efforts including forwards Joe Devin, Steven Whitney and Nick Roberto, who each registered a goal and an assist, while defenseman Travis Walsh added two helpers. Goaltender Parker Milner earned the win by making 23 saves.
The Solar Bears struck first when Tayler Thompson beat Milner to make it 1-0 at 3:31 of the opening period.
South Carolina responded at 11:02 when defenseman Danny Federico took a pass from Whitney and wristed the puck at the net. The shot beat goaltender Mackenzie Skapski to his right and tied the game for the Stingrays. Federico's third tally of the season also had an assist by Devin.
Devin was the next scorer for South Carolina, blasting a one-timer past Skapski's glove on the power play at 12:40 of the first to give the Rays a 2-1 advantage. Assists on the first man-advantage goal of the night were credited to Walsh and defenseman Paul Geiger.
Late in the frame, Patrick Gaul won a face-off right to Dylan Margonari, who didn't waste any time before unleashing a shot that hit the back of the net at 18:28 of the period to make it 3-1 South Carolina.
The Solar Bears scored the only goal of the middle period when forward Joe Perry tapped in a pass in front of the net by Milner to cut the Stingrays lead to 3-2 at 7:51.
Whitney took advantage of an errant pass in front by Skapski and found the back of the net at 6:50 of the third period for his 14th strike of the year to push South Carolina's lead back up to two goals at 4-2.
Orlando pulled their netminder in the final minutes in an attempt to get back in the game, but Roberto made sure that didn't happen with an empty net marker from Tommy Hughes at 16:58 of the third. The Wakefield, Mass. native's second goal of the season grew the Rays' lead to 5-2.
Finally, after a late penalty to Orlando's Mike Monfredo had the Stingrays on a power play in the last minute of the game, Hampus Gustafsson batted a pass by Walsh out of the air and into the net for his fifth goal of the season. Scored at 19:30, Gustafsson's goal also had a second assist from Roberto.
The Stingrays had a 39-25 edge in shots on goal during the game and also won the special teams battle, going 2-for-4 on the power play while holding the Solar Bears to 0-for-3. Skapski turned aside 33 saves for Orlando in a losing effort.
South Carolina now heads to Jacksonville to take on the Icemen on Saturday night at 7:30 p.m. The Stingrays return to North Charleston to host the Icemen on Friday, Feb. 16 at 7:05 p.m.
5G is nearly here. The next generation of wireless connectivity promises superfast speeds, ultra-low latency and more network capacity than ever. 5G auctions have or are due to take place in the US, UK, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Germany, Australia and host of other countries.
The Pyeongchang Winter Olympics was billed as a major 5G-powered event. Companies such as Nokia, Ericsson, and Intel are all promoting their 5G credentials, with Huawei pushing the issue particularly hard saying it will be selling 5G ready infrastructure in the coming months.
But is this actually the case?
“I believe 5G is really, really over-hyped considering that there's only a few known use-cases that people really know that we need it,” says Magnus Jern, Chief Innovation Officer at mobility consultancy firm DMI.
“Of course, we do need 5G; there'll continue to be a huge demand for increased capacity, lower latency etc, but we just need to be realistic about the timeline. There will probably be a lot of use cases that can really leverage 5G, but are probably going to take five to 10 years, rather than next year as some of the operators are promising.”

(Reuters) - Singer-songwriter Neil Young's extensive collection of model trains have fetched nearly $300,000 at auction, along with classic cars and musical equipment owned by the 72-year-old folk-rock icon.
A model train which is part of a collection of recording artist Neil Young's most prized possessions being put up for auction by Julien's Auctions in Los Angeles, California, U.S., December 9, 2017, is shown in this photo provided November 2, 2107. Julien's Auctions Gallery/Handout via REUTERS
Young, a model train enthusiast for decades, offered more than 230 pieces at Julien's Auctions in Los Angeles from his collection of Lionel trains, including a custom-painted Commodore Vanderbilt 4-6-4 locomotive that sold for $10,000.
Several cars that Young owns were also sold. A 1953 Buick code 76X Roadmaster Skylark convertible with a steering wheel hub that says, “Customized for Neil Young,” went for $400,000, the auction house said on Saturday.
Young, best known for his Woodstock-era songs as well as his work with the bands Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young has said the vast model train layouts at his California ranch helped him connect with his son Ben, who has cerebral palsy.
Other items auctioned off on Saturday included some of Young's guitars, amplifiers and microphones.
A portion of the proceeds will benefit the Bridge School in California, which Young's ex-wife Pegi Young co-founded in 1986 for children with severe speech and physical impairments.

LAHORE - Plains of the country, including Lahore, remained in the grip of severe heat on Tuesday with massive outages adding to woes of heat-stricken people.
Experts are seeing no relief from harsh weather conditions due to a lack of significant rains during the next 2-3 days. In Lahore, mercury rose as high as 44 degree Celsius, making Tuesday the hottest day of current summer. Minimum temperature was recorded 28C.
Excessive use of air conditioners at offices and homes caused increase in demand of electricity that led to hours' long loadshedding across the country. Enormous burden on transmission system caused frequent tripping. This also affected operation of Wasa tubewells that led to water shortage in parts of Lahore. People avoided unnecessarily coming out, reducing traffic on otherwise busy roads at noon and in the afternoon. The Lahore Canal, as usual, attracted a large number of people including women and children. Not only youth but also elderly people were seen bathing in the canal. At certain places even women were seen beating the heat by taking a dip in the mud coloured canal water.
According to the experts, shallow westerly wave is affecting upper parts of the country and likely to persist during next 24 hours.
The Met Office forecast mainly hot and dry weather for most parts of the country
Meanwhile, severe heat wave has caused alarming increase in weather related diseases, especially among elderly people and children. Experts have laid stress on precautionary measures to avoid getting summer related diseases. “Extremely hot weather has increased gastroenteritis, sunstroke, high grade fever and allergy. Excessive pollution is causing respiratory tract infection, cough and flu, and stomach upset,” said leading family physician Dr Abdul Rauf.
“Avoid unnecessarily going out especially at noon and in the afternoon. Wear light clothes, avoid physical exertion, direct exposure to sunlight, cover head while going out and consume more water,” he suggested.
Trees, shrubs and bushes – be they for ornamental effect or edible fruit production – represent such good value for money, and there are several opportunities throughout a year to introduce them to your garden.
They come in two different forms; those grown in containers, and nursery-grown stock, which are lifted and arrive in a bare-rooted state. The former are more expensive.
I'm continually asked about the best time to plant each type and the response is straight-forward. Autumn is generally recognised as a good time for both because many plants go into a semi-dormant state, prompted by falling temperatures and shorter days.
Although the air becomes cooler, the soil retains enough warmth to encourage new root growth before winter.
Mid-September planting of pot-grown specimens gains full advantage of a relatively high soil temperature. Bare-rooted types are not dug and delivered until the leaves have fallen so November planting is more appropriate.
Container-grown plants can, in theory, be introduced to the garden at any time of year because they emerge with a solid root-ball, the shape of the pot they've occupied. This facilitates planting with the least possible disturbance. However, I'd avoid any dry summer period where constant watering is required for survival.
Also avoid planting any specimen that has become pot-bound with a bunched circle of roots. These must be teased apart with gloved hands or a tool to break the cycle. Any perennial planted with a tightly-bunched root system will struggle to make progress afterwards.
Bare-rooted planting is confined to the period between November and March, which means that the plants are collected or delivered during unpredictable weather conditions. Frosted gardens prompt a temporary holding operation, during which time the roots must be kept moist.
Heeling them into the garden at the slightest hint of thaw, covering the roots in moist compost undercover, or plunging them into water occasionally, are possible ways of keeping the plants fresh.
Whichever perennial plant you're introducing to the garden, make sure it is given a location that suits, and prepare the chosen site well in accordance with its needs.
Dig a hole slightly deeper and wider than the roots to accommodate organic matter, compost and fertiliser, and water the contents well before planting. This ensures that some moisture is present at the plant's roots from the outset.

Zidane, a “Unifying Figure” in a Divided France On March 6, the Paris Saint-Germain soccer club lost to Madrid (1 to 3). However, French supporters rejoiced. They celebrated the return of their favorite athlete, French soccer superstar and Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane, who has been living in Spain since 2000. An unknown player until the 1998 World Cup, where he scored two goals that ultimately allowed France...
MADRID-Juan Benito Druet has just learned that his life may be about to change.
In the next few hours he will receive a healthy kidney thanks to a pioneering system that has made Spain the world leader in organ transplants for the past 25 years.
“We don't know what will happen. but you have to take a chance,” said Druet, 63, a reserved and moustachioed boilermaker, as he lays in his bed at Madrid's La Paz hospital. Hospital staff try to reassure him by telling him organ transplants are carried out every day in Spain.
Doctors performed 4,818 transplants last year, including 2,994 kidney transplants, according to the health ministry's National Transplant Organisation (ONT).
That means there were 43.4 organ donors per million inhabitants last year, a world record, up from 40.2 donors in 2015. By comparison in the United States there were just 28.2 donors per million inhabitants in 2015, 28.1 in France and 10.9 in Germany, according to the Council of Europe. “It is even better than if we had won the jackpot in the lottery,” says Druet's wife Jeronima, 60, as she sits close to him along with the couple's two adult children. Now she dreams of going on a cruise with her husband, something impossible as long as he needed to be hooked to a 15-kilo (33-pound) kidney dialysis machine every night to filter his blood.
The transplant operation lasts four and half hours.
Surgeons make a 15-centimetre (six-inch) incision in Druet's abdomen to transplant a healthy kidney extracted the night before from a woman who died.
After a transplant patient “start to regain weight, their health improves. It is as if we transplant lives,” the founder of the ONT, Rafael Matesanz, tells AFP.
Matesanz oversaw the implementation of a centralised and well-oiled organ donation and transplant system which has been replicated in Portugal and Croatia and inspired others across Europe.
Each hospital has a transplant coordinator, usually a doctor or nurse who specialises in intensive care, charged with identifying patients at risk of a heart attack or brain death.
In both situations kidneys, livers, lungs, pancreas and sometimes even the heart can still work and can be transplanted.
Organ donations are quickly reported to the ONT which searches for the best match from its organ waiting list.
If the patient is far away, a cooler with the organ is sent by plane inside the cockpit with the pilot.
The operation is free under Spain's public health system, anonymous and available only to residents of the country to avoid organ trafficking.
“What makes the difference is the organisation of the system. This network, this centralisation, is the key,” says Marie-Charlotte Bouesseau of the World Health Organisation's department of ethics.
Worldwide only about 10 percent of all patients who need a transplant receive a donated organ, she adds.
“That means that 90 percent will die while they are on a waiting list,” she explains.
In Spain only four to six percent of patients died in 2016 while they were on a waiting list for a vital organ - a liver, heart or lung.
Ramon Garcia Castillo, 85, a former TV technician, spent 13 months on dialysis before he received a kidney transplant in 2010.
He would previously trek to a hospital three times a week to be hooked up to a machine for three-and-a-half hours.
The kidney transplant “gave me my life back”, says Castillo, who now just needs to take pills to ensure his body does not reject the donated kidney.
The other secret to the success of the Spanish system is training and communication, explains Matesanz.
Since it was set up in 1989, the ONT has trained over 18,000 transplant coordinators who break the news of a person's death and then gently convince their loved ones to agree to donate their organs.
Spanish law presumes consent for organs to be removed on their death unless they had previously made clear that they were against donation.
But loved ones are systematically consulted.
“You have to have a lot of empathy, sensitivity, respect,” says Belen Estebanez, the transplant coordinator at Madrid's La Paz hospital.
The work of a transport coordinator was depicted in Spanish director Pedro Almodovar‘s 1999 Oscar-winning movie “All About My Mother”. The director consulted with the ONT to prepare the movie.
“If they have a lot of doubts we ask them what the person was like, if they were generous...from there we get them to reflect on an organ donation,” adds Damiana Gurria, another transplant coordinator.
“It comforts many families to know that the organs of their loved ones will live on inside someone else, that people will be thankful for the rest of their lives.”
Castillo said he drinks two litres of water each day and follows a balanced diet since he received his new kidney.
“I have to take care of it, especially since it was given to me. I have to be thankful.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy was expected to grow for an eighth straight quarter in October-December, the longest period of expansion in about 30 years, a Reuters poll found on Friday, led by robust exports and solid domestic demand.
Gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated to have expanded at an annualized rate of 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, the poll of 19 analysts found.
That would be the longest streak of growth since a 12-quarter stretch of growth between April-June 1986 and January-March 1989 around the height of Japan's notorious economic bubble.
The pace of growth likely slowed in the fourth quarter from annualized 2.5 percent growth in the third quarter, but analysts believe the deceleration will be temporary.
The expected annual expansion would translate into 0.2 percent growth from the previous quarter.
“The economy is forecast to improve thanks to both domestic and foreign demand on the back of recovering the global economy,” Yusuke Ichikawa, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute said in the survey.
“But we need to be vigilant about financial market fluctuations, a slowdown in China's economy, and geo-political risk from North Korea.”
Poll respondents also noted rises in import costs from new-model smartphones and higher oil prices would trim Japan's trade surplus. But exports were expected to remain strong on robust shipments of goods such as cars and semiconductor manufacturing equipment.
The median forecast saw capital spending rising 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, up for a fifth straight quarter, on buying of equipment to ease labor shortages and brisk demand from semiconductor makers.
Private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of GDP, rose 0.4 percent for the quarter, recovering from a 0.5 percent fall in the third quarter, the poll predicted. The poll showed the economy received no contribution from external demand - or exports minus imports - after it contributed 0.5 percentage point to GDP growth in July-September.
The Cabinet Office will publish the GDP data on Feb. 14 at 8:50 a.m.(2350 GMT, Feb. 13).
Japan's current account balance was seen likely to show a surplus of 1.02 trillion yen ($9.30 billion) in December, shrinking from a 1.35 trillion yen of surplus in November as higher oil import costs trimmed the trade surplus, the poll found.
The finance ministry will release the data at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Feb. 8, Thursday (2350 GMT Wednesday).
ROME (Reuters) - An Italian man opened fire on African migrants in the central city of Macerata on Saturday, injuring six people before he was captured, in what police said was a racially motivated attack.
The shootings happened just days after a Nigerian migrant was arrested in connection with the death of an 18-year-old Italian woman, whose dismembered body was discovered stuffed into two suitcases near Macerata.
Police named the suspected shooter as Luca Traini, 28, and said he had an Italian flag draped over his shoulders when he was seized in the street by armed police. Onlookers said he made a fascist salute before being handcuffed.
“He drove around in his car and when he saw any black people he shot them,” Marcello Mancini, a Macerata resident, told Reuters television. Police said one of the six victims was seriously hurt and needed surgery, but gave no further details.
Traini also fired shots at the offices of the ruling centre-left Democratic Party (PD) in Macerata, but did not injure anyone there. The PD said he had stood as a candidate for the rightist Northern League at local elections last year but had not received any votes.
The League backs fiercely anti-immigrant policies and is part of ex-prime Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right alliance that is leading in the polls ahead of a March 4 national election.
League leader Matteo Salvini distanced himself from the shooting, but blamed mass immigration for the tensions.
“I can't wait to get into government to restore security, social justice and serenity to Italy,” he told reporters.
PD leader Matteo Renzi called for calm.
“The man who fired the gun, hitting six people of colour, is a squalid, mad person. But the state is stronger than him,” he wrote on Facebook.
Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said Italy would come down heavily on anyone promoting violence.

“We will stop this risk. We will stop it immediately. We will stop it together,” he said. “Hatred and violence will not be able to divide us.”
DENIED ASYLUM
Police said the shooter drove around Macerata, which is famed for its outdoor opera festivals, in a black Alfa Romeo car firing out of his window at migrants in various locations.
With police closing in, he left his car in the city centre but was almost immediately stopped. Local media said he shouted, “Long live Italy,” as he was taken away.
Tensions in Macerata had risen this week following the gruesome discovery of Pamela Mastropietro's body. The teenager had run away from a drug rehabilitation centre on Monday and met a Nigerian asylum seeker, Innocent Oseghale, the next day.
Her body was found on Wednesday and a preliminary postmortem could not immediately identify the cause of death.
Witnesses said they had earlier seen Oseghale with the suitcases in which the body was found. He refused to talk to the police after his arrest. Newspapers said he was denied asylum last year but had remained in Macerata to appeal against the decision.
“What was this worm still doing in Italy?” Northern League leader Salvini wrote on Facebook at mid-week, accusing the centre-left government of responsibility for Mastropietro's death for allowing migrants to stay in the country.
“The left has blood on its hands,” he wrote.
More than 600,000 mainly African migrants have reached Italy by boat over the past four years, and thousands have perished on the journey. The centre-right bloc, which includes the League, says the vast majority have no right to asylum and has promised mass expulsions if it takes power.
Leftist parties have ruled out any such deportations.
“What happened today in Macerata shows that inciting hatred and whitewashing fascism, as Salvini does, has consequences. It can spark violence,” said Laura Boldrini, a leftist politician and the speaker of the lower house of parliament.
LOS ANGELES (AP)  Southern California won its final nine games last season after losing at Utah in quarterback Sam Darnold's first start.
The No. 14 Trojans will aim for another streak after falling at No. 11 Washington State. They play lowly Oregon State on Saturday. Coach Clay Helton has spent the last week emphasizing that every goal USC wants to accomplish can still be achieved.
"For us as a team, we're in a great situation right now. You are always trying to improve year in, year out, and I remember this time last year we're sitting at 2-3," Helton said.
But to meet those expectations, injury-riddled USC (4-1, 2-1 Pac-12) will need to get healthy. Right guard Viane Talamaivao is out for the season with a torn pectoral muscle that requires surgery, and his likely replacement, freshman Andrew Vorhees, was held out of practice Thursday with a tight back. However, he's still expected to play.

Right tackle Chuma Edoga is doubtful with a high-ankle sprain. The list of bumps and bruises seems to get longer every week.
Helton couldn't help but ruefully laugh when recounting how linebacker Jordan Iosefa and wide receiver Jalen Greene were injured when they accidentally collided during pregame warmups against the Cougars.
"I've never seen it in 23 years," Helton said. "It was a bad deal. We've had some bad luck lately. That's about as much as I can take as far as injuries go."
USC will handle those injuries without a bye week during the regular season. The struggling Beavers (1-4, 0-2) might be the closest thing to a win because of their own injury woes. Running back Ryan Nall is a game-time decision after spraining his ankle in a loss to Washington last week, and quarterback Jake Luton remains out indefinitely with a thoracic spine fracture.
Redshirt junior Darrell Garretson will start for Oregon State. In nine games since transferring from Utah State, Garretson has completed 50.6 percent of his passes for 711 yards, four touchdowns and four interceptions.
Oregon State has been outscored 200-71 in its four games against FBS teams. However, USC said it is not overlooking a team that will be desperate for an upset.
"USC is a lot of people's Super Bowl, especially a team like Oregon State, so we just got to stick to what we do," USC safety Chris Hawkins said.
Here are some things to watch as the Trojans and Beavers meet for the first time since 2014:
DARNOLD'S DOLDRUMS: Darnold threw for 164 yards against Washington State, his lowest total as a starter. Some of that can be attributed to an offensive line playing most of the game without three starters and facing a strong Washington State pass rush. Plus there's been turnover at wide receiver. Darnold will have reinforcements in both areas as left tackle Toa Lobendahn and wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. will return to the lineup this week. Lobendahn didn't play at Washington State due to a skin infection that required intravenous antibiotics. Mitchell has missed the last two games with a groin injury.
LA COLISEUM: Oregon State hasn't beaten USC in Los Angeles since 1960 and has lost 23 straight games at the Coliseum. Only five of those games have been decided by one possession, while USC has been ranked in the Top 25 in all but six of those meetings.
TYNER TIME: With Nall's status in doubt, senior running back Thomas Tyner could be in line for his most significant workload since playing for in-state rival Oregon against Ohio State in the 2015 national championship game. Tyner medically retired from the Ducks after shoulder surgery sidelined him for the 2015 season before transferring to Oregon State in May. A former five-star recruit, Tyner has rushed for 72 yards and one touchdown on 15 carries in three games this season. During two seasons at Oregon, Tyner rushed for 1,284 yards and 14 touchdowns, including 124 yards and two touchdowns in the 2015 Rose Bowl win over Florida State.
MISCUES: Oregon State has turned the ball over 14 times this season, the second-worst total in the FBS ahead of only San Jose State. Even worse, opponents have turned those four interceptions and 10 fumbles lost into 79 points (10 touchdowns, three field goals). The only time Oregon State hasn't allowed a score after turning the ball over came last week against the Huskies, when safety David Morris intercepted a pass to get the ball back after running back Artavis Pierce fumbled.

The long-anticipated boxing match between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor is now closer than ever. We chronicle their larger-than-life personalities through the years. (0:55)
The Nevada State Athletic Commission has approved a request submitted by Mayweather Promotions to host a boxing event on Aug. 26 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.
NSAC chairman Anthony Marnell told ESPN the commission approved the request as an item on its consent agenda on Wednesday.

Earlier this week, multiple sources told ESPN that Mayweather Promotions planned to retract its request for the Aug. 26 date, but the promotion informed NSAC officials late Tuesday evening it would not do so.
"I got a call (Tuesday) night from Mayweather Promotions that they wanted to be put back on the agenda, so I put them back on the agenda," Bob Bennett, executive director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission, told ESPN. "They pulled the request but then decided to put it back on."
According to multiple sources, Mayweather Promotions secured the date for a potential boxing match between Floyd Mayweather, the former pound-for-pound king, and UFC star Conor McGregor. The two sides have not announced a finalized deal, however, and Mayweather Promotion's request was for an unspecified event.
The approved request is for an event to be televised on Showtime, Mayweather's broadcast partner. It is also for MGM Grand Garden Arena, which shares the same parent company as Las Vegas's T-Mobile Arena.
McGregor and UFC president Dana White have previously announced they've come to terms on their side of what would be a blockbuster summer event. The UFC is owned by entertainment agency WME-IMG. Earlier this month, the Los Angeles Times reported negotiations were underway between the entertainment powerhouse and Al Haymon, Mayweather's longtime advisor.
Showtime executive Stephen Espinoza also confirmed negotiations are taking place to ESPN.
Editor's Picks Vegas taking big Mayweather-McGregor bets Las Vegas sportsbooks already are taking thousands of dollars in bets on a Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor fight even though the blockbuster bout has not been finalized.
Mayweather (49-0, 26 KOs) retired from professional boxing after defeating Andre Berto in September 2015. Many observers expected him to return at some point to chase a record of 50-0. Based out of Las Vegas, he has stated publicly a bout against McGregor is the only fight that would currently bring him out of retirement.
McGregor (21-3) is a two-weight UFC champion, having own belts at 145 and 155 pounds. The Irish star hasn't fought since he defeated Eddie Alvarez at UFC 205 in November. He has never boxed professionally.
The Mayweather-McGregor card is expected to be a boxing-only card, and Mayweather has said he wants two of his company's top fighters to appear on it, Badou Jack (21-1-2, 12 KOs), a former super middleweight world titleholder who vacated his belt in January to move up to light heavyweight, and junior lightweight world titlist Gervonta Davis (18-0, 17 KOs).
Source: Police block MDC Hurungwe rally – DailyNews Live
STAFF WRITER 6 October 2017
HARARE – Police in Karoi have banned an MDC rally set to be addressed by
MDC vice president Nelson Chamisa to mobilise people to register to vote
ahead of next year's hotly-contested election, the opposition party said
yesterday.
The rally on October 7, just after the start of the Zimbabwe Electoral
Commission (Zec)'s voter registration blitz, would have been the latest in
a series of rallies by MDC against the incumbent President Robert Mugabe,
whom they claim has vandalised the economy.
Police have received notice of the rally from the organisers.
MDC spokesperson Obert Gutu said: “We note with dismay that the police
have today stopped the MDC `Chakachaya' Star Rally billed to be addressed
by MDC vice president honourable advocate Nelson Chamisa on Saturday has
been banned
“The police in Hurungwe have denied the party permission to hold a voter
registration and mobilisation rally at Chikangwe Stadium, Karoi in
Mashonaland West province.
“In a letter erroneously dated September 04, 2017, the Officer Commanding
Hurungwe District Chief Superintendent B. Ncube wrote to the party's
Hurungwe district indicating that it was impossible for the party to
proceed with the rally, owing to undisclosed reasons.”
Gutu said the police had been notified of the rally by the local
leadership in terms of the law.
“This development is disturbing particularly considering that a genuine
free and fair election is predicated upon all political parties being
given an opportunity to access all places of the country.
“We also note that Zanu PF gatherings ahead of the voter registration
blitz that kicks off on Tuesday are being allowed to proceed
uninterrupted,” he said.
“The party is undeterred and therefore remains focused on convergence and
converging the nation for the people's imminent victory.”
The MDC urged “all our supporters to turn out in their numbers and
register to vote in the coming elections.”
“None but ourselves will free us from the shackles of a clueless
government that has allowed the economic situation to deteriorate to these
plumbing depths,” Gutu said.
Kendrick Lamar's fourth album, “DAMN,” is a sprawling yet sparse masterpiece that blends layers of introspection with Lamar's typical political, topical and religious themes. Foregoing the classic hip-hop storytelling of his commercial debut, “Good Kidd, M.A.A.D City,” and the jazz/funk inspired poetic political diatribe of “To Pimp a Butterfly (TPAB),” “DAMN,” is something completely different from anything Lamar has produced and different than anything else in the hip hop world.
“DAMN” is a project of duality, a constant theme in Lamar's work. “A Gemini, duality personalities always conflict in me,” he raps on “untitled 06” from his b-side LP “untitled unmastered.” Throughout the record he grapples with issues of competing emotions: lust and love, humility and pride, faith and fear, life and death.
Less broad in its reach than his previous albums, “DAMN” is a journey through the mind of a man who feels stuck between being a saviour for his people, his home and the fickle rap industry and being an eternally damned soul in the eyes of the universe. This duality is also felt sonically in the music, which switches between hard hitting, trap-inspired beats paired with Lamar's violent flow and dreamy tracks that find Lamar sharing more sing-songy verses with collaborators such as Rihanna, and the new-to-the-scene falsetto of Zacari.
The lyrics in “DAMN” are more direct and visible in meaning than Lamar's previous album. This is not to mean that the album lacks vivid symbolism and metaphorical language, but it relies more on its direct diction and shots at everyone ranging from “wack artists” to the figureheads of Fox News and the Commander in Chief himself, than on deeply complex metaphors.
The jazz production of “TPAB” is replaced on “DAMN” with experimental, direct beats that range from the hard knocking trap, audio panning beat of “DNA” or “HUMBLE,” to the Steve Lacy-produced, Mac DeMarco vibe inducing “PRIDE.”
The album is less angst and anger than it is meditating spirituality and self reflecting disquiet. The tunes shift sonically throughout the album, ranging from the late summer night driving song “LOYALTY ft. Rihanna,” to the experimental (the beat's centerpiece is an alarm clock-esque siren) hard hitting lyrical malaise “XXX (ft. U2),” to the boom-bap and guitar backed three parted storytelling of “FEAR. ”
The album might not share the musical complexity and funk inspiration of TPAB, but it matches the award winning 2015 album in terms of lyrical content. The first track, “BLOOD,” combines lush production with a spoken word segment by Lamar that finds him being shot (the gunshot punctuates the song), before fading into a clip from a Fox News segment where the reporters criticized Lamar's hit 2015 song and the eventual anthem of the Black Lives Matter movement, “Alright.”
The reporter's critique of Lamar is quickly responded to in the hardest hitting song off the album, “DNA,” which sees Lamar exploring the duality inherent within his own views of his blackness and that of society's. “I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA,” he rattles off in double time flow.
He switches between personal accounts and attacks against the establishment he sees as purveyors of prejudice and hate towards the black man. The schizophrenic “XXX,” which features the unexpected appearance of Irish band U2, dives further into the political and social themes of the album, finding Lamar rapping a verse in which he pushes a friend (whose son was recently killed) to incite violent revenge, in opposition to Lamar's usual peaceful demeanor.
In the second verse following the U2-provided bridge, he critiques the political climate in America today and provides the world context for his push towards violence. In the second verse he raps: “But is America honest or do we bask in sin?/Pass the gin I mix it with American blood.” It's a striking, paradoxical song that harkens back to Lamar's 2015 song, “The Blacker the Berry,” in which Lamar rapped that he was “the biggest hypocrite of 2015” for decrying black on black gun violence when he engaged in it himself.
On “FEAR,” which might serve to be the centerpiece and defining lecture of the album, Lamar brings us on a three-part journey through his life and the constant emotion of fear. At seven, he fears the exhaustive authority of his parents, at 17, he fears death at the hands of his peers or the police and at 27, he fears losing all he has earned in life and being judged as a reflection of himself, his family and his city.
After the three vignettes of his life, Lamar fires off a verse in which he raps maybe one of the most striking poetic messages of his career: “Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth/And I can't take these feelings with me/So hopefully they disperse/Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax/Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap.”
These lines define an album that serves in under 55 minutes to showcase a troubled yet celebratory artist at the top of his game and an artist that will have an impact for untold years to come.
WASINGTON, Oct 7 (APP):Pakistan's Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif on Friday said that Pakistan will continue to play its positive role in bringing peace to the region, but called for recognizing its legitimate security concerns in the wake of the new South Asia strategy announced by US President Trump.
In his opening remarks to the US and international media here in Washington, the Minister said that after the announcement of this South Asia Strategy, the bilateral relationship between Pakistan and the US have taken a new turn.
“If on one hand, US has its concerns about the future of Afghanistan, Pakistan seeks recognition of its legitimate security concerns in the region,” the Minister said, who is on a visit here at the invitation of US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
Minister Asif said that Pakistan was genuinely concerned with regard to the role accorded in the Strategy to India in general and its efforts geared to destabilization in Balochistan, in particular.
Kh. Asif reiterated that Pakistan would continue to play its positive role in bringing peace to the region through measures agreed upon by all relevant stakeholders. ”We believe that a political approach characterized by an Afghan owned and Afghan led process will yield durable peace in the interest of Afghanistan and the broader region,” he added.
The Foreign Minister said that his visit was a follow-up trip to Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi during which he's meeting with Vice President Mike Pence on the sidelines of UNGA on September 19, 2017. Meeting with Secretary Tillerson was an important interaction after President Trump announced US South Asia Strategy in August, he added.
The Minister said that Pakistan greatly valued its relationship with the US in seven-decade long history of result oriented cooperation and we want to build a relationship founded on mutual respect.
“We firmly believe that through consistent, structured and constructive engagement, at political and diplomatic levels, both the countries can continue to work together for the common goal of peace, stability and prosperity in South Asia,” he added.
He also underlined enormous investment and business opportunities in Pakistan for corporate America, particularly after Pakistan's remarkable successes in war against terror and significant reduction in terrorist incidents in the country.
However, he added that Pakistan believed that unless there was stability in Afghanistan, the dividends of peace in the region would continue to elude us. “To achieve that goal both US and Pakistan need to work closely,” he added.
The Minister also stated that Pakistan has completely wiped out all the hideouts used by terrorists and anti-state elements, but this was an ongoing process with continuing intelligence based operations by law enforcement agencies across the country.
He told the media-persons that Pakistan has offered candid cooperation to Afghanistan during the recent visit of the Army Chief and the Foreign Secretary to Kabul recently, where they had successful and productive meetings with President Ashraf Ghani, the CEO Abdullah and others in the Afghan hierarchy.
The Minister said that Pakistan was extremely concerned about safe havens of terrorists who are mostly operating from ungoverned spaces in Afghanistan which are more than 40% of the total area of the country. A number of terrorist attacks in Pakistan in recent months have been traced back to these elements operating from these bases in Afghanistan, he added.
(Reuters) - LIVERPOOL 1 EVERTON 1

Everton captain Wayne Rooney equalised from the penalty spot in a Merseyside derby that ended 1-1 at Anfield on Sunday and left Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp fuming.
With the snow swirling, Rooney stepped up in the 77th-minute and sent the ball straight down the middle. It was his first goal in a match between two of English football's greatest rivals.
Mohamed Salah earlier fired Liverpool ahead with a 42nd-minute stunner that sent the Egyptian clear of Tottenham Hotspur's England striker Harry Kane as the league's top marksman with 13 goals this season.
Liverpool stayed fourth with 30 points, 13 adrift of leaders Manchester City who were playing later at second-placed Manchester United.
Chelsea is third on 32 with Sam Allardyce's Everton moving up to 10th.
While Salah's goal was a breathtaking effort, the penalty left Klopp far from speechless with the German taking issue with the referee's decision after Dejan Lovren was adjudged to have pushed Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the back.
Lovren was still protesting with officials after the final whistle while Klopp argued with a Sky Sports television interviewer.
Asked what he had said to the referee, Klopp replied: “That I don't understand what he's doing. That's what I said. I didn't use one swearing word.”
The German, who defended his decision to take off Salah with 22 minutes remaining, refused to accept it had been a penalty and said his side had been the only ones trying to win.
“The other team was not even in our box, I don't know if they had a shot on target apart from the penalty. To give them an open door like this, in my understanding, that's not OK,” he added.

Klopp said Lovren had not even made a challenge.
“Calvert-Lewin makes a step...the hand is like this on the back, you saw it,” continued the manager. “If you think it is a penalty do it, say it.”
When told that it looked a soft one, Klopp laughed out loud. “So, then we can stop the interview because I only want to talk to people that have a little bit of understanding of football.”

He later apologised, adding: “There are greater catastrophes on this planet than getting a point after a game like this but it feels not too good.”
Klopp's side are now unbeaten in 10 games in all competitions, and stretched their unbeaten run against Everton in all competitions to a record-equalling 15 games.
But the manager's team selection was called into question after he left Brazilians Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino out of the starting lineup. Firmino eventually came on for Salah.
Everton enjoyed only 21 percent of possession in the game while Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson completed more passes (60) in the first half -- than all of the visiting players put together.
Allardyce said it was a huge point and had no doubt the penalty call was correct, with the referee “very brave” in his decision.
“Our defensive shape as a team was extremely good today and stopped one of the most fluent, attacking goalscoring sides probably in Europe,” said the former England manager.
”Twelve goals in two games they've scored and a brilliant goal today from Salah to get 1-0 up. But I can't honestly say they had too many clear-cut chances after that.
“While we didn't do too much in possession, we completely and utterly shut Liverpool down from an attacking force and waited for what had to be just one opportunity.”
Thousands of smiling, cheering football fans turned out for the biggest party Clemson coach Dabo Swinney has thrown yet at Death Valley to celebrate the school's first national championship in 35 years.
Gov. Nikki Haley issued a proclamation naming Saturday "Clemson Tigers National Football Championship Day."
Last year, more than 30,000 people showed up for Swinney's pizza party when Clemson was picked for its first College Football Playoff berth after the 2015 season. The gathering Saturday was expected to top that, with more than 50,000 fans expected along the parade route through town and into Memorial Stadium.

According to the United States Department of Commerce, 65 percent of jobs for kids today dont exist yet, which is why its important for them to explore the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), as those occupations are growing at a rate of 17 percent. This type of education increases science literacy, creates critical thinkers and can prepare the next generation for a bright future.
STEM is educational, but it can also be enjoyable for the whole family. Consider taking your childs learning further with these five tips that can help create playful experiences and spark educational fun.
Start Early. According to the Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop, brain and skill-building experiences are critical for child development early in life, and high-quality, early STEM experiences can support childrens growth. Critical thinking and problem-solving skills can even be developed with programming and coding toys that light up and make sounds.
Encourage creative construction

STEM toys can be fundamental learning tools that can help children build and construct creatively at any age. The world is a canvas for creative construction, as children can draw with tools around the house to build their first masterpieces. If your little one enjoys 3-D building and matching, a toy like the Mega Bloks Big Building Bag is perfect for little builders to explore the concept of construction with big blocks, allowing for endless creativity to build anything they can imagine.
Use technology to your advantage
With some reports estimating children spend an average of seven hours a day on smart devices, look for ways to turn this time into learning time. Make tech time count with options that teach kids how to code, build apps and make digital projects come to life. Or have them build their own video game from scratch. Kids can build their own levels, heroes and art to make their stories come to life.
Play your way
Additionally, STEM toys can be helpful learning tools for everything from sequencing to building and planning. Integrating an activity that your child is already interested in is one way to introduce more education into their play time. With KamiGami, you can inspire future scientists with interactive STEM features where they can build six-legged animal robots and learn programming to create dances with lights, movements and sounds.
Find Resources in Your Community. Interacting with STEM toys and experiences offers nearly endless possibilities for young children to develop their skills in fun and engaging ways. Try looking for community events centered around science or engineering. Many local community centers offer classes and may host special STEM-focused events, organizations and science fairs.

With millions of players around the world, there's a good chance that many video game fans enjoyed a round of Epic Games' “Fortnite” or Bluehole's “PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds” (“PUBG”) with their Memorial Day hamburger. But in South Korea, “Fortnite” fans suddenly need to worry if they'll lose access to the world's biggest game. A copyright lawsuit filed in January (and first reported yesterday) by Bluehole subsidiary PUBG Corp. in the Seoul Central District Court in South Korea might put Epic's runaway success on ice.
The suit, which was first reported by The Korea Times, is an attempt at an injunction. If successful, PUBG Corporation copyright claim could block Epic and partner Neowiz from distributing “Fortnite” in South Korea.
Why is PUBG Corporation and Epic at odds?
The feud between these two companies has been waging since September 2017, when Epic Games announced “Fortnite Battle Royale.” While the Battle Royale concept isn't new for anyone who has read or seen “Battle Royale” or “The Hunger Games,” “PUBG” developer Bluehole bristled at the announcement.
“We've had an ongoing relationship with Epic Games throughout PUBG's development as they are the creators of (Unreal Engine 4), the engine we licensed for the game,” Chang Han Kim, Bluehole's vice president, said in a prepared statement. “After listening to the growing feedback from our community and reviewing the gameplay for ourselves, we are concerned that Fortnite may be replicating the experience for which PUBG is known.”
While no suit was filed immediately, Bluehole leveled an ominous warning at Epic Games. The company suggested it was considering “further action” against Epic to protect its interests. (Fast forward to this lawsuit filing.)
Just two months later, in November 2017, Epic announced that “Fortnite Battle Royale's” popularity had rocketed to 20 million players. Massive streaming audiences and a $100 million esports prize pool suggest that the number has continued to grow at breakneck pace since then.
In December 2017, ‘‘PUBG” creator Brandon “PlayerUnknown” Greene called for stricter intellectual property protections in the video game space.
“You're protecting the work of artists basically. Games are art for a large part, and so I think it's important they're protected,” Greene said on Radio 1's Gaming Show. “I want this genre of games to grow,” Greene said. “For that to happen you need new and interesting spins on the game mode. If it's just copycats down the line, then the genre doesn't grow and people get bored.”
The question at play here (and in PUBG Corporation's lawsuit) hinges on Greene's perspective that “Fortnite” doesn't “spin the game mode” and is, instead a “copycat.” US law would tend to disagree with Greene's take.
“Generally, game mechanics are not protectable under US law,” attorney Ryan Morrison explains. “There are, of course, exceptions, but I would be very surprised if a court found that a shrinking map, a skydiving start to a map, or having 100 players at once were protectable. Genres are not copyrightable, and just because you created a new genre does not mean you get to police it forever. That would be awful for all technology and all innovation.“
Those same copyright laws have allowed multiple games from different developers and publishers to include “capture the flag” modes, jumping on enemy heads to defeat them, and even aiming down the sights of guns. United States intellectual property protections are extended to expression of ideas, rather than ideas themselves. Sound and art assets can't be copied, but concepts like driving a vehicle are fair game for replication and iteration.
There is a big difference between PUBG Corporation's copyright infringement lawsuit filed in the Northern District of California against NetEase over two mobile battle royale games: “Knives Out” and “Rules of Survival”. An amended filing shows comparisons of weapons, buildings, and equipment that PUBG Corporation alleges were misappropriated for “Rules of Survival” by NetEase. In addition to claims about play modality, PUBG Corporation has identified specific art assets it believes have been copied from “PUBG.”
It's telling that PUBG Corporation opted to file suit against Epic outside the United States and specifically in Korea. Epic has not been accused of asset misappropriation. Rather, based on previous statements regarding “Fortnite,” PUBG Corporation appears to be focused on the ideas underpinning “PUBG” (and, to wit, the entire battle royale genre).
“In the NetEase ‘Knives Out'/'Rules of Survival' suit there was actual consumer confusion,” explains attorney Ryan Morrison. “Users were calling the games ‘PUBG-Mobile' and YouTube videos popped up doing the same. This kind of consumer confusion is what trademark laws are there to prevent, and the associated copyright with each art asset was much closer in these games. No one, on the other hand, looks at ‘Fortnite' and thinks it's ‘PUBG.' The games look very different, not ‘substantially similar' as copyright infringement in the US would demand, or ‘confusingly similar' that is the test for trademark infringement in the US.”
The goal of an injunction is likely to cut Epic off from Korea's voracious gaming community, especially as Epic and partner Neowiz have plans for PC cafe presence starting in the first half of 2018. South Korea is the 6th largest market by video game revenue, responsible for $4.2 billion in 2017 (just a hair less than the 5th ranked UK). Additionally, Bluehole can leverage the government to assist with its infringement claim.
“I am not a Korean attorney, but I know the penalties in Korea are much harsher if infringement is found,” attorney Ryan Morrison told Variety. “There, the government actually assists with enforcement and can even block access to the infringing game throughout the web. I don't believe Bluehole would have much of a case in the United States, as you generally cannot protect and idea, genre, or game mechanics, however litigation is always unpredictable. Judges can barely work their own email accounts usually, so asking them to weigh in on the finer points of game design is usually difficult.”
While we don't have a direct comparison of user numbers to-date, Epic and PUBG Corporation both announced in November 2017 that their games had each reached the 20 million player milestones. The difference is that it took PUBG Corporation eight months versus Epic's two.
In January, “Fortnite” reached 40 million players. By contrast, a reported (and not insignificant) 30 million copies of “PUBG” have been sold to date since launch. “Fortnite” has been outpacing it by thousands of concurrent players as the bottom has started to drop out of “PUBG's” community. A dip in player base over time is a natural outcome of “games-as-a-service” development, often countered with new content and technical improvements.
However, PUBG Corporation has been plagued by cheaters in its game. This has led some to posit that this is incentivizing “PUBG's” player base to migrate to Fortnite. To its credit, the “PUBG” development team has been contrite about the game's shortcomings.
“Although we've made some meaningful improvements to PUBG, we've fallen short in other ways,” a May 26, 2018, post on the “PUBG” Steam Forums says. “Players have rightfully called us out for failing to address complaints about performance, and recently we haven't done the best job of communicating about the changes we're making to the game.”
Competition amongst publishers vying for players isn't uncommon. Copyright lawsuits are, though. In this case, there are business entanglements that further complicate the situation.
Epic and Bluehole have a complicated history
It's impossible to say how the NetEase and Epic lawsuits will play out. As attorney Ryan Morrison pointed out on Twitter, “Litigation is unpredictable and judges do not understand video games. That said, in a strictly legal reading, I think this case is a huge long shot.”
There are business matters separate from the Epic lawsuit that make this a story to watch. In addition to developing games, Epic produces and licenses one of the most widely used game engines on the market. Unreal Engine 4 powers dozens of titles, including Microsoft's “Sea of Thieves,” Square Enix's “Kingdom Hearts III,” Ninja Theory's “Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice,” and a little game called… “PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.”
Neither Epic nor PUBG Corporation are talking about the suit or their business relationship, but there are a few things we do know. Unreal Engine licensing operates via a royalty model. It's free to download and tinker with, but once you earn more than $3,000 in a calendar quarter, Epic typically requires a five percent payment on the gross earnings. If operating under a standard licensing agreement, the value of this relationship based on 30 million full-price sales ($29.99 each) is, to-date, about $45 million in royalties (plus a portion of revenue earned by PUBG Corporation from Steam marketplace item transactions).
It's possible that Bluehole negotiated a lower rate based on an up-front payment. Such arrangements are common for larger titles. Any such agreement could also include non-standard licensing terms, but these deals are negotiated under non-disclosure agreement.
Under the standard terms of use, PUBG Corporation isn't in imminent danger of Epic yanking its Unreal license outright. The Unreal Engine end-user license agreement doesn't include terms that allow for Epic to terminate the agreement due to a lawsuit like this. The EULA does include this provision, though:
Epic may issue an amended Agreement at any time in its discretion by providing notice to you or by providing you with digital access to the amended Agreement when you next log in to your Account, access the Marketplace, or download additional Content or new Versions. You are not required to accept the amended Agreement. However, in order to continue accessing your Account or the Marketplace or to download or use additional Content or new Versions, you must accept the amended Agreement. By logging in to your Account, using the Marketplace, or downloading or using additional Content or a new Version, you hereby agree to be bound by the amended Agreement then most recently issued by Epic. If you do not accept the amended Agreement, you may not log in to your Account, access the Marketplace, download or use additional Content, or download or use any new Version that is made available by Epic contemporaneously with or after the issuance of that amended Agreement (but this will not terminate your License for the Licensed Technology that you downloaded prior to the issuance of the amended Agreement). If you are a legal entity, acceptance of an amended Agreement by any of your Users will be binding on you.
Whether Epic would do this to a single licensee operating under the standard agreement and EULA remains to be seen. If so, Epic could make the terms so onerous that PUBG Corporation would either be left behind with no access to new Unreal Engine updates or accept the new agreement. Without access to new versions of the engine, “PUBG” won't be dead in the water. It will, however, be cut off from technological innovations that could improve player experience and aid in user retention. This could push PUBG Corporation into rebuilding its entire game on a new engine, requiring a significant investment of time and money.
Regardless, PUBG Corporation might want to start investigating other technology. “The business relationship has obviously soured, and it would be in Bluehole's best interest to consider an engine change,” Morrison says.
Bluehole is also reportedly courting investors. The most prominent name floated to the top is Chinese powerhouse Tencent, which seems ready to pour 500 billion won (about $468 million USD) into Bluehole. While Bluehole wouldn't confirm the report, it did state that if this deal went through, Tencent would own approximately 10 percent of the “PUBG” developer.
Tencent is the world's largest gaming company, with stakes in a number of developers and publishers. Among those holdings is a 40 percent share of Epic Games. In effect, PUBG Corporation has filed suit to prevent a potential investor's significant property from launching in its home territory. That's not a good way to welcome a to the family.
PUBG Corporation and Epic are both staying relatively silent on the legal dispute. Epic Games doesn't comment on ongoing litigation, according to a company spokesperson. PUBG Corporation declined to provide a copy of the lawsuit, offering a single sentence statement. “PUBG Corporation filed an injunction against Epic Games Korea on January 5, 2018 to the Seoul Central District Court as an action to protect PUBG Corp's copyright,” a representative told Variety via email.
We can't predict how the US District Court in California will rule on the “Rules of Survival”/”Knives Out” case or the Seoul Central District Court will decide the “Fortnite” injunction. What we do know is that Fortnite is the current leader, not only in the battle royale genre, but in gaming as a whole. The Korean market is important, and it's Bluehole's base of operations.
A legal win in Korea won't slay the “Fortnite” giant, but it will serve as a warning to NetEase and any other company that wants to play on Bluehole's home turf: “PUBG” will be the last man standing.

SEOUL—South Korea added several North Korean groups and individuals to its sanctions list Monday in a largely symbolic move that is part of efforts to cut off funding for the North's weapons programs.
The government said those added were 20 North Korean groups, including several banks and companies, and 12 individuals.
Seoul is among the first to respond to North Korea's Nov. 29 missile launch with fresh sanctions. While the move is largely symbolic because all transactions between two Koreas have been banned for years, the government said it hopes its move will prompt the international community to do likewise.

Josh Donaldson smacked his foot with his bat and muttered fiercely to himself as he struck out in the fifth inning here Wednesday night, the Blue Jays down by two to the Tampa Bay Rays with runners on the corners and no outs.He missed the opportunity to bring rain; what if that was Toronto's only shot?In hindsight, the third baseman needn't have worried, thanks to Kendrys Morales and Russell Martin, whose multi-hit games propelled the Jays to a 7-6 victory.Two batters behind Donaldson — after Jose Bautista singled up the middle to score Ryan Goins from third — Morales smacked his 13th homer of the year into the back of the second deck for a 5-3 lead. Martin was the key to two more runs, scoring on a wild pitch in the sixth and delivering a game-winning solo homer in the eighth, a much-needed response after reliever Joe Smith allowed three runs in the top of the inning to level the game late.Article Continued BelowThe win earned the Jays a split in the two-game series after they suffered an 8-1 rout at the hands of their AL East rivals on Tuesday. “Good ball game, especially after that egg we laid last night,” manager John Gibbons said.The Jays will hope to carry that momentum into three consecutive series against clubs also hovering around .500: the Chicago White Sox, Texas and Kansas City.
More good news for Alabama's booming automotive industry just rolled out. Gov. Kay Ivey announced Friday that Alabama will be the first state in the nation to offer nationally-recognized and industry-led credentials for the automotive industry at every community college statewide starting in the spring.
Ivey made the announcement while speaking at the Southern Automotive Conference in Birmingham, saying the Alabama Community College System has partnered with the Manufacturing Skills Standard Council, or MSCC, to offer the credentials statewide.
“Alabama is committed to providing a 21st Century workforce that is prepared for 21st Century manufacturing,” Ivey stated. “We are once again proving Alabama is a leader in the automotive industry by offering these credentials in all of our two-year colleges.”
The courses will be offered at two-year schools and as dual-enrollment credit for high school students. The courses will allow students the ability to become certified technicians in various areas of manufacturing.
“The Alabama Community College System is constantly seeking out new opportunities for Alabama students to create a better future..." said ACSS Chancellor Jimmy Baker. "Our partnership with MSSC provides yet another pathway for our students to succeed.”
The programs will help increase the state's pipeline of skilled workers will reduce the need for companies to provide on-the-job remedial training.
“An industry-led non-profit, MSSC is the national leader in preparing individuals with the skills needed for front-line jobs in today's ever-changing, technology-driven advanced manufacturing and distribution-logistics industries," said MSSC Chairman and CEO Leo Reddy. "Since our certifications are based on industry standards, MSSC certificate recipients enjoy prompt job placement and higher wages.”
The news comes on U.S. Manufacturing Day. More information on MCSS can be found here.

NEWARK, N.J. — Mario Batali is giving up oversight of the daily operations at his restaurant empire following reports of sexual misconduct by the celebrity chef over a period of at least 20 years.
The online site Eater New York, part of Vox Media, reported Monday that the incidents involve at least four women, three of whom worked for Batali. The women, who were not named in the Eater story, claim that Batali engaged in behaviour including groping one's chest and grabbing one from behind and holding her tightly against his body.
In a prepared statement sent to The Associated Press, Batali said that the complaints “match up” with his past behaviour.
“I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family,” Batali said.
A spokesperson for Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group says an employee reported inappropriate behaviour by Batali in October. The company told Eater it was the first formal complaint against Batali and that he was reprimanded and required to attend training.
Batali will also take leave from his ABC cooking show, “The Chew.”
“We have asked Mario Batali to step away from The Chew while we review the allegations that have just recently come to our attention,” the network said Monday. “ABC takes matters like this very seriously as we are committed to a safe work environment. While we are unaware of any type of inappropriate behaviour involving him and anyone affiliated with the show, we will swiftly address any alleged violations of our standards of conduct.”
The allegations against Batali are just the latest in a series of incidents that include Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Louis C.K., Matt Lauer, resignations in the U.S. House and Senate and calls again for President Donald Trump to address sexual misconduct allegations that he's faced. Last week Time magazine named the “silence breakers,” those that have shared their stories about sexual assault and harassment, as Person of the Year.
The 57-year-old Batali was well known in culinary circles, taking jobs early in his career as a sous chef at the Four Seasons in Santa Barbara and San Francisco.
His career took off after opening Po in New York City in the early 1990s, and he skyrocketed to fame with the airing of “Molto Mario,” a show that ran on the Food Network for eight years, until 2004. It was there that his signature look, a fleece vest, shorts, and orange Crocs, became instantly recognizable to most people.
The Food Network, which was planning to relaunch “Molto Mario,” said Monday that it was placing its plans on hold. “Food Network takes matters like this very seriously,” the network said in a statement.

A day after two tourists died of suspected drug overdose in Anjuna, Goa police on Monday arrested five accused persons including four students during raids conducted in Anjuna in three separate drug-related cases.
In two separate cases booked by the Anjuna police, four persons were arrested after the raids for possessing drugs. The Anjuna police arrested three students (19 years), natives of Bengaluru in Karnataka, and in a separate case, they arrested a Pernem man, who was working as a waiter in Anjuna.
In yet another drug-related case, the Anti Narcotic Cell (ANC) of the Goa police arrested a 22-year-old student, a native of Chennai, for possessing drugs.
In the first case, the Anjuna police conducted a raid in the parking lot of Curlies restaurant in the wee hours of Monday and arrested the three students for being in illegal possession of drugs. The raid was conducted based on reliable information and during the search, student Darius Sarigala was found to be in possession of 7.7 grams of drugs, suspected to be charas worth Rs 8,000. Police have booked the three accused students – Darius Sarigala, Akash Prasad and Morcio Mullen under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.
Later, the Anjuna police conducted another raid at the same location and found one Manjunath Anverikar, a resident of Nanerwada in Pernem and working as a waiter in Anjuna, with drugs in his possession, suspected to be charas weighing 7.3 grams.
Meanwhile on Monday afternoon, the ANC arrested Mudhassir Mohammad, a student of an engineering college in Chennai, during a raid conducted in Anjuna. According to police, the raid was conducted based on a tip-off and the accused was found to be in possession of drugs (suspected) – 15 grams of MDMA, bottle containing liquid LSD 3 grams and 250 grams of ganja. The value of the seized drugs is said to be around Rs 2 lakh.
An investigation into an alleged sexual abuse case at a northwest Iowa school more than one year ago has led to the arrest of a southeast Iowa man.
According to the Osceola County Sheriff's Office, the charges against 38-year-old Kyle Ewinger of West Burlington, stem from the investigation into an alleged incident that took place in the fall of 2015.
Sibley-Ocheyedan Superintendent Bill Boer said in 2015 that on a Saturday morning, he discovered Ewinger asleep in his classroom with a Sibley-Ocheyedan student. He said that Ewinger, who at that time was a Sibley-Ocheyedan Middle School social studies teacher and football coach, was terminated in October of that year.
Court records indicate that after the student originally said that nothing sexual happened that night, he is now saying something of a sexual nature did happen.
Ewinger is charged with second-degree sexual abuse.

LONDON-US President Donald Trump's block on US funds going to organisations involved in abortion care overseas could impact millions of women, Bill and Melinda Gates have warned, the Guardian reported on Tuesday.
The Microsoft founder and billionaire philanthropist runs the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with his wife, focusing on health and education worldwide.
“We're concerned that this shift could impact millions of women and girls around the world,” Melinda Gates told the British daily.
“Enabling women to time and space their pregnancies and providing access to treatment and prevention of infectious diseases is life-saving work,” she said.
“It saves moms' lives and it saves babies' lives, and that has long had wide support in the United States”.
Bill Gates said the funding cut would “create a void that even a foundation like ours can't fill”.
“The US is the No1 donor in the work that we do. Government aid can't be replaced by philanthropy.”
Trump last month signed a decree barring US funding for foreign non-governmental groups that provide abortion assistance or engage in advocacy, relaunching a battle that has long divided Americans.
The restrictions were first put in place in 1984 by Republican president Ronald Reagan.
Later eliminated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, they were reinstalled by his Republican successor George W. Bush, and annulled again after Barack Obama took office.
Trump's version goes further because it applies to any organisation that receives funding from US Aid, not just those involved in family planning.
(Reuters) - Breitburn Energy Partners LP (BBEPQ.PK) has received a $1.8 billion full cash offer from Lime Rock Resources, according to court papers filed on Friday, a surprise bid that could blow open the oil and gas producer's bankruptcy reorganization plan.
A four-day bankruptcy confirmation hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan ended last month after a bitter valuation battle between Breitburn and its shareholders.
Parties were awaiting a ruling from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein, who is overseeing the case, when Breitburn revealed in a letter to the judge that it had received the bid from Lime Rock, an oil basin acquirer and producer.
“The Lime Rock Resources team seeks to bid aggressively and to remain patient and flexible in negotiations,” the company said in a Jan. 31 letter to Breitburn that was filed with the court on Friday.
Houston, Texas-based Lime Rock's $1.8 billion “stalking horse” offer, which is an initial bid on a bankrupt company's assets, tops a $1.6 billion enterprise valuation by Breitburn's investment bank.
The official committee of equity holders said they believed Breitburn was worth $3.8 billion following a spike in oil prices since the company filed for bankruptcy in 2016. They argued in court that Breitburn had low-balled its valuation in order to favor creditors who stood to gain control over its assets.
Breitburn's reorganization plan envisioned splitting its assets into two companies, one created through a $775 million rights offering and the other through a debt-for-equity swap.
A group of unsecured creditors led by Elliott Management Corp and WL Ross & Co were set to own Breitburn's Permian Basin reserves in Texas through their participation in the rights offering, while creditors with $793 million of debt would own a second company with oil reserves in California, the Rocky Mountains, the U.S. Midwest and Southeast.
Following news of the Lime Rock bid, the equity committee asked the court to reopen the record to submit the new evidence and called for a hearing on Feb. 13.
The stakes are high for the equity holders because Breitburn is structured as a “master limited partnership,” which provides tax advantages when the company is profitable.
But when such companies file for bankruptcy, investors who hold their units can lose an entire investment and still be hit with a tax bill because the debt canceled in the bankruptcy is treated as income.
Breitburn said it has given Lime Rock until March 9 to complete due diligence.
Lisa Bloom is defending her decision to represent Harvey Weinstein in the wake of the Hollywood mogul being accused of decades of sexual harassment. Bloom faced criticism on social media — and even her mother, power lawyer Gloria Allred , spoke out against Bloom — over working with Weinstein.
Speaking exclusively to Variety on Friday afternoon, as the Weinstein Company board is in the process of meeting to prepare to suspend Weinstein, Bloom says, “I represent women and men in many kinds of legal matters.”
Eyebrows were raised on Thursday when the New York Times bombshell report about Weinstein revealed that Bloom would be advising the mega-producer through the sexual harassment scandal and had been consulting him over the past year.
Yesterday, Allred released a statement, disapproving of her daughter's decision to represent Weinstein.
“Had I been asked by Mr. Weinstein to represent him, I would have declined, because I do not represent individuals accused of sex harassment,” Allred's statement read. “I only represent those who allege that they are victims of sexual harassment. While I would not represent Mr. Weinstein, I would consider representing anyone who accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment, even if it meant that my daughter was the opposing counsel.”
In response to her mother's shocking remarks, Bloom tells Variety, “I have a different kind of law practice. My mother does only plaintiff side discrimination and harassment work. I have a successful, 12-lawyer general practice law firm that includes business litigation, defamation, revenge porn cases, entertainment matters, family law, and much more. … I believe that we can do good by suing, but also working behind the scenes to encourage accused people to respond with dignity and respect.”

Bloom continues, “I would never take a case where either my lawyer mother or my lawyer daughter is opposing counsel. That's another area where we differ. I believe in family before business.”
Bloom has made a name for herself as a women's rights advocate and high-profile attorney for celebrities such as Kathy Griffin, Blac Chyna, and Mischa Barton in recent months. She led the charge in taking down Bill O'Reilly, defending a slew of female clients who said they had been victimized and harassed by the former Fox News star, who was ousted, following Bloom's work.
When asked to respond to the backlash of her representing Weinstein, given her work with women, Bloom referred Variety to the Twitter statement she posted yesterday.
On Twitter, she posted, in part, “As a women's rights advocate, I have been blunt with Harvey and he has listened to me. I have told him the times have changed, it is 2017, and he needs to evolve to a higher standard. I have found Harvey to be refreshingly candid and receptive to my message. He has acknowledged the mistakes he has made. … He is an old dinosaur and learning new ways.”
Bloom, who is also working with Weinstein on adapting her book about Trayvon Martin into a television show through his company, continued on Twitter: “Harvey is not going to demean or attack any of the women making accusations against him, although he does dispute many of the allegations. Instead, he is going to use this as a painful learning experience to grow into a better man. … I will make recommendations to ensure that gender equality and zero tolerance for workplace misconduct aren't just goals, but a reality.”

After a faceoff in the third period, Antoine Vermette whacks the ref with his stick, getting ejected from the game in the Ducks' 1-0 win. (0:16)
Anaheim Ducks forward Antoine Vermette was ejected from his team's road game against the Minnesota Wild on Tuesday for abuse of an official.
Vermette slashed at the leg of linesman Shandor Alphonso after losing a faceoff with 7:33 of the third period to earn a 10-minute penalty for game misconduct.
In addition to the ejection, Vermette could face further discipline.
Per the NHL's Rule 40.3, deliberately applying physical force to an official in any manner comes with an automatic 10-game suspension.
Calgary Flames defenseman Dennis Wideman was suspended 20 games for abuse of an official last season, after cross-checking a ref on his way back to the bench. Wideman's suspension was later reduced to 10 games through an appeal.
The Ducks won Tuesday night's game 1-0.
In his first season with the Ducks, Vermette has eight goals and 14 points in 57 games.

Brighten your winter days by inviting birds into your landscape.
Their beauty and motion help enliven the garden and lighten your spirit. Not only do they provide entertainment, but also an opportunity for all ages to stay involved with nature year-round.
Increase the number of visitors to your yard by including all the essentials these winged visitors need; food, shelter and water.
Plants are the easiest way to bring birds into your landscape. These natural feeders provide seasonal food and shelter for the birds. Take a walk through your yard and look for trees, shrubs and perennials that provide food and evergreens that provide year-round shelter. Plan on adding a few of their favorites that provide food and shelter and seasonal beauty you can enjoy.
In the meantime, add a few feeders. This is a great way to increase the number and diversity of birds visiting your garden.
Place feeders in a quiet, sheltered location where you can easily watch these visitors come and go. Avoid placing feeders too close to plants that provide easy places for squirrels to jump onto the feeders and cats to hide while hunting for a meal.
Select feeders to attract the type of birds you want to bring into the garden.
Tube feeders with metal ports keep the seeds fairly clean and dry and are somewhat squirrel resistant. Feeders with short perches attract small birds like chickadees, titmice, and finches. Those with the perches above the feeding port are suitable for birds like goldfinches, chickadees and pine siskins that can feed upside down.
Thistle feeders and socks have extra small openings designed to hold the small seeds of thistle. You'll find small songbirds like finches feeding at these.
Suet feeders hold blocks of high energy food made of animal fat filled with seeds and berries. They attract woodpeckers, nuthatches, chickadees, titmice, jays and starlings.
Platform feeders attract the greatest variety of birds, but give squirrels easy access to the seed. Plus, the open environment subjects the seeds to spoilage from damp weather and droppings from feeding birds. Enclosed hopper or house feeders are attractive to most birds, but once again the seed can be exposed to the weather and spoil.
Be sure to thoroughly clean the feeders monthly to avoid the spread of disease. Cover droppings and spoiled seed on the ground with a fresh layer of mulch.
Add additional feeding stations by dressing up your evergreens with bird-friendly ornaments. You can purchase seed coated ornaments or make your own. Roll an evergreen cone in peanut butter or suet and coat with birdseed. Coat a stale bagel with peanut butter and seed. Hang these on the tree with colorful yarn. Add a few orange slices and strings of cranberries for added food and color.
And once the holidays are over move a discarded holiday tree into your bird feeding station. It provides shelter from cold winter winds and makes another place to hang a few edible ornaments.
Keep the birds coming by adding a birdbath for a constant supply of water for drinking and bathing. Shallow birdbaths with sloping sides and a maximum depth of two inches in the center provide easy access for all birds. Keep the water flowing despite cold temperatures with the help of an immersion heater designed for birdbaths or purchase a birdbath with a built-in thermostatically controlled heater.
And once you create a bird-friendly environment you'll be enjoying them year-round. Listen for their songs, watch them raise their young and thank them for helping keep garden pests under control.

Judging by Sam Allardyce's post-Merseyside derby interview, he wasn't overly happy with one of Jamie Carragher's half-time comments.
Everton had just 21% possession during the 1-1 draw at Anfield with goalkeeper Jordan Pickford attempting nearly twice as many passes as any other player.
Their point may have owed a little to fortune, as well as a brave penalty call from referee Craig Pawson, but a point represents a fine return.
Unsurprisingly, though, the Blues' approach has come into focus, reports the Liverpool Echo .
In the Sky Sports studio at half-time, pundit Carragher said of Big Sam's Toffees: "If Everton got any deeper, they'd be in Stanley Park."

But Allardyce wasn't happy with the former Liverpool defender.
Speaking to Danish television, Allardyce was informed of Carragher's remark.
His response was: “Jamie, if you're listening to this. You get forced back by two things. One is the talent of the opposition, and two the failure of your players to play out correctly when they've got possession.
“So, next time I see Jamie I will give him a lesson in coaching so he can understand it better next time he's commentating.”
(Image: LIVERPOOL ECHO)
Allardyce and Carragher, in fairness, have worked together in the past - Allardyce was Carragher's manager for a 'Soccer Aid' charity match at Old Trafford.
And Carragher, too, was honest enough to admit after the game that Everton's penalty call had been the correct one.
“Klopp is a very frustrated manager, and rightly so,” he said. “It was a game Liverpool should have won quite comfortably.
(Image: LIVERPOOL ECHO)
"I think his frustration comes from the fact that Everton weren't that adventurous and came to defend. But whether you defend for 95 minutes, it doesn't matter - they've got the result they wanted, and it all hinges on the penalty.
"It's a penalty. What is Lovren doing? People say it's soft, but that doesn't mean it's not a penalty. As soon as he's felt his hands on his shoulders, he [Calvert-Lewin] has gone down."
Peterborough Sports emphasised thsir superiority over city rivals Peterborough Northern Star with a 5-1 United Counties Premier Division win at PSL today (April 17).
Champions Sports have now netted an astonishing 142 goals in 40 league games this season and 190 in all competitions!

Today's goal-scoring hero was Mark Jones who bagged a hat-trick, while Josh Moreman and Avelino Vieira also netted.
Sports were 3-0 ahead by half-time and 5-0 up after 50 minutes before Jezz Goldson-Willimas grabbed a late consolation goal for Star.
Sports now have 106 points, 61 more than Star. Star did hold Sports to a 0-0 draw earlier this season.
Sixth-placed Wisbech, whose popular manager Dick Creasey is staying on next season, also went goal-crazy today hammering local rivals Holbeach 7-2 at the Fenland Stadium. There is just one place between the teams in the top-flight, but you wouldn't have known it today as Michael Frew's first minute goal for the Fenmen led to a total rout of the Tigers.
Billy Smith (red) claimed a hat-trick for Wisbech against Holbeach.
Frew scored twice, but was overshadowed by Billy Smith who claimed a hat-trick. Goalkeeper Sam Vince converted another penalty, while Alex Beck also scored. Josh Ford (penalty) and Tommy Treacher replied for Holbeach, but the latter was sent off after collecting a second caution at 5-2.
Spalding United sealed third spot and a home tie in the semi-finals of the play-offs in Division One South of the Evo Stik Northern Premier League with a 2-0 win at Lincoln United.

“I'm not celebrating until we win promotion,” said Spalding boss Chris Rawlinson.

AFC Rushden & Diamonds are also battling for a play-off spot, but they had to settle for a 1-1 draw at Stamford AFC for whom Jordan Smith equalised in the 82nd minute. Former Stamford player Nabil Sharrif had put Diamonds ahead on the stroke of half-time.
There was a bumper crowd of 632 at the final game of the season at the Zeeco Stadium. That's the highest of the season for a team struggling in 16th place. Their average home gate of 285 is the third highest in the division.

Canada has been well served by NAFTA. It facilitated robust, sustained economic growth and it transformed the manufacturing sector, more than just about any other. By allowing companies to rationalize production across the region, NAFTA helped create much more competitive, profitable and global industries. As the country moves to sign more free-trade agreements (FTAs), we should step back and consider some underlying truths about our ability to capitalize on them.
Without doubt, NAFTA has been an unqualified success for all three partners, our citizens and our businesses, which makes securing a modernized, strengthened agreement critical. In fact, it should be the top priority for the federal government, given the short- and long-term economic implications.
However, if the current NAFTA renegotiations, and the uncertainty that surrounds them, point out anything, it is that Canada does not export enough to markets outside North America and that we need a stronger, more globally competitive and active manufacturing sector.
But simply signing a new trade deal with another country will not ensure our future economic prosperity. Today, Canada has 14 robust FTAs in place, including the provisional implementation of Comprehensive and Economic Trade Agreement with the European Union and the recently signed Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership with 10 Pacific Rim countries. However, outside of NAFTA, Canada's exports with the majority of these markets have not expanded since their signing.
The incredible effort that goes into negotiating an FTA shouldn't be for nought. If Canada wants to grow our economy and create new jobs to expand the middle class through expanded trade, we need a plan, not just another trade agreement. This plan should consist of five critical elements.
First, we must improve the competitiveness of our domestic business environment. When manufacturers step into the global arena, much of their success has already been determined by whether Canada's domestic environment has been conducive to helping them succeed in new markets.
Our business-tax structure is already complicated, onerous and growing less competitive given the recent U.S. tax changes. A wide range of policy, tax and regulatory regimes are contributing to a relentless increase in the cost of doing business in Canada and making our companies' ability to compete with the EU, never mind the economies of the TPP, unnecessarily difficult. Canada needs comprehensive tax and regulatory reform to boost investment competitiveness and drive growth.
Second, we must ensure FTAs level the playing field for manufactured goods.
Managing global trade is far more than dealing with tariffs. Other barriers are emerging, including product regulations, direct export subsidies, government-procurement exemptions and currency manipulation. All of which provide an advantage to domestic industry over importers.
While recent FTAs have improved focus on these non-tariff barriers, it is critical moving forward that there are strong protections for Canadian exporters to eliminate these practices.
Third, Canada should focus FTAs on countries with natural business ties, and not because of political expedience. We need to pick our trade partners similarly to how businesses pick theirs — is there a mutually beneficial agreement that will realistically boost the economic performance of all parties?
This should start with countries with deep historical connections and similar business cultures and legal frameworks to make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular.
Related to this is the fourth element — a focus on leveraging existing integrated supply chains.
Under NAFTA, Canada's manufacturing economy has shifted from producing goods for this market to largely producing parts, materials and ingredients that feed larger supply chains. As such, roughly 85 per cent of Canada's value-added exports are production parts that feed into larger finished consumer and industrial products.
Governments must make decisions based on actual industrial capacity for global supply-chain integration and expansion, not strive to create new export segments where there is no proven advantage.
Finally, we must support the global growth of small and medium enterprises to support their growth at home. Canada has many small businesses but not enough medium and large companies. More than 95 per cent of manufacturers has under 10 employees, and many do not have the internal expertise or financial ability to expand globally. Governments have excellent export-support programs, but they should be consolidated to ease access for small companies.
By working together, government and industry can create the conditions our exporters need to harness the natural, technology and human capital resources of our country and succeed abroad, beyond North America. We need a comprehensive plan that starts with a review and modernization of our business environment and creates better supports for Canadian companies looking to go global.
The ongoing renegotiations have shown our vulnerability. We have no time to wait for the outcomes to start making the structural changes we need to compete.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Islamic State claimed responsibility on Wednesday for a knife and shooting attack in the Belgian city of Liege, but provided no evidence for its claim.
It said in an online statement a “soldier of the caliphate” had carried out the attack on Tuesday which killed two policewomen and a bystander.
Islamic State regularly claims attacks that are thought to be Islamist-inspired, often without providing any proof the group was involved.
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will hike rates in August on concerns that already above-target inflation will climb further, according to economists in a Reuters poll, in contrast to a survey just a month ago which saw an increase only in the second half of 2019.

That dramatic shift in expectations was driven by India's annual consumer price inflation accelerating in April to 4.58 percent, above the central bank's target of 4 percent for the sixth month in a row, after easing in each of the three previous months.
The May 24-30 poll of nearly 60 economists showed the RBI will hike its repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25 percent in August.
While the median suggests the RBI will keep rates on hold when it meets on June 6, about 40 percent of the economists polled expected a hike next week.
“As global market turmoil takes its toll, we are changing our RBI policy rate call from an extended pause to a 25 basis point hike at the August meeting,” said Kunal Kundu, India economist at Société Générale.
“The RBI may announce a change in policy stance during the June meeting and follow that up with a hike in August.”
Kundu said that while RBI's inflation expectation has been “erring on the side of hawkishness, with actual inflation mostly relatively underwhelming, the latest inflation data, though not too high, raise the prospect of a rate hike.”
The inflation rate increased due to higher domestic food costs and crude oil prices, which hit $80.50 a barrel on May 17, their highest since November 2014.
With India importing 80 percent of its fuel needs and government spending increasing before national elections next year - which will likely add to price pressures - expectations have firmed for the RBI to move away from a neutral stance next week.
Out of 42 economists who answered an extra question, 24 said they expect the central bank to change its monetary policy stance to a tightening bias in June. More than 35 percent anticipated that in August.
Just last month, a majority said the RBI would turn hawkish by December.
Currently, the RBI estimates consumer inflation of 4.7-5.1 percent in April-September before dipping to 4.4 percent for the remainder of this fiscal year.
A total of 19 out of 31 economists who answered another question said the RBI would revise inflation projections up. Eleven said it would be unchanged and one said it would be revised down.
“The RBI cut its inflation forecasts based on the weakness of observed inflation the first couple of months of the year, so it was not premature to cut the forecasts,” said Shilan Shah, senior India economist at Capital Economics.
“It did note some upside risks to the inflation outlook, some of which have come to fruition. So it is likely that forecasts will now be revised up.”
The first three months of 2018 likely saw the fastest economic expansion since July-September 2016. Data for the latest quarter will be announced later on Thursday.
More than 80 percent of the 30 economists who answered an extra question said the RBI would keep its growth projections for 2018/19 unchanged. Two predicted an upgrade and three said it would be revised lower.

Senate President Bukola Saraki has said the senate plans to amend the 1999 constitution to allow for the creation of state and community police as a major strategy in combating insecurity.
Saraki said on Tuesday: “Today, my colleagues and I in the eighth Senate resolved to begin the process of amending the Constitution to allow for the creation of State and Community Police. This is following our debate on solutions to the killings across the country.”
He told the Conference of State Assembly Speakers that he and his colleagues in the 8th have resolved to begin the process of amending the Constitution to allow the creation of State and Community Police.
The senate president revealed in a tweet,
The plan by the Senate comes after years of calls by a section of Nigerians for the creation of state police and debate over the issue.
Recent killings in several states have revived the debate over state police with several governors lamenting, over time, about their helplessness to provide security for residents of the state.
In reaction to the killings, the Senate had previously called for more decisive action with some Senators demanding the removal of the service chiefs.
The decision of the Senate to amend the Constitution in favour of state and community police followed a debate on the killings across the country and in Plateau State – after a Point of Order raised by former Plateau Governor, Senator Jonah Jang.
In his comments, the Senate President condemned the killings once again and said it was necessary for the Senate to condemn it and play its role in ensuring the security of lives and property.
“We have talked about the fact that whether these killings were initial acts of aggression or reprisal attacks, it is clear that either way, it is totally unacceptable and we must condemn it in all totality,” he said.
“Secondly, these are acts of criminality and we should not encourage any other colouration to it, be it religious or otherwise. This is criminality. And as such, we have a role to ensure that we must address this criminality to see how we can fight it.
“We have spoken on many platforms and made suggestions to the Executive on the fact that there is a need for an urgent review of the security architecture of the nation.”
Having made suggestions and listened to security agencies over the killings, Saraki said it was important for the lawmakers to do their own part.
“We as the Senate must come up with our own actions. We do not need to flog the issue. We have told the Executive what to do. We have told them privately and we have told them publicly. However, on our own part, we must decide on what we need to do.”
The senate condemned the terrorist attacks, mass killings and displacement of the people and occupation of their homes and farmlands;
“We MUST all put aside our political, personal, and ideological differences and work together to stop the bloodshed,'' he tweeted.
Saraki said: “The security and welfare of the people is primary purpose of government. This is what the Constitution we all swore to uphold says. At no time whether in the past or in the present is it okay to lose even one Nigerian life.''
The cost of school crossing guards will grow by about $580,000 over the next two years as the minimum wage rises to $15 an hour, a report to the upcoming Toronto Police Services Board shows.
Toronto Police employ 769 school crossing guards who earn hourly wages ranging from 11.90 to $14.44 -- depending on years of service.
Premier Kathleen Wynne is boosting the current minimum wage of $11.60 an hour to $14 on Jan. 1, and then to $15 on Jan. 1, 2019.
The police board estimates the increased cost of bringing school crossing guards up to the new minimum wage will be $230,900 in 2018 and $352,400 in 2019, says the report to Thursday's police services board meeting.
Mayor John Tory said he doesn't begrudge the crossing guards a pay boost given the important work they do protecting children.
“It's not as if they were paid an exorbitant amount of money before,” Tory said Sunday. “And it's not as if they even get that many hours ... They work in this split shift arrangement, in the morning and afternoons.”
However, any time another level of government, usually the province, makes changes that impose costs on municipalities, it can be very challenging, he said.
“They simply have not given us, over time, the flexibility with respect to how we raise money to pay for a lot of this stuff,” Tory said. “And it's very frustrating for me as a mayor and I'm sure for other mayors.”
For example, cannabis legalization brings a host of new responsibilities for cities, and provincial policies around funding shelters “substantially prejudices” Toronto, he said.
The only reason that the school crossing guard pay hike would even be an issue is because it comes on top of a lot of other financial obligations that the city must shoulder, he said.
The provincial government has sent funds for some priorities, including supportive housing, he said.
But the mayor noted he does receive a lot of mail from other levels of governments pleased to inform him of new mandated initiatives.
“And then there's no cheque in the envelope,” Tory said.
The City of Toronto budget committee has already considered the impact of minimum wage hikes on its bottom line -- about $2.3 million over the next two years for parks, forestry and recreation staff alone, and millions more for other labour law changes, including three-hour standby pay and paid emergency leave.

The actress also asked fans not to defend her before thanking fans for defending her, and then retweeting numerous posts both defending and condemning her.
Roseanne Barr says that tweeting under the influence of the prescription sleep aid Ambien is what led to her post a racist remark that subsequently got her sitcom, 'Roseanne,' cancelled by ABC.
The 65-year-old actress and outspoken conservative spent much of Tuesday night half-apologizing for the remark, tweeting -- among many other things -- that the since-deleted racist comment was a "mistake" made late at night.
"Guys I did something unforgivable so do not defend me," Barr wrote, after retweeted many fans who had been defending her. "It was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweetin."
"It was Memorial Day too," she added. "I went too far and do not want it defended-it was egregious Indefensible. I made a mistake I wish I hadn't but...don't defend it please. Ty."
After tweeting that her sleep aide medication contributed to her racist remark, Sanofi -- the pharmaceutical company behind Ambien -- released their own statement on Twitter.
"People of all races, religions and nationalities work at Sanofi every day to improve the lives of people around the world," reads the statement. "While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication."

Several minutes prior to her Ambien post, Barr shared a similar sentiment regarding her desire for fans not to stick up for her, despite the fact that she appreciates their efforts.
"Hey guys, don't defend me, it's sweet of you 2 try, but...losing my show is 0 compared 2 being labelled a racist over one tweet-that I regret even more," Barr wrote.

Barr later thanked one of her fans for defending her, writing, "I'm not a racist, just an idiot who made a bad joke. thank you for defending me tho."
i'm not a racist, just an idiot who made a bad joke. thank you for defending me tho- — Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) May 30, 2018
When a fan later tweeted at Barr, "We are defending your free speech and ours," Barr responded, "Thank u, but, it's over. I am moving on."
thank u, but, it's over. I am moving on. — Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) May 30, 2018
In between her new posts, Barr retweeted a flurry of comments that ran the gamut condemning her, to celebrating her downfall, to full-on supporting her.
Barr finally addressed her conflicting bevy of back-and-forth apologies, remarks and retweets, telling critics that, if they don't like what she has to say, they don't have to read her posts.
"I'm sorry 4 my tweet, AND I will also defend myself as well as talk to my followers. so, go away if u don't like it. I will handle my sadness the way I want to. I'm tired of being attacked & belittled more than other comedians who have said worse," Barr wrote, without specifying which comedians she was referring to.
Tuesday was a whirlwind of developments and controversies that all began when Barr tweeted a racist "joke" about former White House adviser Valerie Jarrett.
"Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj," Barr wrote in a since-deleted tweet, referring to Jarrett, who is black and was born in Iran. The comment sparked an immediate backlash and lead to ABC nixing the show's upcoming second revival season, which had already been picked up for 13 episodes and was set to begin production in August.
ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey said in a statement later in the day, "Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show." ABC removed all references to the revival series on its press site and Viacom has pulled all re-runs of the sitcom's entire run from all of its channels.
After claiming she was going to leave Twitter Tuesday morning, Barr's very outspoken return later in the evening began with tweets apologizing to the show's "all liberal" writers and cast, and then two direct apologies tweeted at Jarrett.

ST. LOUIS -- Monday's Winter Classic between the Chicago Blackhawks and St. Louis Blues started on time, but the potential for inclement weather led the NHL to set up contingency plans.
The forecast had called for rain and thunderstorms during the day at Busch Stadium.
The game will be deemed official once two periods have been played, awarding the win to the team that is leading when the game is called. If the game is tied and has to be stopped after two periods, each team will get a point, and the teams will hold a shootout. If the conditions do not permit a shootout at Busch Stadium, the teams will hold it before their scheduled game at the United Center on Feb. 26.

If the game is started and must be stopped before two periods have concluded, the game will be postponed and played in its entirety Tuesday at Busch Stadium. If the weather doesn't cooperate then, the teams will meet at Scottrade Center at a date to be determined.
Normally, the game is played on New Year's Day, and if that had been the case this year, the weather would have been perfect for an outdoor game. Instead, the NHL celebrated its 100th anniversary with the Centennial Classic between the Detroit Red Wings and Toronto Maple Leafs on Sunday at BMO Field in Toronto. That game was delayed a half-hour because of sun glare on the ice.
The Winter Classic has never been postponed to the following day, but that had been an option. The NHL made the call Monday morning to go ahead as planned.
Players understand the challenges of playing outside and were prepared for a delay.
"You prepare like you would a normal game," Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews said Sunday. "You don't really know how it can turn out, but at the end of the day, it's the same for both teams, and it comes down to who's handling the conditions the best. We played in a game at Soldier Field a couple of years ago, and it was snowing like crazy, and it was tough to even see the puck at times. It was slowing down on you, and it slowed the pace of the game down a little bit. If you don't make excuses and you just go play through it and know that it's a challenge both teams have to deal with, maybe you can take advantage of the rough conditions in some ways."
Players, including the alumni, have been impressed with the ice surface in St. Louis, and there haven't been any issues, but a significant amount of rain could change that.
"It's not an ordinary situation being outside your building, but obviously, we have to adjust to weather," Blackhawks goalie Corey Crawford said.
NEW PICTURE: Here's a more recent photograph of Steven Wiggins, from a 2017 arrest in Williamson County. pic.twitter.com/qDSMgKBNMN — TBI (@TBInvestigation) May 30, 2018
A Tennessee sheriff's deputy was fatally shot during a traffic stop early Wednesday and police were offering a $7,500 reward to help them find the suspect, a man charged the day before with hitting a woman and stealing her car.Authorities identified the suspect as Steven Joshua Wiggins, 31, a white male with balding brown hair who they believe is armed and dangerous. State, federal and local authorities have launched a manhunt for him in the area near where the Dickson County deputy was shot and killed.The deputy responded to a call about a suspicious car Wednesday, then couldn't be contacted for some time, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Susan Niland said at a news conference. The deputy's car was tracked by GPS to a location 2 or 3 miles (3 to 5 kilometers) away, and the deputy was found dead inside of it."If he is listening or anyone listening that knows him that could talk some sense into him, that he would turn himself in, that's what he needs to do," Dickson County Sheriff Jeff Bledsoe said of Wiggins at the news conference. "Because we're not going to rest. We're not going to leave anything unturned until he's brought in for justice."The deputy's name has not been released, but the sheriff said he was one of the department's best, a supervisor who had worked his way up to sergeant on patrol. Bledsoe became emotional while talking about the tragedy."Our heart's shattered with this," he said.Wiggins was identified as the suspect from video footage, Niland said.Wiggins was already wanted on charges that he assaulted a woman and stole her car when he was pulled over Wednesday, according to a report from the Kingston Springs Police Department.The report says a woman told police early Tuesday that Wiggins had slapped her in the face and pulled out some of her hair, then put a gun to her head and threatened to kill her if she called police. She said he then grabbed her keys and took her car without her permission.At the time of the report, the woman, 38, told police Wiggins was "doing meth all night and smoking marijuana." She told police she planned to press charges, the report said.
Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, April 24, 2018 – The President of the Republic of Cameroon, Paul Biya, ratified the agreement to establish the African Legal Support Facility (ALSF) on April 13, 2018 in the presence of his cabinet. Cameroon is the 25th Member State to ratify the treaty.
The bill authorizing President Biya to ratify the agreement was brought before the Senate, under the chairmanship of Senate President, Marcel Niat Njifenji, after the country's National Assembly adopted the proposed statute. After the 100 upper house members voted in favour of the bill on March 15, 2018, it was transmitted to the President for ratification.
Cameroon has a long-standing cooperation with the ALSF, which has launched and successfully concluded several large-scale projects in the country. It supported the Government in developing the Nachtigal Hydroelectric Project, a strategic 420-megawatt facility and the country's largest energy project, which is expected to begin operating in 2020. By adding this new source of clean, renewable energy to the country's rapidly expanding grid, Cameroon will be able to meet the growing needs of its population.
The ratification of the ALSF treaty was driven by Cameroon's recognition of the value added by the its interventions and by the growing need to further strengthen and improve the country's legal capacities. The ALSF delivers its services to both Regional Member Countries and non-Members, but Cameroon will benefit from closer collaboration with the ALSF and maintain broad access to its capacity-building events, knowledge products, and legal expertise.

ISLAMABAD : The transgender representatives will be invited to the next meeting of standing committee.
Convener committee has said that attitude and thinking regarding transgender had to be changed.
He pronounced that this deprived class of people does not get identity from their birth to death. Committee member Mir Kabir said that transgenders should also be considered as human.
Another member Sajjad Tori said that people should change their minds about them.
Sitara Ayaz said that educated people are also present in the transgenders. She stressed that a third box for gender individuality should be made in the identity card.
On Monday, the actress and writer perhaps best known for her role as the red-headed lawyer on the television show Sex and the City announced she would be stepping into the political arena. After she shared a video announcing her bid for the New York governorship, immediate reactions to Cynthia Nixon's campaign appeared to be largely positive, if Twitter was any indication.
Right off the bat, Nixon found support both from within the entertainment industry and from outside of it. "CYNTHIA NIXON FOR GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK ! #myFULLsupport - she is one of kind - brilliant - brave bold and so smart - a true leader #NIXON4NY," tweeted comedian and actress Rosie O'Donnell.
Appealing largely to New York City subway commuters and parents who send their children to public schools, Nixon's campaign video positioned herself as an of-the-earth New York resident, particularly in contrast to her opponent — two-term New York governor Andrew Cuomo. Though Nixon's campaign is only in its very early stages, many early supporters seemed thrilled to see Cuomo challenged at all.
"Really gonna try not to let resentment dictate my assessment of Cynthia Nixon's politics, soon as I'm done running around the block banging a gong and howling GET THAT SUCKER," tweeted journalist Ryan Cooper, presumably of Cuomo.
Just as thrilling for many, it seemed, was her heavy emphasis on reforming New York City's subway system. The Metropolitan Transit Authority, better known colloquially as the MTA, has been plagued with rider complaints as signal systems and decreased train speeds reportedly lead to increased delays and slower commutes.
Nixon has so far made MTA repairs and reform the most significant portion of her campaign website, tagging the platform as #CUOMOSMTA. "Governor Cuomo has been focused on making superficial, cosmetic changes rather than fixing the real problems," her website reads. The description continues:
He has completely neglected the non-glamorous infrastructure work that actually keeps the subway functioning... Governor Cuomo even proposed spending hundreds of millions of dollars on an LED light show on the bridges to attract tourists, while below ground, native New Yorkers are trapped in packed, sweaty train cars.
Many on Twitter, it seemed, were impressed by her decision to emphasize the city's infrastructure. "Cynthia Nixon is running on the MTA grievance platform, I'm screaming," tweeted Kelly Weill, a reporter for The Daily Beast.
Similarly, user @joopiterbeats chimed in that they would gladly back Nixon if she intends to focus on the city's subways. "Cynthia Nixon has my vote based purely on the fact she's planning on tackling the subway system. I'm sick of the MTA and these god awful trains," they wrote.
The other major portion of Nixon's campaign announcement focused on funding public schools. Though currently afforded less real estate on her website relative to subway reform, her video and the biography portion of her campaign page emphasized that she is a "public school graduate."
"I'm a proud public school graduate and a prouder public school parent," she says in the video's voice over.
Similarly, she has penned several op-eds which mention education funding reform, including one for Lohud.com, in which she compares Gov. Cuomo's approach to education to that of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos':
"He also wants to increase the number of privately-run charter schools in New York City by more than 50 percent," she wrote of Cuomo for the website in March of 2017. "And he has been a loud proponent of private school tax credits, essentially a backdoor voucher system. These are policies we expect from Betsy DeVos, but from Andrew Cuomo?"
So far, her move to focus on two systems which affect large swaths of the public — education and transportation — seems to be going well. "Cynthia Nixon, an out gay woman, a fierce PP advocate, looking to raise funding for public schools, as well as improve the subway system is running for governor; and I'm so excited!!" tweeted user @livvecchio. "Activism like this is what we need in NY."
Opec achieved the best compliance rate in its history at the outset of its accord to cut production, a plan that's being supported by strong demand, the International Energy Agency said in a February 10 report. In the past, Opec had often struggled to fully deliver promised cuts due to a reluctance to lose income and market share. Former Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali Al Naimi said on December 2 that, in the history of Opec deals, “the unfortunate part is we tend to cheat.” Meanwhile, US producers last week extended the biggest surge in oil drilling in more than four years as the prolific shale plays of Texas and Oklahoma lure investment from Exxon Mobil Corp. and Continental Resources Inc.
US crude output climbed to 8.98 million barrels a day in the week ended February 3, according to the Energy Information Administration. That's an increase of about half a million barrels a day from last year's low, and the agency expects production to keep climbing to reach 9.53 million a day next year, the most since 1970. Tight range Hedge funds cut their net-long position, or the difference between bets on a price increase and wagers on a decline, by 5.4 per cent in the week ended February 7, US commodity futures trading commission data show. WTI slipped 1.2 per cent to $52.17 a barrel in the report week, and closed at $53.86 on February 10. It was trading at $53.80 a barrel, down 6 cents, on Monday at 1:04pmin Hong Kong. Money managers' net-long position in WTI decreased by 20,540 futures and options to 359,387. Longs fell 1.8 per cent, while shorts climbed 26 per cent, the biggest gain in three months. Willing Investors “The shorts increased, which shows that there are investors willing to bet that the Opec production cuts are fully priced into the market and that the oil bulls are vulnerable to bearish news,” Tim Evans, an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York, said by telephone. As they boost output, US oil producers are hedging their price risk for this year and 2018. Producers' short positions, protecting against a drop in prices, increased to 707,498 futures and options, the most since August 2007, according to the CFTC. Pioneer Natural Resources Co. plans to continue being a “heavy hedger,” Chief Operating Officer Tim Dove said last week. The company raised its drilling budget more than expected and is expanding its fleet of rigs in the Permian Basin. Pioneer's hedges provide upside to about $62 a barrel, Dove said. Opec implemented 90 per cent of promised output cuts in January, the first month of its agreement, according to the IEA. Eleven non-Opec members who joined the agreement have made about half their pledged reductions, the agency said. “I think that we will be looking at the reverse of this report in a week,” Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts, said by telephone. “The IEA report on compliance has dispelled doubts about Opec's adherence.” More from Markets Law on dissolving Dubai Economic Council

In the backstreets of Agra's Muslim quarter, where shoes have been made for centuries, small-scale manufacturers are firing workers and families cutting back on spending as a government crackdown on cattle slaughter ripples through the community.
The election of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) three years ago has emboldened right-wing Hindu groups to push harder for protection of the cow, an animal they consider sacred. Authorities in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, started closing down unlicensed abattoirs in March, immediately hitting production and sales in the Muslim-dominated meat industry. Last month Modi's government also banned trading cattle for slaughter, including not just cows, whose killing was already outlawed in most states, but also buffalo, an animal used for meat and leather.
Now the squeeze is spreading to others in the Muslim minority and to lower-caste Hindus who cart cattle, labor in tanneries and make shoes, bags and belts - including for big name brands such as Zara and Clarks. Frequent attacks by right-wing Hindus against workers they accuse of harming cattle have further rattled the industry.
SOCIAL TENSIONS
Much of India's meat and leather trade takes place in the informal economy, meaning the impact of the closing of illegal abattoirs and ban on trading for slaughter is hard to measure.
But cattle markets are reporting a big slowdown in trade and tanneries a shortage of hides.
Abdul Faheem Qureshi, a representative of India's Muslim Qureshi community of butchers, said in Uttar Pradesh some markets trading 1,000 animals last year were now down to as few as 100. The decline in production means fewer jobs for two of India's poorest communities, and risks inflaming social tensions at a time when Modi has vowed to boost employment and accelerate economic growth ahead of the next general election in 2019.
Some large leather manufacturers support the Uttar Pradesh state government's move, arguing that allowing only licensed abattoirs to operate will clean the industry's image.
Bigger exporters also say they have enough leather as they source hides widely, including from abroad. Still, millions work in the meat and leather industries, which are worth more than $16 billion in annual sales.
When Reuters visited the narrow shoemaking lanes of Agra a crowd of Muslims breaking their Ramadan fast gathered, shouting angrily that they were no longer safe to trade buffalo, buy cow leather for shoes or to do work that their community has done for centuries for fear of being attacked by Hindu vigilantes.
"They want to weaken us. They want to snatch our bread," says 66-year-old Mohammad Muqeem, whose workers stitch $3 shoes in his cellar, referring to the closure of slaughterhouses and recent attacks on cattle traders.
Muqeem's monthly income has halved to $300 since last year as leather has become scarce. His dozen casual workers, down from 40, now use mostly synthetic materials.
IMPOSSIBLE TARGET
Like meat, India's leather industry has expanded rapidly in the last decade, providing relatively well-paid factory work and cash for families stitching informally in their homes.
Agra, in Uttar Pradesh, turns out a million pairs of shoes a day for domestic buyers and European labels such as Inditex-owned Zara and Clarks. An estimated 40 percent of the population of the northern Indian city, famed as the home of the Taj Mahal, depends on the industry.
Clarks said in a statement that it does not use leather from Indian-origin cows and that the small amount of buffalo leather it sources from India had not been impacted. Zara and did not respond to requests for comment. India is one of the world's top five producers of leather, with skins coming from cows that die of natural causes or from the legal slaughter of buffalo.
Modi's government is targeting leather revenues of $27 billion - more than double today's level - by 2020 as part of a job creation push.
But in May, the government decreed that animal markets could only trade cow and buffalo for agricultural purposes such as plowing and dairy production - a move many in the industry say contradicts its plans to grow leather sales.
India's environment minister said this week the government could amend the rule after a court temporarily stayed the order and there was widespread anger in regions where meat and leather are important to the local culture and economy. But industry officials said the shock of the ban, coming on the heels of the crackdown on abattoirs and attacks against cattle workers, meant business would not easily recover. Companies say the government's leather target would be impossible to meet unless the restrictions are reversed. "There is a lot of panic in the industry after the latest order, which has come as the biggest blow," Puran Dawar, chairman of Agra-based exporter Dawar Footwear Industries, said as hundreds of workers moulded shoes on the factory floor, referring to the ban on cattle traded for slaughter. "There are grave concerns about the supply of leather, exports of shoes and overall employment."
India's commerce ministry did not respond to requests for comment. In Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a controversial Hindu priest, had made closing unlicensed slaughter houses a priority after Modi appointed him in March. About 30 percent of hides, mostly from buffaloes, that supply tanneries in the state are from unlicensed abattoirs. Sitting in his one-room shop in Agra's leather market, Mohammad Hashim, a burly leather dealer in his sixties, said business was down 40 percent in the last three months.
The recent scarcity of hides had hurt Hindus as much as Muslims, he said, pointing to the quiet streets outside and a Hindu man struggling to sell puffed rice snacks from his cart.
Modi's election in 2014 and a resurgence in right-wing Hindu activism have increased concerns among Muslims that their livelihoods are under attack. As a minority making up 14 percent of India's 1.3 billion people, they are generally poorer and less literate than majority Hindus.
When worshippers finishing evening prayers at the Mughal-era mosque in the shoemaking quarter of Agra are asked whether the chief minister handpicked by Modi is to blame, one of the Imams thunders: "Modi is to blame. He is targeting Muslims." In an interview with Reuters, Chief Minister Adityanath rejected accusations the BJP had targeted any specific group.
"Illegal slaughterhouses operated across the state and many big and small leather traders were buying raw material at cheapest rates from unlicensed slaughterhouses to maximize profits," he said in Lucknow, the state capital.
WIDER INDUSTRY HIT
In the industrial city of Kanpur, 250 km (155 miles) east of Agra, tanneries processing buffalo skins are reporting job losses as the availability of hides dries up. Nayyar Jamal, general secretary of Kanpur's Small Tanners' Association, reckons as many as 400,000 employees in Kanpur's leather and related industries are temporarily jobless, including some laid off because of environmental curbs on tannery pollution. Supplies of local hides have dropped by 20 to 30 percent.
Qureshi, from the butchers' organization, estimates that 3.5 million employees in Uttar Pradesh alone have been directly hit. "More than the economic loss, the government has injected fear," said Chandra Bhan Prasad, a writer and businessman from the Dalit community, as those at the bottom of Hinduism's social hierarchy once called "untouchables" are known. Dalits and Muslims often work in trades that higher-caste Hindus traditionally consider beneath them. –Reuters
Tannery owner Mohammad Ikram said he was only able to procure 4,000 hides a month - down from 25,000 - because even truckers transporting legally obtained cow or buffalo hides fear attacks from vigilantes. He has a month's inventory left, and when that runs out he will have to start shedding staff.
Shahnawaz Qureshi, a wage laborer stuffing synthetic shoes into plastic bags in Muqeem's cellar in Agra, lost his last job after his employer could no longer afford leather.
He now earns 3,000 rupees - or $47 - a month, down from 4,500 in his previous job, and together with his father's income supports three sisters and his mother. "I decided to sign up for this job despite the fact that I earn reasonably less here," he said.

VALPOI: The campaigning for bypoll in the Valpoi constituency has picked up steam as the candidates in the fray Vishwajit Rane of Bharatiya Janata Party and Roy Naik of the Congress have stepped up door-to-door campaign to win over the voters to their sides.
Interestingly, both the candidates are sons of former chief ministers.
However, senior Congress MLA Pratapsingh Rane has already distanced himself from the election-related activities as he would not like to campaign against his son Vishwajit.
While, Congress MLA Ravi Naik is vigorously canvassing for his son.
Naik claims that he still has a strong hold on voters, especially, in the Usgaon area.
The Congress traditional vote bank – the minority community, may make the road to victory for the BJP candidate a little tougher.
Meanwhile, Vishwajit is canvassing door-to-door in the municipal area and convincing the voters to elect him irrespective of which party he belongs to.
He is also appealing to the voters not to fall prey to the politics being played by those with vested interest.
BJP candidate's wife Divya Rane, ZP member Premnath Hazare, Valpoi Municipal Council chairperson Parvin Shaikh and other council members were seen participating in the door-to-door campaign.
Besides, Vishwajit is also holding corner meetings in villages to convince the people to vote for him for carrying out development of the constituency and providing employment to the youth.
Due to the major political shift, it will be a real test for councillors and panch members from Rane's camp as they have to reach out to each and every voter of the constituency and convince them to vote for the BJP.
Roy was also seen doing door-to-door campaign in the Valpoi municipal area.
He is a new face to the voters but municipal area has a strong Congress base. Many issues being faced by the residents of Valpoi have been brought to the notice of Naik.
Even his father, Ravi Naik visited the CHC and enquired about the lack of healthcare facilities there.
Vishwajit has expressed confidence of winning this by-poll with a landslide margin.
He has his own strategies for Valpoi and Usgaon. He feels that the voters who voted for him during the last elections will rally behind him while the BJP voters will add to his votes.
On the other hand, Roy is claiming that the Congress voters are not happy with Vishwajit's move, and the Congress party will retain the seat as the voters have extended their full support to him.

1. ABC Carpet & Home
A veritable mecca of interior design, this venerable shop has been operating out of its Broadway location since Jerome Weinrib opened it as a carpet shop in 1961. Two decades later, his daughter Paulette Cole updated the company, adding "Home" to the store's name and stocking its six floors with furniture, lighting, and accessories sourced from around the world (with an emphasis on fair-trade and sustainably sourced goods) and presented in dreamlike vignettes conceived by the store's talented visual team.

2. Pirch
When Pirch opened its Manhattan location last spring, a line formed around the block for the event. If that sounds unusual for an appliance store, it's because Pirch is not your ordinary home gadget purveyor. The three-floor space contains multiple in-situ setups where prospective customers can try out top-of-the-line appliances and fixtures before they buy. If that doesn't entice you, maybe the client list will: Ken Fulk, Iris Apfel, and Geoffrey Zakarian are all fans of the store.

MOSUL - Iraqi forces gained ground in door-to-door fighting in the Old City of Mosul, a military spokesman said on Monday, as the US-backed offensive to capture Islamic State's de facto capital in Iraq entered its seventh month.
A Reuters correspondent saw thick smoke billowing over the Old City, near the Grand al-Nuri Mosque, from where Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a "caliphate" spanning parts of Iraq and Syria.
Heavy exchanges of gunfire and mortar rounds could be heard from the neighbourhoods facing the old city across the Tigris river that bisects Mosul into a western and eastern sides.
The war between Islamic State militants and Iraqi forces is taking a heavy toll on several hundred thousand civilians trapped inside the city, with severely malnourished babies reaching hospitals in government-held areas. Iraqi Federal Police forces "are engaged in difficult, house-to-house clashes with Daesh fighters inside the Old City", a media officer from these units told Reuters.
Drones are being used to locate and direct air strikes on the militants who are dug in the middle of civilians, he said.
Troops have had the famous centuries-old al-Nuri Mosque leaning minaret in their sights since last month, as capturing it would mark a symbolic victory over the insurgents. A police spokesman said the troops were closing in on the mosque without indicating the remaining distance.
Their progress has been slow as about 400,000 civilians, or a quarter of Mosul's pre-war population, are trapped in the Old City, according to the United Nations.
As many as half a million are estimated to remain overall in neighbourhoods still under control of the militants in western Mosul, the organisation said in a statement on Monday.
"Civilians in Mosul face incredible, terrifying risks," said the UN humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, Lise Grande. "They are being shot at, there are artillery barrages, families are running out of supplies, medicines are scarce and water is cut-off."= More than 327,000 have fled fighting since the offensive operation started on Oct. 17, with strong air and ground support from a US-led coalition.
"Mosul has pushed us to our operational limits," Grande said.
Mosul, the largest city in northern Iraq, was captured by the ultra-hardline Sunni Muslim fighters in mid 2014.
Government forces, including army, police and elite counterterrorism units have taken back most of it, including the half that lies east of the Tigris river.
The militants are now surrounded in the northwestern quarter including the historic Old City, using booby traps, sniper and mortar fire against the assailants.
Police on Sunday reported a toxic gas attack on its troops that caused no deaths. It also said the militants were increasingly using suicide motorbikes attacks.
The narrow alleyways restrict the use of suicide cars by the militants and tanks, armoured personnel carriers and Humvees by the government forces.
The United Nations said last month that 12 people, including women and children, had been treated for possible exposure to chemical weapons agents in Mosul. But Iraq's UN ambassador, Mohamed Ali Alhakim, said later there was no evidence for that.
The fighting has killed several thousands among civilians and fighters on both sides, according to aid organisations.
Residents who have managed to escape from the Old City have said there is almost nothing to eat but flour mixed with water and boiled wheat grain. What little food remains is too expensive for most residents to afford, or kept for Islamic State members and their supporters.
A domestic violence investigation led to the felony arrest of a man in Vallejo.
The Solano County Sheriff's Department arrested Charles Evans, 24, before noon Monday in the 200 block of Benicia Road.
Evans faces charges of suspicion of robbery, corporal injury to spouse and damaging a wireless communication device.
As Evans was contacted during the investigation, deputies learned he had a number of outstanding misdemeanor warrants, including second-degree burglary, hit and run causing property damage and petty theft.
Evans also was found to have an outstanding felony warrant for a parole violation with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
Evans was booked into the Solano County Jail on a $97.500 bail.
SINGAPORE/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Far from entering the death throes predicted by some environmentalists and analysts, thermal coal miners are enjoying their best returns in years as strong Asian demand and tight supplies send prices soaring.
Chinese thermal coal futures hit a record of 687 yuan ($108.49) this week, up five-fold from their 2016 lows. Coal cargo prices from Australia's Newcastle terminal, meanwhile, have roughly doubled since 2016 lows to over $100 per tonne, not far off 2011/2012 levels.
“The coal price improvement has thrown into stark relief the robustness of underlying demand in Asia,” Paul Flynn, chief executive of Australian miner Whitehaven Coal, told Reuters. “This had been masked until recent times by the surplus of capacity constructed during the last cycle. This period has now passed.”
While the spotlight of a broad energy market revival has been on oil and natural gas, specialist thermal coal miners are enjoying an even better run, suggesting investors think this much reviled fossil fuel has life in it still.
“We made global thermal coal our favourite commodity in October and stuck with it,” said Jeremy Sussman, New York-based analyst at brokerage and investment bank Clarksons Platou.
Whitehaven, Indonesia's Adaro Energy and global commodity merchant Glencore have all seen their share prices multiply from record lows in 2015/2016, hitting levels last seen during the mining boom before 2012.
“We expect coal prices to remain meaningfully higher than expectations, and as such, believe Whitehaven can keep moving higher,” Sussman said.
COAL BEATS GAS
The rise in coal prices has taken many by surprise. Morningstar Equity Research said coal prices “have fared better than we expected due to continue strong growth in China”.
As a result, Whitehaven has seen its share price soar 10-fold percent since its early 2016 low. Adaro and Glencore have enjoyed rallies of 330 percent and 290 percent, respectively. Shares in Thai coal miner Banpu are up 85 percent.
That compares to increases of 18 to 45 percent for competitors specialising in exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG), including Australia's Woodside Petroleum and Santos or U.S. firm Cheniere.
With many listed investors shunning coal due to concerns and pressure over its environmental impact, the profits of the coal boom are being enjoyed by others.
Whitehaven's biggest shareholders are U.S.-based Farallon Capital Management, which holds 14 percent of the stock, followed by specialist mining investor AMCI Group with 8.4 percent.
AMCI Group Managing Director Brian Beem said the outlook for high grade thermal coal and steelmaking coal was positive.
“The urbanization and electrification of Asia will continue to drive demand for these commodities, and we see supply struggling to meet that demand because of depletion and lack of investment in new capacity,” Beem said in emailed comments.
Farallon Capital Management declined to comment.
The main investors in commodity Glencore include Qatar Holding, a state investment firm of the world's top LNG exporter, which has a policy not to talk to media about investment.
Glencore, the world's biggest single thermal coal exporting firm, said it could not comment for this article as it is in close period ahead of its annual results.

During an investor call in December, Glencore said it expects an average coal production unit cost of $48 per tonne in 2018, allowing it to comfortably generate cash at current prices.
General under-investment in the sector in past years was allowing the company to now reap the benefits of higher prices, Glencore added.
Indonesia's Adaro declined to comment.
CAN IT LAST?
At the heart of the strong performance is the fact that, despite the rise of LNG and renewables, thermal coal consumption has barely dropped across Asia.
Trade data in Thomson Reuters Eikon showed shipments of thermal coal to North and South Asia's main energy consumers, which make up half the world's population and form the fastest growing block of energy consumers, have not dropped versus LNG since 2016.

In Japan, a top coal and LNG consumer, imports of thermal coal rose 4.3 percent last year to a record 114.5 million tonnes. LNG purchases rose 0.4 percent to 83.6 million tonnes.
South Korea's coal imports rose by more than 10 percent in 2017. China's 2017 coal imports were at their highest level since 2014, at 270.9 million tonnes.
Indian coal imports have also started growing again after years of stagnation.
Globally, sea-borne coal trade increased by 1.5 percent between 2016 and 2017, to 1.143 billion tonnes, according to coal industry group VDKI.
Asia's share of global coal consumption has increased from less than 50 percent in 2000 to nearly 74 percent in 2016.
Whitehaven's Flynn said strong power demand growth, in part thanks to the rise of electric vehicles, would push up demand further, including for thermal coal.
Despite coal's stellar recent performance, doubts over its long-term outlook remain.
Many analysts say the future of power generation lies with cleaner technology such as gas, solar and wind.
In a massive effort to combat pollution, China is in the early stages of a huge gasification programme, moving industry and millions of households from coal to gas.
China's natural gas imports and production are set to rise faster than its energy demand. Given China is also investing large-scale into the spread of renewables and even nuclear power, its share of coal will fall.
Morningstar for one believes that means the upside for mining stocks like Whitehaven “is nearly done.”

Helen Mirren's gothic horror-thriller “Winchester” has a decent shot at topping the moderate Super Bowl weekend with as much as $11 million at 2,480 North American sites, early estimates showed Friday.
Updated projections showed that “Winchester,” released in a partnership of CBS Films and Lionsgate, was going to top the second weekend of “Maze Runner: The Death Cure” and the seventh session of “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle” — both in the $10 million range. Those three could easily switch positions by the end of the weekend, but it's clear that the winner will have the lowest total since the second weekend of “The Hitman's Bodyguard” led the last weekend in August with $10.3 million.
“Winchester” opened with $615,000 in Thursday night previews, which are included in its Friday total of more than $4 million. Similar recent titles include “Rings,” which took in $800,000 in previews on its way to a $13 million weekend a year ago, and 2016's “Blair Witch” with $765,000 in previews at the start of a $9.6 million weekend.
Forecasts had pegged “Winchester,” directed by the Spierig brothers, with a debut in the $6 million to $8 million range. Mirren portrays Sarah Winchester, the heiress to the Winchester fortune who began construction of the Northern California house in 1886 and continued building over the next 38 years. The mansion, which stands seven stories tall, contains hundreds of rooms — meant to be an asylum for vengeful ghosts.

CBS Films bought the movie rights for $3.5 million. Critics have been unimpressed with “Winchester” so far — it's opening with a 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
Fox's “Maze Runner: The Death Cure,” the finale of the dystopian trilogy, easily topped last weekend with $24.2 million at 3,787 sites. It added $6.4 million over the next four weekdays as it led each day. The film's release was delayed for a year due to injuries that Dylan O'Brien suffered in 2016 on the set.
Sony's seventh frame of “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle” could wind up topping the chart for the fourth time, given its remarkable holding power. The action-comedy declined only 17% in its previous frame and finished with $16 million. The action-comedy, which is still playing at 3,352 locations, has been one of the biggest surprise hits in memory with a dazzling $341.6 million domestically after 44 days — the 45th-highest gross of all time.
“Jumanji” is the key factor that's kept the overall 2018 domestic box office nearly even with last year at $955 million through Jan. 31 — down only 0.9%, according to comScore.
Studios are reluctant to open major releases on Super Bowl weekend, leading to slow performance. On the same weekend in 2017, the third frame of “Split” led with $14.4 million, edging Paramount's launch of “Rings” ($13 million). Overall business was off 42% from the prior frame with $99.5 million, the eighth-slowest weekend of the year, according to comScore.
Another holdover film, Fox's “The Greatest Showman,” is heading for fourth place this weekend with about $7 million at 2,663 venues. The Hugh Jackman musical, which declined only 10% last weekend, has grossed nearly $130 million domestically after 44 days.
Business should pick up on Feb. 9 when Universal launches “Fifty Shades Freed,” with tracking showing an opening of at least $35 million. Sony is also debuting the CGI/live-action “Peter Rabbit” and Warner Bros. will debut Clint Eastwood's real-life thriller “15:17 to Paris.” And the Feb. 16 launch of “Black Panther” will be a tonic to the box office with early tracking showing an opening of as much as $150 million over the Presidents Day weekend.
Forty years after its release, Steely Dan's Aja remains the defining work of 1970s America. Donald Fagen and Walter Becker's sixth album under the Steely Dan moniker is a self-indulgent and delightfully overproduced magnum opus.
New York City. September 16, 1977. Three months after a citywide blackout halted a matchup between the Chicago Cubs and New York Mets at Queens' Shea Stadium, the Cubs finally win, 5-2, and The City That Never Sleeps does.
In Manhattan, a four-piece band of weirdos called the Talking Heads releases its debut LP. Talking Heads: 77 is a wildly danceable convergence of art rock and punk, fresh out of the CBGB scene of the Lower East Side, that presages the over-consumption of the 1980s. With Ronald Reagan and MTV on the horizon, Talking Heads take up a more clean-cut look and retire the sleazeball attitude associated with the American 1970s. New York City had become a theater of immorality, harnessing blue and white collar crimes alike.
And so Steely Dan co-founders Donald Fagen and Walter Becker travel between Los Angeles and New York City to record the last three albums of the group's initial run. New York's studio musicians hit the tones in Fagen and Becker's heads when LA's couldn't. But Steely Dan also called the City home. The crooks, cheats and creeps at the center of many of their tunes are influenced by the people they knew and saw in the City.
Alums of Bard College in New York state's Hudson River Valley, Fagen and Becker moved to New York City in 1969. Following their friend and eventual long-time collaborator Gary Katz to California in 1971, Steely Dan recorded their first four albums entirely in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975. Their next three, dubbed their “guitar albums”, were recorded over many months in both Los Angeles and New York City.
The middle of this trio, Aja was released on September 23, 1977, a mere seven days after Talking Heads: 77. If 77 introduced the world to the 80s, then Aja marked the end of the 70s. The Bee Gees' iconic Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, which epitomized and caricatured urban America in the 1970s, would deal the decade its final blow upon its release in December of ‘77. But Aja gave the last rites to that sinking ship.
The characters central to Steely Dan's tunes are misfits, has-beens and wannabes. “Peg,” the album's danceable centerpiece, is a low-level actress who succumbs to the sleazy world of adult entertainment. The neighborhood boys anticipate the resulting debauchery when the titular “Josie” comes home. A suburbanite has dreams of being the famous saxophonist-bandleader “Deacon Blues.”
These characters would be meaningless without the dreamy New York City backdrops Fagen and Becker construct. “Black Cow” drops us in a moody 1940s greasy spoon where we could enjoy the titular sugary concoction. “I Got The News” puts us in a passionless and secret love-making session in the backseat of a Studebaker Lark. Deacon Blues, Peg and Josie only exist on the damp street corners, in the dimly-lit apartment hallways and the hazy barrooms Fagen and Becker have constructed. Aja is the stage for the theater of immorality.
But Aja's showstopper is “Home At Last,” a retelling of Odysseus' ten-year journey back home to Ithaca. Steely Dan made it known they wanted to be in New York City. They wanted the grimy, cold streets of Manhattan beneath their feet.
But so do we. It is after all, The City That Never Sleeps.
Ethan Copeland is the host of The Marina, which airs Tuesdays from 10 to 11 pm.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Under pressure all weekend, President Donald Trump on Monday named and condemned hate groups as “repugnant” and declared “racism is evil” in an updated, more forceful statement on the deadly, race-fueled clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Trump had been under increasing pressure to call out the groups by name after his previous remarks bemoaning violence on “many sides” prompted criticism from fellow Republicans as well as Democrats. The president described members of the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists who take part in violence as “criminals and thugs” in a prepared statement from the White House.
In his remarks he also called for unity.
“We must love each other, show affection for each other and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence. We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans,” he said.
His attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said earlier Monday that the violence in which a car plowed into a group of counter-protesters, killing one person, “does meet the definition of domestic terrorism in our statute.”
He told ABC's “Good Morning America”: “You can be sure we will charge and advance the investigation towards the most serious charges that can be brought, because this is an unequivocally unacceptable and evil attack that cannot be accepted in America.”
Sessions said he expects to hear more from Trump on the matter after meeting with him Monday, as well as officials from the FBI. The president added a late-morning meeting with Sessions and FBI director Christopher Wray to his Monday schedule.
“We will not allow these extremist groups to obtain credibility,” Sessions told “CBS This Morning.”
In the hours after the incident on Saturday, Trump addressed the violence in broad strokes, saying that he condemns “in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.”

This year's Sound On Sound Festival has been canceled after losing its primary financial backer. “Due to several recent roadblocks outside of our control and in an effort to do right by our fans, the decision to cancel the event was our only real option,” the festival organizers said in a statement.
The Austin, Texas-based festival was originally scheduled to take place between November 10th-12th, but organizers were left high and dry when the backer pulled out a week and a half ago, according to The Austin Chronicle.
While the promoters scrambled to find new investors, they were ultimately unsuccessful and forced to cancel the event. Sound On Sound booker Graham Williams said the move had nothing to do with ticket sales, which were “on track” with expectations.
Sound On Sound organizers are in the process of rescheduling the majority of the festival's acts at other venues in the area, and will be announcing the shows on October 16th with individual show tickets available for purchase on October 19th. This year's lineup included names like Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Iggy Pop, Grizzly Bear, The Shins, Blood Orange, Pusha T, Vince Staples, and more.
It's the latest unfortunate situation for both festival organizers and attendees alike. Successfully running a music festival has become increasingly difficult, as shown by the cancelations of Pemberton Festival and Karoodinha Music Festival, while the botched Fyre Festival certainly hasn't helped matters.
Read Sound On Sound's full statement below:
We are extremely saddened to announce today that Sound On Sound Fest 2017 is being cancelled. This is one of the hardest decisions we have ever had to make. Due to several recent roadblocks outside of our control and in an effort to do right by our fans, the decision to cancel the event was our only real option.
All ticket holders will be 100% refunded for the costs of their tickets. That refund process has already been initiated through our ticketing partner, Eventbrite, for all attendees who purchased ticket(s) through their site. There is no action necessary on your end and you can expect to see the refund on your credit/debit card statement within the next 5-7 business days.
If you bought a physical ticket, please email info@soundonsoundfest.com to process your refund.
If you have questions about this entire process, please contact us at info@soundonsoundfest.com. We are dedicated to answering any questions and concerns that you might have.
We are currently in the process of rescheduling the majority of the artists who were set to play Sound On Sound Fest at other venues in the area, and will be announcing the shows and individual show tickets available for purchase very shortly. There are many acts who were touring through November 10-12 who are still performing as well as a number of artists who will be flying back in for new dates this year. For all these rescheduled shows, fans who purchased Sound On Sound tickets will get the first chance to purchase single tickets to any makeup shows this fall. Fans will be emailed a link with details in advance of the public onsale with a limited time to purchase before tickets open to the general public. We will announce the schedule for shows on Monday, October 16.

The San Diego Chargers finally wised up and fired Mike McCoy on Sunday after a second straight disastrous season. Unfortunately, McCoy's ouster came a year too late. Now that one huge problem is gone, it's time for the Chargers to fire their other massive disappointment, general manager Tom Telesco.
Telesco's voice was included in the team's statement on McCoy's firing, which almost certainly means the franchise won't get rid of him. But they should fire him immediately.
Telesco had a lot of success with his 2016 NFL Draft class. In fact, that group's production is probably what saved his job. Defensive end Joey Bosa looks like a bonafide star, tight end Hunter Henry has shown he can be lethal to opposing defenses, Joshua Perry and Jatavis Brown look like solid NFL linebackers and we'll see what they got in center Max Tuerk next season when he's finally healthy. Where Telesco has failed has been on the free agent market and in building depth for his team, which has been devastated by injuries.
Telesco — like Ryan Grigson, his former boss in Indianapolis — has failed to build an offensive line that can adequately protect his quarterback. Philip Rivers has been running for his life for four years. Now maybe that's due to the scheme McCoy prefers to run, but if that's the case, Telesco should have pushed hard to relieve the coach of his duties last season. No matter who has been offensive coordinator for the Bolts, Rivers has been constantly under duress. It's unacceptable to not protect a guy when he's your franchise quarterback. That should be jobbed No. 1.
When Rivers has a clean pocket, he's an elite quarterback. He can absolutely pick any defense apart if he's given the time to step up and throw. Additionally, the Chargers spent a first-round pick on Melvin Gordon in 2015 and have been unable to consistently create running lanes for him. This all falls on Telesco for not recognizing the problem and continuing to patch together a line with whatever he can find relatively cheaply on the free agent market.
The Chargers have suffered a ridiculous rash of injuries over the past two seasons. That can absolutely be attributed to bad luck. But good teams have enough depth to deal with losing key players. The Bolts do not and have not had quality depth under Telesco. He also completely botched Bosa's contract negotiations and ruined his standing with fans by running fan-favorite Eric Weddle out of town.
The Chargers have been an embarrassment over the past two seasons on and off the field. The “will they or won't they” fiasco involving Los Angeles has turned most of the city's fans off to the team. Meanwhile, their play on the field has in many ways been even worse. With owner Dean Spanos and his completely unqualified kids John and A.G. essentially running the Chargers, I haven't expected sound decision-making when it comes to the front office and coaching staff. I've been right. Which is why I expect Telesco to retain his job, even though he shouldn't.
KARACHI - Keeping the promise to better the lives of host communities of Tharparkar, Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC) has engaged a highly reputed health service provider, the Indus Hospital, for running its on-site free mother and child clinic situated in Thar Coal Block II.
In this connection, SECMC entered into an agreement with The Indus Hospital on Tuesday which was signed by SECMC CEO Shamsuddin Sheikh and Indus Hospital CEO Dr Abdul Bari at a ceremony.
The Indus Hospital will manage the entire operations of the clinic by providing necessary and quality healthcare facilities and services.
Given the high maternal and infant mortality rates in Tharparkar, the clinic was built by SECMC in June 2015, and initially was known as Marvi Mother and Child Health Clinic.
Several locals are involved in running the weekly clinic, while dispensary staff has been hired from a local pharmacy in Islamkot.
The clinic also provides medicines free of cost to females and children.
Briefing about the initiative, Shamsuddin Sheikh said the health facility was fully equipped with a specialized female gynecologist, a qualified nurse, provision of an ultrasound machine, Gyne/Ops related medical checkup, free of cost medical consultation services and provision of free medicines.
“Around 6,000 patients have visited the clinic till this date,” he said, and added,
“The clinic has been one of our success stories in providing better health care facilities to the people of Block II and surrounding areas.”
He was of the view that the provision of quality health care and education had been the top priorities for SECMC since the start of the Thar Coal Project.
Shamsuddin hoped that the new endeavour would take off on a larger scale with the help of top medical experts of the Indus Hospital and its management.
Indus Hospital CEO Dr Abdul Bari also expressed his thoughts, and said that it was his mission to provide free of cost health care to the people of underprivileged areas.
BERLIN (Reuters) - A Vietnamese man appeared in a German court on Tuesday, accused of helping to kidnap a former oil executive in Berlin last year on behalf of Vietnam's secret services and smuggle him back to his homeland where he has been jailed for life for corruption.

Prosecutors say the 47-year-old helped in abducting Trinh Xuan Thanh in broad daylight on a Berlin street together with a female companion in July last year in a case which soured relations between Germany and Vietnam.
The man, identified as Long N.H., is accused of taking part in secret service activity and assisting in deprivation of personal freedom. If convicted, he could be jailed for up to seven and a half years.
“The defendant is alleged to have rented two vehicles as part of this intelligence operation. One was used to observe the victims, the other for the actual kidnapping,” said public prosecutor Lienhard Weiss outside the courtroom.
Weiss said the accused later drove both vehicles back to Prague in the Czech Republic where he had hired them.
“Based on our information this operation was planned and carried out by the Vietnamese secret service with the participation of members of the Vietnamese embassy in Berlin,” he said.
Thanh, a former high flyer in Vietnam who was accused of mismanagement and causing losses at PetroVietnam Construction JSC, has been given two life sentences in jail in Vietnam since being smuggled back home.
He had been seeking asylum in Germany and his sudden disappearance in Berlin caused Germany to accuse Vietnam of breaching international law. Berlin summoned the Vietnamese ambassador and ordered the official representative of the Vietnamese intelligence service to leave.
Long, who also has Czech citizenship, watched proceedings in the courtroom from behind a glass barrier.
Defence lawyer Stephan Bonell said his client was not involved and called for him to be acquitted.
Thanh's case was part of a government anti-corruption drive, in which more than 100 people, many from state-owned enterprises in the banking or energy sectors have been prosecuted, jailed and, in some cases, given death sentences.
Petra Schlagenhauf, a lawyer representing Thanh, said Hanoi had not expected the kidnapping to be noticed.
“We have to assume that the Vietnamese secret service felt so secure that they thought they could carry out such an operation without anybody noticing or caring about it. That was a big mistake,” she said.
The case is expected to take weeks, possibly months.
U.S. President Donald Trump waves after arriving by helicopter at Morristown Airport to depart aboard Air Force One bound for Washington in Morristown, New Jersey, U.S. August 14, 2017.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday authorized an inquiry into whether to investigate China's alleged theft of American intellectual property, declaring it "a very big move" while the country's largest business lobby group urged the two countries to resolve differences.
Trump broke from his 17-day vacation in New Jersey to return to Washington and sign a memorandum that instructs U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to look into whether to investigate China's trade policies on intellectual property, which the White House says are harming U.S. businesses and jobs.
The inquiry, which U.S. administration officials say will take up to a year to complete, is likely to escalate tensions with Beijing at a time when Washington has asked for its help on North Korea.
"Ambassador Lighthizer, you are empowered to consider all available options at your disposal," Trump told reporters, flanked by Lighthizer and members of his economic team, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. "It's a very big move," he added.
Analysts said the action was aimed at pressuring Beijing into a negotiated settlement to revise its practices.
China's policy of forcing foreign companies to turn over technology to Chinese joint venture partners and failure to crack down on intellectual property theft have been longstanding problems for several U.S. administrations.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest business lobbying group in Washington, said U.S. companies must get equal access to the Chinese market, but said the two countries should be able to work out the issues.
"If the U.S.-China relationship is to deliver mutually beneficial growth, U.S. firms must enjoy the same broad, secure access to the Chinese market that Chinese firms already enjoy to the United States," Myron Brilliant, the chamber's executive vice president and head of international affairs, said in a statement.
"Equally important, China must end forced technology transfer and protect foreign-owned intellectual property rights within China," he said, "We urge the two governments to work together to resolve these concerns."
In a statement later, Lighthizer said the investigation would be a top priority for his office.
Although Trump constantly criticized China's trade practices on the campaign trail, his administration has not taken direct action against Beijing. It declined to name China a currency manipulator and has delayed broader national security probes into imports of foreign steel and aluminium that could indirectly affect China.
In an editorial on Monday, the state-run newspaper China Daily said the investigation will "poison" relations and warned the Trump administration not to make a rash decision it could regret.
The investigation could take up to a year, according to administration officials, opening the door to a settlement before a possible investigation is launched.
Matthew Goodman, a senior adviser for Asian economics at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Beijing would likely resist negotiating under the threat of trade sanctions but could be amenable to a backdoor deal.
"I'm sure they will formally reject this if an investigation is launched and there is an implication this is going to require negotiation to resolve it," Goodman said. "But will they quietly be willing to talk about some of the underlying concerns?"
Jonathan Fenby, an analyst at the TS Lombard consultancy, said China was not interested in a short-term trade fix with the United States and will resist "attempts to tie it down."
Trump had been expected to seek a so-called Section 301 investigation earlier this month, but an announcement was postponed as the White House pressured for China's cooperation on North Korea.
Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, a popular trade tool in the 1980s that has been rarely used in the past decade, allows the president to unilaterally impose tariffs or other trade restrictions to protect U.S. industries from "unfair trade practices" of foreign countries.
For a few glorious weeks there, it seemed as if the Winnipeg Jets could do no wrong. Then they went on a quick road trip.
It would be wrong to say that it all came unraveled during that road trip. Sure, they only took one of a possible six points from Tampa Bay, Florida and Detroit, but it's only three games. Hardly the end of the world given how the season has gone so far.
Some holes most certainly appeared in the ship over those three games, however, and the Jets can't afford to ignore them. It may seem like the Jets' start lets them hit cruise control, but this is still the ultra-competitive Western Conference.
In particular, some personnel decisions that didn't seem glaring when the Jets were winning but get thrown into sharp relief when they lose have drawn the ire of fans and observers. The loss to Tampa Bay in particular brought some questions.
– Perreault playing 7 min a night.
– Chiarot in Over poolman
– AHL leading scorer still on the moose
– Hendricks in the NHL Period. And people still claim there are no problems with the team… — Evan Samoiloff (@esamoiloff) December 10, 2017
While not every complaint here is totally valid (Jack Roslovic is doing just fine in the AHL for now, thank you very much), there are some noteworthy points here. With Tucker Poolman being so young, it makes little sense for his development to be playing in the press box.
Then too, there's the fact that Mathieu Perreault, with 15 points in 18 games, played an average of 9:37 per game over the road trip. While Perreault is in a good place on the line with Joel Armia, he could certainly stand to get more ice time overall.
He could also use some help on that line. Matt Hendricks is many things, but offensively inclined isn't one of them. Perreault could use another scorer to complete that line.
It doesn't have to be a centreman either. Perreault himself can play center. Given his ability to make those around him better, it would be interesting to see what he can do with Marko Dano, another young player whose development is not aided by all this press box time.
Jets Should Play Dano
On the subject of Dano, his underlying numbers this year haven't been good, but there are a couple of contextual caveats to that. One, those numbers came early in the season when the Jets' bottom six was a complete mess. Two, those numbers represent an outlier in his career, in which he's otherwise posted positive CF% Rel.
Dano hasn't played since October, and in six games he averaged 7:24 of ice time. He isn't exactly being put into a position to succeed, and unlike Nic Petan, who is the same age, he wasn't sent to the AHL to get some ice time. His waiver status likely impacted that, in fairness.
Depth forward and would need to clear waivers if send him down — Jim Toth (@JimTothSports) November 30, 2017
That said, when Kyle Connor had to sit out a game against Ottawa, it was Shawn Matthias who drew into the lineup, not Dano. Given that Dano spent time in the top six last year after injuries, it's hard to watch him languishing in a suit for games now.
Dano's NHL career has certainly been a rocky one, and he's had a hard time gaining the trust of his coaches. Yet when he's in the lineup, he makes his team better. And no team, not even one that was briefly atop the Western Conference, can ignore a chance to get better.
Tucker Poolman Deserves a Chance
On the defensive end, an injury to Toby Enstrom (an all-too-common theme of recent years) forced Ben Chiarot into action. He's played in 11 games since then with two assists and 16 PIMS (all minor penalties) and negative 5-on-5 possession metrics.
This is Poolman's first pro season, and although he made the Jets out of camp and played well in his three games in October, he was sent back to the AHL in order to play. He should still be playing, as what was true of Poolman in October is still true: he's a young player whose development is better for him getting on the ice.
Chiarot knew at the start of the year he was likely to be a seventh defenseman, called in if an injury occurred. He's filled in for Enstrom for a while, but now it's time to see what the kid can do. After all, Poolman earned rave reviews for his play at the start of the year.
Poolman's great start was a long time ago, but he's not going to regain that form sitting in the press box. Since the Jets won't send him down to the Moose again until Enstrom returns, it's time for him to play.
With Dustin Byfuglien possibly going down injured, it may be unavoidable for Poolman to get game action, but it shouldn't have had to come to that. Even if Byfuglien is ready to go against the Canucks, Poolman should play.
All of these may seem like minor nitpicks, and next to the Jets' record, they are. The Jets' success this year means little details will start to be scrutinized harder, of course. And nitpicking is, after all, part of a columnist's job.
More importantly, however, the Jets need some nitpicking to optimize their lineup. They cannot fall into the trap of thinking they have a playoff spot all locked up just because things are going well right now. The injury bug, which has been relatively light on the Jets this year, could bite at any time, among other things.
The Jets need to put themselves in the best possible position to succeed, and that means icing the best possible lineup. If that means making a couple of minor tweaks after a quick lesson on the road, so be it.

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -- As Giancarlo Stanton pulled on an extra-large set of New York Yankees pinstripes for the first time Monday, officials from the Boston Red Sox were still searching for ways to fill the Stanton-sized hole in the middle of their lineup.
Even Dave Dombrowski admitted the optics weren't great.
"It didn't make my day that [Stanton] went to the Yankees, by any means," the Red Sox president of baseball operations said as the winter meetings began in the shadow of Walt Disney World. "He's a heck of a player."
When asked about acquiring a slugger, Dave Dombrowski said, "There are people out there." AP Photo/Josh Reynolds
Dombrowski disputed a characterization made by Stanton's agent that the Red Sox "never had any interest" in the recently crowned National League MVP. Dombrowski said he met with Miami Marlins president of baseball operations Michael Hill last month and spoke to him as recently as last week after Stanton vetoed trades to the San Francisco Giants and St. Louis Cardinals.
The Red Sox, after all, have a profound need for power after finishing last in the American League in home runs for the first time since 1993, and Stanton is baseball's pre-eminent slugger, a mountain of a man who walloped 59 homers this past season for the Marlins.
So, how did Stanton wind up with the Yankees, who went deep more often than any team in the majors in 2017, came within one win of reaching the World Series and represent the biggest obstacle to the Red Sox winning a third consecutive division title?
"Well, we were not on his immediate list," Dombrowski said, referring to the four teams (Yankees, Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers and Houston Astros) to which Stanton would've accepted a trade. "We called at the end. We were not on his list, so [the Marlins] were going somewhere else. We did all our homework on Stanton."
Stanton's camp told a different story Monday. Asked if the Red Sox were a consideration, Stanton claimed he "didn't really have a thought on it." Agent Joel Wolfe said the Marlins never asked if Stanton would go to Boston because the Red Sox didn't come close to making a trade. Neither the Giants nor the Cardinals was among Stanton's preferred destinations, but that didn't stop them from working out a deal for him.
According to Wolfe, the Red Sox told teams during the general managers' meetings last month that they were looking for pitching. Dombrowski didn't recall any such thing. If anything, he said he inquired about Stanton at the GM meetings and found the Marlins' initial asking price to be too high given the $295 million left on Stanton's contract.
And although Wolfe noted that the Red Sox are satisfied with their young outfield of Andrew Benintendi, Jackie Bradley Jr. and Mookie Betts, Stanton could have fit for them as a designated hitter.
The bottom line, it seems, is that the Red Sox had little appetite for taking on the money owed to Stanton, who in turn had little appetite for playing in Boston.
Either way, it wasn't a match.
So, while Stanton modeled a No. 27 Yankees jersey and held court for reporters, the Red Sox continued to pound the pavement in search of the elusive middle-of-the-order slugger they haven't had since David Ortiz retired after the 2016 playoffs. Dombrowski said the Red Sox are open to both free agents and trades, although given that they have not yet simply written a check to J.D. Martinez, the latter appears to remain their preference.
According to a source, the Sox have expressed interest in Kyle Schwarber, who is unlikely to be dealt by the Chicago Cubs. The Oakland A's don't want to trade Khris Davis after freeing up the DH spot for him by dealing Ryon Healy. Milwaukee Brewers general manager David Stearns said he's been taking calls on 30-homer outfielder Domingo Santana, but is "gong to expect a sizable return" for a player who is under club control for four more seasons.
"There are people out there," Dombrowski said coyly about the possibility of trading for a slugger.
Martinez, an outfielder who would fit into the Red Sox's lineup as a DH, remains the top power hitter in a slow-to-develop free-agent market that Dombrowski guessed could drag into January. First baseman Eric Hosmer isn't a pure power hitter, although his defense and leadership qualities could make him the most well-rounded player on the market.
Dombrowski said reports that the Red Sox have made Bradley available in trades are "false." He also said the Sox are in the market for only one hitter rather than trying to double up with, say, Martinez and a second-tier free agent such as first basemen Carlos Santana or Logan Morrison.
"I don't know where we'd play these two bats. I'm trying to figure that one out," Dombrowski said. "But I would say we'd be more limited to probably one bat."
Dombrowski's said pitcher Steven Wright's arrest last Friday night on charges related to domestic assault won't increase the Red Sox's need to add a starting pitcher. Major League Baseball has begun an investigation into the matter. There is precedent for a suspension, with Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman missing 30 games in 2016 and catcher Derek Norris receiving a one-month ban at the end of the 2017 season.

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said the goods and services tax (GST) has become “even simpler” after the GST Council's recommendations, and that it is in line with the government's constant endeavour to safeguard citizens' interests and ensure the Indian economy grows.
The prime minister congratulated finance minister Arun Jaitley and his team for engaging with various stakeholders for “extensive feedback which led to today's recommendations” on GST.
Modi's comments in a series of tweets came after a GST Council meeting made sweeping changes to the tax to give relief to small and medium businesses on filing and payment of taxes, eased rules for exporters and cut tax rates on more than two dozen items.
The changes were made three months after the rollout of the new indirect tax regime.
“Good and Simple Tax becomes even simpler. Today's recommendations will immensely help small and medium business,” the prime minister said in a tweet. Modi has been describing GST as “Good and Simple Tax”.
“GST is in line with our constant endeavour to ensure interests of our citizens are safeguarded & India's economy grows,” he added.
According to the prime minister, the composition scheme under the indirect tax has been made more attractive and other facilitation measures will make it even more people-friendly and effective.
According to the changes made in GST, businesses with annual turnover of up to Rs1.5 crore, which constitute 90% of the taxpayer base but pay only 5-6% of total tax, have been allowed to file quarterly GST returns and tax payments, instead of the current provision of monthly filings.
The turnover threshold for businesses to avail of the composition scheme, which allows them to pay 1-5% tax without going through tedious formalities, was raised to Rs1 crore from current Rs75 lakh.
Jaitley, while briefing the media on the GST Council meeting, said a decision has been taken to cut GST rate on 27 items. GST on unbranded namkeen, unbranded ayurvedic medicine, sliced dried mango and khakra has been cut to 5% from 12%, while the same on man-made yarn used in textile sector has been reduced to 12% from 18%. Tax on stationery items, stones used for flooring (other than marble and granite), diesel engine parts and water pump components has been cut to 18% from 28%.
GST on e-waste has been slashed to 5% from 28%. Food packets given to school kids under Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) will attract 5% tax instead of 12%. Job works like zari (embroidery), imitation jewellery, food items and printing items would attract 5% tax instead of 12%. Government contracts involving high amount of labour will be levied 5% GST instead of 12% in order to contain cost of those programmes, he said.
During CES, the single piece of electronics I spent the most time with, apart from my laptop and camera, was a Mattel Dungeons & Dragons Computer Fantasy Game handheld. This decades-old device held the attention of John Biggs and myself through quite a few drinks as we navigated its arcane interface (eventually slaying the dragon, thank you). These cheap handhelds, sold as impulse buys at drug stores and Toys ‘R Us (RIP), are the latest thing to be collected and emulated in full by MAME and the Internet Archive.
At first when I heard this, I was happy but not particularly impressed. They're great little devices — mostly terrible games, albeit a nostalgic kind of terrible — but how complicated can they be?
Oh, quite complicated, it turns out.
Unlike, say, an NES ROM, these little gadgets don't have their graphics palettized, their logic isolated, etc. No, each one of these things is a strange and unique little machine. They must be carefully taken apart and their logic teased out by experts.
For one thing, the graphics aren't pixels accounted for digitally. They're etched into the liquid crystal system, to be activated when a charge runs through them. In other words, all the graphics are right there on the same screen, arranged like puzzle pieces.
So you may remember Space Jam looking like this:
But the LCD layer looks like this:
All that is hard-wired into the electronic part, where the logic resides telling which pieces to light up and when.
I won't go into the details — read the interesting Internet Archive post if you're curious. Basically it was a ton of hard work by a bunch of dedicated folks on the MAME crew. Incidentally, thanks to them and everyone else who's kept that project going for years and years.
The only thing that's missing is the interface — that is, the plastic. These things were great not because they were actually great games, but because they cost like $10 and would keep your kid occupied on a road trip for a few hours while they got beaten over and over again by the first three enemies. The cheap plastic enclosures and gaudy decorations are part of the fun.
No one wants to play this:
But this?
I'd definitely bug my mom to get me that. In fact, I think I did.
You can check out the scores of games the teams have already digitized at the Handheld History page, and if you're in an emulatin' mood, check out the other gazillion systems you can play in the browser in Archive's Internet Arcade and Console Living Room.
For people that are supposed to be exceedingly competent businessmen, National Hockey League owners sure do make some fascinating choices. Look no further than Peter Karmanos Jr., majority owner of the Carolina Hurricanes. Formerly chief executive officer at Compuware, Karmanos joined the NHL ownership ranks in 1994, as part of the group that purchased the rudderless Hartford Whalers.
Now, an NHL team is a risky investment for anyone (how many of them actually make money, do y'reckon?), but Karmanos had been involved in hockey his entire life. The Whalers were a disappointment on the ice, especially following the boneheaded trade of superstar centre Ron Francis, and struggling mightily off it, due to the small size of the Hartford market and the lack of an NHL-calibre arena. So why, then, would Karmanos buy in?
And especially why, three seasons later, would he choose to move the team to Raleigh, North Carolina (renaming them the Carolina Hurricanes), a city far from a slam-dunk for relocation success? More to the point, Raleigh's brand-new arena was so new that it wouldn't even be ready for another two years, forcing the team to play out of nearby Greensboro. And when I say “nearby," I mean, an hour and a half away. Needless to say, the move didn't exactly help the team's attendance.
The Hurricanes have stumbled along ever since, making the playoffs only five times in 19 seasons post-relocation, including missing the dance eight straight times going into 2017-18. Yes, they did manage a Stanley Cup in the free-for-all that was 2005-06, but the ‘Canes have never really had any prolonged period of competitiveness, something even their bumbling predecessors managed.
Carolina Hurricanes Storm Warning
To be fair, the ‘Canes did have a tough act to follow in the uniform department. For all the Whalers' faults, nearly everyone agrees the team had some truly sweet duds, centred by one of the most artistically brilliant logos to ever grace an NHL jersey.
The Hurricanes, though sticking with the seafaring theme, completely redesigned the team's look. Gone was the blue, green and silver colour scheme, replaced by red, black and silver. Gone, too was the Whalers crest, replaced instead by a swirling hurricane.
The Hurricanes take a lot of flak for their logo, but I think it looks good; nice and aggressive. The shape reminds me of Sonic the Hedgehog in full flight. Yes, it is a bit blunt, especially considering the complex brilliance of its predecessor. However, I think most of the hate comes not on account of its own design, but because it replaced a beloved icon of sports logodom.
As for the rest of the uniforms, they were reasonably well thought-out, too. After choosing traditional striping patterns for the sleeves and socks, the ‘Canes broke with the blandness of hockey custom and went with a hurricane warning flag motif for a tail stripe. I think it works better on the red jerseys than the whites (it's left to float about on the latter, while it is sandwiched and secured nicely on the former), but I love it, nonetheless. The italicised name and number font works well, too, congruent with the impression of movement the primary logo communicates.
Nevertheless, one thing I really take issue with is this kit's lack of consistency. The tail striping utilises a five-stripe pattern, while the sleeves use three stripes, as do the socks (though in a different arrangement), with the collar getting two. The application of silver is similarly spotty, with the red jerseys getting more of it than the whites, and the socks receiving none at all. I would also have liked to see black pants used for the red kit, for purposes of better contrast.
Speaking of ruining a good idea with sloppy execution, take a look at that shoulder patch. The team's secondary logo also utilises the hurricane warning flag, with a singular flag mounted on a hockey stick, the two straining together against the (hurricane-force, presumably) wind. Not bad, right?
Well, one, the singular flag, technically, represents “storm warning," not “hurricane warning," somewhat lessening its impact. And two, the whole thing is mounted on a black triangle, supposedly symbolising North Carolina's Research Triangle. ‘Cause yeah, that's what people want to be reminded of when they put on their hockey jersey.
So, the Hurricanes had a few good design ideas they then ruined with overengineering. Or maybe they didn't put enough effort in and underengineered them. Or maybe the engineers just weren't competent in the first place. Whatever. The jersey engineering on the Hurricanes' inaugural kit is intriguing but, ultimately, sub-par.
Carolina Hurricanes at the Reebok Edge of Reason
With the exception of a black outline added to the player names a couple seasons in, the ‘Canes' kits remained exactly the same for a decade. However, the 2007-08 rollout of the Reebok Edge uniform system resulted in many a team making unneeded, often detrimental changes to their uniforms. The Hurricanes were no different, further muddling an already flawed design.
As you can see, none of the flaws of either the home or away uniforms were addressed. Instead, you know that vertical piping everyone was adding to their jerseys at the time? Well, the 'Canes turned it into shoulder yokes. Or, rather, the outline of shoulder yokes. Actual shoulder yokes might have looked cool – especially on the white jerseys, but the Hurricanes felt an outline was sufficient.
It is not. It only serves to further complicate an already confused cacophony of confuddlement.
Carolina Hurricanes One-Step Forward, Two Steps Black
In 2013, the Hurricanes debuted a black alternate kit, with the almost-hurricane flag crest front and centre, and the swirling hurricane relegated to shoulder duty. Interestingly, the ‘Canes chose to go with the wacky, wavy sock striping of Reebok Edge for their alternate uniform, after (wisely) ignoring it in their home and away ensembles. They even changed the amount and order of the sock stripes, though this alteration is at least in line with the changes to the sleeve and tail striping. The Hurricanes finally saw fit to make all their striping elements consistent, a decision from which this kit benefitted greatly.
Unfortunately, Carolina proceeded to ruin this progress with yet another head-scratching decision: greying out the hurricane flag motif and shoulder logos. This tragic overestimation of “silver" (grey) deadens what could have been a staggeringly good black kit – few and far between in the NHL.
If the ‘Canes are going to bring this uniform back after the ADIZERO moratorium on third jerseys is lifted, I would recommend they use colourised secondary crests to make the shoulders pop, and swap the silver and red tail stripes to emphasise the hurricane flag design. The latter change would also bring the tail striping more completely in line with the sleeves, socks and collar, with red on top and silver underneath. Oh, and fix those socks, too.
Fortunately, the Hurricanes finally decided to switch to black helmets and black pants. Unfortunately, this decision applied to their black jerseys. To make their outfits even more punchy, they could use the team's red helmets and pants with the black jerseys for some added contrast, likewise putting the black helmets and pants to use in the red kit.
Carolina Hurricanes Downgraded to Tropical Storm
What's that saying, “Be careful what you wish for?" Hurricane fans sure must have been thinking that when the team brought out their redesigned kits for the 2013-14 season. The black alternate remained in the rotation, unchanged, but the home reds and road whites were both given complete overhauls. And not for the better.
The home uniform is thoroughly boring, with two thin, white stripes adorning the tail, sleeves and socks. Consistent, yes, but utterly devoid of any thought, care or artistic merit whatsoever. The most interesting thing about it is the lace-up collar, which is black – the only instance of black colouration on the jersey, save for a thin font outline. While we're on the topic of font, even that manages to be boring; tall, slender lettering that would be more at home on a road sign than an NHL jersey. There's just nothing about this uniform that evokes any sort of emotion or communicates any sort of passion. No wonder nobody goes to ‘Canes games anymore.
It's more of the same with the away kit. True, gapped, slim-thick-slim striping can be found on the tail, sleeves and socks, giving the uniform more complexity than its home equivalent. However, the squared-off shoulder yokes look cookie-cutter and robotic, and the V-neck collar looks downright amateurish. Different, yes. But still staggeringly uninteresting.
The old uniforms, though irritating in many ways, were undoubtedly interesting and had some excellent design features. Their replacements look as though they were designed by a computer algorithm – or maybe an alien given only the vaguest description of a hockey jersey, rather than by a human being with, you know, eyes. And a heart.
Carolina Hurricanes Gaining Strength
But never fear, for Adidas' ADIZERO programme is upon us, and it has benefitted the Hurricanes' uniform set greatly. Well, half of it, anyway. Actually, only a third. Whatever. Shut up.
Yes, the black alternates are no more. And yes, the road sweaters stay the exact same (what, did they run out of money? I mean, this is the Hurricanes we're talking about…).
But that red home uniform… Boy, is that ever a sight for sore, uninspired eyes. The same basic two-stripe template has been retained but, this time, the thin white stripes are flanked by black. The top stripe is joined by a thin black band, while the lower stripe has a thick, chunky black stripe on its southern border. This addition of more black makes the black collar finally make sense. The hurricane warning pattern returns, too, although it is somewhat muted and restricted to the tail striping.
This jersey is not without warts. The thin black stripe is probably not needed. I'd like to see a full-impact hurricane flag design, rather than the washed-out colouration they've gone with. The hurricane patterning should also be extended to the sleeves and possibly even the socks. The helmets and pants would make the kit look much more striking if they were black. Oh, and the font still sucks.
But hey, much like the Hurricanes as a team, their uniforms are finally pointing in the right direction. If they can follow up their new home kit with an equivalent for the road, and maybe even bring out an improved edition of the black alternates, the ‘Canes might just have the best dressed-contending wardrobe to suit their soon-to-be Stanley Cup-contending team.
Carolina Hurricanes Climate Change?
It's a real shame the Hurricanes haven't had any sustained success, as they do draw fans – Caniacs, in fact – when they're winning. Or, you know, at least not terrible. The team has just been so offensively (and goaltendingly) starved the past few seasons that they've become absolutely dreadful to watch. Can you blame people for not going?
But help is on the way, with a soon-to-be all-world defense corps and a bevy of promising young forwards. If netminding acquisition Scott Darling is ready for a starter's role, look for the ‘Canes to make the playoffs this season. No doubt their fans will return, and they'll be treated to a team that looks as good as it plays.
On home ice, at least.
Eoin Morgan ruled out any element of complacency and insisted England simply failed to adapt to the demands of a used Cardiff pitch as they crashed out of the Champions Trophy against Pakistan.
Morgan's men reached 128-2 but faltered alarmingly to be bowled out for 211 as Hasan Ali (3-35) exemplified an outstanding performance from the visitors' attack on a dry surface which suited them ideally.
Openers Azhar Ali (76) and Fakhar Zaman (57) then helped knock off the inadequate total with almost 13 overs and eight wickets to spare as England bowed out of their own tournament at the semi-final stage.
It was an outcome which confounded almost all predictions after England had breezed through the group stages – while Pakistan began their campaign with a landslide defeat against India and sneaked into the last four only when they beat Sri Lanka by three wickets at this same venue two days ago.
Morgan believes that experience, on the same strip prepared for this match, played its part – and spelled out that England did not take unpredictable Pakistan lightly.
“We certainly weren't over-confident,” he said.
“We played against some really good sides recently, and we've managed to beat them.
“(But) certainly, that hasn't gone to our heads at all.”
Instead, it was a case of coming unstuck in conditions which made setting a defendable total no easy task – despite England's handy start after being put in.
“We left ourselves short today, adapting to conditions,” said Morgan.
“It's a big frustration, because I think we've played some great cricket in this tournament – and we weren't anywhere close to it today.
“(But) fair credit to Pakistan. They played brilliantly.”
Pakistan were expert with the ball, and fielded increasingly well too after dropping three early catches.
“I think, going into today's game knowing that we were going to play on a used wicket potentially brought Pakistan's game closer to their home,” added Morgan.
“So it was a big challenge, and one that was too far for us.
“They adjusted to conditions extremely well, and the wicket was obviously slow and low.
“Every partnership we had started behind the rate, which put us under the pump a little bit, and none of our batsmen seemed to get away.”
England ground to a near standstill as their last eight wickets fell for 83, and Ben Stokes found himself batting entirely out of character without hitting a single boundary from his 64 balls.
“I felt like we were trying to take a positive option against them,” said Morgan.
“But obviously, given the conditions, it didn't allow us to do that ... it was quite tough.”
He and Stokes had prospered on a vastly different surface against Australia in their final Group A match at Edgbaston on Saturday.
But on arrival in Wales, they found requirements were very different.
“I don't think there was any home advantage,” he added.
“We knew we were going to play on a used wicket at some stage in this tournament.
“But certainly, coming from Edgbaston, it was obviously a big jump (down) in pace and bounce and too much of an ask for us to adjust to really.”
Pakistan turned the run chase into a formality.
Asked how that came about, Morgan said: “I think the explanation is they played two days ago on it.”
He declined to call on tournament organisers to change their pitch policy, however.
“I think it depends on what the ICC want to get out of the tournament,” the 30-year-old added.
“If they want it to be completely neutral ground and bring all the teams into (it)... I would keep it the same way.”
He confirmed that, despite their setback, England's long-term ambition to win the 2019 World Cup remains on track.
“We've stayed true to what we believe in and what's worked for us the last couple of years, and I think that's the continued formula for the future.
“I think it will have to evolve in whatever manner the game does over the next two years in the lead-in to the World Cup, but certainly I think we're moving in the right direction.”
Morgan's opposite number Sarfraz Ahmed hailed Pakistan's near perfect performance.
“I think the pitch was very good for both teams,” he said.
“We played very well. That's why we won.”
They were completing a remarkable turnaround after losing so heavily 10 days ago to India, who will bid to join them in the final when they take on Bangladesh in Birmingham today.
Sarfraz added: “After that first loss, we were very down. “We just motivated the guys – ‘don't worry about the India match, it's gone ... if we play good cricket, definitely we will win this tournament'.”
Plenty of fans were surprised when the New York Rangers' pre-trade deadline selloff in February didn't include forward Mats Zuccarello.
Following management's stated desire to trade off assets and rebuild the club, speculation swirled about how many suitors there would be for the diminutive but offensively talented Norwegian before the deadline. Invaluable to the Rangers during their years of Stanley Cup contention, he seemed a perfect trade target for a contender who craved the scoring and energy Zuccarello provides.
The question wasn't if he would be traded but when and for what? The discussion focused on what he was worth: a second-round pick and a prospect, or a first-rounder? Then the deadline passed and the beloved Zucc kept his Blueshirt, unlike so many of his veteran teammates who were shipped off in deals for future assets.
Though it might have stunned some, the reality was that Zuccarello was more likely to remain a Ranger than depart; the reason being that his contract and a down season could have scared off potential trade partners.
The eight-year veteran wasn't a rental player, with one season remaining on the four-year deal he signed in March 2015. At an annual average value of $4.5 million, Zucc's contract was considered below market value when he inked it in lieu of testing free agency, wanting to stay with the club he helped reach the Stanley Cup Final in 2013-14 and that would go on to capture the Presidents' Trophy and make it to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Final in 2014-15.
Any team acquiring Zuccarello would have received two potential playoff runs at a reasonable rate, a major selling point. Even with the workable AAV, though, it's possible that no team wanted to commit to that $4.5 million cap hit next season, especially when Zuccarello's play didn't measure up to his usual standards.
Zuccarello's Production, Intensity Dropped in 2017-18
Whether it was the mood that hung over the team due to the Rangers' stated mission to rebuild, their general ineptitude on the ice later in the season or a combination of the two, Zuccarello simply wasn't as good offensively. Though he did record 16 goals and 37 assists, the excellent passing and timely scoring seemed absent too often, and he wasn't the same force on the power play.
Zuccarello, who had scored 12 power-play goals over the previous two seasons, often operating from his trademark spot low on the right side, managed one in 2017-18. He recorded 17 points with the man advantage but the low number of power-play goals likely hurt his value in trade talks.
More importantly, his energy, intensity and often extremely irritating presence against opponents appeared to be missing far too often. Driving bigger players crazy and then scoring or setting up goals against them has been Zuccarello's ticket to success since he arrived in the NHL in 2010-11 and he slowly but steadily developed into an unlikely star. A plus-55 over the previous five seasons, Zucc was a minus-10 in 2017-18.
Now many are demanding that he be traded this offseason, perhaps at the draft. The idea is to leverage every important veteran asset as part of the Rangers' rebuild. Doing so, however, could end up being a rash decision and, ultimately, a mistake. If a deal arrives that's to the Rangers' liking they should, by all means, pull the trigger but the right call could be not to rush it and carry him into next season.
There's risk in keeping Zuccarello and hoping he rebounds with a strong effort that rebuilds his value. Could he be declining, given that his point totals have dropped in each of the past two seasons? If that proves to be the case and he stays with the team into next season, the Rangers might end up having to settle for even less in return at the deadline than they might have gotten for him during 2017-18 or this offseason.
Betting on a bounce-back season, however, might be the better move. If he can return to form under new coach David Quinn, he'll be an even more attractive rental trade chip with his contract set to expire and no financial commitment beyond 2018-19.
The Rangers have executed their teardown strategy about as well as could be hoped for but there's no reason to rush into turning every tradeable veteran player into draft picks just because a rebuild is underway. The mission is to build for the long-term; as such, every bit of future value that can be squeezed from the current roster doesn't need to arrive immediately.
If the Blueshirts did, in fact, receive offers for Zuccarello before the deadline and refused to jump at one because they didn't care for the terms, good for them.
Rangers Need to be Patient in Trading Zucc
If that was the case, they should continue to exercise the same restraint this offseason. They shouldn't get caught up in the potential flurry of deals at the draft next month and move him just to move him; they need to be willing to play the long game for his value. Players believed to be the missing piece to a Stanley Cup run are highly coveted just before the trade deadline, more so than during the offseason.
The potential for a rebound in Zuccarello's value is realistic. Rick Nash went on a pre-deadline surge this season, scoring nine goals in 16 games immediately before being traded to the Boston Bruins on Feb. 25. The Rangers received a haul that included a 2018 first-round pick, defense prospect Ryan Lindgren, forward Ryan Spooner and a 2019 seventh-rounder for a player that's clearly past his prime. Nash's timely scoring binge had plenty to do with the high-value return, not to mention the level of interest.
It's doubtful that Zuccarello would be as sought after as Nash was but, who knows? If Michael Grabner was worth a second-round pick and a defensive prospect from the New Jersey Devils, the Blueshirts should be looking for at least a first-rounder in return.
Maximizing his trade value – and that's what he represents at this point to a club that's getting younger – might require rolling the dice on a player who meant so much to them when they were chasing the Cup not that long ago, and holding off on dealing him for while. If that strategy proves successful, and Zuccarello has a resurgent season that sets the Rangers up to move a coveted player to a contender next year, then discussions about a high return for him could end up becoming reality in 2019.

Ammunition Seller Charged In Connection With Las Vegas Shooting
Enlarge this image toggle caption Brian Skoloff/AP Brian Skoloff/AP
Federal prosecutors have charged Douglas Haig, a man identified earlier this week as "a person of interest" in the Las Vegas mass shooting, with selling bullets he had modified to make them more potent — referred to as armor-piercing.
The 55-year-old aerospace engineer did not have a license to manufacture and sell the armor-piercing bullets he sold to Stephen Paddock in the weeks before the massacre that left 58 people dead. Paddock died at the scene from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound.
Court documents filed Friday indicated Haig also sold Paddock 720 rounds of tracer bullets.
Haig came to investigators' attention early on, when they found a shipping box with his name on it among Paddock's possessions, reports NPR's Martin Kaste.
Authorities also found Haig's fingerprints on armor-piercing bullets recovered from Paddock's Mandalay Bay hotel room. The ammunition found at the scene was unfired, and it's unclear if any of it was used in the attack.
Haig held a press conference with his attorney by his side on the same day federal authorities filed the charge. In it he explained how he first met Paddock at a Phoenix gun show and calmly recounted having three separate phone conversations with Paddock whom he described as "very well dressed, very well groomed, very polite, very respectful."
That's when Paddock told Haig he wanted the tracer bullets.
Tracer ammunition is built with a small pyrotechnic charge that produces a bright trail of light to allow a shooter to see the bullet's trajectory during nighttime firing or other low visibility scenarios.
"At no time did I see anything suspicious or odd or any kind of tell," Haig told reporters.
The complaint says Haig told investigators that when Paddock bought the ammunition, he put on gloves before taking the box from Haig.
Haig defended himself as merely a vendor, saying, "I had no contribution to what Paddock did. I had no way to see into his mind. The product that I sold him had absolutely nothing to do with what he did."
His lawyer, Marc J. Victor, also called the exchange "a very routine transaction."
The Mesa, Ariz., resident also recounted receiving several death threats over the phone and in person at his home in recent days. Haig's name was released to the press after authorities released documents containing his full name.
If convicted, Haig faces up to five years in prison, a fine of $250,000 or both, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Las Vegas.
Korean unity at Vatican? Not so fast, but pope cheers anyway
Korean unity at Vatican? Not so fast, but pope cheers anyway

VATICAN CITY (AP) — South Korean taekwondo athletes have performed for Pope Francis, after a planned show of Korean unity at the Vatican fell apart when the North pulled out at the last minute.
Pope Francis didn't seem to notice or mind, thanking the athletes Wednesday for their exhibition "which was a show of the will for peace, the two Koreas together."
South Korea's World Taekwondo organization, the Seoul-led international body, said last week that a demonstration team from the North withdrew from the performance over the U.S.-South Korean military drills.
The performance had been planned to ceremonially open the World Taekwondo's Grand Prix competition this week in Rome.
The South's team performed for thousands of people in St. Peter's Square and featured a young girl releasing a dove in a sign of peace.
A technologically obsolete medium that self-destructs over time? No wonder only 89 million CDs were purchased in all of 2017. Back in 2001, that number peaked at 800 million and many of those copies were sold by retail giants like Best Buy and Target. But as interest in physical discs has waned, so too has the amount of space these stores dedicate to such inventory. Soon enough, Best Buy will cease selling CDs altogether, while Target will ask record labels to front the costs, according to a new report from Billboard.
Come June 1st, Best Buy will no longer offer CDs in its retail stores. Physical music is only generating around $40 million in annual revenue for the company and executives would rather dedicate the floor space to more lucrative items, Billboard notes. Best Buy will continue to sell vinyl for at least the next two years, but titles will now be merchandised with turntables.
Meanwhile, Target is reportedly pressuring record companies into signing consignment agreements. Under such a scenario, the label would be required to purchase back any unsold inventory. Though Target only stocks 100 titles at any given time, it's still responsible for a sizable chunk of sales. For example, last year Target moved 500,000 copies of Taylor Swift's latest, Reputation. Even still, one major label has already turned down Target's demands, while two others are undecided, according to Billboard.

The High Court of Bombay at Goa has issued notices to the central and state governments on a petition challenging the Centre's new rules that have banned the trade in cattle for slaughter.
The High Court has adjourned the hearing in the case to the last week of June.
Quraishi Meat Traders Association president Manna Bepari stated that the rules notified on May 23, 2017 – the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Regulations of Livestock Markets) Rules, 2017 – are in direct conflict and in violation of the Constitution of India which guarantees freedom to practise trade of meat including beef.
The plea argued that the Centre's notification indirectly imposes a ban on sale, purchase or resale of animals. This would put a huge economic burden on farmers and cattle traders.
During the hearing the counsel for the association said the new rules violate the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act that allows sacrifice of cattle for religious purposes.
It was also argued that as per the Constitution, markets and fairs are a state subject, and therefore the notification controlling animal markets is in violation of the Constitution.
Praying to quash the notification, the petition has sought interim relief by ordering a stay on implementation of the notification until final disposal of the plea.
The petition has pointed out that the Goa Animal Preservation Act, 1995 permits the slaughter of bovine animals subject to strict compliance of all relevant Acts and Rules in force.
The petition has also drawn the attention of a High Court order passed on June 26 in 2013 whereby a plea of the Govansh Raksha Abhiyan was rejected and allowed bovine animals to get slaughter at the Goa Meat Complex.
The petitioners also complained that their fundamental right to trade and profession under Article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution of India was substantially affected, as the bovine animals permitted for slaughter are mainly purchased from animal markets in Karnataka.
Furthermore, it was contended that slaughter of animals for food was a permissible activity under the parent Act – Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act – and that the central government is trying to contravene by using its concurrent jurisdiction on prevention of cruelty to animals.
A gazette notification titled ‘Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Regulation of Livestock Markets) Rules, 2017' and issued by the Union ministry states that no one can bring cattle to an animal market unless he or she has furnished a written declaration that the cattle will not be sold for the purpose of slaughter.
DETROIT (AP)  The winners of this year's international ArtPrize competition were announced Friday during an event in western Michigan that's known for openness  and increasingly, this year, politics.
A portrait of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln made with more than 24,000 pennies is among the top prizes in the ninth annual international ArtPrize competition. "A. Lincoln" by Richard Schlatter was awarded one of two $200,000 prizes following a public vote in Grand Rapids, and for the other, a jury of experts selected Seitu Jones' "The Heartside Community Meal," which welcomed 250 residents to a 300-foot table in the city's Heartside Park last month for a healthy, locally grown meal.
In all, $500,000 prizes were awarded as part of ArtPrize Nine, culled from the work of more than 1,300 artists on display since last month at more than 170 venues. They will remain open through Sunday evening.
Nine years in, the open, experimental mission remains firm for the show that draws hundreds of thousands of attendees annually. It comes directly from founder Rick DeVos, grandson of multibillionaire Rich DeVos, a co-founder of direct-sales giant Amway Corp., an ArtPrize sponsor, and son of U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Her critics say she's hostile to public education and indifferent to civil rights, citing her push for school choice and her decision to end the Obama administration's rules for investigating allegations of on-campus sexual violence. School choice programs include charter schools, which are publicly funded but usually independently operated, and vouchers that help families cover tuition at private schools.

A spokeswoman said Rick DeVos wasn't available to comment. He told The Associated Press in 2011 that organizers "want to make sure everyone knows that ArtPrize can host really any type of expression."
The show has works critical of Betsy DeVos and the Trump administration, including "For-profit Education" by Sarah Ellis, a Grand Rapids high school teacher. She says in an artist's statement that her video and installation-based piece reflects her concern over policies that harm "free and quality education for all." Her video shows a hammer striking plaster casts of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, who is quoted in the work saying, "Education is teaching our children to desire the right things."
Detroit artist Eric Millikin's "Made of Money" consists of dollar bills cut up and fashioned into portraits of "great people," such as Nikola Tesla, Hedy Lamarr, Joe Louis and Edgar Allan Poe, who "died penniless." Millikin said his work is designed to remind "that our best people aren't always rewarded with wealth, and that our wealthiest people aren't always our best."
Millikin said he has long known about the DeVos family through their wealth and political connections. He recalls in particular Betsy DeVos' husband, Dick DeVos, a former Amway president who unsuccessfully ran for Michigan governor in 2006. The DeVos family's support of ArtPrize kept Millikin away for the first eight years, but he saw the election of Trump and Betsy DeVos' cabinet appointment as a way "to make a statement."
"That made it a better place (to exhibit) because I'm addressing a national figure," he told the AP. "It's equivalent to someone ... speaking up at the town hall."
ArtPrize Exhibitions Director Kevin Buist said political statements  including those against the DeVos family  have been part of the competition since the beginning. In 2009, Anna Campbell exhibited "The Seeding Trilogy," which featured drink coasters with messages calling out efforts by members of the DeVos family to fight same-sex marriage.
Buist said an increase in political pieces  and an increasing spotlight on them  is no surprise, given the current climate.
"Some (artists) are angry and they have a right to be angry," he said. "They're using ArtPrize as a vehicle to express that and to work through really complicated and tricky issues.
"Of course, some of that is going to be directed toward the current administration, and some of our funders," he added. "That's fine. I'd be worried if that weren't happening."
On Thursday evening, Trump spoke with China's President Xi Jinping, their first conversation since his January 20 inauguration.
A White House statement said he “agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our ‘one China' policy.” It was announced by Jimmy Carter in December 1978 – made official US policy on January 1, 1979.
Trump earlier saying “(e)verything is under negotiation including one China” didn't go down well in Beijing. It considers Taiwan an inalienable part of the mainland. Normalized bilateral relations depend on Washington continuing to recognize it.
Taiwan's reaction was muted. President Tsai-Ing-wen's spokesman said it was in the interest of its country to maintain good relations with America and China.
According to a White House statement, both leaders “extended invitations to meet in their respective countries. President Trump and President Xi look forward to further talks with very successful outcomes…on various issues of mutual interest” – with no further elaboration.
Thursday's phone call followed Trump's letter to Xi, saying he seeks a “constructive relationship” with Beijing, extending an olive branch after earlier hostile comments, along with China's concern over challenges by Washington to develop island territories in its own waters.
According to China's Xinhua news agency, Xi and Trump pledged “cooperation in a variety of areas and develop a constructive China-US relationship.”
Both countries “maintained close communication on issues of common concern since Trump's inauguration, Xi noted, saying that the necessity and urgency of strengthening China-US cooperation is further increased in the face of the current complicated international situation and various challenges.”
Trump said he's committed to mutual cooperation with China on trade, investment and international affairs issues. Both leaders agreed to maintain close contacts.
Earlier Trump comments on China were hostile, saying “we are so tied with China and Asia that their markets are now taking the US market down.”
China is “taking our jobs (and) our money. We have nobody that has a clue…They keep devaluing their currency…and that's going to be devastating for us.”
Statements by both governments excluded contentious issues. They haven't gone away.
They risk less than cordial US relations with China ahead, notably continuing Obama's hostile Asia pivot targeting Beijing.
If your favorite room is outdated and dingy, a renovation may be all you need to make the old feel new and to fall in love with your home all over again.
Upgrading your home can be a big job, and unless its part of a pre-move-in plan, few homeowners find it practical (or even possible, from a budget standpoint) to execute a large-scale project. However, tackling the updates one room at a time and focusing on small changes that bring big returns can put those overdue enhancements well within reach.
Kitchen
Its the heart of the home, and its where many homeowners sink big money to make upgrades. Kitchen renovations dont have to require a second mortgage though. Re-facing rather than replacing cabinetry can bring about a whole new look for a whole lot less money. This is a good option when the existing cabinets are still in good working condition and youre just looking for an aesthetic change. Other small-scale options include swapping out the countertop and sink, changing the lighting fixtures and updating tired floors with contemporary wood or tile.
Bathroom
When plumbing is involved, project costs can skyrocket, but there are some relatively simple ways you can give your bathroom a facelift on a modest budget. For starters, swap out all the fixtures from lighting to faucets. A new vanity is another instant upgrade, whether you opt for an updated version of the original or select a whole new style for a completely fresh look.

Also consider upgrades that can increase natural light and fresh air without compromising privacy, such as the addition of skylights to your ceiling, or fifth wall, which can completely change the lighting dynamic of the room. In addition to balanced, natural light, skylights like those from Velux can open to help refresh your space and keep it odor- and moisture-free.
For extra style and light control, consider complementing the rooms decor with skylights featuring colored blinds, which are available in more than 100 colors and styles, and also offer remote control operation for convenience in raising and lowering the blinds and opening skylights to let in fresh air. Learn more about making the fifth wall part of your renovation plan at whyskylights.com.
Living Room
A common space where the family gathers is likely to sustain the greatest wear and tear, and because you spend so much time there, its also a room where youre likely to find a list of things that irk you. Creating a new color scheme is a simple fix that transforms the space, but changing the palette of the walls is just the beginning. Also consider taking your redesign to the ceiling with vibrant colors, creative wallpapers or even exposed beams. Round out the room by swapping out lamp shades, adding vibrant throw pillows, replacing old curtains or blinds, or tying the color scheme together with a new area rug.
Bedroom
In your private sanctuary, all the typical options for updates apply for sure. However, this is a space where the furnishings can be an especially impactful way to influence the ambiance, especially if a construction project in the room where you sleep is impractical. Changing out the style of the bed frame and complementary pieces creates a whole new vibe for the room. Then bring in a new collection of textiles for the bedding and drapery to help round out the pseudo-renovation.
One of the many problems prevalent on this place called earth is that related to those who adopt and those who are adopted. Perpetual misery hovers over the hearts of both the parties. Parents fear that the child might abandon them after encountering the truth, and the child, if happens to find out the truth, spends the entire life in a state of identity loss. Pakistan has produced numerous drama serials on this topic such as ‘Pehchan', ‘Mehndi' and ‘Ghuroor', all of them depicting the characters leaving their up-bringers after finding out that they are not their real children. Sonia Rehman does so in Pechaan. Amina Hussain falls into depression in Mehndi, and Ali Tahir in Ghuroor sets off on a journey to find out his real parentage. Dhund's 5th episode, besides telling the story of a restless ghost hailing from Muzaffarabad, addresses the above-mentioned issue too.
An old man, Jamal (Arjumand Azhar) hesitates to reveal the truth to his adopted daughter regarding her family in fear of losing her, while the girl Hira (Jinaan Hussain) is suffering from identity issues throughout, at times going to the extent of considering herself an illegitimate child. No other person to talk to, she shares her problems with a friend of hers named Moiz (Yaseen Ali), or at times, tries to evoke the spirit of her dead mother so that her questions may be answered. Moiz's advices based on greed and wealth-lust, however, are in constant clash with Erum's loyalty to her up-bringer.
Coming towards the ghost story which has to be the real concern of the series, the restless ghost communicating with Maria and Nana Syed this time is one who is not resting in peace because she carries the guilt of selling off her daughter owing to poor financial conditions. Another reason for her restlessness can be her disobedience to her religion, for being a Muslim woman named Lala Gull, she has gone against the following Quranic statement:
“Don't kill your children for fear of poverty. We (Allah) provide for them and for you. Indeed, their killing is ever a great sin.” (Al-Quran 17:31)
The questions regarding whom the sold child was, to whom it was sold and what link is between the stories can be answered by watching with full concentration the episode, directed with artistic finesse by Farrukh Faiz, and having a clean and fresh look, for which we owe the cameramen and DOP.
The aesthetic element in this episode is provided by the inclusion of Marina Khan, playing the character of Humaira whose story is linked with the plot in the way that she wants the interior designer Maria to have a look at the new house she has bought, and from the shop where she sells flowers and pastries, Moiz comes to buy bouquets for Hira. This elegant character of a middle-aged woman is made all the more admirable by the performer being Marina Khan. The director has given us a treat by casting her who when utters the word ‘pastry', makes us feel as if a delicious, gooey eatable is melting in our mouths. Such is her enunciation.
What makes Dhund an important piece of work is the information it keeps providing by referring to the beliefs of our society, and by hinting at some significant historical events such as the 1857 revolt or the partition of East Pakistan. In this episode, the reference is towards the 8th October earthquake of 2005, which resulted in mass destruction of the northern side of Pakistan. The ghost we have in this episode happens to be one of the victims of this earthquake, presenting an interesting amalgamation of a realistic event and a mysterious element. The belief in this episode is that which is associated with dying people. People on death-beds claim that they are seeing the ghosts of their loved ones who have arrived to take them to heavens, and the scene presenting this belief has been beautifully shot, the blurriness of the arriving figure suggesting the closing eyes of the person about to leave the world.
A fine direction makes itself conspicuous, especially in the first, breakfast making scene, and through the way the cast keeps growing better and better. This time, Maria Wasti and Mohammed Ahmed have been accompanied by Arjumand Azhar, Jinaan Hussain and Marina Khan who are ranked among the popular actors of Pakistani drama industry.
Whereas the scripting is concerned, Dhund is mysterious, historical and comical, hence a mixture of genres carefully and adeptly dealt with.
Congresswoman Terri Sewell is voicing her opposition to the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
The Alabama Democrat voted against a GOP-approved budget resolution in the House Friday.
With a near party-line 227-198 House vote, Congress gave final approval Friday to a budget that will ease passage of a still-unwritten bill replacing President Barack Obama's health care overhaul with a GOP edition. The budget - the Senate approved it Thursday - bars Democratic senators from blocking that future legislation with a filibuster.
The budget is an early but critical victory in the Republican crusade to scrap Obamacare.
Sewell released this statement and video after the vote:
“On behalf of the more than 20 million Americans and over 165,000 Alabamians who stand to lose their health insurance under Republican's plans to repeal the ACA, I voted against the GOP Budget Resolution on Friday. This measure sets repeal of the ACA into motion without a replacement plan and adds over $9.5 trillion to the national debt over the next ten years. The ACA is not perfect. This is why I have worked across the aisle to increase Alabama's hospital reimbursements, decrease costs to individuals and businesses in states that haven't expanded Medicaid, increase innovation, and stabilize the markets. While the Republicans know what it will take to fix what's wrong with the ACA and build upon what's working, they have yet to produce a replacement plan that works for the American people. Simply put, repeal without replace is a disgrace. According to the Office of Management and Budget, the Republican budget includes virtually no deficit reduction and would allow debt held by the American people to increase by roughly $9.5 trillion over the next ten years. The American people deserve a Congress that will work together to fix what's wrong with the ACA and build upon what's working. As representative of a heavily underserved district in a state dependent upon the solvency of Medicaid and Medicare, I stand ready to work with my colleagues to increase access, decreases costs, and stabilize the markets.”

President Karen Haynes, introduces Dr. Joe-Joe McManus and his family to CSUSM by holding a welcoming reception.
Dr. McManus was selected out of 101 applicants. According to Haynes, Dr. McManus has 20 years of experience in the area of diversity. As a first-generation college student and part of a multi-racial and inter religious family, he relates to many students.
McManus was introduced in an open event as the new Chief Diversity Officer and Associate Vice President Office of Diversity, Educational Equity and Inclusion on Jan. 25 from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. in the Kellogg Library Reading Room 5400.
Approximately 60 people attended the event, and the majority were faculty and staff. The attendees included Diversity Coordinator, Ariel Stevenson, and political science professor Cynthia Metoyer.
Stevenson said McManus wants to implement the new strategic plan.
“I think he will help propel us to the next level,” said Stevenson.
Dr. McManus introduced his wife and young daughter to those who attended. He said he wants to interact with the campus community and would like for students to feel comfortable speaking with him. He said that students are free to visit his office located in Craven Hall 6208.
“I have been excited to see what has been done already, and people are very much engaged in issues of diversity and inclusion, and there has been progress; we are not starting at step one. People are looking on how to take the next step and how to move forward.”
McManus plans to host a student forum where he can meet with students. Details will later be announced.
Just before 7:30 a.m. on May 25, Harvey Weinstein stepped out of a black Toyota SUV in Lower Manhattan and surrendered himself to the New York Police Dept. A scrum of reporters shouted, “Harvey! Harvey!” as photographers jockeyed at the barricades, as though it were just another red carpet premiere.
Weinstein had emerged from a six-month exile in the Arizona desert to be fingerprinted and booked on charges of rape and forcible oral sex. He wore a navy sport coat over a light-blue sweater and carried an armload of books.
One of them was a biography of Elia Kazan, the playboy director who was tangled up in the Red Scare in the 1950s. According to a source, it was a tongue-in-cheek message to the media, accusing them of scapegoating him as part of another Hollywood witch hunt.
Weinstein is certainly correct that he is not the only man in Hollywood preying on women. But given the sheer number and severity of his alleged abuses, he has become the focal point of a reckoning over the ways in which women's ambitions are exploited and thwarted. While Weinstein was marched alone in handcuffs into a Manhattan courtroom to enter a plea of not guilty, he had a lot of help in getting there.
“The celebration around his charges misses the point,” says Marie Henein, a Toronto attorney who is suing Weinstein, as well as Miramax and Disney, for sexual assault. “There is a measure of individual accountability, but it really doesn't address the systemic problems that exist in Hollywood.”
Weinstein was such a celebrated figure — dripping with Oscars, the center of every party — that his downfall almost cannot help but force a confrontation with complicity. It has not been pretty.
It began in October with a New York Times exposé, which triggered a cascade of allegations against other powerful men. Brett Ratner was kicked out of his bungalow on the Warner Bros. lot. Kevin Spacey was erased from a movie about J. Paul Getty. A Louis C.K. film disappeared from the release schedule. Just last week, Morgan Freeman was dropped as a Visa pitchman.
Prosecutors are reviewing dozens of allegations against other prominent figures, including Steven Seagal and Ed Westwick, and some are surely watching the Weinstein case in trepidation about who is next.
But it remains to be seen how long-lasting, and how deep, the reckoning will be. At Disney, there is talk that John Lasseter could return from a self-imposed “sabbatical,” which followed accusations that he had groped and forcibly kissed women at Pixar and Disney Animation Studios.
Sources have told Variety that Disney CEO Bob Iger knew of Lasseter's behavior at least as early as 2010, when Lasseter was seen making out with a staffer at an Oscar wrap party. Yet Disney has not conducted an internal investigation, and some within the company fear that top executives are not serious about changing the culture.
“If the company allows him to come back, that would just be a giant slap in the face to the whole Me Too movement,” said one Disney animator, who asked not to be named to protect her job. “It sends a message to the entire universe of animation that if you're big enough and bad enough and awesome enough and a creative genius, you can get away with anything.”
If convicted, Weinstein could face up to 25 years in prison. But structural accountability may only come in civil court, where attorneys are going after Miramax, Disney and the Weinstein Co., the latter of which is now in bankruptcy.
Plaintiffs' attorneys allege that Weinstein's predation was ignored or even facilitated because he was good for the bottom line.
Cris Armenta, an attorney who is pursuing a class action suit, noted that the Weinstein Co. board of directors approved an employment agreement that required him to reimburse the company for sexual misconduct settlements.
“The suggestion that the directors of his company were unaware and didn't condone it is absurd,” she said. “There were lawyers who participated in the confidentiality of settlement agreements. There are others who were aware and helped create an environment that helped him conduct himself the way he did.”
Henein argues that the complicity is evident in the term “the casting couch.”
“You are allowed to demand sexual favors from women to promote them through the industry. That's a standard practice,” she said. “Harvey Weinstein doesn't invent this. What is the culture that allows that?”
The Bill Cosby prosecution offered a similar lesson in sheer impunity — but criminal courts are unlikely to handle any but the most egregious cases.
In Los Angeles, the district attorney's office has established a Hollywood sex crimes task force to handle the influx. Yet many of the cases that have been presented to prosecutors are beyond the statute of limitations.
The L.A. County Sheriff's Dept. submitted a case against Spacey that is believed to be too old to file charges. The office also declined to prosecute five cases against director James Toback, finding that all were too old, and too low-level, to bring charges now. The NYPD is investigating Toback as well.
Weinstein is also under investigation by Scotland Yard, and the L.A. District Attorney's office is looking at five cases involving the disgraced mogul. The most likely to lead to prosecution may be an allegation that he raped an Italian model at Mr. C Beverly Hills in 2013, which does fall within the statute of limitations.
But now that New York prosecutors have made their move, L.A. District Attorney Jackie Lacey may be content to wait her turn.
Weinstein posted $1 million cash bail on May 25 and has been fitted with an ankle monitor. For now, he is not allowed to leave New York or Connecticut without the court's permission — though he may seek approval to return to Arizona, where he has been receiving expensive therapy. He was required to surrender his passport.
A grand jury is expected to indict Weinstein on the sex crimes charges, which would supersede the criminal complaint, at which point his attorney, Benjamin Brafman, will move for a dismissal. Weinstein's team is set to argue that District Attorney Cyrus Vance faced intense political pressure to bring a case.
The former mogul appeared stone-faced in court, saying almost nothing as he stood in handcuffs. According to a source familiar with his state of mind, Weinstein feels almost relieved to have been charged. He did not like waiting for Vance's office to make up its mind. Now, at least, he knows what is in front of him and has a way to fight back.
He may also attempt to atone publicly. Weinstein continues to believe that he was abusive and boorish but that he did not cross the line into illegal conduct. In another year or so, he will learn whether a jury agrees with him.

Kienan LaFrance, left, who is a ratio-buster as a national running back, has signed with the CFL's Saskatchewan Roughriiders. After being a backup all season, LaFrance gave the Ottawa RedBlacks a viable ground game during their run to the 2016 Grey Cup title. Carlos Osorio / Toronto Star ) Order this photo
Chris Jones and Marcel Desjardins highlighted an eventful opening day of CFL free agency. Jones, the Saskatchewan Roughriders head coach/GM, landed one of the most coveted free agents in Derek Dennis. The six-foot-three, 340-pound Dennis was the CFL's top lineman last season after anchoring a Calgary Stampeders offensive line that allowed a league-low 20 sacks and paved the way for rushing leader Jerome Messam, of Brampton. “Proud to announce I'll be apart of @sskroughriders! Thank you to Coach Jones, Jeremy O'Day, and John Murphy for welcoming me to Riderville!” Dennis tweeted. But Toronto Argonauts defensive lineman Shawn Lemon, who signed with Saskatchewan as a free agent last year but asked to be traded once the season began, didn't exactly endorse Dennis's decision. “@6BONECRUSHER3 congrats on making the biggest mistake of your life Sincerely #Lemondrops,'“ he tweeted.

Shoring up the offensive line is one of many off-season priorities for Jones, who posted a 5-13 record in his first season with the Riders. Saskatchewan's offence ranked last in points (19.4 per game) and second-last in rushing (74.2) and sacks allowed (57). Yet that didn't deter Dennis. “Just looking at the overall roster, at the O-linemen on the team and at the need, I think I can be a good complement to what the Riders are trying to build and help them be a competitive team in the West,” Dennis told the Riders' website. “Out of all the offers I had on the table, for a team willing to compete for a Grey Cup this season and next, I think Saskatchewan was my best option.”
Saskatchewan also signed Canadian running back Kienan LaFrance, who spent the last two years with Ottawa. LaFrance ran for 157 yards, a TD and two-point convert in the Redblacks' 35-23 win over Edmonton in the East Division final before adding 42 yards on 11 carries and six receptions for 31 yards in the club's 39-33 overtime Grey Cup win over Calgary. But Jones wasn't nearly as busy as Desjardins. The GM of the Grey Cup-champion Ottawa Redblacks re-signed offensive lineman Nolan MacMillan — the first player drafted in franchise history — before the start of free agency. Once the noon ET deadline passed, Desjardins went about changing the look of his team by adding linebackers Khalil Bass (Winnipeg) and Ron Omara (Hamilton), receivers Kenny Shaw and Diontae Spencer and defensive back A.J. Jefferson (all Toronto) and defensive back Adam Berger (Calgary). Desjardins lost LaFrance and starting defensive back Abdul Kanneh (Hamilton) and released Canadian kicker Chris Milo and American linebacker Damaso Munoz. Spencer and Shaw have the daunting task of replacing 1,000-yard performers Ernest Jackson and Chris Williams in Ottawa's receiving corps. Jackson and Williams were among 16 Redblacks players to hit the open market Tuesday. Shaw, 25, had 77 catches for 1,004 yards and five TDs last season while Spencer, 24, registered 71 receptions for 706 yards and three touchdowns. Spencer also returned punts and kickoffs with the Argos. Jefferson joins an Ottawa secondary that's minus Kanneh, cornerback Mitchell White (Philadelphia Eagles), backup safety Jeff Richards (Carolina Panthers) and defensive back Forrest Hightower (New Orleans). Bass, 26, recorded 181 tackles, nine sacks, three interceptions and five forced fumbles over two seasons with the Bombers. It was an active opening day as all nine teams either re-signed pending free agents or added new faces after the deadline. Rookie Montreal GM Kavis Reed was busy, re-signing linebacker Nicolas Boulay and receiver Kyle Graves, both pending Canadian free agents, to extensions before reportedly adding veteran Ryan Phillips, a free-agent defensive back who was released last week after 12 seasons with the B.C. Lions. Montreal didn't immediately confirm the move but Phillips all but did in a tweet to Darian Durant, the Alouettes' new starting quarterback. “@dariandurant let's have funned my brother. #21 #4 #MTL,” Phillips tweeted. Reed also re-signed kicker Boris Bede and was reportedly in talks with Canadian defensive lineman Jabar Westerman (B.C.) and American quarterback Jacory Harris (Hamilton). Other moves included: Toronto signed quarterback Jeff Mathews to a two-year contract. The six-foot-four, 225-pound Mathews spent the last three seasons with Hamilton playing for head coach Kent Austin, his former coach at Cornell. Winnipeg signed offensive lineman Sukh Chungh to an extension through the 2018 season then added defensive lineman Drake Nevis and Canadian receiver Matt Coates, who both spent last year with Hamilton. B.C. signed defensive back Buddy Jackson to a one-year contract. He played in six games last year with Saskatchewan and also spent parts of three seasons with Calgary. The Lions also signed Canadian receiver Marco Iannuzzi, defensive back Ronnie Yell and defensive lineman Mic'hael Brooks to extensions. Running back/returner Kendial Lawrence returned to Edmonton as a free agent. Lawrence spent 2014-15 with the Eskimos before splitting last season between Saskatchewan and Hamilton. The club also signed defensive back Andrew Lue and fullback Alexandre Dupuis, both Canadian free agents. — Calgary signed receiver Marquay McDaniel and defensive lineman Micah Johnson to extensions. McDaniel was the Stampeders' leading receiver last season with 83 catches for 1,074 yards and four TDs in 16 games. Johnson started 17 games last year and registered career highs in tackles (36) and sacks (seven).
BOSTON -- Red Sox president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski again acknowledged he'd "ideally like to add power to the lineup."
He has said this repeatedly throughout the offseason.
But just 12 days remain until pitchers and catchers report to spring training camp in Fort Myers. And Dombrowski has yet to add a middle of the order hitter.
"I have nothing that's imminent at the moment," Dombrowski said at the Hot Stove Hardball Discussion at Hotel Commonwealth today. "But I can't tell you when I walk across the hall that my phone doesn't ring. Because at some point, this is going to move. I don't know when that's going to be."
MLB free agency has moved at an incredibly slow pace this offseason. Top free agents, including Yu Darvish, Jake Arrieta, Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas and J.D. Martinez, remain unsigned.
"I would say the industry has got to thaw at some point," Dombrowski said. "There's still over 110 free agents out there. There's still trade talks place. So it's going to break at some point. I don't know when it's going to break. But we're ready and willing to move whenever it does."
That said, Dombrowski is prepared to enter spring training with his current roster.
"Sure, we're happy," he said. "Basically we have the foundation for a club that won 93 games last year. Can we get better? Yes."
Dombrowski has never witnessed an offseason where so many free agents remain unsigned in early February. He's unsure why the market has been so slow.
"It's amazing how interactive and dependent upon one move is with another move," Dombrowski said.
He added, "Sometimes you have to sit back and be patient."
TEMPE, Ariz./SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - An Uber self-driving car hit and killed a woman crossing the street in Arizona, police said on Monday, marking the first fatality caused by an autonomous vehicle and a potential blow to the technology expected to transform transportation.
The ride services company said it was suspending North American tests of its self-driving vehicles.
So-called robot cars, when fully developed by companies including Uber, Alphabet Inc and General Motors Co, are expected to drastically cut down on motor vehicle fatalities and create billion-dollar businesses. But Monday's accident underscored the potential challenges ahead for the promising technology as the cars confront real-world situations involving real people.
The accident spurred immediate reaction from U.S. lawmakers who have been debating whether to pass legislation that would speed introduction of self-driving cars into the United States.
“This tragic accident underscores why we need to be exceptionally cautious when testing and deploying autonomous vehicle technologies on public roads,” said Democratic Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts, a member of the transportation committee, in a statement.
The Uber vehicle was in autonomous mode with an operator behind the wheel at the time of the accident, which occurred Sunday about 10 p.m. MST (0400 GMT Monday) in Tempe, a suburb about 11 miles (18 km) east of Phoenix.
“The vehicle was traveling northbound ... when a female walking outside of the crosswalk crossed the road from west to east when she was struck by the Uber vehicle,” police said in a statement, identifying the victim as Elaine Herzberg, 49.
Herzberg later died from her injuries in a hospital, police said. Further details on the accident were not immediately available.
Local television footage of the scene showed a crumpled bike and a Volvo XC90 SUV with a smashed-in front. Uber has been using special versions of Volvo's SUV for its testing, but a Volvo spokesman said the autonomous technology used in the vehicle at the time of the accident was not made by Volvo.
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said they were sending teams to investigate the crash. NHTSA also said it was in contact with Volvo, the Swedish car brand owned by China's Geely.
Canada's transportation ministry in Ontario, where Uber conducts testing, also said it was reviewing the accident.

WILD WEST
Uber and Waymo on Friday urged Congress to pass sweeping legislation to speed the introduction of self-driving cars into the United States. Some congressional Democrats have blocked the legislation over safety concerns, and Monday's fatality could hamper the quick passage of the bill, congressional aides said Monday.
Safety advocates called for a national moratorium on all robot car testing on public roads.
“Arizona has been the wild west of robot car testing with virtually no regulations in place,” said Consumer Watchdog, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, in a statement. “That's why Uber and Waymo test there. When there's no sheriff in town, people get killed.”
Arizona has opened its arms to companies testing self-driving vehicles as a means to economic growth and jobs. Republican Governor Doug Ducey signed an executive order in 2015 allowing for the testing of such vehicles on Arizona streets and reached out to Uber a year later, after California regulators cracked down on the company over its failure to obtain testing permits.

Self-driving cars being tested routinely get into fender-benders with other vehicles. Last week, a self-driving Uber crashed with another vehicle in Pittsburgh, local news reported. There were no injuries.
A year ago, Uber temporarily grounded its self-driving cars for a few days following a crash with another car in Tempe. The company has been the subject of a number of complaints about its autonomous vehicles, but the company has said the cars were being driven by a human driver at the time of the incidents.
ESSENTIAL TO UBER'S SUCCESS
Uber has said its ability to build autonomous cars is essential to its success in the rapidly changing transportation industry. The company envisions a network of autonomous cars that would be summoned through the Uber app that would supplement - and eventually replace - human-driven cars.
Uber has logged 2 million self-driving miles (3.2 million km) through December. The company has more than 100 autonomous cars testing on the roads of the greater Phoenix area, the company's prime testing ground due to the state's loose regulations and hospitable weather. Rain, snow and ice are particularly challenging for autonomous cars. The company also tests in Pittsburgh and Toronto.
Concerns over the safety of autonomous vehicles flared after a July 2016 fatality involving a Tesla Inc automobile. The car involved in that accident featured a partially autonomous system that required human supervision. Uber's vehicle, on the other hand, is considered a full self-driving vehicle where a human is not needed at the wheel.
Safety regulators later determined Tesla was not at fault.
Uber has weathered a series of crises, including sexual harassment claims, controversy over its use of a tracking tool to avoid government officials, and a high-profile lawsuit brought by competitor Waymo alleging theft of self-driving trade secrets. It settled that lawsuit last month, with Uber paying $245 million of its own shares to Waymo.
That settlement was largely seen as a means for Uber to resume work on autonomous cars without the distraction of litigation, as it hustles to catch up with Waymo, widely seen as having the most advanced cars in the industry.
PanARMENIAN.Net - The Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement signed between Armenia and the European Union will be ratified by the National Assembly on April 10, the head of the foreign relations committee Armen Ashotyan told a press conference on Monday, March 18.
Addressing the press conference alongside a Polish parliamentary delegation in Yerevan, Ashotyan said the deal will enter into effect “part by part”.
“Our joint efforts were dedicated to a number of most important questions, particularly to the ratification of the EU-Armenia agreement,” the Armenian lawmaker was quoted as saying by Panorama.am.
“The possibility of launching political dialogue for an EU visa waiver program have also been discussed.”
The Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement (CEPA) between the EU and Armenia was signed by Mogherini and Armenian Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian in Brussels on November 24. The Armenian government approved the 350-page deal in December.
CODY, Wyo. (AP)  Police have arrested a man they say wounded three people by firing live rounds instead of blanks during a Wyoming gunfighter show last summer.
The shooting happened at the height of tourist season in Cody, a city named for the wild West showman Buffalo Bill Cody.
Bullets struck one spectator in the legs and another in the chest as he held his 3-year-old daughter. The girl was wounded in the arm during the nightly Cody Gunfighters show July 29.
Police arrested 51-year-old Steve Winsor, of Cody, on Monday. He is charged with five misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment. He remained jailed Tuesday on $7,500 bond. He had no attorney and couldn't be reached for comment.

A police affidavit says Winsor told investigators live rounds got mixed up with his blanks.

CARACAS, Aug 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's talk of possible military action in Venezuela could be a political life-line for the country's unpopular leader, who has long used the threat of U.S. aggression to justify policies that have shredded the economy.
President Nicolas Maduro has continued the free-spending socialist "revolution" started by his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, almost 20 years ago. Key to the populist rhetoric used by both is a constant drumbeat of warnings that the U.S. "empire" is planning an invasion to steal Venezuela's oil.
That threat was laughed off by the opposition and until Friday night, when Trump said a military option was not out of the question for dealing with the Venezuelan government's crackdown on the opposition and deepening social crisis.
"He's doing Maduro a favor by reinforcing the nationalist position that the Gringos want to come and attack Venezuela. This has always been part of Maduro's rhetoric, and Chavez before him. And it has served them both well," said lawyer Luis Alberto Rodriguez while sitting at a cafe, smoking a Cuban cigar, in one of Caracas' wealthier neighborhoods.
"It's not going to have any impact other than the government using it to further unify its people and attack the opposition," the 44-year-old added.
Maduro loyalists, who regularly insult opposition leaders as Washington's lackeys, wasted no time in pouncing.
"Mind your own business and solve your own problems, Mr. Trump!" thundered Maduro's son, also named Nicolas, at the country's new constituent assembly, which was elected last month to re-write the constitution.
The opposition fears the assembly will remove any checks that remain on the president's powers and critics globally have condemned it as an affront to democracy.
"If Venezuela were attacked," the younger Maduro said, "The rifles would arrive in New York, Mr. Trump. We would take the White House."
Marches against Maduro were held in Caracas on Saturday, with few confrontations with state security forces and no deaths. More than 120 have been killed in unrest since April, as the economy collapses deeper into a recession compounded by triple-digit inflation as well as food and medicine shortages.
Opposition leaders who have counted on the U.S. government to apply sustained moral and economic pressure on Maduro have so far been silent about Trump's remarks and marchers seemed confounded by his military threat.
"I don't know what to tell you," one woman marcher said, declining to give her name. "It's very complicated."
'NO GREATER GIFT'
The opposition, which controls a congress that has been neutered by Maduro's loyalist Supreme Court, boycotted last month's election of the new legislative superbody.
Opposition leaders called instead for an early presidential election, which Maduro would likely lose as his popularity gets pummeled by the country's economic woes.
"Maduro could not have asked for a greater gift from Trump. He provided substance for Maduro's heretofore implausible conspiracy theories," said David Smilde, senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin American, a human rights think-tank.
Smilde said Trump's threat of military force put the Venezuelan opposition "on its heels" after a group of Latin American governments joined last week in reprimanding Maduro for sponsoring the July 30 election of the constituent assembly.
"It has threatened to deflate the emerging regional consensus regarding Venezuela. Today the countries that on Tuesday signed on to a strong statement criticizing Maduro's authoritarian direction are spending their time criticizing Trump's statements," Smilde said.
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. -- Frank Broyles, who guided Arkansas to its lone national football championship and later molded the overall program as athletic director, died Monday at the age of 92.
Broyles died from complications of Alzheimer's disease, according to a statement from his family, who said he "passed peacefully in his home surrounded by his loved ones."
Broyles won almost 70 percent of his games in 19 years as Razorbacks football coach. He became the school's athletic director in 1974 while still coaching, eventually retiring from the gridiron to focus on administrative duties after the 1976 season.
As athletic director, Broyles led an overhaul and upgrade of Arkansas' facilities -- as well as leading the school in its move to the SEC. Following his coaching career, Broyles, who earned a spot in the National Football Foundation's College Hall of Fame, served as an analyst on ABC's college football telecasts from 1977 to 1985.
While his coaching record of 144-58-5 at Arkansas defined the first part of his career, Broyles' legacy is every bit equaled by his work as athletic director.
Arkansas' athletic facilities underwent a near-complete overhaul after the school's move from the Southwest Conference to the SEC in 1991.
Broyles spearheaded the fundraising efforts that led to the construction of Bud Walton Arena, the renovation of and additions to Razorback Stadium and the building of Baum Stadium. He also guided the school as it built indoor and outdoor tracks, a tennis facility and the athletic administrative complex that bears his name.
He was known for his ability to identify top coaches, both head coaches and assistants.

Broyles was responsible for hiring basketball coaches Eddie Sutton and Nolan Richardson as well as Lou Holtz and Ken Hatfield in football. He also hired former great John McDonnell in track.
McDonnell won 40 national championships with the Razorbacks, while Richardson led Arkansas to the 1994 national championship in men's basketball.
Broyles retired as athletic director in 2007, moving into a fundraising role with the school's Razorback Foundation until leaving that role in 2014.
"For the past 56 years, I have had the privilege or working in the only job I ever wanted -- to be the head football coach and then the athletic director of the Razorbacks," Broyles said at the time. "The Razorbacks have always been my passion."
He spent much of his time later in life attending various Arkansas sporting events and raising money for Alzheimer's awareness after the 2004 death of his wife, Barbara, following a battle with the disease.
Broyles started the Frank and Barbara Broyles Foundation CareGivers United, an Alzheimer's education organization, and wrote a book that published more than 800,000 copies and focused on helping those who care for loved ones with Alzheimer's.
"In 50 years, people are going to look back and that's what they are going to remember him for, his second legacy," said Broyles' daughter, Betsy Arnold.
Under Broyles as coach, the Razorbacks won or shared seven Southwest Conference titles and went to 10 bowl games.
That included a win over Nebraska in the Cotton Bowl following the 1964 regular season, which left the Razorbacks 11-0. Alabama was also undefeated entering the bowl season and was named the national champion by The Associated Press poll, but the Crimson Tide lost their bowl game to Texas -- leading to Arkansas being named the champion by the Football Writers Association of America.
The AP poll soon changed its policy and began naming its champion following the bowl games.
Several prominent football figures were members of the undefeated 1964 football team, including Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, former Miami Hurricanes and Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson and Hatfield.
"He's a life teacher," Jones told the AP in 2014. "He always spoke about football as it related to life. ... All things pointed to life's lessons."

One of Broyles' first moves as athletic director was the hiring of Sutton, the coaching great who took over a struggling basketball program and turned it into a national power.
Following Sutton's departure, Broyles again struck coaching gold with the hiring of Richardson -- although the two strong personalities clashed when Richardson was fired in 2002 and claimed he was a victim of racial discrimination, a lawsuit that was eventually ruled without merit.
At Decatur, Georgia, Broyles was a star in football, basketball and baseball. He won 10 letters in those sports at Georgia Tech and was the All-SEC quarterback in 1944 and 1946.
He graduated from Georgia Tech in 1947 with an industrial management degree. Broyles was drafted in the third round by the Chicago Bears but turned down professional football and baseball offers before accepting a position on Bob Woodruff's staff at Baylor.
After a year as an assistant at Florida, Broyles returned to Georgia Tech as the offensive backfield coach and the Yellow Jackets won 31 straight.
In 1957, Broyles was hired as head coach at Missouri and guided the Tigers to a 5-4-1 record. The following January, Arkansas athletic director John Barnhill offered Broyles the Arkansas job vacated by Jack Mitchell.
Broyles' first team started 0-6 and finished 4-6. Only one other time did the Razorbacks finish below .500 under Broyles.
A couple dozen of Broyles' players or assistants became head coaches, leading to the creation of the annual Broyles Award -- given to the nation's top assistant coach -- in his honor.
Broyles had four sons and two daughters with his first wife, Barbara, and later married Gen Whitehead in late 2005.
"I will forever be grateful for the generosity, graciousness and unwavering support he extended to me when I came to the University of Arkansas," Arkansas athletic director Jeff Long said. "The thoughts and prayers of the entire Razorback nation are with his wife, Gen, his children and the entire Broyles family."

Ah, football. Footy. Soccer. The feet. The balls. Some nets. A few flags. It has it all, and while the World Cup is enthralling (or disappointing, depending on how well your country is doing) fans across the globe, it's got us thinking: what country has been responsible for the greatest ever computer?
That's why we've pitted the most famous computers from a variety of countries in a knockout tournament to see who will take home the TechRadar World Cup of Computers™.
Knockout Match 1
Russia (Elektronika 60) vs Spain (Enciclopedia Mecánica)
Well, our World Cup of Computers has got off to a cracking start with this showdown between Russia and Spain. Representing Russia is the Elektronika 60, a terminal computer made by the Electronika company. Its claim to fame is that in the 1980s, the first version of Tetris was written for it by Alexey Pajitnov.
On the Spanish side is the Enciclopedia Mecánica, the Mechanical Encyclopaedia, which was patented back in 1949 by Ángela Ruiz Robles, and is often thought of as the first e-book reader.
The enciclopedia mecánica
The Russian team storms onto the pitch with a RAM size of 8KB and performance speed of just 250,000 operations per second, and this has led to a pretty lacklustre performance. However, its iconic status as the home of one of the most popular games ever invented means it's still an imposing opponent.
Meanwhile, the Spanish team's age may be a disadvantage in this game, as it doesn't have any RAM whatsoever, and uses compressed air to move rotating spindles that displays text and images.
It seems to be a bit of a lopsided match, but the crowd is cheering the Enciclopedia Mecánica on, as it paved the way for the massively successful Amazon Kindle to take over the world.
But wait, what's this? The ref is holding up a yellow card towards the Russians! Oh dear, oh dear. It looks like the Elektronika 60 is being penalised for being a Soviet clone of the LSI-11, a 16-bit minicomputer by the Digital Equipment Corp.
This leaves the field wide open for the Enciclopedia Mecánica, which has a clear ethical advantage, having been created by Ruiz Robles to lighten the weight of the books carried by her students and, in celebration of her 121st birthday, Google immortalised her in a Google doodle .
That's it! The whistle has blown and the winner is: Spain! What an upset so early on in the competition! Russia were the favorites thanks to their more powerful hardware, but the beautiful simplicity of Spain's Enciclopedia Mecánica, combined with its principled ambition to make the life of its creator's students easier, has seen it through to the next round.
Knockout Match 2
France (Alcatel Minitel communication terminal) vs Australia (CSIRAC)
The next match of our knockout round pits France's Alcatel Minitel communication terminal against Australia's Council for Scientific and Industrial Research Automatic Computer. Both have less-than-catchy names, but the Aussies get an early advantage by being better known as CSIRAC, which is slightly easier to type.
CSIRAC was Australia's first digital computer, released in 1949, making it one of the oldest competitors in this tournament. But, as Spain proved, age is no barrier to success in this World Cup. It's one of the oldest surviving first-generation electronic computers, and it's one of the first in the world to play digital music. If you've ever used Spotify on your PC, then give a small moment of thanks to the CSIRAC next time Ed Sheeran comes on for making all this possible.
The less-than-portable CSIRAC
But, charging towards it on the pitch comes the young (sort of) pretender, France's Alcatel Minitel communication terminal. Introduced in the early 1980s by the French government, this beige beauty effectively created the internet before the internet existed. Except it was all in French, and there were no pictures of cats on it.
Using the Alcatel Minitel communication terminal, owners could access up to 22,000 databases and services after paying a subscription charge. France Telecom gave away millions of the terminals for free, and they can still be found in over 6 million homes. Some French government agencies also continue to use these devices.
The fact that the Alcatel Minitel communication terminal is still in use, and not just a dusty curio, gives it an early lead in this contest.
With a text-based screen, keyboard (which can be folded away to cover the screen, beating Microsoft's Surface Touch Cover by several decades) and a modem that is capable of speeds of 1200 bit/s, the Alcatel Minitel communication terminal is running rings around the CSIRAC, specs wise, the latter being a valve-driven computer which uses mercury acoustic delay lines to store data, with a memory clock of 1000 Hz and a control unit that takes two cycles to execute an instruction.
France is dominating this game, but in the dying minutes of the match, its showboating may be its undoing. While the Alcatel Minitel communication terminal is still being used, some people blame the popularity of the device as being the reason why France was slow to embrace the internet. That self-sabotaging streak isn't just quintessentially French, but it's also given the CSIRAC a lead, which despite its age and low computational power, has arguably done nothing but further technological progress for its home nation.
And now the whistle has blown, and Australia has won! Sorry France. If you're upset by this result, log on to the Minitel service to complain.
Knockout Match 3
Taiwan (Asus ZenBook 13 UX331UN) vs England (Sinclair ZX Spectrum)
Oh, come on. This isn't fair. Taiwan brings the Asus ZenBook 13 UX331UN onto the pitch. It's a sleek and sexy ultrabook, with an 8th generation Intel Core i7 processor clocked at 4.0Ghz, full HD 13.3-inch display, 8GB of RAM and Nvidia MX 150 graphics, and it's the world's thinnest laptop with discrete graphics.
Meanwhile, England is represented by the ZX Spectrum, which has a 3.5Mhz Zilog Z80 A CPU, 16KB of RAM and has an image resolution of 256 x 192. Well, at least it's not an Amstrad.
So, the Taiwanese team is well ahead in terms of specs, but what about likeability? Sure, the Asus ZenBook 13 is beautifully designed, lightweight and comes with a backlit keyboard, but the Sinclair ZX Spectrum underdog has plenty of charm as well. It has that iconic rainbow graphic on its keyboard, for example.
The Asus Zenbook 13
There must be something going for it, at least, as even though it was launched in 1982 and discontinued in 1992, over 40 new pieces of software have been released so far in 2018! Would the ZenBook have that kind of following over 30 years later?
And the games. Oh, the games. Jet Set Willy, R-Type, Dizzy, The Hobbit. Match Day II for football fans who are still reading this.
As for the ZenBook 13, what iconic games can it play? Except for all of those games via emulators. And many modern classics thanks to its powerful dedicated GPU. OK, fine, the ZenBook 13 is a much better computer than the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. Game over. Taiwan won. We're not bitter.
Knockout Match 4
USA (Apple IMac G3) vs Japan (Panasonic Toughbook CF-31)
Here is the match that many people have been anticipating: the showdown between two goliaths: on the US side we have the iconic iMac G3, one of the most popular all-in-one PCs ever made, and from Japan we have the near-indestructible Panasonic Toughbook CF-31.
First on the pitch is the iMac G3, which although slightly egg shaped, is a tough little PC, emerging onto the scene in 1998, with an eye-catching design by Sir Jonathan Ive that became a pop culture icon in the 1990s.
Meanwhile, the Panasonic Toughbook CF-31 is a sturdy little bruiser, combining military-endorsed ruggedness with high performance. It comes with a full magnesium alloy case and built-in handle, scoffing at the iMac G3's fancy colored look in favor of a ruthlessly robust design.
It may not look as pretty as the iMac, but can Apple's PC survive a six foot drop, high temperatures, dust and water like the Toughbook CF-31? Of course not. You just have to look at the G3 the wrong way for it to crack like an over-expensive egg.
Tough by name, tough by nature
With a DVD drive, GPS, touchscreen and more, the Toughbook CF-31 is dominating this game, while the iMac G3 can barely keep up with its 4GB hard drive and 128MB RAM. However, the US team is showing some ballsy innovation as well, ditching the then-common floppy drive in favor of something called ‘USB' ports. Will it pay off? Yes. Yes it did.
And, while the Panasonic Toughbook CF-31 is playing an exceptional game thanks to power and build quality, it's struggling against the iMac's status as an icon of modern computers. The fact that it helped change the fortunes of the floundering Apple, which went on to become one of the biggest companies in the world, means the win has to go to the iMac G3.
But Japan should hold its head high, the Panasonic Toughbook CF-31 put in a fantastic performance.
Semi-final match 1
Spain (Enciclopedia Mecánica) vs USA (Apple IMac G3)
Spain's Enciclopedia Mecánica enters the pitch with the crowd roaring its support, buoyed by its surprise win in the knockout round. It's clearly the underdog in this match, but the audience love it. However, as it does a lap of victory (a bit premature, as the match has only started), it's got one of its spindles stuck in ground! A free spindle is furiously waving around, and the word ‘ayuda!' can just about be made out.
And here comes the USA with its iMac G3! It rolls onto the pitch, straight up to the Enciclopedia Mecánica and crushes it under its weight, like a great big egg laid by Jony Ive himself.
USA wins!
Semi-final match 2
Taiwan (Asus ZenBook 13 UX331UN) vs Australia (CSIRAC)
Here we are at our last semi-final match, and Australia's CSIRAC is already on the pitch, and looks terrified. Taiwan's Asus ZenBook 13 saunters in, full of confidence and RAM, easily the favorite in this match.
Oh, and it's off to a bad start, as the CSIRAC has blown a valve in fear! Meanwhile, the Asus ZenBook 13 dominates the game, the only valve it knows being the company behind Half-Life and Steam, everybody's favorite DRM-riddled storefront.
With the Asus ZenBook 13 running rings around the still-smoking CSIRAC, it's a clear win for the Taiwan and the Asus ZenBook 13.
Final
Taiwan (Asus ZenBook 13 UX331UN) vs USA (Apple IMac G3)
Here we are at the final of TechRadar's World Cup of Computers. Both sides have played spectacularly well in this tournament, and we can tell this is going to be a close game.
The Apple IMac G3's iconic design gives it an early lead, but the ZenBook 13 counters with a slim and light look that makes it an incredibly desirable laptop. The sheer feat of engineering it's taken to cram the powerful components of the ZenBook 13 into such a slim body is a marvel, putting the ZenBook 13 ahead early on in the match.
However, the iMac G3 fights back thanks to just how important the device was in changing Apple's fortunes. If Apple hadn't struck gold with the iMac G3, who knows what the computing landscape would look like these days. While the ZenBook 13 is a great device, it hasn't had the same impact for Asus.
Look at that blue shell. Look at it.
We're getting into the last minutes of the game, and it looks like it could be a tie. However, the ZenBook 13 has one more trick up its sleeve: the future.
While the iMac G3 was a ground-breaking all-in-one PC (which means it is a desktop PC with a built-in monitor), all-in-ones remain a rather niche product.
Meanwhile, the ZenBook 13 represents the future of computers. It's powerful, light and beautifully designed. Ultrabooks like the ZenBook 13 are redefining what we think of when it comes to computers.
It's a risky manoeuvre, but it's paid off, and as the final whistle blows Taiwan – with the Asus ZenBook 13 – is the champion of TechRadar's World Cup of Computers 2018! A very well-deserved winner.
WINNER: Asus ZenBook 13 UX331UN

MULTAN-Caretaker Chief Minister Punjab Dr Hassan Askari has said that the only agenda of caretaker government is holding free and fair elections in the province.
Addressing a meeting of Commissioners and RPOs of Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan and Bahawalpur divisions in connection with upcoming elections here at circuit house on Tuesday, he added that the responsibilities of administration further increased due to increase in the number of polling stations in Punjab. He declared that the enforcement of election code at all polling stations on polling day would be ensured as all out arrangements were being made to maintain law and order on the day. He said that the administration would play key role in holding of free, fair and transparent elections.
Earlier, talking to media at Nishtar Burn Unit, he said that the arrangements for holding free, fair and transparent election are being monitored through media and administration. He said that even play field is offered to the candidates of all political parties to run their election campaign. He declared that the enforcement of election code would be ensured through police and administration. He said that all transfers and postings were approved by the election commission. He disclosed that the election commission itself took action on some election related incidents in different cities. He said that the administration had been directed to resolve all election-related complaints forthwith.
When asked to give his analysis on the upcoming election, the caretaker CM said that his post did not permit him to give any analysis on election at this time. He said that he would be available for analyses and comments after elections.
Speaking on the occasion, caretaker home minister Shaukar Javed said that the security institutions should stay alert in view of prevailing situations. He warned that the chances of terrorism could not be neglected.
Earlier, briefing the chief minister on security, polling arrangements and other issues, the Commissioners and RPOs said that there would be a strict ban on aerial firing and crackers while search operations would continue as per routine. They said that the polling material would be shifted under strict security and surveillance while security would be beefed up at all polling stations and other spots. They said that police patrolling teams would remain active besides deployment of contingents at sensitive spots while arrangements would be made in advance to cope with election day violence.
Rs1b allocated for Nishtar-II in current budget
MULTAN-Caretaker Chief Minister Dr Hassan Askari disclosed on Tuesday that Rs1 billion is allocated in current budget for Nishtar-II project.
He revealed this while visiting Nishtar Hospital. He further disclosed that the re-construction of emergencies of 13 big hospitals of the province is underway and all supply of funds for all ongoing health projects would be ensured. He said that health budget is increased considerably to offer healthcare facilities of international standard. He said that the turnout of patients at hospitals is very high as compared to the number of staff and the government would make efforts to resolve this issue in light of its mandate. He said that the caretaker government had been set up for the holding of free and fair elections and it would not go beyond its mandate. "However, we may develop recommendations for the coming government for long term projects," he informed.
The CM visited emergency, ICU, operation theatres, surgical emergency and other wards. He talked to the patients and inquired about their health.
Doctors' delegation also called on the CM. He assured the doctors that their genuine issues would be resolved in light of law. He said that healthcare was a sacred profession and doctors should fulfil their professional obligations with utmost honesty and dedication.

CHICOPEE - Harry E. Dumay was sworn in as the 11th president of the College of Our Lady of the Elms at a formal inauguration ceremony Friday.
Dumay, who has previously served in senior and executive capacities in higher education finance and administration for 19 years, was selected to head the school in July of 2017 after a nationwide search.
Dumay holds a doctorate in higher education administration from Boston College, as well as an master's in business administration from Boston University, and a master of arts degree in public administration from Framingham State University.
Friday's events included a special Mass at the school, as well as a campus-wide picnic, a dedication ceremony for a new chapel in one of the school's halls, and a post-inauguration reception as well as the annual President's Evening of Appreciation dinner.
Delegates from 45 sister colleges and associations across New England and around the country attended the ceremony. Numbered in the attendees were some of Dumay's former colleagues from Harvard University, Boston University, Boston College, and Saint Anselm College.
Dumay's inaugural address focused on the large contributions of Catholic colleges--discussing the responsibility of the schools to their students as well as to the communities they serve.
"The Catholic intellectual tradition stems in great part from John Henry Newman's exhortation to Catholics in England in his time: 'to cultivate [their] reason, to get an insight into the relation of truth to truth, to understand how faith and reason stand to each other,' " Dumay said.
"[A] strong and active Catholic higher education is our promise to you, our students. We have chosen you because you have met the requirements to be part of our community of teachers and learners. You have chosen us to help you achieve your dreams and aspirations," he said. "You have chosen us because you know that we are prepared to help you unleash your creativity, your passion, your determination to better yourselves and the world."
"This is truly an exciting time to be a part of the Elms, with our new president taking the helm as we enter our 90th anniversary year," said Alumni Association President Jenn Putnam. "With Dr. Dumay's vision and commitment, and all of us working toward a common goal, we can be certain that the Elms will continue to provide leaders for the future of the college and for our society."
"In the first months of Dr. Dumay's tenure, we have witnessed a president who is engaging, approachable, transparent, humble, responsive to the community, committed to the mission, shows a genuine interest in students, faculty, and staff, and is 'present in the moment' in each interaction," said Eileen Kirk, associate director of Campus Ministry, in a speech on behalf of staff and administration.
"On behalf of the students of Elms College, it is an honor and privilege to welcome Dr. Harry Dumay into our college community," said John Dunphy '19. "Dr. Dumay, as we begin this journey together, we look forward to learning from the experiences and wisdom that you bring to our beloved college. Likewise, we are excited to share with you what we treasure most about our community."
The federal Liberal government is spending $4.5 billion to buy Trans Mountain and all of Kinder Morgan Canada's core assets.
A protester holds a photo of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and a representation of the globe covered in oil during a protest against the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion in Vancouver, B.C., on Tuesday May 29, 2018. The federal Liberal government is spending $4.5 billion to buy Trans Mountain and all of Kinder Morgan Canada's core assets, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Tuesday as he unveiled the government's long-awaited, big-budget strategy to save the plan to expand the oilsands pipeline. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck
Outrage over the federal government's announcement about buying the Trans Mountain pipeline to ensure it gets built could fuel unprecedented protests, says a prominent environmentalist who was at the forefront of British Columbia's so-called War in the Woods in the 1990s.
Tzeporah Berman said the fight against the pipeline expansion is even bigger than those over logging in Clayoquot Sound.
Canadians are angry the government is shelling out $4.5 billion to purchase the Trans Mountain pipeline rather than investing in clean energy after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's climate-change promises during the 2015 election and his later commitment to the Paris climate accord, she said.
“My experience is that people are motivated by betrayal, they're motivated by a lack of fairness, they're motivated by a sense of shared common purpose and outrage. In this case we have all of that,” said Berman, who was cleared of aiding and abetting protesters at the Clayoquot blockade and is now an adjunct professor of environmental studies at York University in Toronto.
Berman said the Liberal government “made a very big mistake” by backing Kinder Morgan's project and alienating voters to create “a perfect storm” that would prompt people to take action.
“I think a lot of us who knocked on doors for the Trudeau government really believed them when they said they were going to bring evidence-based analysis and science and democratic process back to pipeline reviews.”

Berman is a director of Stand.earth, one of the groups that organized an anti-pipeline protest in Vancouver on Tuesday after Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the government's plans for the pipeline between Edmonton and Burnaby, B.C. Another protest is planned in Victoria on Thursday.
“My expectation is that the outrage is going to grow and we're not just going it see it here in British Columbia but we're going to see it nationally and internationally,” she said, adding social media makes it possible for activists to connect in ways that didn't exist at the height of anti-logging protests in 1993.
“We didn't have email, we didn't have cellphones. It was a remote location that took most people five to seven hours to get through. This is a pipeline project that runs through urban centres,” she said of Trans Mountain.
Khelsilem, a Squamish Nation council member who goes by his first name, said the federal government's decision to pursue completion of the pipeline expansion threatens Indigenous communities if there was a spill of bitumen from increased tanker traffic in B.C. waters.
“Trudeau had promised during the election that he would create a new environmental process that would protect Indigenous rights and that the Kinder Morgan project would be included and sent back to be done through the new process, and on both those counts he's failed completely,” he said.
Along with multiple legal challenges involving the pipeline, the Squamish Nation and five other First Nations are involved in a Federal Court of Appeal case that targets Ottawa's approval of the project.
“The protesters and the opposition, and the civil disobedience is probably going to increase,” Khelsilem said.
“Our mandate from our people is to continue to defend our rights as a people and to protect our territory, not just for us but for future generations. We're going to continue to stand with our allies that support our Indigenous rights and change the story of Canada, that Canada is no longer a country that disregards Indigenous rights.”

I'm hustling through the Spanish countryside getting a back massage, attacking roundabouts with gusto in a car that can sprint from 0-60 mph in less than five seconds, and my passenger is sound asleep. I'm in a car that won't come to America for more than a year, and it seems to do just about everything well. It's quiet, fast, smooth, spacious, and luxurious. While the car it's replacing is still quite competitive, this car is clearly a leap forward.
I'm in the 2019 Audi A8 60 TFSI, the V-8-powered, 460-horsepower version of Audi's flagship that will likely arrive a few months after the V-6 version. It's a technological tour de force and it doesn't even have all of the goodies that Audi will bring to the table when the A8 goes on sale at the end of next summer.
2019 Audi A8's multi-material spaceframe Enlarge Photo
Vosprung durch technik
So, what enables one car to offer so much capability? As Audi would tell say, it's vorsprung durch technik, or advancement through technology.
Let's start with the structure and chassis. The A8 no longer uses an aluminum spaceframe (truth be told, it was always steel and aluminum). Audi is now employing a multi-media approach that chooses the right material for the right job. The structure is a combination of high-strength steel, aluminum, magnesium, and even carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic. Through the smart use of these materials, the new structure has 24 percent more structural rigidity than the outgoing spaceframe, and it weighs less, though Audi isn't saying how much. The aluminum content is up to 58 percent, and the carbon fiber and magnesium help cut weight, too.
The available suspension technologies are more advanced. The base suspension is an aluminum five-link setup both front and rear with air springs and electrically adjustable dampers. That's pretty advanced right out of the box. From there, buyers will be able to opt for the 48-volt-powered electromechanical Audi AI active suspension that uses electric actuators to press the tires into ruts or pull them up over bumps. The system is tied into a forward-looking camera that can see 66 feet ahead and tell the actuators to raise or lower the wheels and body up to 4.3 inches to mitigate the effects of speed bumps, potholes, or other road imperfections.
On top of that, buyers can get rear-axle steering and an active rear differential to help control rear traction out of a turn. Audi's Dynamic All-Wheel Steering is an especially aggressive system that can turn the rear wheels up to 5 degrees opposite the fronts (3 degrees seems to be the industry standard) at speeds up to 37 mph to make the car rotate and shorten the turning circle to a compact car-like 38.7 feet. At over 37 mph, it turns the rear wheels 2 degrees in concert with the fronts to increase highway stability. This system also includes variable ratio steering that ranges between 9.5:1 at low speeds and about 16:1 at high speeds.
CHECK OUT: 2018 Audi RS 5 first drive review: green with mean
While we're on the hardware, let's look at the rest of the stats. The 2019 A8 will come to the U.S. in only the long-wheelbase A8 L body style, which is 5.1 inches longer than the standard sedan. Compared to the outgoing car, the car we get is 1.5 inches longer and it sits 0.7 inch higher. At 123.2 inches long, the wheelbase is just 0.2 inch longer.
At launch, we will only see one engine. The A8 L 55 TFSI will be powered by the twin-scroll turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 found in Audis like the S5 and SQ5. Here, it will produce 340 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque. That power will be sent through an 8-speed automatic transmission to all four wheels via standard all-wheel drive. Audi quotes a 0-62 mph time of 5.6 seconds.
While it won't come until perhaps a few months after launch, the U.S. will also get the A8 L 60 TFSI, which is motivated by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 making 460 horsepower and 487 lb-ft of torque. No 0-62 mph number has been given, but expect it to be in the 4.7-second range. After all, no V-8 in a flagship sedan is a lost business opportunity.
Both engines are considered mild hybrids because they have a 48-volt electrical system with a belt-alternator/starter, stop/start that works below 13.7 mph, a coasting function that shuts the engine off to save fuel between 34 and 99 mph, and brake energy recuperation.
MUMBAI: A new set of global guidelines on managing diabetes that aim to replace those followed for over three decades, has stirred up a controversy within the medical community.Medical practitioners here in India feel the guidelines which recommend relaxing blood sugar targets will, not only lead to serious complications in diabetics, but also confusion in treatment protocol, advising that these should be ignored for Indians.There were over 72 million cases of diabetes in India in 2017, according to International Diabetes Federation . The controversial guidelines relate to relaxing the long-term blood sugar target, hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), which through a blood test gives an estimate of a person's blood sugar level average over the past few months.Generally, an HbA1c of 6.5% indicates diabetes. American College of Physicians , an organization of internal medicine physicians, recommended recently in the medical journal Annals of Internal Medicine, that clinicians should aim to achieve an HbA1c level between 7% and 8% in most patients with type 2 diabetes, as against the traditional 6.5 to 7% which has been followed over decades.The recommendation is leading to a conflict in views amongst doctors and physicians, with certain associations even opposing it.Doctors here say the guideline of lowering the blood sugar target cannot be binding and should be ignored, as diabetes in India is more aggressive, and hence riddled with complications. They say these recommendations should not be applicable as India has its own as advised by three bodies — ICMR Indian Council of Medical Research ), RSDDI (Research Society For The Study of Diabetes in India) and API ( Association of Physicians of India), which are more tuned in to the Indian diabetic.Anoop Misra chairman of Delhi-based Fortis-C-DOC (Centre of Excellence For Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology) said, “In reality, Indian physicians continue to follow US-based guidelines, hence ACP guidelines may have substantial impact in India. If blood sugar control is loosened (as advised by ACP), more patients in India will suffer from complications, the burden of which is already high. We should ignore these, and stick to previous time-tested glycosylated hemoglobin limit of control of 7%.”Others concur the guidelines cannot be standardized because of several differences in lifestyle, physiology and food habits.
The Bloom/Spiegel Partnership, an alliance between New York's IFP Marcie Bloom Fellowship in Film and Jerusalem's prestigious Sam Spiegel Film School, has selected 8 filmmakers from around the world who will participate in the program's second edition.
This year's participants, Alik Barsoumian, Daliso Leslie, Clare Sackler, Ostin Fam (selected by Bloom), and Dana Blankstein-Cohen, Avishay Kahana, Maya Fischer and Sol Goodman (selected by Sam Spiegel), will spend time with other directors, industry professionals, and attend screenings and events over a period of five days. Tribeca Film Festival provided passes to all participants of the Bloom/Spiegel Partnership.
“We started this program last year as a bit of an experiment and the experience was so inspiring that we have entered into a second year of the partnership. Through this program we seek to expand our community, build international friendships and enrich the next generation of filmmakers,” said Dylan Leiner and Alex Uhlmann, the co-directors of the IFP Marcie Bloom Fellowship in Film.
Barsoumian, a New York-based Armenian-American filmmaker, graduated from NYU and had her thesis film, “Antouni,” premiere at Toronto in 2016. Barsoumian is currently developing a web series set in New York and a feature film set in modern-day rural Armenia.

Born in Zambia and raised in Florida, Leslie is a student of NYU's graduate film department. He received the Spike Film Production Grant for this upcoming thesis film, “White Wedding.” His next film, “Mothers of the Dead” will center on a a black woman whose son was killed by police and who attempts to rebuild her life with the help of his white girlfriend.
Sackler is an American filmmaker who worked in development and production in L.A. before graduating from NYU in 2017. Her short film “Humpty” was recently distributed through PBS's Film School Shorts program. She is currently developing several projects including a science fiction comedy pilot and two feature film comedies — one of which is being written by Todd Bartels and Michael Mitnick and produced by Tanya Wexler and Laura Ivey. Expected to begin shooting New York this Summer, the film will follow a free-spirited woman grappling with the realities of adulthood and long-term commitments as she nears her 30th birthday.
Born in Vietman and based in New York, Fam graduated from Wesleyan University and received the Steven J. Ross Prize for his senior film thesis. Fam is currently finishing the screenplay of his first feature, “Small Wars.” Taking place in a rural village in Vietnam, the story is about a family of three.
Dana Blankstein-Cohen, who graduated from Sam Spiegel Film and Television School with honors in 2008, is the executive director of the Israeli Academy of Film and Television. Her first short “Camping” played at Berlin in 2007. During her studies, Blankstein-Cohen assisted Savi Gabizon on “Nina's Tragedies” and Renen Schorr on “The Loners.”
Avishay Kahana is the content development manager at the Tel Aviv Cinematheque and director of the Kolnoa Darom Film Festival which is dedicated to up and coming Israeli filmmakers. Kahana graduated from the producers track of Sam Spiegel Film School and worked alongside the school's founder, Schorr, on the launch of the Sam Spiegel International Film Lab.
Maya Fischer graduated with honors from Tisch Film School in Tel Aviv and has been associate producer and head of development at leading Israeli outfit Green Production for the last three years. She notably worked on Matan Yair's “Scaffolding” and Eitan Anner's “A Quiet Heart.” Fischer is also studying entertainment and copyright law in Israel.
Sol Goodman, who studied at Sam Spiegel Film School to become producer, is currently working with Oscar-nominated Dror Moreh on an American film. He will have two projects presented at the upcoming Sam Spiegel International Film Lab: “The Taste of Apples is Red” from Ehab Tarabieh, and “The Final Stop,” Nizan Gilady's follow up to “Wedding Doll” which won the best film at Jerusalem Film Festival and earned 9 Israeli Academy Awards nominations.
The Bloom/Spiegel Partnership is backed by the Israeli Film Fund and Tadmor, the NYC based Film and TV financing and production entity.
The IFP Marcie Bloom Fellowship, which just celebrated its 10-year anniversary at the Film Society of Lincoln Center, also announced the launch of a new grant, the Nick Louvel Breakthrough Filmmaker Award.
The young director Cathy Yan, whose “Dead Pigs” won this year's Special Jury Prize at Sundance, is the first recipient of this $5,000 grant. The Award was created to honor the legacy and memory of director Nick Louvel (“Domino One”).
“We are thrilled to give Cathy Yan this award. Her film so skillfully weaves together intersecting narratives to tell the larger story of a fast changing society,” said the Louvel family. “Nick was passionate about every little detail of the filmmaking process and was drawn to telling human stories with empathy and humor, something we see reflected in Cathy Yan's impressive work,” added the Louvel family.
To be fair to Republican leaders, very few of them supported the Trump candidacy for their party's presidential nomination. Their sins were really more of omission than commission. They tolerated the creeping "nativism" first manifested by the Sarah Palin candidacy, and then reinforced by the rise of the Tea Party, now relabelled the Freedom Caucus in Congress. Little by little, Republicans pandered to their most extremist fringe, and then catered to the rise of the "birther" movement, which fuelled the beginning of Donald Trump's campaign for the White House.
It isn't unusual for politicians to be primarily motivated by a desire for survival beyond the next election. The current Republican challenge for those who aren't ensconced in very safe districts is to prevail in party primaries where Donald Trump is supported by some 80 per cent of voters, and then to win general elections where close to two-thirds of people oppose the president. Pleasing both primary and general election voters will require some fancy footwork.
One of the Republican strategies is apparently to distract the public with a series of conspiracy theories with such charges as "witch hunt," "deep state" and "secret societies" in the bureaucracy trying to undermine the Trump administration, even though they are unaccompanied by any serious evidence. We have already seen previous accusations — being illegally wiretapped by President Barack Obama, being victimized by fraudulent voting on a massive scale (three million voters) — fail to be supported by government investigations.
These distractions seem to reflect Donald Trump's fears that the Mueller inquiry will reveal embarrassing evidence on the charges of collusion with the Russians, obstruction of justice in interfering with the investigation, or perhaps even money laundering as suggested by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. Trump's defence has in part consisted of challenging the legitimacy of the media "an enemy of the state," and many government institutions including the courts, the State Department, the CIA and most recently the FBI. With his charges of "fake news," he has also successfully cast doubt an any general agreement on what constitutes objective truth.
Donald Trump's pattern of ignoring the traditional norms of presidential behaviour seems to be part of his life experience. He grew up rich, inherited money to develop his business, and as a private family firm has never had to answer to an independent board of directors or anyone else. There is an abundance of stories of how he has bluffed and bullied his way through life, and a series of questionable business practices including bankruptcies and failures. He has surrounded himself with yes-men and acolytes, and his approach to government hasn't changed since his business days. Trump's obsession appears to be staff loyalty to him personally, rather than to the constitution and the law.
Among the recent crises that have been generated to perpetuate the aura of chaos in Washington has been a government shutdown, the threat of firing the Special Prosecutor, the demonization of the FBI, the Steve Wynn scandal, Trump's ugly comments about Third World nations and the payoff to Stormy Daniels. In other times, any of these matters would have some lasting impact, but in Trumpland, a scandal a day keeps the media and investigators off balance.
While the confusion continues, the policy focus has moved to the immigration issue. The Democrats who advocated legal status for Dreamers that were brought to America as children, have long opposed Trump's demand for a wall along the Mexican border as ineffective and a waste of money. However after seeing the tax cut bill add $1.5 trillion to the debt, it is difficult to get excited about the $25 billion involved. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has signalled he could be agreeable to this, but Trump has indicated additional requests for the elimination of an immigration lottery program, and the end of family sponsorship, or as he calls it "chain migration."
There are still looming obstacles to this deal that have not been fully recognized if a compromise formula is to be found acceptable to both left wing Democrats in the Senate and right wing Republicans in the House of Representatives. Members of the Freedom Caucus have already denounced the granting of amnesty to Dreamers.
That the status of Dreamers is in jeopardy at all, is a result of Trump's decision last September to place a deadline on Congress to resolve the matter by March 5. The previous Democratic threat to shut down the government was used to address this matter, but a congressional failure to find compromise, could be ameliorated by the president extending the deadline.

NEW HAVEN, Conn. -- Former Yale basketball captain Jack Montague, who was expelled from the Ivy League school in 2016 for sexual misconduct, has enrolled at Belmont University in Tennessee.
Montague, who is a Tennessee native, is still suing to be readmitted to Yale. He complained in a court deposition last spring that he was unable to apply to other schools. He said Yale would not release his transcript until he paid a disputed tuition bill.
Karen Schwartzman, a spokeswoman for Montague, says Yale later released the transcript, allowing Montague to enroll at Belmont this fall. She says not all of his credits transferred and he will need two semesters to graduate. He exhausted his basketball eligibility at Yale.
Montague denies the sexual misconduct allegations. No criminal charges were ever sought.
Yale's attorneys have said the school and its officials acted appropriately.
The lawsuit, which also seeks monetary damages, is expected to go to trial next year.

The trouble, of course, is that when people admire the achievements of autocracies, they are usually thinking of the achievements of tiny Singapore, or perhaps Shanghai. They aren't thinking about the more impoverished regions of rural China, and they certainly aren't thinking about Zimbabwe — a country that has nevertheless applied its version of the Chinese model consistently for four decades.
During most of that time, the country's unchallenged leader was Robert Mugabe, now 93 and, as of Tuesday, under house arrest after what appears to have been a coup (though the military is calling it a “bloodless correction”). Mugabe has been using Marxist and Maoist language since he first became a guerrilla fighter in the 1960s, battling against the white minority government of what was then called Southern Rhodesia. When he finally became leader in 1980, he expressly followed the Chinese example, using terrorism against opponents, nationalizing land and industry, carrying out purges described as “cultural revolutions.”
Later, he began to use the more modern-sounding language of state capitalism — one recent document spoke of “indigenization” instead of “nationalization” and called for the “establishment of a Results Based Government that seeks to optimise utilisation of scarce resources.” But the effect was the same. Zimbabwe's government — top-down, carefully planned, “safely” and “predictably” led by the same person for decades — led the country into utter disaster.
In March 2008, Mugabe used violence to “win” the second round of an election he had lost in the first round. In November 2008, Zimbabwe had 79.6 billion percent inflation, probably the second-highest in history. Nowadays, banks barely function. Shortages are rife. One of Africa's better-off countries is now one of its poorest. Last spring, Evan Mawarire, the pastor of a church in Harare, draped himself in his country's flag and made a heartbreaking, patriotic video calling for an end to corruption and poverty. Protests followed; Mawarire was arrested. Mugabe remained in charge.
Without some element of democracy, without a means of recognizing the existence of other leaders and parties, without some way of legally managing a change of power, it seemed impossible to remove him. Without some element of economic freedom and rule of law, only those with insider connections could prosper. The army's intervention appears to have been the last chance: Mugabe was believed to be preparing to hand over power to his widely loathed wife.
The intervention may or may not end well. I asked one Zimbabwean in the diaspora how he felt about the coup, and he shrugged: “Anything is an improvement.” But the reassertion of an identical political system, this time with a different strongman on top, won't bring real change. The only long-term hope is some form of power sharing, some form of economic decentralization, some opportunity for small businesses to thrive and ideas to be exchanged. The belief that authoritarianism is necessary for development led Zimbabwe, like so many other countries, into a dead end. If it's tried again, it will eventually happen again, too.
Plenty of fans were surprised when the New York Rangers' pre-trade deadline selloff in February didn't include forward Mats Zuccarello.
Following management's stated desire to trade off assets and rebuild the club, speculation swirled about how many suitors there would be for the diminutive but offensively talented Norwegian before the deadline. Invaluable to the Rangers during their years of Stanley Cup contention, he seemed a perfect trade target for a contender who craved the scoring and energy Zuccarello provides.
The question wasn't if he would be traded but when and for what? The discussion focused on what he was worth: a second-round pick and a prospect, or a first-rounder? Then the deadline passed and the beloved Zucc kept his Blueshirt, unlike so many of his veteran teammates who were shipped off in deals for future assets.
Though it might have stunned some, the reality was that Zuccarello was more likely to remain a Ranger than depart; the reason being that his contract and a down season could have scared off potential trade partners.
The eight-year veteran wasn't a rental player, with one season remaining on the four-year deal he signed in March 2015. At an annual average value of $4.5 million, Zucc's contract was considered below market value when he inked it in lieu of testing free agency, wanting to stay with the club he helped reach the Stanley Cup Final in 2013-14 and that would go on to capture the Presidents' Trophy and make it to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Final in 2014-15.
Any team acquiring Zuccarello would have received two potential playoff runs at a reasonable rate, a major selling point. Even with the workable AAV, though, it's possible that no team wanted to commit to that $4.5 million cap hit next season, especially when Zuccarello's play didn't measure up to his usual standards.
Zuccarello's Production, Intensity Dropped in 2017-18
Whether it was the mood that hung over the team due to the Rangers' stated mission to rebuild, their general ineptitude on the ice later in the season or a combination of the two, Zuccarello simply wasn't as good offensively. Though he did record 16 goals and 37 assists, the excellent passing and timely scoring seemed absent too often, and he wasn't the same force on the power play.
Zuccarello, who had scored 12 power-play goals over the previous two seasons, often operating from his trademark spot low on the right side, managed one in 2017-18. He recorded 17 points with the man advantage but the low number of power-play goals likely hurt his value in trade talks.
More importantly, his energy, intensity and often extremely irritating presence against opponents appeared to be missing far too often. Driving bigger players crazy and then scoring or setting up goals against them has been Zuccarello's ticket to success since he arrived in the NHL in 2010-11 and he slowly but steadily developed into an unlikely star. A plus-55 over the previous five seasons, Zucc was a minus-10 in 2017-18.
Now many are demanding that he be traded this offseason, perhaps at the draft. The idea is to leverage every important veteran asset as part of the Rangers' rebuild. Doing so, however, could end up being a rash decision and, ultimately, a mistake. If a deal arrives that's to the Rangers' liking they should, by all means, pull the trigger but the right call could be not to rush it and carry him into next season.
There's risk in keeping Zuccarello and hoping he rebounds with a strong effort that rebuilds his value. Could he be declining, given that his point totals have dropped in each of the past two seasons? If that proves to be the case and he stays with the team into next season, the Rangers might end up having to settle for even less in return at the deadline than they might have gotten for him during 2017-18 or this offseason.
Betting on a bounce-back season, however, might be the better move. If he can return to form under new coach David Quinn, he'll be an even more attractive rental trade chip with his contract set to expire and no financial commitment beyond 2018-19.
The Rangers have executed their teardown strategy about as well as could be hoped for but there's no reason to rush into turning every tradeable veteran player into draft picks just because a rebuild is underway. The mission is to build for the long-term; as such, every bit of future value that can be squeezed from the current roster doesn't need to arrive immediately.
If the Blueshirts did, in fact, receive offers for Zuccarello before the deadline and refused to jump at one because they didn't care for the terms, good for them.
Rangers Need to be Patient in Trading Zucc
If that was the case, they should continue to exercise the same restraint this offseason. They shouldn't get caught up in the potential flurry of deals at the draft next month and move him just to move him; they need to be willing to play the long game for his value. Players believed to be the missing piece to a Stanley Cup run are highly coveted just before the trade deadline, more so than during the offseason.
The potential for a rebound in Zuccarello's value is realistic. Rick Nash went on a pre-deadline surge this season, scoring nine goals in 16 games immediately before being traded to the Boston Bruins on Feb. 25. The Rangers received a haul that included a 2018 first-round pick, defense prospect Ryan Lindgren, forward Ryan Spooner and a 2019 seventh-rounder for a player that's clearly past his prime. Nash's timely scoring binge had plenty to do with the high-value return, not to mention the level of interest.
It's doubtful that Zuccarello would be as sought after as Nash was but, who knows? If Michael Grabner was worth a second-round pick and a defensive prospect from the New Jersey Devils, the Blueshirts should be looking for at least a first-rounder in return.
Maximizing his trade value – and that's what he represents at this point to a club that's getting younger – might require rolling the dice on a player who meant so much to them when they were chasing the Cup not that long ago, and holding off on dealing him for while. If that strategy proves successful, and Zuccarello has a resurgent season that sets the Rangers up to move a coveted player to a contender next year, then discussions about a high return for him could end up becoming reality in 2019.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - British Trade Minister Liam Fox said on Friday it would be very difficult for Britain to remain in any kind of customs union with the European Union after Brexit.
“It is very difficult to see how being in a customs union is compatible with having an independent trade policy because we would therefore be dependent on what the EU negotiated in terms of its trading policies and we'd be following behind that,” Fox told Bloomberg TV in China.
“We have to be outside of that to take advantage of those growing markets. One of the reasons we are leaving the European Union is to take control and that's not possible with a common external tariff.”

Talkback: Mark Young talks about Vice Mayor Gene Gallo's tragic loss of his wife
His two-goal output against Dallas gave him 43, tying him with boyhood idol Alex Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals.
Laine's racked up 68 points in 72 games and is riding a league-high 15-game point streak (18 goals, eight assists), which is already an NHL record for longest point streak by a teenager. He turns 20 on April 19.
After the game, Laine repeated that he wants to grab the goal-scoring lead and will try when Winnipeg (43-19-10) hosts Los Angeles on Tuesday.
While words like that could come across as cocky, that's not the case with Laine.
He always honestly assesses the good and bad parts of his game and stresses his ultimate goal is helping the Jets get into the playoffs.
His candid responses to questions have become as much a trademark as his one-timer blasts from the left circle. It hasn't gone unnoticed by his admiring teammates.
"He's mature," veteran forward Bryan Little said. "You forget how old he is.
"When he's on the ice, he plays mature and he handles himself like a veteran. He doesn't seem to care about all the outside noise and all the pressure and stuff. He just plays."
Little is also impressed with Laine's ability to live his life under the spotlight.
"He knows he's got a responsibility because he's so good, because he's a rising star in this league," he said. "He does it without complaint."
While team staff monitor the amount of interviews and events he's part of so it's not too disruptive, no one tries to curb his candour.
"I think that would be just like stupid to say to somebody to don't be yourself. That's just who I am," Laine said.
"I mean, I don't need to lie to you (reporters). If you guys ask me something, I just want to say how it is. I don't feel like I have to make something up or just say whatever."
His media availability has been restricted to the rink and not places such as his home. Laine has also put the kibosh on interviews with his family.
His mom lives with him in Winnipeg, but she recently went back to Finland to be with his sister so his dad is now here. The whole family and his girlfriend plan to be here soon to hopefully watch the team's playoff run.
"I'm the athlete, I can answer all the questions," Laine explained. "I don't feel like I have to bring my family to the media. They're just in the background."
His confidence in himself is perhaps most evident in a physical way. His friendly bet with a cousin to see how long they can grow beards this season has drawn jabs on social media and teasing from his teammates.
"It's got uglier and uglier," Little said with a smile of the scruffy beard. "When he finally shaves it he's going to look like a new man."
That may not happen any time soon with the way his season is clipping along. Keeping the beard might even turn into a superstitious habit.
"Who knows?" Laine said with a laugh. "Let's see where we're at in a month or a couple more months. It might be a good thing, but we'll see."

The Bears Ears National Monument is located to the east of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and to the south of Canyonlands National Park.
It has more than 100,000 Native American cultural and archaeological sites and is regarded as one of the most significant archaeological areas in the United States.
“This beautiful piece of land stretches for over a million acres of land across the southern edge of the state. Its ancient cliff dwellings, ceremonial sites, abundant rock art, countless cultural artifacts, winding creek beds, and expanses of desert land, contain the great history of my nation,” Begaye wrote on a White House website.
“The Bears Ears region faced urgent threats from looting, vandalism, and energy development,” Navajo Nation Council Delegate Walter Phelps said in 2016.
“In addition to cementing his “profound record” on conservation, Obama also continued his effort to give Native Americans a voice,” Begaye said.
However, Utah's governor and its Congressional delegation vow to fight the Obama designation.
San Juan County Commissioner Rebecca Benally, the only tribal member on the commission, is at odds with most Navajo Utah chapters and opposes any option that gives the federal government control over local land.
She doesn't “support any movement to convert our sacred lands to a monument that will ultimately be controlled by bureaucrats unfamiliar with our history and traditional ways.”
Utah Dine Bike'yah has been working for the monuments for six years, said group chairman Willie Grayeyes.
“This is a very important moment,” he said.
A bill introduced in the House of Representatives last year sought to bar Obama from designating public land in specific counties – including the ones where Bears Ears is located.
Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva sought to remove the language but lost a tight 225-202 vote.
The president has had the power to preserve public land since the 1906
Bears Ears, named for the twin buttes that thrust above the horizon, is home to a diverse southwestern landscape that includes red-rock formations, mountain peaks, sandstone canyons, and piñon- juniper mesas.
islamabad - Higher Education Commission (HEC) is set to formally conduct the first aptitude test for admissions in undergraduate programs of universities; however, it has sought the support of institutions for the successful launch, an official said on Wednesday.
All the vice chancellors, rectors and heads of public and private universities have been formally notified seeking their confirmation on allowing HEC-backed ‘Education Testing Council' (ETC) to arrange the test during the fall semester of this year.
The HEC testing service will be free-of-cost for students and will arrange admission test in five categories while the registration process will be online, the official added.
The notification issued in this regard stated, “As announced at the ETC commencement ceremony and approved in first meeting of the council held on May 06, 2017, the ETC will be launching tests for admission to undergraduate programs from Fall 2017, during first half of July 2017 initially in five broad categories viz. engineering, medical, basic & natural sciences, management sciences and social sciences, arts and humanities.
The tests would be conducted by ETC in all major cities of Pakistan within higher education institutions in most professional and transparent manner, registration process will be online and choice will be given to students for selection of test centre.”
Meanwhile, HEC has also sought the support of institutions in adoption of the ETC along with adoption of the testing service. HEC has also asked universities to nominate a focal person and provide infrastructure facilities in the institutions.
The notification also said, “HEC seeks your kind and urgent support to confirm adoption of the ETC Aptitude Test for admission to undergraduate programs from fall 2017 in your institution.
HEC also solicit support of the university in authorizing use of university infrastructure and services for conducting the tests and will appreciate your nominating a responsible focal person for future direct contact in the matter.”
HEC has addressed the institutions that in pursuance of the powers vested under Section-1091) (n) of the Higher Education Commission Ordinance, HEC has established ‘Education Testing Council' (ETC) w.e.f January 25, 2017.
The initiative was undertaken on the advice of the government of Pakistan to relieve students and their parents from taking multiple recruitment tests and charge of fee for each test separately, and providing free-of-cost, uniform, standardised, competitive and accessible assessment tests for admission to universities and degree awarding institutions across Pakistan.
Since commencement of the council, the ETC has successfully conducted tests for over 100,000 students for different HEC's indigenous and overseas scholarship programs, states the letter.
Meanwhile, academic circles have expressed their concerns on the launch of testing service by HEC.
Talking to The Nation, a Vice Chancellor (VC) who wished anonymity declared the launch of testing service a clean violation of HEC Act after the decision of Lahore High Court (LHC), which directed the regulatory body to work under Council of Common Interest (CCI).
“HEC is overstepping from its constitutional role and interference in the autonomy of the universities by directing them to must adopt this service in given time,” he said.
He said it will not be possible for universities to adopt the service in such less time.
“Conducting free-of-cost test is a positive step but it could have been done through universities,” he said.
Dr Shehzad Ashraf, President Islamabad chapter, Federation All Pakistan University Academic Staff Association (FAPUASA) said that HEC is taking such steps only to consolidate more power; however, its role has been limited after the 18th amendment.
“It is not HEC's responsibility to select and shortlist the students for universities,” said Dr Shehzad.
He also stated HEC would take the admission testing fee from government and would have given the funds to universities to conduct such tests free-of-cost.
Earlier, National Testing Service (NTS) had also expressed concerns over the launch of ETC declaring it against the mandate of HEC.
However, students are encouraging the ‘free-of-cost' service as they do not have to pay for admission tests repeatedly.
TEGA CAY, S.C. (AP) - An anonymous person dropped a single gold coin worth about $1,200 in a Salvation Army kettle in South Carolina.
Multiple media outlets report the one-ounce South African Krugerrand was dropped into a Salvation Army kettle during a fundraising drive at a Walmart store in Tega Cay.
The coin will likely be sold to a jeweler's store with proceeds going to Salvation Army programs.
Mike McGee of the Salvation Army in Rock Hill says a typical kettle fundraiser will raise about $300 a day.

Not long ago, I wrote a column about Lil Pump, the gleefully obnoxious teenage Florida rapper who was a big part of the new wave of SoundCloud rap stars. Pump had made a series of short, lo-fi SoundCloud singles, all of which became huge cult hits and all of which were somehow deeply annoying and deeply catchy and the same time. Up until now, Pump's entire discography has been nothing but SoundCloud singles. But today, he came out with his self-titled debut mixtape, which means we can now hear how he sounds in a full-length context. It's about how you'd expect: Lots of energy, absolutely no conventional rap skills, and the whole thing feels pretty long even though it's just 37 minutes. Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz, Rick Ross, Chief Keef, Lil Yachty, and Smokepurrp all make appearances. Listen to it below.
The self-released Lil Pump is out now.

It is the New Year 2017. The world now harks back to the beginning of civilization and culture and agriculture itself looking back to the times of Cain and Abel, gathering fruit from the forests and tending to animals organically. The concept of “food forests” and “analog forestry” is getting popular as the era of chemicals-based “industrial agriculture” and “battery farms” recedes to the background.
I first heard of the concept of analog forest in September 2009 from Kamal Melvani, a diminutive lady with big ideas. She is a Mumbai bred Sri Lankan of Gujarati origin. Kamy, as she is popularly known, was making a presentation at the South Asia Convention on Outstanding Organic Agriculture Technologies conducted jointly by the Goa-based Organic Farming Association of India (OFAI) and the Government of India's Ghaziabad-based National Centre of Organic Farming (NCOF) at the University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS) in Bengaluru. An analog forest has trees, shrubs, creepers, grasses and herbs just as in a forest but the analog forest also provides fruits, fibres, cereals, pulses and vegetables in a planned way. That is how the name ‘food forest' cropped up. Call it mainstreaming of organic agriculture or introduction of University faculty to organic agriculture, the dual-edged objective of validating organic agriculture practices and popularising them in the academia was achieved. There has been no looking back. We now not only have ‘Research Institutes in Organic Farming' (RIOF) at UAS-Begaluru and Dharwad but even an undergraduate program at Don Bosco College of Agriculture (DBCA), Sulcorna-Goa that is focused on organic practices. Four students, three of the first batch and one in his first year of BSc (Agri) course, have even researched, analysed data and submitted papers for the 19th Organic World Congress to be held in Noida in November, 2017.
The UAS-Bengaluru has a project on Jack fruit, a crop that has been identified as climate change resilient and an insurance against hunger. With scientific back-up, it has been possible to test, evaluate and standardise various products from jack fruit vegetable, vegan chicken, chips, pulp, milk-shakes, panas-poli, satt or jack leather, burfi, modak, pedda, jam, jelly and wine to gluten-free seed flour and caffeine – free malted seed coffee or Jaffee. Grafting techniques have been standardised and skills transferred to nurserymen so that named varieties of Jack can be made available for large-scale plantations. Grafts are available even in Goa. The Goa Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI), the National Bank for Agricultural Refinance & Development (NABARD) and the Western Ghats Kokum Foundation (WGKF) are jointly organising an advanced workshop on jack fruit and kokum for those who attended the seminar last March. The aim is to get the industry to take-off on jack processing on a higher scale in Goa and the Konkan.
Have a great year ahead. We will rediscover the Jack for all tastes.
The Tennessee Titans will let their starting quarterback decision linger until right before Sunday's game against the Miami Dolphins.
Marcus Mariota, who has been limited in practice all week with a left hamstring strain, will be listed as questionable for Sunday. Titans head coach Mike Mularkey said whether the QB plays will be a game-time decision that will involve Mariota, himself, the training staff and the front office. They'll have to balance being safe with their franchise quarterback and letting him play in a limited pocket passer role. There's no secret which way Mariota wants this to go.
"If I'm able to move around, hand the ball off and able to drop back, I'll definitely play," said Mariota, who said he would want to play if the game was Friday.
Mariota hasn't tested his hamstring in that capacity during practice this week. He's gradually done more every day this week, but most of his work has consisted of throwing intermediate passes in individual drills before going inside for rehab while Matt Cassel leads the first-team offense.

Cassel will start if Mariota can't play. The Titans believe a week of receivers building chemistry with Cassel will help tremendously if he has to play Sunday. The Titans' second half against the Raiders with Cassel under center wasn't pretty. Brandon Weeden would be active as Cassel's backup if Mariota was out.
The Titans have used the phrase "we're being safe" a few times in regards to Mariota, but the quarterback acknowledged it would be tough for him to sit out if he feels he can fulfill basic quarterback responsibilities.
"My first and foremost goal is to get healthy," Mariota said. "If I am able to play, I'd love to play."
At practice, Mariota didn't look like a quarterback who would start on Sunday, but running back DeMarco Murray didn't miss a game after suffering a similar hamstring injury earlier this season.
The Titans' stated uncertainty It also doesn't help the Dolphins, who prepared this week for Mariota and Cassel.
"He's got a lot of starts, a lot of wins," Mularkey said of Cassel, who has a 36-44 record as a starter. "We're confident in Matt."
A handful of cities could soon face a legal showdown with the Trump administration over their efforts to open "supervised injection facilities" where drug addicts can shoot up with powerful illegal drugs while trained personnel stand by to prevent fatal overdoses.
In an effort to stem its growing opioid death rate, San Francisco is slated to open the nation's first two publically authorized injection facilities in July. Philadelphia and Seattle are also pursuing similar sites — even as President Trump called again for the death penalty for major drug dealers on Monday.
Other large cities like Denver and New York City and even smaller towns, like Ithaca, NY, have considered the facilities as well. The Massachusetts Medical Society and the Massachusetts Health & Hospital Association want a pilot facility in their state too.
Research on injection sites around the world have found they prevent fatal overdoses and reduce the spread of infectious diseases like Hepatitis C and HIV by providing sterile needles and equipment. They also connect drug users with counseling, treatment and other services — without increasing area drug trafficking and other crime, studies have found.

Armed with naloxone to reverse overdoses, injection facility staff provide a lifesaving backstop to addicts whose stash may be tainted with lethal fentanyl, said Taeko Frost, western regional director at the Harm Reduction Coalition in Oakland.
“They can see immediately, before a person has fallen unconscious, they can see the signs of an overdose happening and administer oxygen (or naloxone) or help someone stand up and walk around," Frost said.
As more cities and health experts, including the American Medical Association, embrace this novel approach to the opioid crisis, their efforts face a major legal hurdle: the Drug Enforcement Administration says the injection sites would violate federal drug laws. That would allow federal prosecutors to potentially shut them down.
By being in illegal possession of controlled substances, every user who visits an injection site would violate drug-possession provisions of the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, said Katherine Pfaff, a DEA spokesperson. And the sites themselves would violate the law's “crack house statute” that prohibits the use of a location to manufacture, store, distribute or use controlled substances, Pfaff said.
The dilemma reflects a philosophical crossroads for U.S. drug policy. President Donald Trump — who again on Monday called for the death penalty for major drug dealers — is holding fast to a punitive drug policy characterized by the decades-old “war on drugs.”
“This is about winning a very, very tough problem. And if we if you don't get very tough on these dealers, it's not going to happen," Trump said at a press briefing in New Hampshire on Monday.
Critics, however, say the get-tough approach has failed to reduce drug usage, while swelling U.S. prisons with non-violent drug offenders.
Drug addiction and medical experts, frustrated by runaway overdose deaths from heroin, carfentanil and other opioids, are embracing more evidenced-based, public health solutions — like supervised injection facilities — to address the problem.
Insite, an injection facility in Vancouver, British Columbia, says it has supervised more than 3.6 million drug injections since 2003, resulting in "6,440 overdose interventions without any deaths," according to their website.
In fact, none of the world's 100-plus sites where drug consumption is supervised have reported a single overdose death in over 30 years, Frost said.
Despite that track record, it's unclear how Attorney General Jeff Sessions will respond to the growing push for supervised injection facilities in the U.S. The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.
Last year, however, Sessions told federal prosecutors to seek the maximum penalty for all crimes, including drug crimes. And Sessions has been unfriendly to even legalized marijuana efforts in some states.
“So it strikes me as more likely than not that (Sessions) would not be supportive of safe injection facilities. But you never know for sure,” said Alex Kreit, a law professor and drug policy expert at Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego.
While Sessions might personally oppose the facilities, he could let local U.S. attorneys decide how best to deal with an injection facility in their jurisdiction.
"That's totally possible,” said Kreit. “It's also possible that Sessions says ‘This is a terrible thing. I'm going to issue a directive advising all U.S. attorneys to try and shut these down.'”
The Controlled Substances Act may provide a loophole for jurisdictions worried about injection sites violating federal law, Kreit added. He said the CSA provides immunity to state and local officials who violate the federal law while enforcing another state or local law. It's designed to protect undercover officers who may purchase, use or handle drugs during a sting operation.
If staff at a supervised injection site worked for a state or local government entity, "I think there's a very, very strong argument that (the immunity provision) would apply" to those workers and the facility itself, Kreit said.
If a non-profit organization ran the injection site — as Philadelphia is proposing — the state or local government would have to deputize facility employees as "agents" of the city in order to claim the immunity protection, Kreit said.
"But it would be a tougher (legal) road to climb" to make that argument, he added.
The first international injection facility opened in Switzerland in 1986. Since then, countries throughout Europe, along with Australia and Canada, have established "safe injection rooms" or "drug consumption rooms" where addicts can inject their drugs use sterile equipment in a safe environment rather in public restrooms, alleys and parks.
In San Francisco, where local police support the injection site proposal as a public health measure, city leaders are undaunted by the prospect of federal interference.
“We are not waiting to take action to save more lives,” said Rachael Kagan, spokesperson for the city's public health department.
Needle exchange programs were also illegal and controversial when they made their U.S. debut in San Francisco in 1988, Kagan said. They're now commonplace in many cities and are recognized as the gold standard for helping reduce HIV infections.
Other federal prosecutors have already taken a hard line. After a local study commission recommended an injection site in Chittendem County, Vt., Christina E. Nolan, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Vermont, issued a blistering statement in opposition.
Nolan said the sites are “counterproductive and dangerous” and would “encourage and normalize” heroin use. That could increase demand for the drug and the risk of overdose deaths, she said.
“Such facilities would also threaten to undercut existing and future prevention initiatives by sending exactly the wrong message to children in Vermont: (that) the government will help you use heroin,” Nolan's statement said. “In short, opiate addicts need treatment, not a place to continue using.”
Philadelphia Health Commissioner Tom Farley said addicts need both. And for Nolan to suggest “that we can only do one or the other is foolish,” Farley said. “Of course, we can do both.”
Farley is working to find a private group to fund an injection site in Philadelphia, which logged 1,200 overdose deaths in 2017. He said the sites would serve a small sub-group of opioid addicts who shoot up multiple times a day “and despite all that we do, are not going into treatment. We want to keep them alive long enough to get them into treatment,” Farley said.
He's hoping Louis D. Lappen, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, will use his enforcement discretion to let a Philadelphia site operate without federal intervention. Local police and prosecutors have already backed the plan, Farley said.
“I believe, and the rest of the people in Philadelphia believe, that the U.S. attorney for this region has better things to do than to prevent us from saving lives,” Farley said. “I can't predict what the U.S. attorney will do, but we're here saving lives. So we think we should be allowed to do that.”
In a statement, Lappen said his office is focused on prosecuting “large scale suppliers, street level distributors, and medical professionals who abuse their position to contribute” to (the opioid) crisis. “With these critical priorities in mind, we will consider all individual facts and circumstances to determine whether it is in the best interests of the District to use its limited resources to prosecute a particular case,” Lappen wrote.
In Seattle, U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes was a non-voting member of a local task force that called for creating two injection sites. But Hayes has “not been involved in any steps taken by the county and/or the city to implement” that recommendation, said a statement from her office.
Because they also refer people to drug treatment and other services, the injection facilities are often said to provide “supervised consumption services.” In Philadelphia, they'd be called Comprehensive User Engagement Sites, or CUES.
But not all public health experts are ready to commit to the concept.
An injection site in Baltimore would prevent six overdose deaths, 21 hepatitis C infections and save the city some $7.8 million a year by eliminating 108 overdose-related ambulance calls, 78 emergency room visits and 27 hospitalizations, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.
But Baltimore Health Commissioner Leanna Wen said in a statement that the city's public health agency is too dependent on federal money to pursue injection sites, despite “growing evidence,” that they reduce overdoses.
“We cannot take an action that would jeopardize our federal funding,” Wen's statement said. “We require guidance from the Department of Justice about the legality of these sites.”
In California, it's unclear what response a San Francisco injection site would elicit from Alex G. Tse, acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California.
“I don't think anybody's quite certain what will happen,” said Frost, of the Harm Reduction Coalition in Oakland. “I think that people are taking a calculated risk by introducing this intervention” because the consequences of not doing so are already apparent.
Rather than the threat of legal action, Frost said “the thing that is more threatening to people on the ground is the risk of overdose and the loss of lives that we are seeing.”
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and high-ranking North Korean official Kim Yong Chol enter a second day of meetings in New York on Thursday as they try to settle nuclear weapons disagreements and set the stage for an historic summit between their two leaders.
The two men left a 90-minute private dinner at a New York apartment on Wednesday night without providing details about their conversation. Another round of talks was scheduled for Thursday, with Pompeo expected to leave New York that afternoon.
The United States has been demanding that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program amid reports that it is close to being able to launch a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States.
Pyongyang has long argued that it needed nuclear weapons for its security.
There were reports earlier on Wednesday that South Korean officials were noting “quite significant” differences between the United States and North Korea over denuclearisation.
The New York meetings follow high-level conversations Pompeo held in North Korea in April and earlier in May and are intended to get negotiations between the two long-time adversaries back on track.
U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had been scheduled to hold an unprecedented summit in Singapore on June 12. Disputes between Washington and Pyongyang led Trump to cancel the meeting, only to see a renewal of diplomatic efforts in recent days.

Kim Yong Chol, a close aide of Kim Jong-un and vice chairman of the ruling Workers' Party's Central Committee, is the most senior North Korean official to meet top U.S. officials for talks in the United States in nearly two decades.
In return for giving up its nuclear weapons, Washington could potentially loosen sanctions on Pyongyang, leading to possible food and other aid to impoverished North Korea and improved ties with South Korea.
A senior State Department official briefed reporters separately as Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol met late on Wednesday. The official, who asked not to be identified, said North Korea is “going to have to make clear what they are willing to do” in response to Washington's demands.
Trump, the official said, “can make a fly or no-fly decision anytime he wants,” referring to the possible Singapore summit.
If not enough progress is made to lead to a productive meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-un, the official said, “we will ramp up the pressure on them and we'll be ready for the day that hopefully they are ready.”

The two Koreas have technically been at war for decades, even though the Korean War's military combat ended in 1953, because a peace agreement was never signed.
On Saturday, Chance the Rapper served as the grand marshal of Chicago's annual Bud Billiken Parade, which supports the education of the city's youth. The procession was followed by a free surprise concert by the MC featuring special guest performers Future and Jeremih and a “cameo” by fellow hometown hero Barack Obama.
The former president delivered a powerful message to the audience via a prerecorded video, which was projected on screens throughout the concert venue. “I wanted to just have the chance to say to all of you that the Bud Billiken parade stands for so much of what our community is about,” he said (via Rolling Stone).
“We want to make sure our kids are safe, we want to make sure that they are ready to go back to school. We want to make sure that we are nurturing and protecting and encouraging and loving the next generation of leaders all throughout the city of Chicago. So Chance, I'm grateful for everything that you've done on behalf of the young people back home.”
Watch footage of the speech up above.
Chance has long been a supporter of the city's young community, most recently donating $1 million to public schools in the area. He and the Obamas also have a long history together; he was invited to Obama's last White House State Dinner, the 2016 National Christmas Tree Lighting, and the last White House party. Most recently, former First Lady Michelle Obama honored Chance at the BET Awards in June. To coincide with this weekend's Bud Billiken Parade, he gave away 30,000 backpacks full of school supplies.
CHICAGO -- The Baltimore Orioles have placed slugging first baseman Chris Davis on the 10-day disabled list because of a strained right oblique.
The Orioles announced the move before Wednesday's game against the Chicago White Sox.

Davis left Monday's loss to Chicago after hitting a fly to right with the bases loaded in the third inning. He is batting .226 with 14 homers and 26 RBI.
The Orioles also selected infielder David Washington's contract from Triple-A Norfolk and transferred outfielder Anthony Santander from the 10-day to the 60-day DL because of a strained right forearm.
The alt-right rally at Texas A&M University scheduled to be hosted September 11 by white nationalist Richard Spencer has been cancelled.
According to A&M spokesperson, 9/11 white lives matter event has been canceled. Story to come soon. — The Battalion (@TheBattOnline) August 14, 2017
In a press release Monday, the university cited safety concerns as the main reason.
“After consultation with law enforcement and considerable study, Texas A&M is cancelling the event scheduled by Preston Wiginton at Rudder Plaza on campus on September 11 because of concerns about the safety of its students, faculty, staff, and the public,” the university said in a press release.
Spencer was behind the white supremacy “Unite the Right” rally at the University of Virginia Saturday that ended in one person killed and 19 more injured after a participant ran his car into a group of counter-protesters.
Spencer had been invited to TAMU by Wiginton, a Texan with deep ties to white nationalist movements and the man who brought him there once before, in Dec. 2016, according to The Texas Tribune. Spencer accepted the invitation and planned to speak at a “White Lives Matter Rally” at TAMU September 11.
Wiginton, who briefly attended TAMU, said he and his lawyers will seek legal action regarding the cancelation, according to The Battalion, the TAMU student newspaper.
“What they've said is the first amendment doesn't apply to white people,” Wiginton told The Battalion. “We are in a new era of civil rights, and it will be white people fighting for their rights.”
Spencer used legal means to go forward with a speech at Auburn University last April.
Spencer is the self-proclaimed leader of the alt-right and has a dream of an all white “ethnostate.” He's well known for his speeches espousing white nationalism, including one he made last December at an alt-right conference in Washington, D.C., where talk of Trump's victory was met with Nazi salutes and cheers.
And Spencer still has his sights set on visiting a university in September: the University of Florida. He is in talks with UF about a speaking event September 12.
UF President Kent Fuchs sent an email to students Saturday about the possibility of Spencer speaking on campus Sept. 12, the day after Spencer's originally planned TAMU visit.
UF @PresidentFuchs sends email about possible alt-right/white nationalist Richard Spencer holding campus speaking event. @WUFTNews pic.twitter.com/3AvfkE8yOm — Ramsey Touchberry (@ramsberry1) August 12, 2017
“For many in the community, including myself, this speaker's presence would be deeply disturbing,” Fuchs wrote in a statement. He went on to say, “While this speaker's views do not align with our values as an institution, we must follow the law, upholding the First Amendment not to discriminate based on content and provide access to a public space.”
UF spokesperson Janine Sikes tells USA TODAY College they're still in contact with Spencer's organization, National Policy Institute, about the possibility of the event, and nothing is finalized. The university's police department has been in contact with local, state and federal authorities about precautionary safety measures.
“We're basically grappling with the same things the public is grappling with: the whole idea of free speech and certainly safety and security for our students, faulty and staff,” Sikes says.
Students at both TAMU and UF were swift to react on social media, creating protest events for each university within hours.
At TAMU, a protest was created on Facebook called “BTHO Hate,” which stands for “beat the hell outta hate,” and comes from a popular football chant students use against opposing teams.
IDK who this is but I saw it on fb & Ilysm & this is great. #BTHOhate pic.twitter.com/xo17Ttn7eN — Julie (@julieseguraa) August 14, 2017
Adam Key is a doctoral student and creator of the page. He tells USA TODAY College they will change their event from a protest to a rally in light of Spencer's event being cancelled.
“This space that white supremacists intended to use to promote hate will now be used to promote love of our fellow human beings,” says Key.
While many people say the media and members of the community should ignore such events, Key says it's important to challenge these ideas and speak out against them.
“In times like these, it's most important we speak out because the alt-right neo-Nazis like Richard Spencer want to change this country,” Key says. “If we don't speak out because we're afraid, they've already won.”
At UF, an Orlando resident named Mitch Emerson created the Facebook page “No Nazis at UF” 4 or 5 hours prior to Fuchs' email to students. He's now handed the group off to students and community activists at UF, but said if Spencer is approved to speak, he'll be there protesting to come September 12.
“White supremacy is only going to go away if we stand up to it,” Emerson tells USA TODAY College. “It's a violent philosophy that promotes the idea of hurting or attacking others.”
Leaders like Spencer are turning to college campuses to recruit more and more.
According to a report released in March by the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, white supremacists are channeling recruitment efforts towards students on college campuses more so than in the past — shifting their recruitment tactics from online to in-person.
The ADL tracked 104 incidents of white supremacist fliering on college campuses since last school year began in September 2016, with an increase in activity in the beginning of 2017, when 63 of the total incidents — 61% — were reported.

“White supremacists have consciously made the decision to focus their recruitment efforts on students and have in some cases openly boasted of efforts to establish a physical presence on campus,” Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL's CEO, stated in a release accompanying the March report. “While there have been recruitment efforts in the past, never have we seen anti-Semites and white supremacists so focused on outreach to students on campus.”

A suspect is in jail after a lengthy police chase early Friday morning.
OKC Police said the chase was initiated shortly after 1 a.m. when an officer attempted to pull the suspect over for a routein traffic violation near I-40 and Meridian in west Oklahoma City.
From there, the suspect took off on a motorcycle and drove all the way through NW OKC before police caught up with him in Stockyards City. The chases lasted for about half an hour.
Police have not yet released the suspects name.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping warned self-ruled Taiwan on Tuesday that it will face the “punishment of history” for any attempt at separatism, offering his strongest warning yet to the island claimed by China as its sacred territory.

Taiwan is one of China's most sensitive issues and a potentially dangerous military flashpoint.
China's hostility towards Taiwan has risen since the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party.
China suspects Tsai wants to push for formal independence, which would cross a red line for Communist Party leaders in Beijing, though Tsai has said she wants to maintain the status quo and is committed to ensuring peace.
China has been infuriated by U.S. President Donald Trump's signing into law legislation last week that encourages the United States to send senior officials to Taiwan to meet Taiwanese counterparts and vice versa.
The United States does not have formal ties with Taiwan but is required by law to help it with self-defence and is the island's primary source of weapons.
In a speech at the end of China's annual session of parliament, Xi told the 3,000-odd delegates that China would push for the “peaceful reunification of the motherland” and work for more Taiwanese to enjoy the opportunities of China's development.
“It is a shared aspiration of all Chinese people and in their basic interests to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and realise China's complete reunification,” Xi said.

“Any actions and tricks to split China are doomed to failure and will meet with the people's condemnation and the punishment of history,” he added, to loud applause.
China has the will, confidence and ability to defeat any separatist activities, Xi said.

“The Chinese people share a common belief that it is never allowed and it is absolutely impossible to separate any inch of our great country's territory from China.”
Proudly democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by autocratic China, and has accused China of not understanding how democracy works, pointing out that Taiwan's people have the right to decide its future.
The new U.S. law on Taiwan adds to strains between China and the United States over trade, as Trump has enacted tariffs and called for China to reduce its huge trade imbalance with the United States, even while Washington has leaned on Beijing to help resolve tensions with North Korea.
Taiwan has thanked the United States for the law and its support, but its foreign ministry said on Monday there were no plans for any senior leaders, such as the president, to visit the country.
While China's stepped up military drills around Taiwan over the past year have rattled Taipei, Xi reiterated claims that China's rise was not a threat to any country, though China considers Taiwan to be merely a Chinese province not a nation.
“Only those who in the habit of threatening others will see everyone else as a threat,” Xi said.
In the wake of the launch of the Lenovo Flex 4 in the United States a year ago, the company is adapting to revive the convertible notebook sooner rather than later. Lenovo quickly showed the unannounced item on its site throughout the end of the week, posting it as the Lenovo Yoga 520 given that the more seasoned model is sold as the Yoga 510 outside the United States.
The up and coming convertible will be based on seventh-gen "Kaby Lake" Intel processors up to a Core i7 model reports, WN. It will likewise wear a discretionary fingerprint reader, an adaptable 360-degree pivot, a battery promising up to 10 hours of utilisation on a single charge, and support for the Lenovo Active Pen. The 2-in-1 gadget will be sold in 14-inch and 15.6-inch form factors.
As indicated by Lenovo, the revived 2-in-1 gadget sports smaller bezels on each side of the screen, diminished from 12.3mm to 7.6mm for a superior viewing experience. The new version is marginally smaller, as well, in spite of keeping a similar screen measure, down from the more established model's measurements of 13.24 x 9.13 x 0.82 inches.

On the processor front, Lenovo doesn't list particular chips, yet indicates on the product page that it will probably send with designs in light of the Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 processors. The more seasoned model upheld processors up to a seventh-gen Core i5 chip, and up to an Intel Pentium 4405U chip. Lenovo may have discarded the AMD Radeon R5 M430 illustrations alternative, as well.

GOTEBORG, Sweden — Vibrant festival opener “Amateurs” from Swedish helmer Gabriela Pichler came away a big winner at the 41st Goteborg Film Festival, scoring the generously endowed (approx. $126,000) Dragon Award for Best Nordic Film. The film also nabbed the Swedish Church's Angelos Award, which includes an additional cash prize.
Pichler's sophomore feature is set in a small, in decline, Swedish town once known for its textile factory and tannery. Two high school friends use cellphones to capture their version of local life. As in her feature debut “Eat Sleep Die,” Pichler mixes social commentary and poignant humor and makes engaging use of affecting, non-pro performers.
The audience award for best Nordic film went to Norway's “What Will People Say” from director-writer Iram Haq. It's a compelling coming-of-ager in which a Norwegian teen clashes with the traditional values of her Pakistani émigré parents.
The festival audience voted the Dragon Award for Best International Film to “Men Don't Cry” from Bosnian helmer-writer Alen Drljevic. In this volatile drama, set some 20 years after the armed conflict in former Yugoslavia, a diverse group of veterans gathers at a remote mountain hotel for a multi-day therapy session.

Danish helmer Simon Lereng Wilmont took the Nordic documentary kudo and a purse of approx. $12,634 for “The Distant Barking Of Dogs,” a sensitive, observational Denmark-Sweden-Finland co-production. The film shows the on-going Ukraine-Russia conflict through the eyes of a 10-year-old boy, whose village home is just one kilometer from the Donbass frontline.
The Ingmar Bergman International Debut Award went to the lyrically directed coming-of-ager “Menina” by Cristina Pinheiro, a French helmer of Portuguese heritage. It centers on a 10-year-old, born and raised in the south of France and her relationship with her immigrant parents.
Following her win last year for “Sami Blood,” Swedish DoP Sophia Olsson claimed the Sven Nykvist Cinematography Award for the second time in a row for her work on Milad Alami's Danish drama “The Charmer.”
The impressively acted social-realist drama “And Breathe Normally” from Iceland's Isold Uggadóttir received the Fipresci critics' nod. It follows a struggling Icelandic single mother who forms an unlikely bond with a female asylum seeker from Guinea Bissau.
While the festival prizes' amply rewarding female talent highlight the Nordic countries successful push for gender parity in filmmaking, so, too, did the selections of the Nordic Film Market and its invaluable works-in-progress sessions. Among the eagerly-anticipated titles pitched to the industry audience were the docu “Bergman – A Year In A Life” from Bergman expert Jane Magnusson, “Anna Odell Untitled,” the sophomore feature of the titular Swedish artist, comedies “Happy People” and “That Time Of Year” from Danish actresses-turned-directors Hella Joof and Paprika Steen respectively, and Anne Sewitsky's bio-pic of Sonja Henie, the ice skating sensation-turned-Hollywood star.
BUFFALO, N.Y. — CJ Massinburg scored 26 points Friday night and Buffalo shot 59 per cent from the field on its way to a 92-86 win over Western Michigan.
Massinburg hit a 3-pointer to make it 84-72 with 1:45 left and made 8 of 10 foul shots in the final minute to help the Bulls (17-6, 9-1 Mid-American Conference) hold on for the win.
Buffalo made 34 of 58 from the field, including 10 of 21 from 3-point range. Jeremy Harris made all four of his 3-point attempts and scored 16, Nick Perkins added 17 points and Wes Clark had 13 points, six rebounds and nine assists.
Thomas Wilder led the Broncos (13-10, 5-5) with 34 points. He made 10 of 17 from the field, 3 of 5 from 3-point range and 9 of 12 from the foul line.
Iran Focus
London, 6 Oct - Donald Trump is set to introduce a new campaign to crack down on the Lebanese terrorist group, Hezbollah, which is backed by the Iranian Regime, as part of the new US policy on Iran.
Reportedly, this will include offering cash rewards for the most-wanted Hezbollah operatives, increasing efforts by the US intelligence service and law enforcement, and working with allies to undermine the group's global terror network.
Hezbollah, a powerful section of the Lebanese government, is an enemy of Israel and has been responsible for many attacks on the US and other Western countries for years. It was designated as a terror group by the US in 1997.
One administration official, who spoke to Politico on the condition of anonymity, said that the campaign's primary objective is to “expose” Hezbollah and undermine their attempts at political legitimacy.
Another source said: “It's a paradigm shift in how we view Hezbollah. While it strives for legitimacy, it is conducting terrorism.”
It is believed that this campaign will be announced at Friday's White House news briefing and would be addressed further over the coming week.
Iran Policy
The officials said that this was part of the new administration's overall policy on Iran, which will include whether or not to decertify the Iranian nuclear deal on October 15.
They believe that Trump will determine the deal as not within national security interests but would not reimpose sanctions.
One said: “We want to counter Iran's malign activities, [and Hezbollah is] “part and parcel of that [because of the group] behaves like a proxy.”
This new push was reportedly fuelled by charges filed against Samer El Debek and Ali Kourani for providing support to Hezbollah, back in June. Indeed, El Debek is believed to have conducted missions in Panama to expose vulnerabilities, while Kourani allegedly conducted surveillance in the US.
Here are just some of the attacks that Hezbollah has been accused of over the years:
• 1983: truck bombings of the U.S. Embassy and a Marine barracks in Beirut
• 1994: bombing of a Jewish cultural centre in Argentina
• 2012: the killing of five Israeli tourists in a bombing in Bulgaria
They have also gone to war with Israel several times over the years and have supported the Bashar Assad dictatorship (at the behest of Iran) in the six-year-long Syrian civil war.
When asked if Hezbollah was likely to attack the US, the officials noted that there is nothing immediate but that the problem should be taken care of before it reached that stage.
Chris Harris and Aqib Talib are two of the best cornerbacks in the NFL, according to one of their peers.
Darius Slay, who plays for the Lions, posted a list on Twitter of who he believes are the top four cornerbacks in the league today:
My top 5 CB's in the nfl but not in order…..
1.@AqibTalib21
2.@RSherman_25

5.can be a lot of of guys Them 4 guys been doin it for the longest on the highest level…. u can't disrespect them guys like that.. — Darius Slay (@_bigplayslay23) January 30, 2018
Seahawks defensive back Richard Sherman and Cardinals cornerback Patrick Peterson are the two other players who made Slay's list.
Slay said there are “a lot of guys” who could be considered the fifth-best cornerback in the NFL. One could make an argument that Slay belongs on the list — the sixth-year corner recorded eight interceptions last season.
Chris Lynn is a surprise omission from Queensland's list of contracted cricketers for 2017-18. (AAP)
The Queensland Bulls have opted not to offer a contract to Chris Lynn for the domestic season.
Chris Lynn has not been offered a contract by the Queensland Bulls this season as the free-wheeling batsman recovers from shoulder surgery.
The 27-year-old is a surprise omission from Queensland's list of contracted players for the 2017-18 campaign, which was released on Tuesday.
However, the Bulls said Lynn would be "considered for selection like any other player" once he returned from full fitness, which would likely be early next year.
Lynn opted for surgery after his shoulder issues interrupted a breakout domestic campaign, becoming the Big Bash League's drawcard player by smashing 26 sixes and also making his one-day international debut for Australia in January.
He has played only six Sheffield Shields matches for Queensland during the past two summers and hasn't played one-day cricket for his state since 2013.
Long-time Shield stalwart Nathan Reardon was also snubbed by the Bulls while Usman Khawaja was named skipper, replacing the retired Chris Hartley.
The domestic one-day competition begins in October.

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. >> Rickie Fowler birdied the last three holes to take the lead in the Waste Management Phoenix Open, overcoming a sluggish start in front of the largest crowd in golf history.
Justin Thomas went the other way, wasting a brilliant opening run with another late meltdown.
Fowler shot a 4-under 67 on Saturday to reach 14-under 199 with a round left at TPC Scottsdales Stadium Course, the fan-friendly layout packed with an estimated 216,818 fans on an 80-degree afternoon.
I really made some good swings coming in, Fowler said. I just wasnt getting the ball close enough and finally on the last few there I was able to get some good looks.

The fourth-ranked Thomas, the PGA Tour player of the year after winning five times last season, birdied the first six holes to take the lead. But instead of making a run at his second sub-60 round in a little over a year, Thomas had to fight for an even-par 71 that left him eight shots back. He dropped six strokes in a three-hole stretch, making a bogey on the par-4 14th, a triple bogey on the par-5 15th and a double bogey on the rowdy par-3 16th. On Thursday in the first round, he had a double bogey on 16 and a bogey on 17.
Thomas left the course without speaking to the media.
Former Arizona State players Jon Rahm and Chez Reavie were a stroke back along with Bryson DeChambeau. Phil Mickelson was two shots behind, another former Sun Devils star riding the crowd support.
It means a lot to me, Mickelson said. Its very helpful and very important to my success. I think its been a big instrument in allowing me to get into the round and play and have fun and get out of the technical side.
The crowd pushed the week total to 654,906, just short of the record of 655,434 set last year.
Fowler is trying to finally win in the desert. He finished a shot behind Hunter Mahan in 2010, lost to Hideki Matsuyama on the fourth extra hole in 2016, and tied for fourth last year.
Its just a matter of time, Fowler said. It would just be nice if it was sooner rather than later.
The four-time tour winner began his birdie run with a 17-footer on 16 and connected from 9 feet on the par-4 17th and 18th holes. He also birdied 13 after playing the first 12 in even par with a birdie and a bogey.
I just kind of had to fight through it, Fowler said. The swing was just a fraction off. It wasnt bad, still made some good swings out there, but just had to try and get the ball in the short grass, get some looks and try not to make many mistakes.
Rahm had a 65, playing alongside Mickelson and Schauffele for the third straight day. The 23-year-old Spaniard had five birdies in a seven-hole stretch on the back nine. He won two weeks ago in the California desert at La Quinta to jump to No. 2 in the world.
I hit the ball really well off the tee, gave myself a lot of opportunities, Rahm said. But the main key today was my iron play. My game was a lot more accurate than the first few days and thanks to that I had a couple better birdie chances and a couple more went in.
Reavie birdied the final two holes for a 67.
To win tournaments out here is great, but to win one that you grew up going to would be very special, Reavie said. For me, this is a fifth major.
DeChambeau shot 68. He lost the lead with a bogey on 17 after driving into the water.
Tempo and rhythm, DeChambeau said. If I can control that and control my golf swing like I have been the past three days I think that Ill be fine.
Mickelson birdied the final two holes for a 66. Hes making his record-tying 29th start in the event he won in 1996, 2005 and 2013.
If you look at it, it looks like a very simple, solid bogey-free round, 5 under, Mickelson said. It was anything but that. I made some really nice up-and-downs to keep the round going and when I did hit some good tee shots and hit some good shots into the fairway I was able to get aggressive and make some birdies.
Xander Schauffele and Daniel Berger also were 12 under. Schauffele shot 66, and Berger had a 68.
Im getting the full experience playing with Phil and Jon, Schauffele said. Especially when all of us are playing well.
Fowler is wearing a pin on his hat with a picture of Griffin Connell, the area boy he befriended at the event who died last week at age 7. Griffin was born with a rare airway disorder.
We actually had a ball go a little left on 11 today and we joked about it that Griffin took one in the chest and kept it out for us, Fowler said.
Suzy Kolber has covered Super Bowls at ESPN for two decades. But Super Bowl LII will be her first as the network's lead pregame and postgame anchor.
“I get to open and close,” Kolber says. “For me personally, in my career, that's a little bit different and a little bit more significant.”
ESPN's Super Bowl pregame show Sunday will be a mammoth four hours — twice the length of “Monday Night Countdown,” which Kolber hosts once a week ahead of “Monday Night Football.” The 2017 NFL season, culminating in Sunday's championship matchup between the New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles in Minneapolis, was Kolber's first in the top spot on “Countdown.” After several years as the show's onsite anchor, she took over the lead role from the retired Chris Berman, one of ESPN's original and best-known on-air personalities. The move made Kolber's already busy weekly schedule busier.
Kolber began her career as an intern, then a producer at local stations in Miami — carrying equipment, logging game results. That experience informed the way she would approach her on-air work in the years to come.

“My comfort zone is probably over-preparation,” she says. “That's what makes me feel good.”
During the season, a typical week for Kolber begins on the first flight home Tuesday, based near ESPN's Connecticut headquarters, from whatever city the Monday-night game has taken place the evening before. She spends the flight reading up on the weekend's games, adding to research files she keeps on every team. That afternoon, she picks up her daughter up from school.
On Wednesday, Kolber watches the entirety of Monday's “Countdown” broadcast. “I always watch everything I do, just always trying to improve,” she says. She then begins to dig into research packets on the league and the upcoming Monday-night game prepared by producers. Before watching the Thursday-night game, she scours the internet, studying what NFL beat writers are reporting on their respective teams. On Friday, she works on writing material for “NFL Live.” When the show is done filming, she goes straight into a meeting for “Countdown.” Most Saturdays, she flies to the site of the coming Monday game, in time for meetings with players and coaches, and spends Sunday watching games and writing Monday's show.
Kolber arrived in Minneapolis on Wednesday after anchoring ESPN's Pro Bowl coverage in Orlando last weekend. She wanted to get to town in time for one of her favorite Super Bowl rituals: the team breakfasts. With every player and every coach in an organization available to the press, Kolber avoids the crowds around star players and head coaches, zeroing in on assistant coaches.
“These guys love to talk, and they don't typically get to,” she says. “I get all my gritty x's and o's stuff from the assistant coaches and maybe some of the secondary players, and at the tail-end swing around and get some comments from the stars. I gather a good chunk of my information for the rest of the week.”
On Sunday, Kolber will be watching the Eagles defense, one of the NFL's best, and determining whether its aggressive linemen are able to get their hands on Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. “The key is always getting Brady off his spot — getting to him, hitting him.” But she will also be watching to see how the Eagles hold up as the game wears on.
“The players who haven't been there, you can say a billion times, ‘This is still just a football game, we're going to keep things as normal as possible,'” she says. “But there is nothing like the energy in that building.” Players who haven't been to the Super Bowl, she adds, don't understand that the pregame routine is different, that warm-ups are longer, and that they are expending far more energy before the game has started than they usually do.
“All of a sudden, it catches up with them in the fourth quarter,” she says. “It's what happened to the Falcons last year,” in a historic fourth quarter Super Bowl meltdown against the Patriots, “and the Patriots know how to take advantage of that.”
Kolber and her colleagues will also have to pace themselves ahead of the pregame show. “It's four hours,” she says. “It's a marathon.” Doing that will require giving up a bit of her traditional over-preparation, which has become ingrained over the course of a career.
“When I first was coming up in the business, and it was me in a room with 250 guys, you have to be right,” she says. “You're judged more harshly. And I feel like I'm my own harshest critic, but you can't really afford to make a mistake.”
But Kolber is also a self-proclaimed perfectionist by nature. Over-preparation, she says, would likely be her standard way of working no matter the circumstances.
“I have a tremendous respect for the game and the people who work so hard,” she says. “It's my responsibility to be right. To make sure the quotes are right, to make sure the information is right. I just think that's how, through the years, you develop that respect and credibility — making sure you're right.”
South Australia-A giant, flying turkey as tall as a kangaroo once roamed Australia, palaeontologists said Wednesday, after an analysis of fossils and bones from around the country revealed five extinct bird species.
A team from Flinders University in South Australia said they were all chunky relatives of today's malleefowl and brush-turkeys. The megapode birds lived during the Pleistocene era, between 1.6 million and 10,000 years ago, alongside other giant Australian animals like diprotodons, marsupial lions and short-faced kangaroos.
Scientists had initially thought the fossils, first found in the 1880s, represented a single ancient bird, but fresh examination has led them to conclude they belong to five different species. Among them was a turkey weighing up to eight kilograms (17 pounds) and standing taller than a grey kangaroo, which can reach 1.3 metres (4ft 3ins) - four times the size of modern fowl. “These discoveries are quite remarkable because they tell us that more than half of Australia's megapodes went extinct during the Pleistocene, and we didn't even realise it until now,” said researcher Elen Shute.
“We compared the fossils described in the 1880s and the 1970s with specimens discovered more recently, and with the benefit of new fossils, differences between species became really clear.” The newly found birds fall into two categories - “tall turkeys” that had long, slender legs, and “nuggetty chickens” that had short legs and broad bodies.
Unlike many large extinct birds, such as dodos, these megapodes were not flightless.
While big and bulky, their long, strong wing bones showed they could all fly, and probably roosted in trees, unlike their modern ground-dwelling cousins which build mounds to incubate their eggs.
Two of the new species come from the Thylacoleo Caves beneath Australia's vast Nullarbor Plain, which have proved a treasure trove since they were discovered 15 years ago.
“So far the Thylacoleo Caves have yielded seven new species of kangaroo, a frog, two giant ground-cuckoos, and now two new megapodes,” said Flinders professor Gavin Prideaux.
“The closer we look, the more we keep finding.”

LAHORE-Pakistan women hockey team goalkeeper Rushna Khan believes that only drastic changes in women hockey can help it excel at international level.
Talking to The Nation, 21-year-old Rushna, who last year became the country's first female hockey player to be signed by a foreign club for a season, said: “We are playing the hockey 90s, which is now outdated and it couldn't help us earn glories for the country at international level. Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) needs to bring drastic changes in women hockey and should hire foreign coaches, who may teach our players advanced and modern-day techniques so that our girls may fight well against other hockey powerhouses.
“Playing with such outdated techniques, we even couldn't beat Asian hockey nations while beating European giants would be not less than a daydreaming. The PHF should immediately appoint foreign coaches, who may start training our players advanced techniques and improve our fitness and stamina, so that we may stand some realistic chances of doing well against at least Asian teams.
“The foreign coaches will surely take some time to transform our raw talent into champions but then everyone will see, Pakistan women hockey will start producing results at international level and start earning laurels for the country in mega events,” she added.
Lauding the efforts of PHF for the promotion of hockey especially women hockey , Rushna said that like men hockey, the federation is also trying to facilitate women hockey . “The PHF has recently arranged national hockey events for female players. Then they arranged foreign tours for us in order to provide us international exposure so that we may learn how to compete against best in the business. Hopefully, with such little but consecutive steps, PHF will see improvement in women hockey but for better and long-term change, they need to appoint foreign coach for female team.”
She said that like the previous year, this year too, she is ready to take part in the Australia's league hockey season and will play a goalkeeper throughout the season. “Playing alongside top professional hockey players always helps a lot in learning and improving the skills and techniques, and the way I have learnt a lot last year from the players of one of the best hockey nations, I hope this year too, I'll return home with great international exposure and better hockey techniques.
Highlighting her personal aims and goals, Rushna said: “As earlier, becoming first Pakistani female hockey player to be signed by a foreign club was my biggest dream, which by the grace of Almighty, I have achieved. And now I have a dream of representing my country in Olympics. Although it is a very tough task but at least it is not impossible. The way I have achieved my first goal of playing for a foreign club, I hope one day, my second dream of playing Olympics for my country will also come true.”
The national goalkeeper also lauded her mentor and coach Waqas Butt for transforming her into quality stuff, due to which she is not only serving the national team but also holding aloft Pakistani flag in Australia. She also lauded her hockey club, Rawha Hockey Academy, whose owner Sehrish Ghumman along with other hockey enthusiasts teaching the modern-day techniques to the young female hockey players so that they may serve the country in future and earn glories for it globally.
Taylor, who works as a patient navigation adviser at Sunnybrook Hospital, was later diagnosed with a broken elbow.
“I catapulted right over the thing and landed on my left side,” Taylor, 62, said in an interview. “It was incredibly painful.”
He made a beeline for the centre of the platform and as he didn't notice a low bench in his path that was obscured by the milling crowd.
But by the time he got from Bloor-Yonge station to his stop at St. George, the delay had caused the waiting crowds to swell and the platform was full. As he exited the train a throng of people pushed to get on, and he had to jostle his way out.
Paul Taylor didn't think much of it when his subway was delayed during his commute home one evening last month. A regular TTC user, he's accustomed to the occasional transit hiccup.
Subway crowding is a common complaint for TTC riders, but the problem took on renewed urgency Tuesday when a cascading series of failures during morning rush hour caused delays that risked creating dangerous conditions at stations across Line 1 (Yonge-University-Spadina) .
“This is just one small example of a person getting injured. But it's only going to get worse,” he said.
He said he often feels unsafe at St. George “because there are so many people there,” and he expects the crowds will only get bigger in the coming years as the downtown population grows.
The problems included a disabled train that began emitting smoke as it was being hauled to a yard, signal and switch malfunctions, and a door problem followed by an emergency alarm that paralyzed a train at Museum station for 21 minutes at the height of rush hour.
Crowds grew as new customers arrived and had nowhere to go, and stranded passengers began to Tweet about “chaos” underground and “scary” conditions on platforms.
In an interview, TTC spokesperson Brad Ross asserted the subway system is safe. He noted the agency has protocols to deal with overcrowding, including slowing trains as they enter a station and shutting down escalators.
But he acknowledged that on Tuesday the TTC was “very, very close” to closing Bloor-Yonge, its busiest station, and evacuating passengers, something he said he has never seen the agency have to do as a result of crowding. The TTC is reviewing what caused the delays and will report to its board later this month.
Tuesday's crowding may have been alarming, but it was not unforeseeable. The section of the Yonge subway south of Bloor has been overcapacity during morning rush hour for a decade.
On a typical morning the section carries between 28,000 and 30,000 people southbound from Bloor-Yonge every hour, more than its scheduled capacity of about 28,000.
The TTC is currently installing a new signalling system called automatic train control (ATC) on Line 1, and once it's fully operational in 2020, the line's capacity will increase to about 32,500 passengers per hour per direction, according to Ross.
But even with ATC, the line is expected to reach capacity again by 2031. And ATC will only help address crowding when trains are moving, not during a service shutdown like Tuesday's. The Achilles heel of the TTC's three-line subway network is that there is no redundancy built in. If a breakdown on Line 1 stops service, rapid transit access downtown is completely cut off.
That problem would be addressed by the relief line subway, the first phase of which would connect the eastern end of Line 2 (Bloor-Danforth) at Pape station to Line 1 downtown at Queen and Osgoode stations, and would cost at least $6.8 billion.
But despite city planners identifying the relief line as an urgent need decades ago, the only additions to Toronto's subway network in the past 20 years have been in its suburbs, away from the crowded core.
Line 4 (Sheppard) opened in 2002 and the new Spadina subway extension to Vaughan followed late last year. Next in line is the planned one-stop Scarborough subway extension, which is being funded by all three levels of government and will cost more than $3.35-billion.
Since John Tory's election as mayor in 2014, another project has been added to the city's priority list: SmartTrack, a $3.7-billion plan to use existing GO Transit corridors to serve people within Toronto. The project, which has shrunk drastically from the version Tory pitched on the campaign trail, is expected to divert some riders away from Line 1, but not nearly as many as would the relief line.
At a press conference at city hall Thursday, Tory insisted that the city's pursuit of the Scarborough subway extension and SmartTrack haven't impeded progress on the relief line.
“The relief line remains front and centre in our approach and in our funding,” he said.
He argued that after years of inaction, his administration had secured money to advance planning for the relief line. The work to take the project to the 15- to 30-per-cent design stage will cost $100 million and is being funded by the city and province.
However, no level of government has allocated any money to actually build the relief line.
Tory argued Thursday that was not yet a problem because even if the money was in place, construction couldn't start until the planning work had been done. The federal government has pledged money to help fund Toronto's next wave of transit projects and the mayor said he was confident the provincial government would also agree to contribute to the relief line.
Tory added that staff has repeatedly advised him “there was nothing to be done” to accelerate the relief line.
But Jennifer Keesmaat, who was Toronto's chief planner for five years before resigning last September, believes the city hasn't done everything it could.
She pointed out the relief line's transit project assessment process (TPAP), a government-mandated study that must be completed before a transit project can be built, was supposed to begin last fall, but instead has been delayed until later this year.
According to Keesmaat, the problem is that neither the city's planning department nor the TTC has a team dedicated solely to the relief line. Instead a small group of staff split their time between different projects.
“There are moments when nobody is working on the relief line because they're working on SmartTrack. There are moments when fewer people are working on SmartTrack because they're working on Waterfront LRT,” she said.
She argued the city should create a dedicated team and its “first task” should be to find ways to start constructing the relief line within three or four years.
Current city estimates indicate the line could be complete by 2031, with construction taking eight to 10 years.
“That timeline actually needs to be truncated,” Keesmaat said. “It's just too long.”
The city and TTC confirmed the TPAP process had been delayed, but said they were still on track to report back to council on the next stage of the design process by the end of 2019, as scheduled.
In an email, the city's director of transportation planning James Perttula said there is team assigned to work on all of council's transit priorities, and “staff from that team are assigned to the relief line, as well as the other projects, in order to best address project demands.”
“The number of staff on each transit project varies as demands change and deadlines for the various projects approach.”
He said consultants are also being hired this year to complement staff from the TTC, city, and Metrolinx, the provincial transit agency, who are working on the project.
Don Peat, the mayor's spokesperson, said Tory will be meeting with city staff in the next two weeks “to ask, yet again, if there are any possible options to speed up work on the relief line.”
“Mayor Tory made it clear this week that the only thing that has slowed the relief line down is the fact that no one did anything about it for years,” he said.
WASHINGTON -- Stephen Strasburg's best wasn't good enough.
In Game 1 of the National League Division Series, Strasburg picked up right where he left off at the end of the regular season, when he was the NL's best pitcher in the second half. Facing the defending World Series champion Cubs, Strasburg didn't give up a hit through five innings, the second-longest no-hit bid of his career. He fanned Anthony Rizzo and Kris Bryant twice each, the first time in more than two months that Rizzo and Bryant both had a pair of whiffs in the same game.
He gave up three hits and no earned runs over seven innings, struck out 10, and needed only 81 pitches to do it, repeatedly inducing chants of "Let's go Strasburg," which pretty much never happens at Nats Park.
In short, he was brilliant. But it didn't matter.

It didn't matter because Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks decided to channel his inner-Irving Berlin ("Anything you can do, I can do better"), tossing seven innings of two-hit ball and generally baffling the Nats' bats. It didn't matter because MVP candidate Anthony Rendon -- who committed fewer errors than any third baseman in the majors this season -- flubbed an easy chopper that put Javier Baez on base to start the sixth, leading to two unearned runs that seemed more like 20.
It didn't matter because, despite getting the very best version of Stephen Strasburg that they ever could have hoped for, the Nationals still lost. Even worse, they lost a game they couldn't afford to lose.
If ace Max Scherzer were pitching on Saturday in Game 2, Friday's defeat would seem infinitely more tolerable for the Nationals. But Scherzer -- he of the two Cy Young awards and one tweaked hammy -- needs extra time to convalesce and isn't slated to pitch until Game 3 in Chicago.
Instead, skipper Dusty Baker will send Gio Gonzalez to the hill Saturday -- the same Gio Gonzalez who, after a stellar first five months of the season, worked to a 6.75 ERA over his final four starts. At best, the left-hander rediscovers his groove and helps the Nats knot the series, their home-field advantage already shot. At worst, Gonzalez continues his slide, Washington continues what has been a disturbing multiseason trend of offensive impotence in the playoffs, and the Nationals continue on to Chicago in a two-game hole.
Gulp.
"Yeah, it does," Baker said when asked postgame if his team's L stung a little more given how well Strasburg threw. "He was doing all he could. You know, we just couldn't muster up too much offense tonight. We'll be better tomorrow."
Being better isn't just about scoring more runs. It's about catching the ball, which Washington didn't do well all season (minus-37 runs saved, worst among playoff teams) and which Rendon didn't do when he needed to. It's about hitting the cutoff man, which Bryce Harper didn't do on Bryant's RBI single in the sixth, allowing Bryant to advance to second (he scored on Rizzo's single two pitches later). It's about mastering the minutia necessary to win games in October.
"That's playoff baseball," Ryan Zimmerman said.
"Both pitchers threw great tonight. Stras threw the heck out of the ball. That was fun to watch. Their guy also threw the ball well. You have to kind of do the little things right, and take advantage of the breaks you get, like they did.
"But that was Game 1. Obviously would have rather won that game, but it's never easy."
Easy, of course, is all relative. For the Nationals, October has proven decidedly difficult. Before this year, they'd been to the playoffs three times since moving to D.C. in 2005. All three times -- in 2012, 2014 and 2016 -- they've been the higher seed, and all three times they've been bounced in the NLDS. Given that, and given what happened Friday, it's hard not to think they're headed a fourth fall failure.
Then again, it's worth noting that last year against the Dodgers, Washington dropped the opener at home -- in a game started by Scherzer -- only to rebound and win the next two. And that was with zero contribution from Strasburg, who missed the 2016 playoffs after suffering a torn pronator tendon down the stretch. In other words, just because Strasburg's best wasn't good enough in Game 1, that doesn't mean the Nats' best isn't yet to come.
"Obviously it didn't go the way we wanted tonight," Zimmerman said. "But we'll bounce back tomorrow."
Kevin Morby has shared a new video for the song “Downtown's Lights,” from his recent album City Lights.
Directed by Hugo Jouxtel and filmed in Paris, the intimate black-and-white clip celebrates the spirit of Parisian flânerie with scenes of Morby singing in empty cafés and giving flowers to the people he passes on the streets.
“Paris has always shown a lot of love towards my music, and I am very grateful,” says Morby. “On my first European solo tour I was selling maybe 50 tickets a city until I showed up in Paris and heard the show was already at 150 tickets, which at the time really blew my mind and took me by complete surprise. Before the show, a company called La Blogothéque asked me to do a ‘Take Away Show,' which I agreed to do, though I didn't really know what it was. The film crew was so kind and took me on a magical adventure around the city filming me playing some songs in a park and in a boat going down the canal. Two years later, I was back in Paris and they asked me to film a show playing to a small crowd inside a house next to Père Lachaise Cemetery and that, too, was very magical. So when it came time to do a video for Downtowns Lights I knew just who to ask. La Blogothéque has a way of capturing the meeting of artists and a city half way, letting them both do the work and play off of each other and the result is always fascinating.”

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) ambassador to Islamabad Hamad Obaid Al-Zaabi here Wednesday said that relations between the UAE and Pakistan were linked with the spirit of sincere brotherhood and historical ties which would grow in days ahead.
He made these remarks on the occasion of the UAE's initiative to distribute food among the deserving sections of the society by utilizing services of the charity organizations in the holy month of Ramadan.
The envoy praised the “generous support provided by charitable organizations to the Pakistani people, and expressed appreciation to sincere brotherhood between the UAE and Pakistan linked by the historical ties between the two countries and the two brotherly peoples.”
The UAE embassy in Islamabad, he said, had launched the distribution of Ramadan food baskets, donated by Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Charitable and Humanitarian Establishment, to the needy families in Islamabad and Rawalpindi.—APP

“Creature Comfort” is one of the new songs that Arcade Fire have been playing live from their upcoming album, Everything Now, and today they've shared a teaser for the studio version of the track. The band posted a video on their Facebook page of what looks like a brightly-colored cereal commercial advertising a product that's made out of 100% marshmallows, but it also says it “contains methylphendiate” (generic ritalin) and comes with a split-second warning screen about the nutritional information of the product. The video also points to the newly created Everything Now Corp Facebook page. Check it out below.
America's Recording Academy president Neil Portnow has denied Beyonce's losing out on the top prizes at the Grammy Awards was due to racial bias.
The Formation singer, 35, won the Best Urban Contemporary Album and Best Music Video prizes at Sunday's ceremony but lost to Adele in the prestigious Record, Song and Album of the Year categories.
With her unexpected loss meaning no female African-American artist has won in the Album of the Year category since Lauryn Hill in 1999, fans and musicians including Beyonce's sister Solange and St. Vincent have accused Recording Academy voters of being biased against non-white artists.

Portnow has denied the claims however, saying that members of his organisation are experts who are unswayed by the race of an artist.
“No, I don't think there's a race problem at all,” he told Pitchfork Media. “Remember, this is a peer-voted award. So when we say the Grammys, it's not a corporate entity - it's the 14,000 members of the Academy.
Grammys' Portnow: "You don't get Chance the Rapper as Best New Artist if you have a membership that isn't diverse" https://t.co/N3BCb7Mxpn — Pitchfork (@pitchfork) February 14, 2017
“They have to qualify in order to be members, which means they have to have recorded and released music, and so they are sort of the experts and the highest level of professionals in the industry.”
Even Adele was shocked to beat Beyonce, whose pioneering visual album Lemonade was hailed by critics as one of 2016's defining cultural moments.
Defending the Academy's members from the accusations, Portnow added, “We don't, as musicians, in my humble opinion, listen to music based on gender or race or ethnicity. When you go to vote on a piece of music - at least the way that I approach it - is you almost put a blindfold on and you listen.”
The Recording Academy Chief cited Chance the Rapper's win in the Best New Artist category as evidence voters honoured musicians of all backgrounds.
He also denied his organisation needed a membership shake-up like the one the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) chiefs embarked upon after no non-white actors were nominated at the 2016 Oscars.
“Well, they may have had a problem,” he explained. “We don't have that kind of issue in that same fashion.”
Connor Hellebuyck is an elite goaltender. His 44-11-9 record, 2.36 goals-against average (GAA) and .924 save percentage (SV%) are massive reasons for the Winnipeg Jets' success this year. His case for capturing the Vezina is a compelling one, as his team simply wouldn't be where they are without him.
However, he hasn't had much success this season against one certain squad — which happens to be the one the Jets find themselves facing in the second round.
Hellebuyck's Nightmares Against Nashville
Hellebuyck's had some problems when playing the Nashville Predators. His numbers against the league's top team aren't exactly a dream.
In five games and four starts against the Predators in 2017-18, his GAA was 3.91 — the worst figure versus any team he faced more than once. He gave up a total of 19 goals in those five games. He also posted a SV% of .882, well below his sparkling overall number.
On Nov. 20, in the two teams' first matchup of the season, Hellebuyck allowed five goals on 29 shots in a 5-3 loss, including two that slid along the ice and through his five-hole.
On Feb. 27, he had arguably his worst start of the season in a 6-5 loss. He looked bad and was torched for six goals on 26 shots, including three straight in the third as the Jets squandered a 5-3 lead.
A rare off night for goalie Connor Hellebuyck as the Jets fall to the Predators 6-5. He didn't look very good on at least 4 of the goals scored by Nashville. But he's been the Jets the best player in most of the games this season. He'll bounce back. — Joe Pascucci (@Pascucci015) February 28, 2018
After that game, Hellebuyck didn't talk to reporters. When he did speak two days later, he refused to discuss the game.
“I do mind going back to it. I don't want to bring it up,” Helleybuyck said in the interview. “There's no need — it's in the past. There are 82 games and I'm focusing on the next one. We've had a good run, so far, and we want to continue it.”
Hellebuyck Shaky Even in Wins
Even in his two wins against the Predators, Hellebuyck wasn't his usual brick-wall self. On Dec. 19, he made 30 saves in a 6-4 win. However, the win was more thanks to Brandon Tanev's unlikely late-game goal than Hellebuyck's performance: he gave up a sharp-angle stinker and a softie he should have been able to squeeze but didn't that trickled through him and just over the goal line.
On Mar. 25, when the Jets punched their ticket to the playoffs with a 5-4 shootout victory, Hellebuyck allowed a couple he would probably have liked to stop, including one with less than a second left in the first period. Overall, though, he was decent, saving 32 and not allowing a shootout goal.
Hellebuyck Bounce-Back Ability — and He Knows It
Even with his suspect numbers against the team the Jets will soon face for four or more, fans shouldn't be too concerned. Hellebuyck has uncommon levels of mettle, maturity, and confidence.

He's a hard worker who doesn't wallow in a bad performance or let a bad night snowball into a free fall. After allowing five goals or more in a game, he has — without exception — rebounded with a great performance. His ability to do that is one of the things that makes him so valuable.
His bounce-back ability was never more apparent than it was in Round 1 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. After a rough 6-2 loss in Game 3, Hellebuyck didn't panic, but instead turned his net into Fort Knox, posting back-to-back shutouts. Paul Maurice praised his goalie for the trait after his Game 4 shutout.
“You knew, five to 10 minutes into that game, he was right and feeling good,” Maurice said after Game 4. “It's really good for our hockey team to see that from him. To see that he can come back and rebound – this kind of confidence builders in the playoffs are critical.”
Hellebuyck Needs to Look Forward, Not Back
Hellebuyck is emerging at just the right time and needs to keep his momentum going. He needs to put his regular-season struggles against the Predators in the rearview and focus on doing what he did in Round 1 and the vast majority of the regular season. His team will need him at his best in what's bound to be a dogfight between two of the NHL's very best.
“I'm going to have to look to the future and remember this,” Hellebuyck said to Darrin Bauming after the series-clinching Game 5. “That this was a big building stone and a step in my career. That I can do this, and if things falter, I have a good foundation to fall back on.”
If big No. 37 can push aside his struggles against the Predators — which by all indicators he can — the Jets will have a good foundation to build on for a Round 2 victory.

ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- John Elway rather tersely pointed out in April that kicker Brandon McManus' one-year tender offer was on Elway's desk and ready to be signed "when he wants to come sign it.''
On Wednesday, McManus finally made the trip and became the last restricted free agent in the league to sign his tender for the 2017 season. McManus will now earn $2.746 million for the season if the two sides don't close out a long-term deal in the weeks to come.
McManus has attended the team's offseason program, including this week's mandatory minicamp. On the final day of the draft, Elway was asked about several other items, including the status of McManus' tender, and Elway quickly responded:
"It's up there. So when he wants to come sign it, he can come sign it.''

McManus made $600,000 last season, and he and the Broncos had faced a Thursday deadline -- at 2 p.m. Denver time. At that point the Broncos could have pulled the tender offer and instead replaced it with a June 15 tender, which would have paid McManus 110 percent of his 2016 salary -- $660,000 -- and significantly less than the one-year deal on the table.
McManus has been seeking a long-term deal and would now be an unrestricted free agent next March.
"There is really no rush for me to sign the tender because it could go through June 15,'' is how McManus put it during last month's OTAs. "I would love to be here as long as I can and be on a long-term deal here that gives me some security. I love Denver and I love the fan base here. I would love to be here for four years, so why not see what I can do?"
The Broncos had offered one-year tenders to both of their prominent restricted free agents -- linebacker Todd Davis and McManus. Davis signed his tender soon after.
McManus' agent, Drew Rosenhaus, has talked to the Broncos about a long-term deal for McManus. But during Elway's tenure as the team's chief football decision-maker, other than wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders' deal last summer, the Broncos have routinely waited until November or December to negotiate long-term deals with some of their players headed for free agency.
Von Miller signed a record deal in July after he had been designated the team's franchise player. But for most other pending free agents the Broncos have wanted to re-sign, the team has made deals in November and beyond.
Cornerback Chris Harris Jr., defensive end Derek Wolfe and safety Darian Stewart each signed long-term deals Nov. 26 or later in the season before they were scheduled for free agency.
McManus was 29-of-34 in field goal attempts last season (.853) and was 30-of-35 in 2015 before he went 10-of-10 in the team's run to a Super Bowl 50 win.

There came a moment, during the trial in a wrongful-death lawsuit against Nassau's jail medical vendor and the county itself, when the family of Bartholomew Ryan gasped audibly in the courtroom.
That was during testimony from Dr. Vincent Manetti, the psychiatrist who examined Ryan hours before the Iraq War veteran — who was in jail after he couldn't make bail on a charge of driving while under the influence of drugs — killed himself.
Manetti testified that Ryan told the doctor during an exam that previously he had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder and anxiety.
But, Manetti said, he diagnosed Ryan only with a drug dependency problem. Manetti said Ryan told him, “I don't want to play the psych card.”
With that, members of Ryan's family gasped, and looked toward each other, with anger and disbelief on some of their faces.
A few days later, the reason for their muted outburst would become clear. Ryan's mother, Lilyann, testified that the veteran left a drug treatment program because he felt he did not belong.

“He felt it was a PTSD problem, and drugs were secondary to that problem,” she testified.
While Manetti testified that Ryan — who killed himself six hours after talking to the doctor — thought his issues were rooted in drug abuse, not other disorders, Ryan's mother testified that Ryan believed it was the other way around.
Either way, the jury put more stock in the plaintiff's case than they did in that of Nassau County, and its jail medical provider, Armor Correctional Health Services. The jury last week awarded Ryan's family almost $8 million after finding both the county, and the medical provider, negligent in the case.
Afterward, a spokeswoman for Armor said the company intended to “pursue all available post-trial remedies,” while Nassau on Monday repeated that it was reviewing the verdict to determine “options available going forward.”
Ryan's was the first of four federal lawsuits against Armor and Nassau over jail inmate deaths to go to trial.
His death also came under review by the state Commission of Correction — which determined that an Armor psychiatrist did an inadequate assessment of Ryan's mental health on Feb. 24, 2012, hours before he killed himself in his cell. The report didn't name the doctor.
Was Ryan a casualty of Nassau's decision to significantly cut costs at the jail by retaining an outside medical provider on a contract that paid the same rate per month no matter how much — or as the state Attorney General initially contended in a civil suit it ultimately settled with Armor — how little care the vendor provided?
The trial didn't address that question. Still, it's one worth pondering — by County Executive Edward Mangano and legislators — as Nassau seeks to replace Armor with a new jail medical care provider.

The county still is seeking proposals — even though Armor, which aggressively has defended its quality of care, has said it plans to leave once its contract expires next month. On Monday, a spokesman for Mangano said the county is discussing a “contingency plan” with Nassau University Medical Center, which is next door to the jail.
Even as the search for a more permanent solution continues, however, Nassau would do well to consider more than savings.

LOS ANGELES-Ben Affleck is reportedly ‘ready to move on' from his estranged wife Jennifer Garner after they filed for divorce last week. The 44-year-old actor and the ‘13 Going on 30' actress officially filed for divorce last week, and sources now claim the Hollywood hunk is making the next steps to start up new relationships.
According to TMZ.com, the ‘Justice League' actor is already dating someone new, although the source claims it's ‘'not serious''. An insider told the publication: ‘'He's ready to move on.''
The news comes after it was reported last week that both Ben and Jennifer, 45, are still living together as their main focus in their three children, Violet, 11, Seraphina, eight and Samuel, five.
A source said at the time: ‘'They are figuring out what to do about their future living arrangements. For now, they are all living together. One thing they agree on - the kids will stay at the family house.
‘'Jen and Ben will focus on making things as smoothly as possible for the kids. It's all about what's best for them. The kids went to school as usual, Jen and Ben took turns with drop-off and pick-up. Ben spent alone time with Violet after school. They went for ice cream in Santa Monica.''
Meanwhile, it was previously revealed that Ben and Jennifer are still ‘'100 percent committed'' to co-parenting their children.
A source said: ‘'Everything today couldn't have been done more amicably. The divorce filing was only a matter of time. Ben and Jen are both still 100 percent committed to co-parenting their children and making sure their family situation works for them all. You can't have anything better than that.''
The pair is both requesting joint and legal custody of their children during their divorce proceedings and are ‘'die-hard committed'' to raising their brood.
The insider claimed at the time: ‘'They have maintained such a strong and beautiful united front to stay lovely and classy towards each other for their kids. They spend so much time working on their relationship - whether it's a friendship or anything - for their kids ...
‘'Their friendship is there. They are so die-hard committed to co-parenting. Whatever form this relationship is, they'll always have love for each other, and the love they have for their kids is so strong, they won't let anything bring that down.''
BOSTON - For a brief moment, the Boston Red Sox tried to use small ball to win against the Toronto Blue Jays. With a runner on first in the sixth inning, Xander Bogaerts popped out on a bunt attempt, handing the Blue Jays an easy out.
But when J.D. Martinez came to the plate one batter later, he did what he does best - hit the long ball. Martinez blasted a 434-foot home run over the Green Monster to lead the Red Sox to a 6-4 win Wednesday. It was Martinez's 18th home run of the year, and it came when the team needed it.
With the win, the Red Sox improve to 39-17 on the season, and complete a series sweep over the Blue Jays. The Red Sox lead Toronto by 14 games in the standings, and hold a 2 1/2 game lead over the New York Yankees before New York faces the Astros later Wednesday night.
Eduardo Rodriguez was brilliant on the afternoon, retiring the first 13 batters he faced until Kendrys Morales lined a single up the middle in the fifth inning. Rodriguez was efficient with his pitches, throwing 70 of his 100 pitches for strikes. He only allowed two runs on three hits and one walk while striking out seven through 6 2/3 innings pitched. He received a loud ovation from the crowd as he left the field.
The Red Sox got on the board first in the bottom of the third inning when Jackie Bradley Jr. drove in Blake Swihart with an RBI double off of the green monster. It was Bradley Jr's third RBI in as many games after not recording one for an 18-game stretch. The Red Sox outfielder has found his groove at the plate lately, recording four doubles and a triple in his last nine games.
Boston had a chance to put a few more runners across the plate in the third inning, but had some bad luck with close calls. First, Andrew Benintendi was ruled out when trying to steal second base after a video replay review overturned an initial safe call. Then, Bradley Jr. tried to run home on a passed ball while he was at third base, but video review ruled he was tagged out on the play as well.
Video review could not overturn the Red Sox' next run, however, as Eduardo Nunez launched a home run just over the Green Monster for a solo shot. It was Nunez's fourth home run of the season and his first since May 1 against the Kansas City Royals.
The Blue Jays finally answered back in the sixth inning, when Gio Urshela drew a two-out walk and Teoscar Hernandez drove him in with a home run. It was Hernandez's eighth home run of the season, and it briefly tied the game until Martinez homered in the bottom half of the inning.
Boston rallied again in the bottom of the eighth inning, with Nunez and Brock Holt both driving in runs. Those runs proved to be important, as the Red Sox' bullpen nearly imploded in the top of the ninth inning.
Brian Johnson was removed from the game after three pitches, as the lefty put runners on the corners with nobody out. Craig Kimbrel came in and allowed a walk and a two-run double to Justin Smoak and Kendrys Morales, respectively, which put the tying run on second base. Kimbrel forced a ground out, a strikeout and a ground out over the next three batters though, and earned his 18th save of the season.
Next up for the Red Sox is a road trip to Houston, where they'll take on the defending World Series-champion Houston Astros in a four-game series.
The clinical commissioning groups in Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Luton, together with the East of England Ambulance Service (EEAST), have continued to make good progress to put in place a reliable transport service for patients that use the service.
Transport services have been working well, with patients picked up on time and attending their outpatient appointments.
A spokesman for the health groups said: “It is usual for there to be fewer outpatient appointments at hospitals at the weekend.
“Nevertheless, we have obtained a list of appointments so we have a clear picture of when transport is required over the weekend and on Monday.
“This has ensured we have sufficient staff and transport capacity available, as well as to transport patients home when they are fit to leave.
“As a precautionary measure, we have arranged for the contact centre to be open over this weekend in case patients need to talk to someone urgently about existing transport arrangements.”
The number is 01603 481208 and will be open 8am to 6pm with an answer machine service operating outside of these hours.
Epic Games' massively popular survival-battle royale game “Fortnite” is finally heading to China thanks to a ¥100 million investment from Tencent, the company announced at a press conference according to Gamesindustry.biz.
Tencent, which owns 40% of Epic Games, will split that ¥100 million ($15.8 million) two ways: half of the money will be used to make in-game content and support video content creators, while the other half is used to push the game as an esport in the country. This seems to be just another addition to Tencent's plan to create a ¥100 billion esports in China by 2020.
“Fortnite,” though a mega-success in the countries like the United States, has yet to come out in China. Though with the backing of Tencent, and with the company's recent push for Chinese esports, it stands to reason Epic's popular free-to-play game will continue to be a success overseas. The game made $126 million in February of this year through in-app purchases alone. On mobile, the game reportedly made $25 million in its first month.
Tencent, a mammoth video game and social media company based out of China, is probably the best partner Epic could've asked for with bringing its game to China. Along with owning part of Epic, it also has the rights to publish “Fortnite's” the biggest competitor, “PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds,” in China. The company is also the publisher of the mobile game “Arena of Valor,” which boasts more than 200 million players in China alone. Tencent's CEO, Ma Huateng, is currently China's richest person.
For all intents and purposes, “Fortnite” should not be as popular as it is. Releasing in July of 2017, after six years of development, the game was met with middling reviews from critics. However, after adding a battle royale mode in the wake of the success of “PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds” last September, the game's popularity has been unrivaled, even being played by popular streamers such as Ninja and rappers such as Drake.
Bolt from blue as he calls United TV
LONDON - Usain Bolt showed his love for Manchester United when the sprint star made a surprise phone call to the Premier League club's in-house television channel on Saturday. In the traditional post-match phone-in on MUTV following United's 2-1 win over Middlesbrough, presenter Mandy Henry introduced the next caller as being a "Usain from Jamaica" and added: "It's not Usain Bolt, is it?" Bolt replied: "It is Usain Bolt." Henry still looked disbelieving as Bolt gave his opinion on United's win, saying: "They came through like the old Man United. They came through and pushed on and persevered, the United way. It was a great match, I am very happy about this." Bolt then tweeted to confirm it was indeed him, with Henry replying to the Jamaican apologising and telling him to call again soon.–AFP
Swansea set to hire Clement
LONDON - Premier League strugglers Swansea City are set to appoint Bayern Munich assistant Paul Clement as their new manager, according to British media reports. Former Derby boss Clement has been in talks with Swansea over the last 24 hours to become the troubled Welsh club's third manager of a difficult season at the Liberty Stadium. It is reported the deal could be finalised over the next 48 hours before Swansea visit Crystal Palace on Tuesday. Clement will succeed Bob Bradley, who was sacked this week after a miserable 85-day reign. Former US coach Bradley had replaced Italian Francesco Guidolin in October. Clement emerged as the favourite to succeed Bradley after Swansea's top target Chris Coleman chose to close the door on making an emotional return to his hometown club.–AFP

'Jeopardy!' Contestants Fumble Entire Football Category, To Coach Trebek's Dismay
Jeopardy! YouTube
When Alex Trebek is disappointed in you, he lets you know. And in a clip from Thursday's episode of Jeopardy! Trebek looked like he wanted to weep.
After clearing the rest of the board in Double Jeopardy, the lone remaining category was "Talkin' Football."
It soon became clear why the contestants — Ryan, Sara and Justin – had avoided it.
The first question, for $200: Your choice: Do or don't name this place in which the QB runs the ball & can choose to pitch it to another back.
The contestants stand still — no manic mashing of buzzers here.
"It's an option play," says Trebek after the beep, with evident concern.
There was nowhere to go but down. Ryan, laughing resignedly, orders up the next embarrassment.
"I can tell you guys are big football fans," Trebek says.
For $400: Tom Landry perfected the shotgun formation with this team.
But there was just no way. Sara and Justin grin widely. They have nothing.
Trebek suggests perhaps they just go to commercial, but the sacks continue through the next two questions.
"Let's look at the $1,000 clue just for the fun of it," Trebek then says to audience laughter.
The last is, painfully, a video clue from the Vikings' stadium in Minneapolis in advance of Sunday's Super Bowl.
"If you guys ring in and get this one," Trebek says, "I will die."
Spoiler alert: They don't.
The show's Twitter feed kept dishing the sass Thursday night and dragged poor, long-suffering Cleveland into the mess.
"Fun fact," the show tweeted. "Our contestants answered as many clues in this category as the @Browns had wins this season."
Full disclosure: This writer wouldn't have rung in, either.

More than a dozen tractor-trailers lined up beneath a Detroit-area freeway overpass to aid police trying to help a man contemplating suicide.Michigan State Police Lt. Michael Shaw said troopers received a call early Tuesday about the man standing on an overpass above Interstate 696 in Huntington Woods. As officers routed traffic away, they directed truckers to drive into positions to shorten the fall if the man jumped.Thirteen trucks lined the freeway as police dealt with the man. The incident lasted about four hours until he walked off to waiting officers and to seek medical help.Shaw says troopers typically work with truckers during such incidents, but it's unusual to have so many involved. He adds there are "many other options out there aside from taking your own life."
Americas younger generation is staggering under student debt loads that will alter the way they participate in traditional American society as they age. Total student debt now stands at $1.4 trillion, more than outstanding vehicle loans and credit card obligations, and second only to mortgages.
On average, college students are accumulating debt at a rate of $8,250 for every year they are in school. Coming out of college already burdened with loans that promise to consume a large chunk of their earnings for decades ahead, the graduates are likely to encounter difficulties when they finance homes. They are also more likely to put off starting families.
The crisis has escalated since 2003, when outstanding student loans totaled $240 billion. Driving the skyrocketing debt is soaring college tuition, and the two share a symbiotic relationship.
Justin Haskins of the Heartland Institute writes that since the federal government first expanded its role in student lending under former President Bill Clinton in 1993, college costs have risen by 190 percent. Just since 2008, average tuition has risen by 25 percent.

As the government took over responsibility for student lending  former President Barack Obama drove private lenders nearly out of the market  conditions for getting loans eased, and were unlinked from financial need.
The federal government basically guarantees that any student, regardless of income, can have access to any college or university, public or private, without regard to whether the student can afford the tuition cost without hefty loans. This has encouraged students to choose schools they might have otherwise passed on, covering the costs with massive loans.
But more significantly, it has freed universities to raise tuition at will, knowing students can get loans to cover the rising costs. As a result, universities have sidestepped the fiscal reckoning of most other institutions and remain aloof to hard financial realities.
A first step to reversing the debt trend is to return lending to the private marketplace. Private lenders would put in place more realistic screening for issuing loans, and be more attuned to the borrowers ability to repay the money.
Obama-era policies limited repayment to 10 percent of a graduates annual income, with up to 25 years to repay the loan. But that insures the student debt will be around their necks until they reach middle age. Trump is promising to shorten the payback period to 15 years by requiring payments of 12.5 percent of income.
A better approach is to avoid the debt in the first place. Indiana has cut student borrowing with a simple financial literacy technique: It sends students a letter detailing their debt and their future monthly payments. After those notices began going out, borrowing at Indiana University dropped 18 percent.
A study by NERA Consulting found that two-thirds of student borrowers were surprised by the details of their obligation, and didnt fully understand the terms of their loans. Fair lending practices are essential when dealing with young borrowers.
But of course the real solution is to hold tuition costs in check. And that starts with bringing greater accountability to universities, particularly in the public realm.
Academic integrity is not compromised by expecting highly paid professors to teach a full class load, nor by asking college deans to trim the excesses from their budgets. Graduates from should leave college full of bright dreams for the future, not with nightmarish debt loads.

FILE PHOTO: A man opens the shutter of a shop painted with an advertisement of Reliance Communications in Mumbai, India, November 3, 2015.
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian telecoms carrier Reliance Communications (RCom) posted its third straight quarterly loss on Saturday as its heavy debt load and a price war triggered by an upstart rival continued to weigh on sales and profit.
RCom, controlled by billionaire Anil Ambani, has won a reprieve on its debt until the end of the year as it works on two asset sale deals that it expects will reduce its $7 billion debt by about 60 percent.
On Saturday, it reported a net loss of 12.21 billion Indian rupees ($190.38 million) for its fiscal first quarter ended June, against a profit of 540 million rupees a year earlier.
Revenue from operations fell 33.6 percent year-on-year to 34.94 billion rupees, while finance costs rose to 9.98 billion rupees.
The company's continued losses are, in part, a result of competition from free voice and cut-price data plans offered by Reliance Jio Infocomm, the telecom startup backed by Ambani's elder brother Mukesh.
Jio has upended India's uber-competitive telecom sector, forcing all incumbents to drop prices despite falling margins and profits.
But RCom's struggle with its debt load and little success with its initial bet on a network based on CDMA technology have also led to its current financial situation.
RCom, whose mobile phone unit is India's seventh-ranked carrier with 82.3 million customers as of end-May, is awaiting regulatory approval for a merger of the unit with rival Aircel. It has also agreed a deal with Canada's Brookfield to sell a stake in its mobile masts business.
The company has previously said it expected the transactions to close by September.
Worries over the company's ability to repay debt have led to a series of downgrades by ratings agencies and the company's stock has plummeted 39 percent so far this year compared with an 18 percent rise of a broader Mumbai market.

The Robins are now in tenth place with 66 points, three from Millwall in sixth spot with two games remaining of the season.
City take on Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United knowing they need maximum points and hope their rivals slip-up again.
There are as many as nine different teams vying with City for a play-off place, with three of those Cardiff City, Fulham and Aston Villa, already confirmed of their place and likely to face The Robins should City reach 5th or 6th place.
Birmingham Live takes a look at the sides that City could come up against in the semi-final and final, were they to make the cut.
Cardiff City
Top six finish odds: Neil Warnock's side have already secured their spot in the play-offs but could still go up automatically as they sit in 2nd, one point above Fulham with a game in hand. They are 2/7 to finish in the top two.

What Neil Warnock says
“I would say (Norwich win was) our best result of the season, and it's all still in our own hands. If we keep winning no-one can catch us.
“Norwich are a good side, and we made a bit of a slow start, but I thought we defended really well. The back four were excellent, and Bruno (Ecuele Manga) when he came on, but I thought Sean Morrison stood out. I'd give him 12 out of 10.
“What I love about the Championship, is being in charge of sides like these, a group of lads who are brave and honest and will go out there and die for you, week in, week out.”
Key player
Junior Hoilett – The tricky winger has been integral for Neil Warnock's side this season, creating chances for his teammates as well as chipping in with 9 league goals. Most of Cardiff's attacking play goes through Hoilett.
Fulham
Top six finish odds: Fulham have already secured their play-off spot and could sneak into the top two if Cardiff slip up. The Cottagers are 4/6 to gain automatic promotion.
Form: Fulham have claimed 17 points from 21 and have not lost a game in their last svven. They are the in form team in the league at this current time and they secured a vital 3-0 win over Millwall on Friday night.

“Now we are thinking about last season, thinking about Watford and different steps – actually it's not necessary right now.
“For us, we are a different team and at the end we learn some things from the past but I am not thinking so much about these things.
“Great challenege is in front of us, this season we will have one or two chances in front of us for fighting to be promoted, we will push for the first chance and if we need to be ready for it we will be ready for the next chance too.”
Key player
Aleksander Mitrovic – Newcastle United loanee Mitrovic has 12 goals in his last 12 games and is in brilliant form.
Aston Villa
Top six finish odds: Aston Villa have already secured a top six finish and there is an unlikely chance they could finish in the top two if Fulham and Cardiff slip up. Villa are 3/1 to win promotion.
Form: Villa have claimed 13 points from a possible 21 in the last seven games, losing away fixtures to Bolton and Norwich. Their home form has been much better, winning their last three at Villa Park.

“We'll look forward to the challenge (the play-offs) if that's the way it goes for us.
“Theyre great games to be involved in. If you can get past the semi-final and have a big day out at Wembley, then there's nothing better.
“I've had the fortune of doing it twice through the play-offs. If it needs to be, let's hope it's lucky the third time around as well.”
Key player
Jack Grealish – The 22 year-old attacking midfielder has had his best season in a Villa shirt and chipped in with plenty of assists for his side.
Middlesbrough
Top six finish odds: Boro are the best place team out of six sides that haven't already secured a play-off spot as they sit in 5th on 72 points. Tony Pulis' side are 11/4 to go up.
Form: Boro have had mixed results in their last seven games, winning three times, drawing twice and losing twice. Their victory at Derby was a real statement of intent.

“The team has been very up and down at times, but I felt today we had a settled performance.
“I'm pleased with the result of course but I'm more pleased with the application from the players.”
Key player: Adama Traore – The ex-Aston Villa winger has been a potent threat on the wing for Boro this season with his pace and dribbling giving full-backs nightmares. Traore has scored 5 league goals in 23 starts this campaign.
Millwall
Top six finish odds: Millwall have somehow crept into 6th place after a great run of form, level on points with Middlesbrough. Derby has a game in hand on them and are just one point behind. Neil Harris' side are 20/1 to go up..

“Middlesbrough, Derby, Bristol City and Brentford think they should be in the play-offs. Villa and Fulham fans expect themselves to win promotion. We don't expect anything.
“All I expect from my players is a desire and work ethic. What I do know is that if we did get in there, then we'd be a tough team to stop because it would be our third year in a row.”
Key player
Jed Wallace – Another winger who has shone for a play-off contender, Wallace has been superb this season in supplying chances for the Millwall forwards and has six goals and nine assists to his name.
Derby County
Top six finish odds: Derby have dropped down to 7th after being in the top six for the majority of the season.
The Rams do have a game in hand on the teams around them and if they can take advantage of that they will put themselves in a great position to claim a top six finish. They are 10/1 to go up.
Form: Derby are suffering their end of season collapse that seems to happen a lot recently in previous seasons. Gary Rowett's side did look to get out of this rut with two wins on the bounce against Preston and Bolton before a run of defeats.

“If you work harder than the opposition and show more endeavour, and if you have got better players quality-wise, then you should win the game.
“If you don't do the first two things, then you are going to give yourself a really difficult chance of winning.
“We didn't compete enough, we did not show enough drive.
“I have said to the players in there, ‘I am not sure how many of you really want to put yourself out and get in the play-offs'.
“That is a disappointing thing for me to say because I don't like making comments like that.”

What Alex Neil says
“We've got as good a chance as anybody else in that area.
“What we've got to do is focus on ourselves. Whatever happens elsewhere, if we don't win we're not going to get there.
“We've got to keep going, win our games and then we'll see what happens.
“A lot of the teams around us have got each other to play, but we have got some points to claw back.”
Key player
Tom Barkhuizen – Once again another winger shining in the Championship this season. Barkhuizen has eight goals and seven assists this season and has had a massive impact in games this season for Preston.
Sheffield United
Top six finish odds: Sheffield United have dropped off recently after a brilliant start to the season. The Blades have had a superb first season back in the Championship following their promotion from League One last season. They are now 250/1 to win promotion.
Form: The Blades have only won once in their last seven, drawing four of those fixtures. They claimed an important victory over Middlesbrough before a 1-1 draw with Millwall. However the defeat to Birmingham makes it an uphill battle.

At Bramble Lane: Sheffield United 1-2 Bristol City
What Chris Wilder says
“It was the right result (against Millwall). From our point of view we couldn't quite find the quality and when we did we weren't clinical.
“From our point of view it was a porr goal to give away, especially after getting our noses in front in a tight game.
“This doesn't enhance our chances but the picture can change in the space of a week because this division is so unpredictable. We're waiting and relying on other results but the season is still alive with three games to go.”
Key player
Leon Clarke – The striker has scored 18 goals for the season now and has continued his fine form from League One into the Championship.
Brentford
Top six finish odds: Brentford are now up to eighth, just one point off the Lions in sixth.
Form: The Bees are unbeaten in seven games, winning four and drawing three. They beat City, Ipswich Town and Nottingham Forest all 1-0 before salvaging a late point at high-flying Fulham in their last game. Saturday's 2-1 win over QPR keeps them well in the mix.

“We have been playing catch up since not winning for the first eight games.
“I'm really proud of the team. The lads don't give up, and we are disappointed that we don't have the points tally we feel we deserve, but we are playing catch-up after a slow start to the season.
Key player
Ollie Watkins – The forward has ten goals in 37 starts for The Bees and is their most dangerous player from an attacking point of view.
Bristol City
Top six finish odds: The Robins are now 100/1 to win promotion after their 5-5 draw with Hull City.
Current form: Three defeats in the last seven and no away win since December. It doesn't look promising.

Lee Johnson says
“I think we've got to give it a right go to win the last three games. I think we can win on any given day – you saw that today that we had moments in the game.
“Obviously we went 1-0 in front and we've got three games that are winnable for us.
“If we're at it. And that's my point. We have to have as many players as possible being 8s, 9s and 10 because we're not a club with huge resources that can have those quality decision makers.
“Our boys are learning in flight and improving and have to take the lessons from big games like this.”
Key player: That's easy Bobby Reid. The youngster glides around the pitch causing mayhem in pockets of space. No player has been involved in more goals in terms of assists (six) and goals scored (18).

The shares of social media giant Facebook plunged Monday as it was heavily criticized at home and abroad over misuse of data.
According to reports, a firm working for Donald Trump's presidential campaign harvested and misused data on 50 million members.
Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy called for the company's head Mark Zuckerberg to appear before Congress, along with Google and Twitter's CEOs.
The lawmakers said the companies “have amassed unprecedented amounts of personal data” and that the lack of oversight “raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights.”
Speaking on this, Facebook's chief of security Alex Stamos said his role has shifted to focusing on emerging risks and election security at the global social network.
He said, “Despite the rumors, I'm still fully engaged with my work at Facebook.
“It's true that my role did change. I'm currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.”

PanARMENIAN.Net - Lorde held a surprise pre-Coachella gig on Friday night, April 14. During the show, the "Royals" hitmaker debuted some tracks from her upcoming album "Melodrama", including "Sober", "Green Light Intro" and a "Sober Interlude", AceShowbiz said.
Lorde announced on Twitter her surprise show at Pappy & Harriets with tickets priced at $20 in celebration of her 20th birthday. "I'm playing my first show in 2 and a half years tonight at midnight. PAPPY & HARRIET'S, pioneertown. see you there," she wrote, "$20 tickets because i'm 20 and because i love you. let's get raucous before coachella on sunday night AHH."
Lorde was surprised when the tickets were sold out immediately. It was her first full-length gig since July 2014.
"Melodrama" is set to be released on June 16.
It is extremely complex, as is today's world, to exactly define a good health system.
World Health Organisation (WHO) defines it to include personal and public health services through inter-sectorial initiatives that primary action is to make better health.
The health enhancing interventions like road safety and pollution free environment are also part of system with traditional public health activities of health promotion.
A country needs health system that protects all citizens against health and financial risks of illness.
The individual physical dignity and integrity is recognized in international law.
Health systems need to ensure that people be treated with respect, according to their human rights.
It's not just the financial expenditure made by governments for health systems that matters, but the strategies and procedures for health system effectiveness.
Amongst many parameters to define good health care system polio eradication constitutes a fundamental parameter to gauge a country's performance towards ameliorating health care.
There was a time, not too long ago, when Pakistan actually became polio free but one of the fallout of war against terror is the massive exodus of people resulting in high levels of dislocation.
Added to this is the arcane belief system that considers vaccination un-Islamic, which has caused the spread of polio in the country.
The considerable decrease in polio cases has started paying dividends, as the country has been chosen, for the first time in 21 years, to host a prestigious regional conference of health ministers, to be held this month.
In the conference, to be held in Pakistan, health ministers from 22 countries in South Asia, the Middle East, West Asia and North Africa would participate.
Without a shadow of doubt it is a great achievement.
The purpose of the conference is to discuss various chronic diseases, including polio, TB, malaria and AIDS, etc.
and to hammer out strategies about how the region could be made safer.
According to the data shared by the ministry, Pakistan witnessed a drastic decrease in polio cases, which at one time rose to such an alarming situation that the world was planning to impose a travel ban on Pakistani citizens.
However, due to the Health Ministry's concerted and coordinated efforts, coupled with the efforts made by the provincial governments, Pakistan brought the polio cases to just two cases in 2017.
According to year-wise breakup, a gradual decrease took place.
In 2014, a total of 306 cases were reported across the country, 55 in 2015, while in 2016, the polio cases have been reduced to only 20.
However, in 2017, so far, only two cases have been reported, and the world greatly acknowledged Pakistan's efforts in eradicating polio from the country.
Pakistan's progress towards zero polio has been highly appreciated by international donors and development partners in the recently-held regular quarterly briefing to the donors' community in Pakistan.
After recording the lowest ever number of polio cases in 2016, the program has successfully maintained the momentum in 2017.
It was all possible because the prime minister had declared polio eradication as one of the key priorities, placing it as the priority agenda No.
1 of the health sector, which is intractably linked to Sustainable Development Goals and the National Health Vision 2025.
At the provincial level, the task forces led by chief ministers and chief secretaries, with the support of respective Emergency Operations Centres are driving this sustained performance.
As many as 3,500 delegates from 194 countries participated at the World Health Assembly, deliberating diverse issues like accelerating the fight against the growing burden of non-communicable diseases across the world, strengthening preparedness for the cross-border spread of epidemics, access to universal health care, eradication of polio, strengthening routine immunization among others.
Progress made by Pakistan towards improvement in health sector has been highly acknowledged and appreciated by health gurus across the globe.
Pakistan also presided over side events on implementation of international health regulations, universal health coverage, diabetes, tuberculosis control, nutrition, eye health, and blood safety, where the country's strategies and plans of action were appreciated by the participating countries.
This conference is beginning of the many, yet to come, accolades for Pakistan for superior performance in the health sector.

Both local and international experience cautions that a monopoly wireless open access network will fail to achieve its objectives of improving access to telecommunications and reducing prices.
South Africa's government always stands ready to intervene when it perceives a so-called market failure. The price of data, especially on mobile networks, is high by international standards, while access to communications services is not yet universal.
Whether or not this is a “market failure” is, of course, impossible to say. Is it a market failure that one has to pay more for something than one would perhaps wish to pay, or does that price simply reflect the realities of costs and competition, supply and demand?
Without perfect information, which nobody – and least of all the government – has, it is often hard to tell whether a price is high or low. If it were easy to discover the “correct” price of things, investment managers would be able to predict stock and commodity prices; instead they have to take educated guesses.
If there is a failure, however, it can easily be attributed to the government's own restrictive and controlling telecommunications policy over the years. Two decades ago, it gave Telkom a monopoly on landline services and a mandate to expand service to the poor. Telkom failed miserably in that objective.
The private foreign company that government enlisted as a “strategic equity partner” bled Telkom for all it was worth, under-investing in its network and overpricing its products. Internet service providers, while very price-competitive against each other, could buy wholesale internet bandwidth only from the Telkom monopoly, and, to stay viable, were forced to pass these high data costs on to customers. To make matters worse, they had to compete with their own supplier for retail customers.
When the monopoly finally ended, there were fewer landlines in operation than before, reaching less than 10% of the population. Despite the government's best intentions, the Telkom monopoly is now widely regarded as having been the single biggest obstacle to faster, more widespread internet access in South Africa.
In the mobile space, government licensed two private operators in the belief that cellular telephones were merely toys for rich people and would never sell more than perhaps a million units. Ten years later, a third operator was licensed.
The low limit on the number of licences put a firm lid on price competition. Even so, private mobile operators managed to get cellular telephones into the hands of 90% of the population, invented pre-paid to cater for customers who were not credit-worthy, and even developed services like “call me” for customers who had no money at all. These private operators have done more for connectivity in South Africa than the government has ever done.
Licences have become more freely available, but the market remains highly concentrated, restricted by high regulatory barriers to entry. As a consequence, prices – particularly for data services – have not fallen as far as one might have hoped from the artificial highs caused by the monopoly government once created.
The government's perverse answer to this problem is to propose a new monopoly, again owned and operated by a private consortium hand-picked by the government.
Taking advantage of the radio-frequency spectrum that will be opened up by the switch from analogue to digital television, the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) White Paper released by the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services proposes to create a monopoly wireless open access network (WOAN), to which all operators will surrender their spectrum by the end of their current licence periods, and from which operators would then lease spectrum back at wholesale rates.
One argument is that it will prevent duplication of infrastructure. The hope is, of course, that this will enable more efficient use of capital to reach under-serviced areas and a neutral entity that can sell bandwidth at regulated – and presumably cheap – prices to operators both old and new.
That runs into an old economic fallacy, however. What is less expensive? One railway line between Johannesburg and Cape Town, or two? The government's answer would be one, since two lines require twice the capital outlay. The private sector's answer would be two, since those two lines would compete, so passengers and freight customers would enjoy lower prices and higher quality service.
The WOAN proposal is the exact opposite of what industry observers have long sought: privatising most of the radio spectrum and making it freely tradable. In principle, it is comparable to mineral rights, which the state has expropriated and now owns and leases back to mining companies on its own terms. It is also comparable to Julius Malema's proposals about land, which he wants government to own and lease back to citizens.
Besides the obvious economic arguments against monopolies, such as that they destroy both market competition and the power of the price mechanism, there exist sound case studies that suggest a WOAN probably won't work. Gary Moore, a South African lawyer and researcher for the Free Market Foundation has produced case studies from four countries that have tried it: Kenya, Mexico, Russia and Rwanda.
Kenya's national broadband policy in 2011 proposed a WOAN to fast-track the roll-out of 4G services. According to Moore, it would be built, financed and operated by public-private partnership with a consortium including the main telecommunications operators. By 2013, the largest operator, Safaricom, had pulled out in despair at the “glacial pace” of developments. In 2014, it was noted that neighbouring countries had already rolled out 4G, while Kenya was still stuck with 3G.
By 2015/16, the Kenyan WOAN was essentially “dead in the water”. Other government regulations, such as mandatory infrastructure sharing to eliminate “wasteful duplication”, were also abandoned. In 2017, the international club of mobile network operators, the GSM Association, declared that the fate of the Kenyan WOAN project highlighted how complicated the single wholesale network model was. It never did deliver the services it was meant to, writes Moore.
In Mexico, a WOAN had been planned for construction beginning in 2014, to be fully operational by 2018. The objective was much the same as in South Africa, namely, to establish a non-discriminatory wholesale provider that would charge “competitive” rates (although competitive with what is unclear in a monopoly environment). This would, the government maintained, encourage new retail customers to enter the market and bring affordable broadband to almost the entire population.
The network failed to materialise within the original time frame. Eventually, writes Moore, a monopoly licence to construct and operate the network was awarded in late 2017 to the only private-sector bidder that qualified, a multinational consortium. Building on existing state-owned infrastructure, it was required to begin providing services in March 2018, but it has only just connected its first customers. Full network roll-out to 92% of the Mexican population is only expected by 2024.
The Mexican WOAN operates with an untested business model, with few potential customers, and with the open hostility of the country's retail telcos. Yet, according to Moore, experts consider Mexico's regulatory and market environment more conducive to the successful establishment of a WOAN than it is in South Africa.
The lengthy delays in both Kenya and Mexico are reminiscent of the disastrous regulatory delays in South Africa's own telecommunications history, which impeded the establishment of a third mobile operator, a second national operator, digital terrestrial television, and a host of other developments that would have happened more rapidly under open market conditions.
The sentiment towards Mexico's WOAN operator likewise reminds one of the hostility towards Telkom in South Africa, which was responsible for keeping prices high, failing to upgrade networks to accommodate growing demand, competing with its own customers, and delaying the roll-out of new network technologies that would benefit end-users.
Russia established a wholesale 4G network monopoly in 2010. Known as Yota, it was given not only available spectrum, but also spectrum taken from existing network operators, as is the intention in South Africa. The goal with Yota was also to avoid network infrastructure duplication while providing mobile retailers with bandwidth that would result in faster access and lower prices for customers. Coverage was expected to reach 180 cities and 70-million people by 2014.
By 2015, the project had failed, according to Moore. Yota resembled Telkom, in that it competed against its own customers, which resulted in unattractive wholesale prices. Other retailers rebelled and went their own way with building 4G networks. A revived plan to establish a shared wireless network has also fallen through, despite, as Moore points out, Russia's unusually autocratic ability to dictate terms to companies under its jurisdiction.
Rwanda's WOAN was launched in 2014, in partnership with Korea Telecom under a 25-year licence. It is the sole wholesaler of 4G in the country, according to Moore. However, the network is notoriously unreliable, often falling back to telcos' existing 3G networks. It has also proven to be expensive even though retailers were making little profit reselling the 4G monopoly's bandwidth.
The old-fashioned, slow, but ubiquitous 3G provided by competitive private telcos still dominated the market by 2017, and the international GSM Association reported that Rwanda's monopoly 4G network was unlikely to achieve its coverage, price and competition objectives.
Moore writes that according to the GSM Association, government-mandated wholesale networks have been much slower to expand coverage, perform upgrades and to embrace new technologies such as 3G and 4G, and can be expected to prompt less innovation than network competition.
This should not be surprising. Because customers have nowhere else to turn, monopolies experience no competitive pressure to keep prices low and to keep improving services. In fact, they have every reason to maximise profit by raising prices and reducing investment in network capacity and new technology. If prices are regulated, then under-investment becomes the only option to improve profits. And when network capacity and quality are also dictated by government, the rate of technological progress will slow to the snail's pace of regulation, leaving the country years, or even decades, behind its peers. Because telecommunications technology develops so rapidly, this would critically hamstring such a network.
Establishing a WOAN in South Africa will merely repeat the disastrous policy the government followed with wired networks when it granted Telkom its monopoly. It severely retarded infrastructure development in South Africa and did not achieve the limited objectives towards universal service that motivated the policy.
In three of the four countries under examination, a WOAN has failed outright, and in the other, sclerosis has already set in. If it cannot learn from its own mistakes, the South African government might consider learning from the mistakes of others. DM

When Magic Johnson arrived at LeBron James' $23 million home Saturday night, they had options of where to finalize a deal that has delivered James to the Los Angeles Lakers.
Perhaps they took the elevator at the three-story mansion to the rooftop terrace and enjoyed views that stretch from downtown Los Angeles to the Pacific Ocean.
Or maybe they retreated to the cigar lounge that sits near the 1,500-bottle wine cellar and separate wine tasting room.
Then again, the soundproof movie theater might have been the ideal retreat. You know, the perfect place to watch highlights of the Showtime Lakers from the 1980s and plot how Magic, as president of operations for the Lakers, and LeBron will construct Showtime 2.0.
And Showtime 2.0 will be spectacular if it's constructed in the same fashion as LeBron's home in the posh Brentwood community, with details readily available online
Santiago Arana, the property developer who doubled as real estate agent, said a series of non-disclosure agreements he signed before the sale went through in November has limited what he and his partner, David Herskowitz, can say.
“The whole goal was for nobody to find out that he bought the house,'' Arana said.
But by now, in Los Angeles, James buying the house is as much a secret as his agreeing to a four-year, $154-million deal with the Lakers.
According to listing details, the 15,846-square foot mansion includes eight bedrooms and 11 bathrooms, four fireplaces and garage space for 10 cars. When the house went on the market last year, The Agency, the realty company that handled the sale, posted this property description:
“Located on one of the most prestigious streets in L.A. with views from downtown to the ocean, this newly constructed estate is a masterpiece of light and design. A generous gated driveway leads to the grand residence, which opens to a soaring great room and custom chef's kitchen with natural French oak and marble floors reclaimed from Spain.
“Four upper level ensuite bedrooms include a luxurious master suite with dual bathrooms, showroom closets and a private patio. A rooftop terrace with direct elevator access offers views to the ocean, while an expansive daylit lower level holds a theater, wine cellar, cigar room with air purifying technology, onyx bar, auto gallery, guest suite and indoor-outdoor gym connecting to a spa with steam room, sauna, shower and massage room.
“Sliding pocket doors off the main level spaces create an effortless indoor-outdoor flow to a sprawling, parklike backyard with an oversized pool and spa, heated dining loggia and outdoor kitchen with BBQ and beer taps.''
Sounds like plenty of space for James, his wife and their three kids. Also the perfect place to have finalized the deal with Magic – and, one day, to celebrate another NBA title.

Iran Focus
London, 11 Dec - An international security conference has reaffirmed the importance of tackling the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen and all other Iranian forces who are supporting terrorism and destabilising the Middle East.
The Manama Dialogue 2017, held in Bahrain this weekend, brought together security and military experts to discuss the joint threats of extremism and terrorism.
Bahrain's Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa explained that the stability and security of the region faced many challenges, especially with the support that terrorists receive from Iran.
He warned that the Iran undermines regional security, destabilises foreign countries, and supports terrorism to implement its own malign agenda.
Terrorism
UAE Minister of State Anwar Gargash said that Iran's proxies are disrupting the region, citing the Houthis who recently assassinated former Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh on the order of Iran in particular.
UK Secretary of Defence Gavin Williamson said that the UK would invest at least £10 million to strengthen counter-terrorism and stressed that terrorism must not only be fought on the ground but also by “shutting down their social media mouthpieces”.
Sheikh Khalid rejected the idea that the Houthis had any positive role to play in rebuilding Yemen as they seek to establish an Iranian-backed terrorist state, citing the role that Iran-backed Hezbollah has in Lebanon.
He said: “This is in addition to [Iran's] smuggling of weapons and explosives and training of terrorists to carry out terrorist operations in Bahrain, Kuwait and other countries."
Missile Programme
Gargash also noted that he was concerned about the missile programme, especially after Iranian-built missiles were fired at Saudi Arabia by the Houthis.
He said: “We're very worried by Iran's missile capability.”
Jerusalem
Gargash and Iraq's Vice President Iyad Allawi expressed fears that Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was a gift to radicalism as radical Islamic terrorists, like Iran, are already using it to stir up sectarian violence.
Qatar
Sheikh Khalid noted that the recent Arab quartet decision to boycott Iran-ally Qatar was a result of attempts by Qatar and Iran to destroy the security and stability of other countries, like Egypt, Yemen, and Libya. He said that Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt, would re-establish relations with Qatar if it agreed to demand, including ending its support for terrorism.
Also in attendance at the annual Manama Dialogue were Iraqi National Security Advisor Faleh al-Fayad, Jordan's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates Ayman Safadi, and Chairman KKR Global Institute General David Petraeus.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats from the House and Senate sent a letter to President Donald Trump on Friday warning him against using the recently released Republican memo as a “pretext” to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein or Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
“Firing Rod Rosenstein, DOJ (Department of Justice) leadership, or Bob Mueller could result in a constitutional crisis of the kind not seen since the Saturday night massacre,” the Democrats wrote, referring to President Richard Nixon's firing of the Watergate scandal special prosecutor in the 1970s.
One iPhone case is much like the other unless it's made of figured walnut wood from a retired woodworker in California and feels like the surface of a finely-sanded and well-made piece of antique cabinetry. That's why Kerf Cases, a Pittsburgh-based manufacturer, is so cool.
The founder, Ben Saks, has been working in wood for most of his life. While working at Carnegie Mellon University he created his first case using a manual milling machine and then, over the next six months, he perfected his design. He became an artist residency at Alpha Lab Gear in 2014 and then joined Techship Pittsburgh where he honed his product. Finally he opened a facility in Pittsburgh's East End.

Saks makes cases for iPhones and the Pixel. They start at $99 and are available in multiple woods including mahogany, cherry, and maple. All of the pieces come from salvaged trees and Saks makes wallets and iPad accessories as well.
“‘Kerf' is the thickness of material removed from a saw blade, usually measured in 1/1000 of an inch. This standard wood working term is important to KerfCase's philosophy, as it represents the precision needed to make our wood iPhone cases,” said Saks. “Every piece of wood has a story, whether it's a piece of reclaimed flooring, or a beautiful burled wood from a local tree which was damaged in a storm. Our woodworking is a continuation of this story, connecting you to the history of the material.”
“Kerf is not a startup, and it took us a long time to realize this. Our value proposition is not something that is scalable like software. By scaling, we would lose the most important aspects of our business. We have grown slowly and organically, through word-of-mouth and a small, dedicated fanbase,” he said.
The case I tested, a deep and dark walnut model, is smooth and cool to the touch and actually amplifies the speaker thanks to the way the wood surrounds the entire phone. It's quite light and feels far nicer than the original rubber case. It's no richly inlaid wooden case hand-made by a blind woodcutter but, I suspect, it's the next best thing.
Emergency crews are responding to a multi-vehicle crash north of Barrie involving a bus coach, officials say.
OPP Const. Peter Leon told CP24 by phone that the vehicle and an SUV collided in the area of Hwy. 26 and Nottawasaga Sideroad in Stayner, northwest of Toronto.
Ornge air ambulance stated that two helicopters are on route to the scene, and that a pediatric team, and a critical care team from Toronto have been dispatched.
Clearview Fire, which services the area, stated on Twitter that there were minor injuries to children and teens on the bus coach.
Five occupants of the SUV sustained serious injuries.
“Fallen London” and “Sunless Seas” studio Failbetter Games is launching a week-long campaign to celebrate indie game developers and their communities.
The first ever #loveindies Week takes place July 16-20 and aims to increase the reviews, ratings, and word of mouth of indie titles.
“Failbetter Games were looking for a way to entice our (fantastic) community to leave more reviews on our games, in order to improve their visibility on stores and build customer trust by (hopefully!) boosting positive review percentages,” the developer explained. “We knew we had thousands of players who hadn't left reviews but who might take a moment to do so if they felt they were part of something bigger, and something that would make a real difference for our team.
“It became obvious that the best way to do this would be a campaign for all indies to get involved with, something fun that brings a bit of positivity to the online games discourse and raises all of us up.”
DEVS! STREAMERS! Get involved with the first ever #loveindies week <3 Celebrate your favourite indies and their incredible communities! IT'S AN INDIE LOVE-IN, PEOPLE <3 Here's the full campaign, inc how you can get involved: https://t.co/vs4WD1MC9m pic.twitter.com/b0Tv9f981J — Hannah Flynn – At Develop on Weds (@itshannahflynn) July 3, 2018
Failbetter has set up a Google Doc with a variety of ways developers, influencers, and streamers can get involved. But, it stresses this event is supposed to be a celebration, not an exchange of swag or freebies for reviews.
“The ask should never be: when we have X reviews we will release this free thing,” it said. “Any giveaways should be open to all, regardless of whether they leave a review or not. Any new content should be available to all. The message should always be: this is a week for us all to celebrate indie games and their amazing communities, here's some free stuff, we love you!”

The deals with the Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU) and a separate bargaining agent, the Association of Management, Administrative and Professional Crown Employees of Ontario (AMAPCEO) representing managerial and professional employees in government must still be ratified by their members.
“No matter what the political context, it is always good news when you have a longer collective agreement because then you have a longer period of workplace stability,” she told reporters.
Treasury Board President Liz Sandals said Wednesday that it made sense to negotiate contract extensions early to avoid any possibility of strikes and interruptions to government services.
The provincial government has signed another quick deal giving thousands of civil servants a 7.5-per-cent raise over four years, prompting accusations the Liberals are buying labour peace for next June's election.
“This is once again about the government looking at their own interests. This is about Liberal Party interest not the greater interest of the province of Ontario.”
“It's no coincidence,” Brown maintained, suggesting the government could have bargained harder to get a better deal for taxpayers.
Progressive Conservative Leader Patrick Brown said renegotiating the two contracts many months before they were to expire is fishy with an election looming on June 7, 2018 and parties already jockeying for position.
Teachers and education workers have also enjoyed contract extensions recently, meaning their contracts won't be up for negotiation before next June's election.
Officials at AMAPCEO said their contract didn't expire until next March, yet the government approached them with an offer last week. Negotiations were completed in less than 24 hours with no demands for concessions, surprising the bargaining team.
“We believe we have negotiated a reasonable extension that protects our current provisions, provides members with fair compensation increases, makes a few significant improvements, and offers stability for the next four years,” AMAPCEO president Dave Bulmer said in a statement.
The deal includes lump sum payments to some members whose salaries have been “red circled” or frozen, and two days a year of leave to care for “unforeseen” issues with dependants and parents.
The OPSEU deal for 7.5 per cent over four years, announced earlier this week, came suddenly because the union didn't expect bargaining to begin until this fall given that its collective agreement was in force until Dec. 31.
Sandals defended the financial terms of the tentative agreements, saying the government is no longer insisting on deals that come at no additional cost to the treasury, which she called “stressful to everybody.
“This time around we've got a little bit more flexibility because we've been able to have a balanced budget,” she said.
“These are actually all contracts that we would be legally required to renegotiate within the next year anyway.”
On the relative ease of talks this time around, Sandals acknowledged the government took a different tack.
“Usually if you're going to have a collective bargaining conversation that is more difficult, you'll have one party starting here and one party starting way over there. And you work toward the middle. What we did this time was we moved quickly to the existing collective agreement, essentially.”
The Liberal government is not now holding any negotiations with other unions whose contracts are about to expire in the coming months, Sandals said, but is open to talking.
“If anybody else approaches us . . . we will talk to them.”

More Canadian drivers than you think are getting busy behind the wheel, according to a new survey released Monday.
A report commissioned by Belair Direct found that 14 per cent of drivers “have engaged in romantic activities,” while three per cent have flossed behind the wheel.
It wasn't just extracurriculars that got Canadians in trouble: three out every 10 drivers admitted to running a red light and disobeying road signs.
Money proved to be just the incentive that drivers needed to fix up their habits. Four-fifths of drivers said they were willing to at least one bad habit if they knew they'd get paid for it. In B.C., that number went up significantly; 96 per cent of the province's drivers were willing to give up a bad habit in exchange for some cash.
On the more wholesome end of the scale, Canucks had some good habits too. Just over half of Canadians sing while driving and 96 per cent wouldn't steal another driver's parking spot.

Islamabad-Senate Standing Committee on National Health Service & Regulations (NHS) on Monday expressed concerns over the performance of Pakistan Medical & Dental Council (PMDC) and asked for improving mechanism of the body.
The meeting was chaired by Senator Sajjad Hussain Turi while Senator Azam Khan Swati, Senator Ateeq Sheikh, Senator Nouman Wazir Khattak, Senator M. Hamza, Senator Ayesha Raza Farooq and officials from National Institute for Health (NIH) and PMDC attended the meeting.
“The Medical and Dental Council (Amendment) Bill, 2017” and “The National Health Care Bill, 2017” tabled by Senator Azam Khan Swati were discussed in meeting held. Senator Azam Khan Swati said that the PMDC is working without any mechanism and doctors in the federal capital are issuing certificates without registration. He alleged that millions of rupees are illegally being earned by issuing fake medical certificates.
Senator Dr Noman Wazir said that the PMDC's registration system is not up to the mark and the council should issue certificates to doctors in one week time. Senator Ateeq Sheikh, while raising the issue of free medical treatment to underprivileged patients, said that people are being provided medical treatment through third party.
The committee also expressed concerns over appointment of new head of Human Organs Transplant Act (HOTA).

IMPERIAL – Imperial Valley College now holds new record of graduates in its history as the class of 2017 graduated with a total of 1,479 students on Saturday June 10 at the DePaoli Sports Gymnasium for the 55th Commencement ceremony. Since the number of students exceeded 2016 alumnus, IVC held two separate ceremonies for the graduates as each received an Associate degree in arts and/or science.
Proud parents and family members waved back to the graduates with a huge smile and a joyful yell as the excited recipients made their way to their seats. The ceremony began with the national anthem sang by the IVC Choral Ensemble.
Victor M. Jaime, IVC superintendent/president, didn't fail to remark the increasing statistics the class of 2017 excelled this year. With the youngest graduate of 18 years old and the oldest of 65 years of age, 41 percent graduated with honors who attained a 3.0 grade-point average or better. Which on top of that, 85 students graduated with distinction with a 3.5 grade-point average and 57 percent earned a 3.0 GPA or better.
“As you can see, the class of 2017 are amongst by far the best of Imperial Valley College.”
Christine Bermudez, Associated Student Government president, reflected the memories and challenges she and her classmates faced in her commencement address. From the several nights of studying or laughing to a favorite professor's jokes, Bermudez expressed with pride how IVC was there for every graduate in its tough and good times.
“IVC made not had been your first choice but IVC was there for your you when you couldn't afford to go to a 4 year college or when you wanted to come back to school after years of working,” said Bermudez.
“Whatever you do, where ever you do, keep pushing and don't stop here. I hope that you show your Arab pride to the whole world. Congratulations class of 2017, you made it!”
District 30 Adjutant, LaTricia Johnson, presented the American Legion Awards to recipients Kyle Deol and Patricia Dymond who were honored for their hard work and dedication for their studies.
One of the alumnus, Cynthia Barajas, graduated with honors and a Associate degree in Liberal Studies and will be transferring to California State Polytechnic University, Pomona this upcoming fall.
“All the faculty, the resources and the school helped me a lot throughout my journey at IVC. I made so many friends here and met great professors.”
Another of the dozens of graduates, Allyson Valenzuela, graduated with distinction and a Associate degree in Behavioral Science and will soon transfer to a university in Alaska to study sociology for the next fall semester.
“Graduation was the best memory at IVC. For next year's graduating class, have motivation and don't give up! It's a very exciting and anticipated moment in everyone's life.”
Well, here we go again.
It's another one of those Super Bowls.
You know, it's one of those Super Bowls in which you don't really care much about who is playing in the big game this Sunday. Heck, there's an even-money chance you don't even know who is playing in the game.
Here in Ohio, we've kind of gotten used to that. If anything, it's become a way of life for neither the Bengals nor the Browns to be in the Super Bowl. Or, in some cases, the playoffs. Or, in the case of the Browns this season, the win column. And until that changes in the year two-thousand-and-never, we are going to be force-fed Super Bowls featuring teams with whom we have no rooting interest.
But that won't stop us from watching because we are American and it is football. If football is going to be played, we are going to watch. Not only will you watch, but you will probably pick a team and root for, because again, we are Americans. There has to be a winner and there has to be a loser — and we need to either be overjoyed or forlorn at the outcome.
Since most folks around here aren't Patriots fans or Eagles fans, it's probably easier to figure out who you hate less and root for the other team. Of course, the knee-jerk reaction is probably to root against the Patriots, because they win all the time — and that gets boring — and because their coach is a troll in a hoodie.
But, I'm going to try to take a little (very little) more scientific approach in choosing who I'm going to be cheering for this Sunday. Here are the criteria I'll be using:
More Ohio State players
Since I much prefer college football to professional football, when choosing which team I'll be rooting for in the big game, I always first look at which team has more former Ohio State players. If the number of Ohio State players on each team is relatively close, I like to subtract the number of Michigan players and come up with a final total.
New England has one Ohio State player, Nate Ebner, on the injured reserve. Philadelphia has two former Buckeyes — Malcom Jenkins and Cameron Johnston — under contract.
So it's fairly close. But Michigan grad Tom Brady is the quarterback and supreme ruler of the Patriots. So minus-1 million points.
Advantage: Eagles
More obnoxious fanbase
I've always said the worst thing about organized sports is rarely the steroid scandals, the point shaving or the groin injuries — but rather, the fans. Nothing spoils a sporting event more than being around boorish fans rooting on their favorite team.
Patriots fans are East coast elites who think titles in professional sports are some sort of birthright. They always want to let you know how knowledgeable they are and how much they suffer with their beloved franchises. This makes them largely insufferable.
Eagle fans threw snowballs at Santa Claus and could, quite possibly, kill you during a game for rooting against the Eagles. But at least they aren't pretentious.
Advantage: Eagles
Better food
Food plays an important role in my life. Probably too important. That being said, I love food from all the different regions of the United States — and when I meet someone from a different part of the country for the first time, I try to stick to two topics of conversation: how good their high school football team is and what sort of food they prefer.
Philadelphia has philly cheesesteaks.
New England has lobsters.
This is a tough one. Advantage: Patriots
Better mascot
I realize this is a pretty arbitrary method of selecting who I'm going to cheer for in the Super Bowl, but since I truly don't care much about either team one way or the other, it's as good as anything else, I suppose.
The Patriots represent all that is right with America. They represent brave men and women willing to throw off the shackles of tyranny. They fought and bled so that this country may remain free (I mean the original patriots, of course. To the best of my knowledge, none of the New England Patriots are actually fighting for freedom).
The Eagles are represented by … well, a bird.
Advantage: Patriots
Final Analysis
Well, what do you know about that? We have a tie. So who will I be rooting for this Sunday? Not the team with Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. Go Eagles.

MONTREAL - Canadian National Railway says it will spend $500 million over the next five years on technology to improve its safety, efficiency and competitive edge, partly in response to the potential threat posed by driverless trucks.
CEO Luc Jobin told an investor conference Wednesday that the country's largest railway will make the investments to improve operations and stay ahead of changes to the trucking sector that are expected to evolve quickly over the next decade.
"These are exciting times where there are unparalleled opportunities to apply technology to advance rail operations and service beyond what was previously possible," he said in Montreal.
CN's plan would see a rise in automation, cutting labour costs spent conducting track inspections, and reduce manual and clerical work, Jobin said. He declined to say how many jobs could be lost.
The railway's efforts are designed to increase revenues or reduce expenses to offset cost pressures it expects to face.
It plans to spend $28 million this year to acquire additional monitoring equipment for the early detection of train defects that would allow it to intervene before problems arise.
CN (TSX:CNR) has already implemented some new technologies, which were on display at the investor conference on Tuesday, and is conducting trials on others. The company is using personal devices such as Readiband to monitor and record employee fatigue and alertness.
It is also testing a process called CanaPux to ship heavy crude from the Alberta oilsands to Asia. The process turns the bitumen into semi-solid pucks that can be more safely loaded and transported. The pucks float, don't dissolve in water or burn, Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets wrote in a report.
CN is also spending $1.2 billion by 2020 to implement Positive Train Control across its network as mandated by the U.S. government. The system uses wireless communications, GPS and onboard computers to alert conductors about track and speed changes while maintaining a safe separation between trains to avoid collisions.
"While we are mindful that some of the technologies are in the pilot phase, the exhibits and presentations we saw on day one of the investor day reaffirm our view that CN Rail is at the forefront of railroad innovation. Moreover, early results have been encouraging," Spracklin added.
With the possibility of elections for treasurer, the Public Service Commission and the state House all appearing on the Oct. 14 ballot, judicial enthusiasts are hoping voters don't forget about the races already underway for those coveted robes and gavels.
There are roughly a half dozen or so high-profile judicial contests that will be voted on this fall around the state, all with the likelihood of placing new personalities on benches.
Right now there's only one Court of Appeal race on the October ballot out of the Orleans portion of the 4th Circuit (1st District, Division B) to replace Judge Paul Bonin.
But another special election in the same circuit (for Division F) is expected to be added too.
The latter becomes vacant this summer when Judge Madeleine M. Landrieu steps down to lead Loyola's law school. Running for his sister's seat will be New Orleans attorney Martin Landrieu, who is also the brother of the mayor.
Among others rumored to be considering one of the two seats are Criminal Court Judge Robin Pittman and Criminal Court Judge Tracey Flemings-Davillier.
With Judge Jeff Cox moving to the Court of Appeal, a vacancy in the 26th Judicial District has political watchers in northwest Louisiana calculating the odds ahead of qualifying in July and the actual vote in the fall.
Lane Pittard, an assistant district attorney, has been running for a few months already and is ahead of the curve. Plus, historically, most every district judge elected in recent years in the 26th was an ADA.
Also being mentioned as a possibility is family law attorney Cynthia L. Carroll-Bridges.
With such a fast start, and institutional support starting to coalesce behind him, Pittard may be able to keep the developing field to a minimum.
The retirement of 18th Judicial District Court Judge James Best has produced a race in the New Roads area that is expected to stay very competitive. Of the three names out there so far, local officials suspect all of them have an equal chance of making it to a Nov. 18 runoff.
Steve Marionneaux certainly looks like a candidate. The cousin for former state Sen. Rob Marionneaux, he's an assistant district attorney who has a turnkey campaign operation should he qualify.
Signs can already be seen around the district for Kevin Kimball, an assistant indigent defender. Like Marionneaux, his family name has deep roots in the region. He counts as a cousin former legislator Clyde Kimball, the husband to former Chief Justice Kitty Kimball.
There's also Lonny Guidroz, an assistant district attorney who is said to be looking at the race. He's well known in the False River area.
LaPolitics News Service will be reporting on other judicial races around the state in the coming weeks.
Adams eyed for seafood gig
Former Rep. Bryan Adams of Jefferson Parish left the Legislature last fall and transitioned into a new position as assistant state fire marshall. Now it looks like he could make another move.
Adams is said to be among the likely candidates being considered for the position of executive director of the Louisiana Seafood Promotion and Marketing Board.
Nominations will be made by the board this week and sent to Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, who has the authority to hire someone and set the salary for the job.
Karen Profita vacated the post recently to take over as the new executive director of Audubon Louisiana.
No other names for the job have surfaced yet, but various stakeholders involved with the board and its mission say they've met with Adams or heard from him about the position.
Big changes in the House
Last week was a time of change for the Louisiana House of Representatives.
Rep. John Schroder, R-Covington, announced he was resigning from the lower chamber to focus on his bid for treasurer.
He even gave his farewell speech on the floor.
“Treat every penny like a dollar, save for a rainy day, everything is on the table when balancing the budget, and everyone should have skin in the game,” he told his soon-to-be former colleagues.
The ongoing special session has altered those plans, however, and Schroder plans to stay in his seat until the Legislature passes a budget.
Rep. Gene Reynolds, D-Minden, likewise made it known that he intends to back away from his gig as chair of the House Democratic Caucus.
“I'm not going anywhere!” he declared this week, adding he wants to remain in the House. “I just like working more behind the scenes.”
An internal election to replace Reynolds has not yet been scheduled.
Finally, after 30 years as the House chaplain, Pastor Ken Ward announced his exit on the floor on Tuesday as well.
They said it
“There is a something else after this something else.”
—Rep. Helena Moreno, D-New Orleans, trying to get to the next thing while being questioned on the House floor
“Your phone is so old it took my text a week to reach you.”
—Rep. Lance Harris, R-Alexandria, to Rep. Jim Morris, R-Oil City

Authorities say one person is dead following a fire caused by a space heater at a Dorchester County home early Monday morning.
According to Dorchester County government officials, the fire happened at a home on the 1500 block of Community Drive in Reevesville.
Crews with the Dorchester County Fire-Rescue received an alarm for a residential structure fire at 1:38 a.m.
"Crews arrived on-scene within minutes, to find a double-wide mobile home engulfed with heavy smoke and fire," county officials said. "Extreme heat, fire, and smoke conditions forced firefighters to attack the fire from a defensive position. After suppressing the fire, a full search of the residence was completed. One citizen perished in the fire."
It took firefighters 45 minutes to bring the fire under control.
Dorchester County EMS and the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office also responded to the scene.
"A space heater has been ruled the cause of the fire," county officials said."No other injuries were reported. The American Red Cross is assisting two displaced residents."
County officials released the additional following information.
According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), 40 percent of home heating fires and 84 percent of home heating fire deaths involve space heaters. Buying a safe space heater is only half the battle, using it safely is the other half. Below are a few Do's and Don'ts to keep in mind when using space heaters.
Do's:
Use a space heater that has been tested to the latest safety standards and has been certified by a nationally recognized testing laboratory. These heaters have the most up-to-date safety features. Older space heaters may not meet newer safety standards.
Always follow the manufacturer's directions for proper use.
Place the heater on a level, hard, nonflammable surface, such as a ceramic tile floor.
Keep the heater at least three feet away from bedding, drapes, furniture, and other flammable materials.
Keep children and pets away from space heaters.
Turn the heater off if you leave the area.
Don'ts:
Never leave a space heater on when you go to sleep.
Don't place a space heater close to any sleeping person.
Never use gasoline in a kerosene space heater, as even small amounts of gasoline mixed with kerosene can increase the risk of fire.
Don't use portable propane space heaters indoors or in any confined space unless they are specifically designed for indoor use.
Also, be sure to place smoke alarms on every level of your home, outside of sleeping areas and inside each bedroom. Guard against carbon monoxide (CO) poisonings as well by installing carbon monoxide alarms in your home. Make sure that your batteries in all alarms are fresh and working.
Citizens are also reminded to ensure they have, working, lifesaving smoke alarms in their residence. All Dorchester County residents can request a smoke alarm be inspected and/or installed in their home by completing the online request form and/or by contacting DCFR Headquarters at (843) 563-0214.
Note: Residents who live in the municipal limits of the City of North Charleston or the Town of Summerville should contact their respective departments, who operate similar programs.

Lady Gaga and British royal Prince William have teamed up to encourage mental health sufferers to speak out about their issues.
The Born This Way singer was filmed having a FaceTime conversation with the Duke of Cambridge to discuss how she felt about being open about her struggles with mental health issues, including post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and how important it was to talk about it.
“It made me very nervous at first,” she said, speaking from the kitchen of her Los Angeles home. “There's a lot of shame attached to mental illness - you feel like something's wrong with you. In my life I go, ‘oh my goodness, look at all these beautiful, wonderful things that I have' and I should be so happy but you can't help it if in the morning when you wake up you are so tired, you are so sad, you are so full of anxiety...”
Prince William suggested other sufferers should be as open as the singer because it will help break the stigma attached to mental health and can make a huge difference to each person, who could suffer more further down the line if they keep quiet.
Gaga agreed, saying, “Even though it was hard, the best thing that could come out of my mental illness was to share it with other people and let our generation as well as other generations know that if you are feeling not well in your mind, that you're not alone... we have to make the strongest, most relentless attempt we can to normalize mental health issues so that people feel like they can come forward.”
Prince William ended the conversation by asking her to visit his royal residence Kensington Palace when she visits London on tour later this year. He also thanked her for supporting the Heads Together campaign, which is also championed by his brother Harry and wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.
Sharing their video, Gaga tweeted, “Thanks to Prince William & @heads_together for inviting me to join this important conversation around mental health awareness #oktosay.”

Their video came just days after Prince Harry confessed he shut down his emotions and refused to think about his mother Princess Diana's death in 1997, when he was aged 12.
LAHORE - Withdrawing advertisements in newspapers, the Punjab University administration has extended the date for submission of applications for the post of Associate professors and professors, The Nation has learnt.
Sources have told The Nation that PU vice chancellor Dr Zafar Moeen Nasir wanted to recruit faculty and staff after completing the due process which had been violated in the past.
He has directed the Registrar office to collect lists of standing referees as directed by the LHC and then conduct the selection boards. Earlier, the administration was not updated by different departments and colleges about these lists.
As the Lahore High Court had banned the vice-chancellors on look-after charge including Dr Mujahid Kamran to take any policy decision but he floated some advertisements in the newspapers to appoint faculty members. Inner circles blame the former VC Dr Kamran of PU, the LCWU former VC Dr Uzma Quraishi took policy decisions and tried to recruit faculty to which they were not authorized.
The VCS of the four universities whom the LHC removed from seats were there just to deal with the day-to-day matters of the varsities.
Dr Kamran announced seats for different departments during his look-after charge. He announced two seats of professors for Geography and Pharmacy, five seats of Associate professors for Arabic, Urdu, Kashmiriyat, and Sports Science, sources said. Moreover, many seats of Assistant Professors and lecturers for other departments were also announced.
Source added that the former VC announced seats even for the departments where there was no vacant slot of professor like Geography department while he didn't announce any seat in the departments where four seats of professors and Associate Professors each were lying vacant. Telling the reason they claim it was due to the VC's wife working in the University Law College whom the Lahore High Court had reverted from the top position.
Dr Mujahid Kamran floated an advertisement appeared in newspapers calling applications for various posts on December 2016 .He was caretaker vice chancellor hence was not legally entitled to take a policy decision and to hold meeting of syndicate.
Real and absolute favoritism is revealed in the form of two posts in the department of geography where one post of professor and one associate professor has been announced while there is no post vacant as per calendar and budget.
In geography department, two professors and one associate professor are working while one vacant post of associate professor was announced in 2014 for which only final selection board is to be held.
A faculty member on condition of anonymity revealed that out of budget posts of Geography department were included by former deputy registrar Kamran Abid.
When contacted, PU Registrar Dr Naeem said that Dr Zafar Moeen Nasir had directed the registrar office to act on merit only. “We want all the things done following the rules only,” the registrar asserted.
He told The Nation that the university administration was looking into the issues of announcing the former VC when he was not eligible to take policy decisions. Not only vacant slots would be filled but much delayed selection boards would also be convened very soon, he added.

Source: Jewellery manufacturer bemoans lack of govt support – NewsDay Zimbabwe August 14, 2017
A BUBI-BASED jewellery manufacturer and miner has claimed that he is failing to fully utilise his jewellery-making machine, worth millions of dollars, due to lack of financial support from the government.
BY SILAS NKALA
In an interview last Friday, Stanford Maponga said his mining claims Nyathi and diamond cutting machinery have been lying idle since 2005 due to lack of capital. He accused the government of prioritising foreign miners at the expense of locals.
“I am talking from experience on what is happening to me. Since 2009, I have been seeking money to have my business capitalised, but to no avail. People are no longer interested in lip service from this government,” Maponga said.
“I have got quite a lot of mining machinery lying idle at my mine in Nyathi, which could have benefited the nation through production. Since 2005, there is no single government official, who has ever visited my place. These government officials take very negative decisions sitting in their offices and do not care what problems people face.”
He said he has a qualified gemstone cutter and jewellery manufacturer, who has been rendered idle by the government's failure to fund local investors.
Maponga said, at some point, he applied for $800 000 from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and the Mines ministry to kickstart his business, but never got any response from them.
“I have got the skills, but I am under-capitalised,” he said.

The Carrier Sekani Family Services is jumping for joy following yesterday's ruling regarding the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (CHRT).
The Federal Government was asked to stop its practice of inadequately funding the costs of child well fare services for Indigenous children and families.
“Before, the federal funding was only to pay for maintenance, and their costs would be covered if they were in care and there wasn't really cap for that as that's what would be covered and then there was little funding to do prevention work,” says Mary Teegee, Carrier Sekani Family Services Executive Director.
Thursday's announcement will also provide a better outcome for First Nations families.
“Being an executive director for our agency and not being able to fully provide those prevention services to keep children with their parents have been heartbreaking and so finally it is a new day and I can't help but be excited for what's coming.”
“When you read the ruling it states very clearly that the treasury boards of policies and funding have to be amended federally to make sure discrimination ceases but to also make sure that it doesn't occur again, so this is any discrimination that in fact, it's legally-binding and not just recommendations.”
The CHRT ordered the government to provide funding based on the actual costs for prevention-based services including child welfare and to pay back First Nations agencies retroactive to January 26th, 2016.
This is the fifth order against Ottawa since that date.
The CHRT ordered the government to provide funding based on the “actual costs” for prevention-based services including child welfare and to pay back First Nations agencies retroactive to January 26th, 2016.
The government has until May 3rd to identify which First Nations agencies were under-funded.

Stats: Who scored the most goals in their first 100 Premier League games?
Harry Kane scored his 59th EPL goal in his 100th game but where is he in the top 10?
@RohithNair by Rohith Nair Stats 02 Jan 2017, 14:08 IST
Harry Kane is ninth on the list of top goalscorers after 100 games
When Harry Kane grabbed a brace in Tottenham Hotspur's 4-1 win over Watford on Sunday, he confirmed his place on an illustrious list alongside one of the greatest Premier League strikers of all time – Thierry Henry. The match was his 100th game in the league and he is well on course to be one of the top goalscorers in the English top flight.
Although the English striker made his debut back in the 2012/13 season, he did not make an impact until the 2013/14 season. While he did score the odd goal for the Spurs, he announced himself only in 2014 when the Spurs beat league leaders Chelsea 5-3 on New Year's day thanks to his brace – a scoring run that helped him win the Premier League Player of the Month award.
Since then, he hasn't looked back and competed with the likes of Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa for the EPL Golden Boot, finally winning that honour last season with 25 goals. The 23-year-old has a long career ahead of him and has already scored more than 50 goals so far.
His 59 goals in 100 games is identical to Thierry Henry at Arsenal. The French striker won four Golden Boots with the Gunners and finished with 175 goals in the Premier League during his time at the north London club.
But both Kane and Henry had a relatively slow start compared to some other legends who make this list. Right at the top is Alan Shearer and it comes as no surprise. The former England international is still the highest goalscorer in Premier League history with 260 goals. Nobody else has scored even 200 with Wayne Rooney the closest on 194 goals.
59 - Harry Kane has now scored 59 goals in 100 Premier League games, the same number as Thierry Henry had at this stage. Updated. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) January 1, 2017
Shearer scored 79 goals in his first 100 games in the ‘90s and his 100th game came in the season he helped Blackburn Rovers win their first ever Premier League title. Although Shearer has never won another title, he is still considered a legend with Blackburn and Newcastle, where he retired after nearly 20 seasons in the top flight.
Alan Shearer with his trademark goal celebration
However, Shearer believes Kane might just be the one to break his record if he stays in England for the rest of his career. “If he avoids injury and continues his career here rather than trying his luck abroad, he will have the opportunity,” the player-turned-pundit had said.

Manchester United's Ruud van Nistelrooy is second with 68 goals in his first 100 games. The Dutchman was a menace in the box with the Red Devils but spent only five seasons at Old Trafford before moving to La Liga giants Real Madrid.
Sergio Aguero is the only other active Premier League player on the list. He's up in third with 64 goals in his first 100 games. The Argentine striker, who won the Premier League Golden Boot in 2014/15, has already scored more than 100 goals for City.
Shearer had tipped Rooney or Aguero to break his record but he felt Rooney's time was done while Aguero may not finish his career with City to get anywhere close to Shearer's mark.
Sergio Aguero is the only other active EPL player in the top 10
Three former Liverpool strikers find themselves next to each other on the list. Fernando Torres, Robbie Fowler and Luis Suarez scored between 62 to 63 goals in their first 100 games for the Anfield side. Sadly, none of them stayed a Red long enough to have a shot at the record (although Fowler does hold the club record with 128 goals).
The other big names from this season that could make this list soon are Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez (41 goals in 82 games so far) and Chelsea's Diego Costa (46 goals in 72 games).

DAVE SCHERBNECO / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Joey Lynn of Berwick tackles Pittston Area's Keemar Woodruff during Friday night's game. Berwick won, 36-0.
TUNKHANNOCK — Crestwood scored on the ground, through the air and on special teams — all in the first quarter — and never relinquished that cushion en route to a 42-18 win over Tunkhannock on Friday night in a Wyoming Valley Conference Class 4A contest at Memorial Stadium.
“This was a big 4A win for us, especially when you look big picture with where we stand,” Crestwood coach Greg Myers said. “Tunkhannock is a good football team and unfortunately their record doesn't indicate that right now. We knew it would be a tough place to play and that it was important to get off to a good start, and the kids did that.”
Indeed, after Tunkhannock's Billy Prebola drilled a 23-yard field goal to give the Tigers a lead five minutes into the game, the Comets' hurry-up offense quickly moved the ball down the field.
In fewer than three minutes, Pat Rother completed a 9-play drive with a 24-yard touchdown run to give Crestwood a 7-3 lead.
Prebola's second field goal from the same distance on Tunkhannock's next drive cut the score to 7-6, but the Comets again moved quickly to respond.
Quarterback Garrett Swank found Kevin Klusewitz and Brandon Brozena for gains of 17 and 18 yards down to the Tigers 27 before again looking for Brozena in the end zone.
Though a Tunkhannock defender tipped the pass, the senior receiver was able to reel in the ball for the score and a 14-6 lead after the extra point.
After Crestwood's defense then forced a quick three-and-out, Rother, who finished with 170 yards on the ground, again came through with a big play, this time on special teams.
The junior raced around the edge to block Prebola's punt, then returned it 37 yards for a touchdown.
“That was huge,” Myers said. “We expected what our offense had done to that point, but that blocked put was what allowed up to control the first half.”
The Comets scored again with 1:18 left in the second quarter and headed into halftime leading, 28-6, but would see the Tigers battle back in the third.
After forcing a fumble, Tunkhannock used a big 49-yard passing play from Zach Rogers to Jake Stephens before Logan Cywinski scored from eight yards out to make it 28-12.
Another big play, this time a 69-yard touchdown run from Garrett Hopkins, pulled Tunkhannock to within 10 with 33 seconds left in the third, but Swank found Klusewitz on the first play of the next drive for 68 yards and a 35-18 Crestwood lead with 18 seconds remaining in the quarter.
Stephens finished with 126 receiving yards, while Hopkins and Cywinski both rushed for more than 100 yards.
“We can't keep spotting teams such big leads to open the game,” Tunkhannock head coach Jan Cechak said. “Crestwood has some players and it was another close game for us. The kids kept fighting, and we're right on the cusp of being able to blow some games open.”

Berwick 36, Pittston Area 0
At Yatesville, Jared Marshman's return was a great boost to Berwick.
That was clearly evident as he threw for 168 yards and two touchdowns and ran for one score in leading the Bulldogs over Pittston Area at Charley Trippi Stadium.
“Jared was extremely excited all week at practice, and that excitement rubbed off on his teammates,” Berwick coach Frank Sheptock said.
The top-ranked Bulldogs defense also did its part in securing the win as they limited the Patriots to just 66 yards of total offense.
Evan Klinger lead the Berwick ground attack as he gained 101 yards and one touchdown.

Washington — Kyle Hendricks goes about things completely differently than Stephen Strasburg does on the mound.
The kid from Dartmouth relies on a fastball that on a good day reaches 88 mph — about 10 mph slower than Strasburg's — and a deceptive changeup. Instead of power, he gets by on precision, guile and smarts.
Hendricks outpitched Strasburg in Game 1 of the NL Division Series, giving up only two hits in seven innings to help the Chicago Cubs open defense of their first World Series title in 108 years by beating the Washington Nationals, 3-0, on Friday night.
“That's why we call him Professor,” Chicago second baseman Javier Baez said about Hendricks. “He knows what he's doing.”
Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo produced RBI singles with two outs in the sixth inning for the first two hits off an otherwise-dominant Strasburg. Rizzo added a run-scoring double in the eighth off Ryan Madson.
Carl Edwards Jr. threw a perfect inning and Wade Davis finished the two-hitter for a save.
Unlike No. 1 overall draft pick Strasburg, Hendricks went in the eighth round. Unlike Strasburg, Hendricks has never been an All-Star. Unlike Strasburg, who already has signed a $175 million, seven-year deal that begins next season, Hendricks earned less than $800,000 in 2017.
But this was Hendricks' time to shine.
“He was tricking us tonight,” Nationals manager Dusty Baker said, “and seems like this kind of guys give us more trouble than guys who throw hard.”
The slender righty, who led the NL in ERA last season, gave up a single in the first and another in the second — and that was it for the Nationals.
He walked three batters and struck out six.
“He knows the scouting report,” said Jon Lester, who starts Game 2 on Saturday for Chicago against fellow lefty Gio Gonzalez. “He knows where guys' weaknesses are.”
Harper — wearing shoes with “Pray for Las Vegas” written on the side following the recent mass shooting in his hometown — was 1 for 4 as he tries to regain his timing after returning last week from a 42-game injury absence. Otherwise, Washington's elite hitters — Anthony Rendon, Ryan Zimmerman, Daniel Murphy, Trea Turner and Jayson Werth — were a combined 0 for 17 with three walks.
“Definitely, your confidence builds,” Hendricks said, “when you start seeing those swings.”
The fact that Hendricks approached 90 mph as often as he did was an aberration he and teammates attributed to adrenaline, but one that helped, of course.
He also knew he needed to be really good, because of what Strasburg was doing.
Strasburg didn't allow a hit until there were two outs in the sixth. Baez reached on Rendon's error at third base to start the inning and was sacrificed to second by Hendricks. One out later, Bryant drove in the first run with a single to right-center and went to second when Harper's throw missed the cutoff man.
Bryant, Rizzo said, managed to “get the monkey off the back in the dugout for all of us.”
Rizzo followed by singling to right in front of a diving Harper to make it 2-0.
With a heavy beard and a lot of sweat on a muggy, 77-degree night, Strasburg dialed up his fastball to 98 mph and mixed in an unhittable changeup. To cheers of “Let's go, Strasburg!” from many in a sellout crowd of 43,898, he struck out 10 to set a playoff record for the Expos-Nationals franchise.
Strasburg wound up allowing just those two unearned runs in seven innings, with three hits and one walk.
“You're aware of it,” Hendricks said about Strasburg. “You know how well he's throwing on the other side.”
Hendricks threw well, too.
“It was,” Cubs catcher Willson Contreras said, “a masterpiece.”

Susanna Reid has proved age is but a number, as she took to social media on Sunday to post a make-up free selfie to celebrate her 47th birthday.
Looking absolutely flawless, the Good Morning Britain host kept her brunette locks out and swishing about her shoulders as she stared down the lens without a scrap of make-up - and looking just as beautiful as she does glammed up on the telly.
Posting the image to her 121k followers, she captioned alongside it: "Older. None the wiser. 47 today. Thank you for your lovely wishes."
(Image: Instagram)
Fans were obsessed with the snap, taking to the comment section in droves to not only wish the star a happy birthday, but to share their awe of her flawless appearance.
"You still look younger than me 37 yesterday," one said.
Another added: "I'm 33 & don't look as good as you, no hope for me when I near 50!"
Another fan said: "You still look amazing. Natural beauty."
"You obviously don't need to make up. Natural beauty!" one quipped.
One complimented: "If natural beauty was a competition then you would win."

Normally spending hours in a make-up chair being tended to by a glam squad each morning before the GMB cameras start rolling, Susanna took a day off from the cosmetics, showing off her bare-faced beauty.
On Saturday night, the bubbly presenter - who co-hosts the show alongside Piers Morgan - was out celebrating her impending day of birth, looking a little more dolled up for the evening.
Wearing a slick of pink lipstick and a swash of mascara that highlighted her peepers, she said: "Goodbye 46...B'day tomoz."

The mother-of-three, who is single, recently said she would be up for a "frisky short term" romance this holiday season, after remarking on the demise of Love Island lovebirds Kem Cetinay and Amber Davies' 132-day relationship.
She said on the morning show: “How long is a successful relationship? I mean obviously everyone wants to get married and then stay married forever.
“But can you not have a relationship for 132 days? That sounds like quite a lot of fun!”
“I never thought I'd say this,” said Erick Oropeza, 29, a former worker with Venezuela's Ministry of Education who recently began crossing the bridge each day. “But I'm more grateful for what Colombia has offered me in this short time than what I ever received from Venezuela my entire life.”
But increasingly, they are coming to eat in one of a half-dozen facilities offering struggling Venezuelans a free plate of food.
An estimated 25,000 Venezuelans make the trek across the Simon Bolivar International Bridge into Colombia each day. Many come for a few hours to work or trade goods on the black market, looking for household supplies they cannot find back home.
CUCUTA, COLOMBIA—Under a scorching sun just a short walk from Colombia's border with Venezuela, hundreds of hungry men, women and children line up for bowls of chicken and rice — the first full meal some have eaten in days.
As Venezuela's economy verges on collapse and its political upheaval worsens, cities like Cucuta along Colombia's porous, 1,370-mile (2,200-kilometre) border with Venezuela have become firsthand witnesses to the neighbouring South American nation's escalating humanitarian crisis.
According to one recent survey, about 75 per cent of Venezuelans lost an average of 19 pounds (8.7 kilograms) last year.
The Colombian government has crafted contingency plans in the event of a sudden, mass exodus, but already church groups and non-profit organizations are stepping in, moved by images of mothers carrying starving babies and skinny men trying to make a few bucks on Cucuta's streets to bring back home.
Paulina Toledo, 47, a Colombian hairstylist who recently helped feed lunch to 900 Venezuelans, said seeing how hungry they were “hurt my soul.”
“Those of us here on the border are seeing their pain,” she said.
People living on either side of the Colombia-Venezuela border have long had a foot in both countries: A Colombian who lives in Cucuta might cross to visit relatives in San Cristobal; a Venezuelan might make the reverse trip to work or go to school.
In the years when Venezuela's oil industry was booming and Colombia entangled in a half-century armed conflict, an estimated 4 million Colombians migrated to Venezuela. Many started coming back as Venezuela's economy began to implode and after President Nicolas Maduro closed the border in 2015 and expelled 20,000 Colombians overnight.
Oropeza said he earned about $70 a month working at the Ministry of Education and selling hamburgers on the side — twice Venezuela's minimum wage but still not enough to feed a family of four. Once a month his family receives a bundle of food provided by the government, but it only lasts a week.
“So the other three weeks, like most Venezuelans, we have to make magic happen,” he said on a recent afternoon.
Desperate for money to feed his family, he left his job and travelled to the Venezuelan border town of San Antonio. He wakes up at 4 a.m. each morning to be among the first crossing the bridge into Cucuta, where he earns money selling soft drinks on the street.
He goes straight to the “Casa de Paso,” a church-run shelter that has served 60,000 meals to Venezuelans since opening two months ago. On an average day, 2,000 Venezuelans line up for meals, getting a ticket to reserve their spot and then waiting four hours for a meal served at outdoor plastic tables.
Workers stir gigantic metal pots filled with chicken and rice set on the bare dirt floor. Volunteers hand out boxes of juice to tired-looking children. Adults sit quietly, savoring their bowl of food as chickens waddle between them.
“Every day I have to remind myself why I am here,” said Oropeza, dressed in a faded striped collared shirt. “I try to repeat it to myself so that I won't, you know, so those moments of weakness don't affect you so much.”
When he's not helping out or waiting in line at the shelter kitchen, Oropeza sells malted soft drinks for about 50 cents each. He's been able to bring money back to his family and has earned enough to buy a cellphone, which he'd lacked for two years.
Jose David Canas, a priest, said his church will continue to serve food “as long as God allows.”
“Until they close the border,” he said. “Until everything is eaten or until the province tells us that they no longer have lunches to give out. And then it's the end.”

The Pleasure Cove campsite at Lake Berryessa is almost always booked up Fourth of July weekend.
But this year, it's nearly deserted.
As the County Fire burns just miles away, most campers canceled their holiday reservations at the campsite — which is one of a handful of resorts in the area under advisory evacuations.

The Reese family, who camp at Lake Berryessa every year on Fourth of July, is one of just three families who decided to stay.
"We didn't think it was going to be so bad," Shenelle Reese explained Wednesday evening while eating dinner outside her camper, "Until yesterday when we went on the water. We went on the boat and it was just like a layer of smoke across the entire lake."
Even so, the family of four took a vote and ultimately decided they would stick it out.
"I mean, I voted to leave," Shenelle's husband Jerry said. "It said advisory notice to leave, but then I got out voted."
Here's what Lake Berryessa is like tonight on this July 4th-eve. (Hint: Not the usual campers and BBQs...) #CountyFire #GuindaFire pic.twitter.com/zoc1Lmestt — Liz Kreutz (@ABCLiz) July 4, 2018
Outvoted, but still prepared. The family says they have packed up everything they would need in the event they do have to evacuate in a hurry. They also take ease knowing the Sheriffs Department will come through with sirens to alert them if they need to go.
Until then, they're enjoying the perks of having a campsite nearly all to themselves. (Although, from a kids perspective, it does come with some challenges.)
"It's kind of hard when you play hide and go seek," the Reese's daughter Amaya explained. "There are no places to hide!"

Allen Park — The pass didn't come close to reaching its intended target, traveling only a short distance before a linebacker deflected it up into the air. From there, the altered trajectory carried the wayward throw directly into the waiting arms of Detroit Lions rookie cornerback Jamal Agnew.
And as he did so often in college, Agnew made the interception. Had it been a game and not a random June practice, he might have been able to convert the turnover into six points.
Regardless of the setting, generating turnovers is important. It's been a point of emphasis for the Lions this offseason, and part of the reason Agnew was tabbed by the team in the fifth round of the draft. Still, the young corner sheepishly sounded as if he was being asked to take credit for someone else's good play.
“I think that was all just being in the right place at the right time,” Agnew said. “The coaches always preach tipped balls always get caught. The linebacker did a great job breaking that up, and I capitalized on the tipped ball. It fell right into my arms”
That's fair, but if there's one thing that can be extrapolated from Agnew's college resume, it's that he's never had problems making plays. He set the University of San Diego record for pass breakups before his senior year and tacked on another 11 for good measure last season, finishing with 48. He also chipped in 11 career interceptions for the Toros.
Those are the skills the Lions hope port to the professional level, and so far, the team has liked what they've seen from the 5-foot-10 speedster competing for playing time as a nickelback and return man.
“What we've seen, he's coming along well,” coach Jim Caldwell said. “The same things you saw from him in college, his quickness, and not only that, he's instinctive. He's got hands.”
Agnew admits he didn't get off to the best start his first month with the Lions, although that's hardly unusual for any rookie, especially one making the jump from the Pioneer Football League. But it hasn't been the speed or physicality that's overwhelmed him. It's the size of the playbook, where he's just starting to find a comfort level
“I definitely feel like the speed of the game is not as much of a difference, but the overall complexity of defensive schemes, how offenses try to attack you and all that, you have taken all that into your thought process,” Agnew said. “That just makes it a little bit harder on the field. Especially, as a rookie, it gets you thinking a little bit more. I feel like I'm starting to get out of that thinking mindset and I'm starting to go out on that field and play.”
It also didn't help that he had to miss two early practices to finish up academic requirements, although he credited the coaching staff for keeping him in the loop.
“The coaches did a really good job,” Agnew said. “I communicated with the DB coach every day. He would tell me what we're installing, what I should really look at with the tape. They also recorded the meetings for me, so it was like I was there. …It was like I didn't even miss a beat.”
But what's really helped Agnew get his bearings has been the support of the team's veterans, particularly Quandre Diggs. It's a unique dynamic because the two are essentially competing for the same job; Diggs the incumbent, Agnew a challenger.
“Even though you might be trying to steal their spot, per se, they're always willing to help,” Agnew said. “They don't care. It's for the team. The ultimate goal is to win a championship. Your twos have to be ready, your threes have to be ready, even the fours sometimes.
“If I ever have any questions, I go straight to Quandre and he's always quick to answer, never hesitates, which I love.”
Agnew has a long way to go before stealing that job. He's currently working with the third-team defense, but if he shows in training camp and the preseason he's able to be a difference-maker like he was in college, it will be tough for the Lions to keep him down the depth chart for long.

When commanding officer Major Adam Jowett faced the battle of a lifetime against a deadly force of Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan in the summer of 2006, it was the culmination of an ambition that was born 24 years earlier.
The Surrey schoolboy was just 11 years old when he saw television images of the ‘grimy, hard-looking men' in maroon berets, the famous Paras who fought and won a tough campaign in the faraway Falkland Islands, and vowed that one day he would be a soldier and lead his own men into battle.
And when he stepped into the fray in Helmand province at the head of a hastily assembled and under-strength unit of Paras and Royal Irish rangers, Jowett was finally commanding a troop of his own… but against a ferocious, merciless enemy in one of the toughest places on Earth.
The man who had so relished the physical and mental challenges of officer training at Sandhurst College was about to face his sternest and most terrifying test yet in the notorious siege at Musa Qala, a town and district centre in the central western part of Helmand which would become the scene of a heroic struggle.
Twelve years after the heart-thumping events in that summer of 2006, Jowett brings us his raw, honest, hard-hitting, emotional and truly inspirational account of a fight for survival that has been labelled by former war reporter Martin Bell as ‘the Rorke's Drift of our times.'
Describing in visceral and vivid detail what it was like to have responsibility for the lives of his men as they fought back bravely over 21 days and nights of relentless, nerve-shredding combat, Jowett takes us up close and personal to the heart of war – from the crumps, whumps and booms of attack to the sickening sight of a man down and the sheer exhaustion of almost non-stop fighting.
In charge of a new unit, which took the letter E and soon became known as ‘Easy Company,' Jowett's mission had been to hold the district centre at any cost but their base was a ramshackle compound and their defences were weak.
Cut off, outgunned and heavily outnumbered by the Taliban in the town, the British soldiers were a sitting target for their enemy who began launching wave after wave of brutal attacks, including crawling up the compound walls and having to be driven back with hand grenades.
Finally, as they came down to their last rounds and with 80 men left to face 500 of the enemy, death seemed to stare Easy Company in the face. The battlegroup did not have the resources to bring in more ammunition by convoy and the danger of flying in Chinook helicopters made that method of resupply too risky.
‘The statistics weren't great on paper,' writes Jowett, ‘but they didn't take into account that my small number of British soldiers were amongst the best trained infantry in the world, and that they would fight like dogs.'
The night before what many knew could be their last day, Jowett like every other man in the company, marked out his last magazine. ‘When I was down to my last few rounds, I would make sure I died upright and fighting. Better that than the alternative of falling into the hands of the Taliban, which was far worse than death.
‘Tomorrow, our enemy would come and try to kill us, and it was my job – my duty – to see they died instead.'
Surrounded by the enemy and with their backs to the wall and no way out, no one in Easy Company could have foreseen that the siege was destined to take an extraordinary turn…
Gripping, emotionally charged and intensely powerful, No Way Out is a dramatic and yet straightforwardly honest first-hand account of war in all its grim reality; but it is also Jowett's moving tribute to the gallant men of his unit.
Some were injured and some did not come home alive but it was ‘their courage, their grit, and their sheer unbreakable spirit' which defied the greatest odds to beat back ‘an unrelentingly barbaric enemy' and which will forever be a part of the man who led them.

FTSE 100 Index called to open -20pts at 7575, holding the mid-point of yesterday's 7630 highs and 7540 lows between rising support and intersecting resistance from last week. Bulls need a break above 7590. Bears require a breach of rising support at 7555. Watch levels: Bullish 7595, Bearish 7550
Calls for a negative open stem from a weak close on Wall St and an extension of losses in Asia notably in China where trade war fears continue to simmer (shares in a bear market) along with concerns about flagging consumer growth and apparent intervention being necessary to stabilise its renminbi currency.
Note the US allowing China's ZTE to resume some business in the US but China banning the US's Micron Tech. from chip sales. Even talk of Europe weighing up international talks to cut tariffs on cars, to reduce any US-inspired pain, is not helping. As we said recently, this trade story has plenty of legs.
Basic materials and financials weak down-under overnight, which may have a spill over to the FTSE's Miners and Banks this morning. FTSE hampered by a weaker USD and thus stronger GBP. Despite the weaker USD, it's a mixed picture for commodities with Copper lower (China slowing consumption, trade war fears) but Oil higher (supply concerns).
In corporate news this morning, Sainsbury Q1 like-for-like retail sales +0.2%, in-line; Grocery +0.5% misses +0.7% est. despite £150m price investment on meat, fruit & veg since March; General Merchandise +1.7% strong, Clothing +0.8% in-line; £3.5bn financing agreed for Asda deal; targets £160m EBITDA synergies from Argos by next March, to open another 90 Argos within supermarkets.
Compass Group CFO Johnny Thomson to step down by year-end. BP increases stake in Clair field (Shetland); sells interest in Kuparuk (Alaska); cash neutral. SIG H1 revenues flat after FX (+1.4%) and less working days (-0.8%); Trading remains mixed, Europe confidence offset by UK challenges; guidance unchanged.
National Express JV gets 15yr bus contract in Morocco, expected to generate €1bn over lifetime option for 7yr extension. Topps Tiles Q3 like-for-like revenues -2.3%, extending Q2 weakness; weaker consumer environment. Staffline trading in line with expectations.
In focus today, apart from speculating about the football, and dealing with a quiet session on account of it being Independence day stateside, will be a raft of June PMI Services prints. Note China got things started overnight with a better than expected read, jumping back towards 2018 highs, while India got back above 50 to return to growth.
In Europe, Spain PMI Services is forecast to show a slight decline while Italy edges higher. More importantly, however, could be France and Germany confirms rebound from 2018 and multi-month lows which could help the Eurozone figure do the same to help the EUR.
As for the UK, the consensus has its PMI Services flat in June, but note all the aforementioned big guns in Europe holding nicely above 50 in growth territory.

NEW YORK -- Veterans Joe Thomas, Antonio Gates and Vernon Davis are among eight finalists for the NFL's Art Rooney Sportsmanship Award.
Also announced Monday as finalists were Luke Kuechly, Haloti Ngata, Joe Staley, Josh McCown and Alex Smith.
The award recognizes those who best demonstrate the qualities of on-field sportsmanship: fair play, respect for the game and opponents, and integrity in competition. The award was created in 2014 in honor of the founding owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pro Football Hall of Famer Art Rooney Sr.
Staley (2015 and 2016), Smith (2014) and Kuechly (2015) have been finalists in the past. Past recipients of the award are Frank Gore, Charles Woodson and Larry Fitzgerald.
A panel of former players selected the eight finalists from the 32 team nominees. The panel is comprised of Hall of Famer Curtis Martin, Warrick Dunn, Karl Mecklenburg and Leonard Wheeler.
The winner is determined by a vote of current NFL players. The eight finalists will be listed on the Pro Bowl ballot under the NFL Sportsmanship Award category when players vote on Friday. From the eight finalists, each team's players will submit a consensus vote of their choice for the winner. As in Pro Bowl voting, a team cannot vote for its own player.
The Art Rooney Sportsmanship award will be presented during NFL Honors, when The Associated Press hands out its individual awards, Feb. 3, the night before the Super Bowl. The winner receives a $25,000 donation from the NFL Foundation to a charity of his choice.
Jail Ordered For Local Man Who Sent Nude Pictures To Teen
February 3, 2018
A Gregory man who sent his nude photos to an underage girl has been sentenced.
18-year-old Craig Holland was sentenced Thursday to one year in the Livingston County jail and three years of probation. Court records indicate Holland will be released from jail one day before school resumes in September and the balance of his jail time will be suspended upon successful completion of probation.
Holland pleaded guilty last month to accosting a child for immoral purposes, using computers to commit a crime, and distributing obscene matter to children. The charges stem from an alleged online relationship with a 13-year-old girl. Holland is said to have connected with the victim via Facebook. In December of 2016, Holland reportedly sent nude images of himself to the girl and convinced her to reciprocate. The girl's mother became aware of the pictures after her daughter's friend brought it to her attention. (DK)
Since returning to Twitter last week, Kanye West has gone back to doing what Kanye West does best: courting controversy. In the midst of tweeting about his various upcoming projects and seemingly tweeting his entire philosophy book, he tweeted in support of conservative pundit Candace Owens and tweeted a bunch of videos from Dilbert creator and Trump supporter Scott Adams. Yesterday, Hot 97 host and rap personality Ebro Darden claimed to have had a conversation with Kanye in which he said, “I do love Donald Trump.” Fucking Alex Jones invited Kanye onto his show, which is never a good look.
So when Kanye West called into Hot 97 during a commercial break today, Darden took the call, presumably expecting him to offer some clarification on his recent comments. He didn't do that. Instead, as MissInfo reports, he said, “I just called to say I love you.” And then he said it again. And again. Then he sang it in his best Stevie Wonder impression. And when Ebro asked if he wanted to talk about any of his upcoming projects, Kanye added, “We can meet up in person and then we can talk on the radio afterwards. But I just wanted to call and say I love you.”
Basically, it was a very bizarre appearance, and Ebro and cohost Peter Rosenberg seemed understandably baffled by the whole thing. Meanwhile, Kanye continues to tweet half motivational, half nonsensical things, and the world continues to turn on its axis. More at 11.
Yes Kanye just called the show while we were in the middle of a break and just kept repeating "I love you" to Ebro…eventually he said lets meet in person off air and then talk on the air — RosenbergTelevision (@Rosenbergradio) April 24, 2018

Islamabad-The Ministry of Human Rights has sought a report from the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to determine whether the building of the Working Women hostel in sector G-6/3 complies with the building safety requirements.
The request has been made to ensure that the women residents of the hostel are safe. The ministry has requested the CDA to send a technical team to visit the hostel and submit a report detailing its condition.
The Working Women hostel, constructed by CDA in 1991, is under the Ministry of Human Rights. According to a letter written by the ministry to the CDA officials, the building is said to be in a dangerous condition due to drain water accumulating in the basement through seepage in walls, unprotected gas pipes and the overall weakening of building's foundations, said the letter.
The Secretary Ministry of Human rights visited the hostel for inspection and directed to take up the matter with CDA immediately to report on the present condition and structure of the building. According to the sources in the CDA, a team would soon be constituted to fulfil this purpose.
Meanwhile, CDA has issued a final seniority list of medical officers/registrar / assistant anaesthetist of BPS-17 of Medical and Health Cadres after finalization of circulated draft seniority list on 27 July 2017.

Cartagena, Colombia — Seeking to highlight the growing plight in Venezuela, Vice President Mike Pence is meeting with people who've fled the country to neighboring Colombia.
Pence is paying a visit to the Calvary Chapel in Cartagena, where he's meeting with faith leaders and Venezuelan families before departing to Buenos Aires, Argentina, later Monday. His wife, Karen Pence, helped to lead a prayer circle, where she prayed for “comfort to the Venezuelan refugees.”
Pence's visit comes as he tries to rally the region against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's attempts to consolidate power.
Pence on Sunday evening denounced Maduro's tactics and said the U.S. will not stand by as Venezuela “crumbles.”
Venezuelan officials have been firing back in a series of statements, with Information Minister Ernest Villegas denouncing U.S. meddling in Venezuela's affairs as hypocritical on Twitter Monday.
“The US and its satellite in Bogota are trying to give classes in democracy to Venezuela while it provides cover for neo-Nazis in its own territory,” Villegas wrote, linking to photos of the recent deadly march in Charlottesville, Virginia, involving far-right groups.

COLOMBO - Pakistan could be on the verge of hosting their highest-profile international visitor in the last eight years, with Sri Lanka all but committing to play a T20 there in September or October.
This would, in itself, represent an extraordinary gesture by Sri Lankan Cricket (SLC), given its own side had been the target of the 2009 terror attack that stopped international cricket being played in Pakistan for six years. Since that attack, in which six policemen and two civilians were killed, only Zimbabwe team has toured the country, playing five internationals in Lahore in 2015.
Sri Lanka and Pakistan are due to play each other in a full series that starts at the end of September. A SLC release said that Sri Lanka will play at least one of the three T20s in Lahore, in September, so long as the logistical and operational plans fall in place.
Speaking at the Asian Cricket Council's (ACC) annual general meeting in Colombo, SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala appealed for Asian unity and cited Pakistan's willingness to tour Sri Lanka during the island's own civil war as reason to play in Lahore. "I am keen to take my team to Pakistan," Sumathipala said. "We have had our security experts visit and make an assessment, and things look positive with things improving all over the country and especially Lahore being cleared. We have three T20 games coming up against Pakistan in September and we would like to play at least one of those games in Lahore.
"I call upon each one of you as members to play your role and give Pakistan the security of your support. There is always risk - there were two attacks in London during the Champions Trophy - but cricket continued under the security assurances of the ICC, so likewise we too must be as accommodating and understanding as possible with our members and extend our fullest support to them as the cricketing family of Asia," he added.
Despite Sumathipala's eagerness, it is not clear yet how Sri Lanka's players will react to the prospect of playing in Pakistan. Out of the squad that was attacked in Lahore, only Chamara Kapugedara stands a chance of being selected for future T20s, but other players will also have heard the details of that attack from teammates, who had lived through it.
The PCB, meanwhile, confirmed that preparations to host Sri Lanka will begin now. "The SLC president and I had very fruitful talks on the sidelines of the ACC meet in Colombo on August 11 and 12," PCB chairman Najam Sethi said. "I am grateful for his decision to support our efforts to bring international cricket back to Pakistan. We shall start preparations to stage one or two T20 matches in October in Lahore. This is a historic decision. Once Sri Lanka have toured Pakistan, the door will be open for safe passage of other teams to Pakistan."
Pakistani cricket officials also welcomed the decision, lauding the move on social media. "Thank you Mr. Thilanga Sumathipala. We look forward to hosting you and the Sri Lankan team," the PCB wrote on Twitter.
When and whether the game - or games - goes ahead will also depend on how a planned series between Pakistan and a World XI side pans out. The World XI tour currently scheduled to be played between September 10 and 16. But there were hopeful signs that Pakistan will successfully host the World XI and Sri Lankan team after they had successfully staged the final of the Pakistan Super League under heavy security in March.
Sumathipala's optimism is also indication that a deal has been reached. With both boards and various governments keen for the match to be played in Lahore, player protestations - if there are any - may not be enough to halt that political will. The Sri Lankan board statement also quoted Pakistan Cricket Board chief Najam Sethi saying they had set up state-of-the-art security and surveillance to make their cities safe.

There have long been tales of lost civilizations and strange peoples that have faded into the sands of time. Such enigmatic races lurk in the tales and history of nearly every major culture, and they span the range of the supernatural, to pure myth, to the possibly real. One tale of a mysterious lost race comes to us from the Appalachian Mountains of the United States, and it tells of a strange race of albino, sun-fearing beings who supposedly roamed this land long before even the Natives arrived.
In the untamed wildernesses along the Southern Appalachian Mountains of the United States the Native Cherokee people have long told of a strange race of beings they call “The Moon-Eyed People.” This mysterious tribe was supposedly smaller than average humans, almost dwarfish in nature, very pale skinned, like pure white alabaster, with shocking white hair, generous beards and body hair, and inhumanly large blue eyes, sensitive to light to the point that they were said to be unable to see in the daytime, hence their name. These Moon-Eyed people were purportedly completely nocturnal, hiding in dank caves and underground caverns during the day only to come out at night when the sun had retreated, and indeed sunlight was said to be enough to kill them if they ever got caught out in the open during daylight hours.
These strange, diminutive nocturnal denizens of the land were said to have been here long before the first Native peoples had settled the area, and according to most legends they were eventually expelled by local Natives, although what form this expulsion takes varies from tradition to tradition. In some tales it was the Creek people from the south who cast them out, wherein in others it is the Cherokees themselves who waged a relentless campaign and full-out war against these pale-skinned creatures to drive them to other lands. The American botanist, naturalist, and physician, Benjamin Smith Barton, wrote of these people and their downfall back in 1797, in his book New Views of the Origin of the Tribes and Nations of America, thus:
The Cheerake tell us, that when they first arrived in the country which they inhabit, they found it possessed by certain ‘moon-eyed-people,' who could not see in the day-time. These wretches they expelled.
Whatever happened to this enigmatic race, their legacy has supposedly remained behind in the ancient rock structures and mysterious pre-Columbian mounds and ruins that dot the landscape along the Appalachians from North Carolina all the way down through Georgia and Alabama, all said to have been erected by the Moon-Eyed People. Perhaps the most famous of these is an 850 foot long stone wall dated to 400 – 500 C.E., which meanders through Fort Mountain State Park, just over the North Carolina border in Georgia, and is said to be a vestige of the bloody war between the mysterious Moon-Eyed People and the native Cherokee. There are countless other crude rock structures, walls, mounds and forts scattered all throughout the Appalachians, as well as anomalous carvings, figurines, and a soapstone carving of conjoined figures now on display at the Cherokee County Historical Museum said to be of these strange people, and no one really knows who made any of them except for the Cherokee themselves, who say it was the work of the Moon-Eyed People.
Whoever built such structures has long remained a mystery, and when Europeans first came to the region the Natives, who were not known for making such fort-like structures themselves, claimed that they had been always been there, saying that they were constructions of the Moon-Eyed People. Interestingly, while Cherokee folklore has many tales of supernatural beings and various spirits, the Moon-Eyed People are never spoken of in such a manner, rather being described matter-of-factly as physically another race inhabiting the same lands.
Of course, with such an oddity as a cryptic tribe of bizarre dwarf subterranean albino people, almost like vampires in their intolerance for sunlight, and who predated the native peoples and constructed their mysterious mounds and forts, there is bound to be theorizing as to who or what they may have been. One of the most popular ideas is that they are evidence of Native contact with European explorers who had made it to the New World long before history says they did, possibly connected to the legend of the “Welsh Speaking Indians.”
The story of white-skinned, Welsh speaking Indians in the New World originates with a 16th-century manuscript published by Welsh antiquarian Humphrey Llwyd, in which he writes of Welsh settlers coming to these shore in the 12th century, in particular a Prince Madoc, who along with his followers was said to have emigrated to America from Wales in about 1170, landing somewhere in the vicinity of Mobile Bay, Alabama. Madoc would supposedly end up shipping over hundreds of his followers to the New World, where they would disappear into the wilderness, never to return. In the following centuries there were many stories of fair-skinned, blue-eyed natives who spoke a form of Welsh from the area, and these have been speculated to have been the ancestors of these settlers. Indeed, there are many tales of “blue-eyed Indians” from the New World, which I have covered here at MU before, and perhaps this all has some part to play in the mystery of the Moon-Eyed People.
Another idea put forth by Benjamin Smith Barton is that they were out of place descendants of members of the Guna people of Panama, who have such an uncommonly high rate of albinism that they were once referred to as the “White Indians,” and who were also reportedly able to see better at night. Another theory is that, rather than go to war, the Natives of the land actually integrated with the Moon-Eyed People and absorbed them. Still other more far-out theories are that these were some other species of human, a new race, or even ancient astronauts from another world.
It is still unclear who or what the Moon-Eyed people may have been, and they remain a distinctly enigmatic lost civilization, if they ever even existed at all. Who were these albino, sun-fearing people? Were they some lost race, descendants of pre-Columbian explorers, or even a new species or alien interlopers? Or were these just a figment of folklore and myth? The answers to such questions remain obscure, but the tales of the Moon-Eyed People have persisted for over a millennium, and the idea that such a race of lost humanoids has been lost to history captures the imagination.

Gov. Phil Murphy on Monday got behind a prospective a 12-acre development project aimed at attracting new technology and other jobs to New Jersey.
The Democratic governor met with officials from Rutgers University, local and state government, private businesses and others at the university to support the project, called the Hub.
Murphy, who met privately with the group of leaders before he spoke to reporters, said the idea for the project goes back at least five years but what's new is “the will” to push the project forward.
“There needs to be a will to pull it together because the interests are quite disparate, and you need to be able to pull a lot of different perspectives togethers,” Murphy said.
The project fits with Murphy's campaign promises to jump-start what he calls the state's innovation economy, though there were few details on the project immediately available.
It's not clear who exactly would fund the project, but the governor said there's broad support in the state and that he hopes the federal government will help finance the effort.
New Brunswick Mayor Jim Cahill, also a Democrat, said a four-acre portion of the project is “shovel-ready” and set to be located near the city's train station, along the corridor connecting New York to Philadelphia.
Democratic Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin also attended the event and said he plans to introduce legislation but didn't give any details.
In addition to state and local elected officials, Rutgers President Robert Barchi and RWJ Barnabas Health President Barry Ostrowsky also attended the event and sounded supportive.
Barchi said Murphy is the “catalyst” for getting the project kick-started.
Murphy also said later that the New Jersey Economic Development Authority will begin a planning and implementation study of the project. He said the authority is expected to identify partners for the Hub.
PANAJI, India (Reuters) - Ghana's gold output is likely to drop sharply in 2017 because of curbs on the small-scale mining that lifted production last year but was causing damage to the environment, a government official said on Saturday.
Total gold output from Africa's second largest producer was 4.1 million ounces in 2016, the highest level in nearly 40 years, up from 2.8 million ounces in 2015.
The government of President Nana Akufo-Addo, who took office in January, has temporarily banned artisanal mining, or panning for gold, in a renewed effort to clamp down on those who do it illegally.
"We anticipate at least a 50 percent drop in production from the small miners," Barbara Oteng-Gyasi, deputy minister of land and mines told Reuters.
"We are trying to control illegal mining which is not good for the environment," Oteng-Gyasi said on the sidelines of the International Gold Convention in Panaji, capital of India's western state of Goa.
Artisanal mining is common in parts of Africa and accidents are frequent.
The small miners account for nearly a third of the total gold production and restrictions on their activities could help bigger players to raise production, Oteng-Gyasi said.
Canada's Asanko Gold, US-based Newmont Gold and Anglogold Ashanti's have mining operations in Ghana.
Ghana's total gold revenues for 2016 including exports from small-scale mining amounted to $5.15 billion up from $3.32 billion in 2015.
The country's diamond output is also likely to fall substantially in 2017 as diamonds are mainly extracted by small-scale mines, she said.
Ghana's diamond production slipped to 143,005 carats in 2016 from 185,376 carats a year before, according to the Ghana Chamber of Mines.
NC State coach Mark Gottfried's tenure in Raleigh is likely coming to an end following the season, unless the Wolfpack go on a run over the next few weeks and in the ACC tournament, sources told ESPN.
"He could be gone this week, if they get pounded by North Carolina tomorrow night," one source close to the situation told ESPN on Tuesday night.
Gottfried, 53, was hired by athletic director Debbie Yow in 2011 and proceeded to go to the NCAA tournament in each of his first four seasons, including a pair of Sweet 16 appearances.
However, the Wolfpack were 16-17 last season and are 14-12 and 3-10 in ACC play this season, with a likely high lottery pick on the roster in Dennis Smith Jr.
Yow, according to several sources, has been unhappy with the lack of effort with the current team.
"They have more than enough talent to get to the NCAA tourney," one ACC coach told ESPN. "They just don't play hard at all."
NC State spokesman Fred Demarest told ESPN that Gottfried remains the coach and that the focus of the team is on North Carolina. He also denied that the school has reached out to other candidates, as several reports have indicated.
If NC State does make a coaching move, it's likely that Dayton coach and NC State alum Archie Miller would be high atop the list, although sources told ESPN that Miller is unlikely to take the job.
Glossybox, a BirchBox clone launched by the Samwer brothers back in 2011 to deliver willing consumers a monthly subscription of beauty products, has been acquired by UK online retailer and ecommerce platform operator, The Hut Group (THG). Terms of the deal have not been disclosed.
Glossybox had raised $72 million from four investors over its six-year or so run, according to Crunchbase. Its majority shareholders were Rocket Internet and Kinnevik Online.
The number of beauty subscription boxes has grown in recent years, as more companies jumped on the product subscription bandwagon.
THG has several subscription box products of its own, such as its lookfantastic brand Beauty Box, although it also offers subscription box offerings beyond the beauty space, such as its MyGeekBox and PopInABox brands.
The company couches the Glossybox buy as a strategic move to further extend its international reach — with the latter active in 10 markets: the US, Canada, UK, Ireland, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden.
Glossybox has not disclosed subscription numbers recently, but THG reckons there's room to grow the brand by plugging it into its proprietary ecommerce platform-plus-marketing infrastructure.
THG, which operates more than 140 websites retailing premium, non-perishable FMCG products direct to consumers, claims “hundreds of millions” of users globally across its market footprint, shipping some 37 million items annually.
It also said it intends to invest in Glossybox's Berlin base — evolving it into a “tech-hub” for the Group.
Commenting on the acquisition in a statement, Matthew Moulding, founder and CEO of THG, said: “This is another significant investment for The Hut Group. In Glossybox, we have acquired a great brand, with a solid and engaged customer base that, once powered through our platform and marketing infrastructure, should be capable of further significant growth.”
While Caren Genthner-Kappesz, CEO of Glossybox, described THG as “the right strategic partner to drive our business forward”.
The press release doesn't mention the word ‘brexit' but a UK-based ecommerce player planning to invest in and beef up a tech hub that will be remaining within the European Union also looks like a nice hedge against potential skills shortages domestically. Hence THG lauding Berlin as “home to a highly tech-savvy community”.
NAIROBI - Kenya's main stock index rose 2.51 percent on Monday to a 14-month high, building on gains last week as investors welcomed the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta.
The NSE-20 index has risen nearly 7 percent since the election last Tuesday. Kenyatta was declared winner by a clear margin on Friday but his main challenger, Raila Odinga, has not yet conceded. At least 24 people have been killed in pockets of protests against the outcome of the vote, mainly in two Nairobi slums. But businesses re-opened on Monday, shrugging off a boycott call by Odinga.
A dispute after an election in 2007, which Odinga also lost, sparked widescale protests and violence that killed 1,200 people and hammered the economy. Aly Khan Satchu, an independent trader and analyst in Nairobi, said the market worried that Odinga, who identifies himself as a social democrat, would have changed the economy's course.
"The markets were concerned around a leftist 'Magufuli'-like tilt which would have eroded Kenya's hard won free market credentials. So part of this rally is a relief rally," he told Reuters, referring to President John Magufuli of neighbouring Tanzania.
Kenyatta, the 55-year-old son of the country's founding president, engaged regularly with the business community in his first term to try to boost economic growth and job creation. His family also owns a range of businesses.
The Kenyan shilling firmed on Monday to touch an intra-day high of 103.65 per dollar, from 104 before the election, while Kenyan dollar bonds have also rallied after the election.
Monday's gains by the blue chip index were led by electricity distributor Kenya Power, which was up 9 percent and lender KCB Group, which was up 8 percent.
Ken Minjire, the head of securities at Genghis Capital, said investors had been encouraged by endorsements of the election by various foreign observer groups. The main local observer group also said the official result was in line with their tally.
"The international investors are more or less confident," he said.
Kenyan shares had slightly lagged this year's gains in other African bourses like Nigeria as investors waited to see how the election would go, market participants said.
"This means there is a tonne of liquidity that is set to enter the market and underpin valuations," Satchu said.
Dear Amy: I am a 31-year-old single, educated woman. I ended a six-year relationship that became emotionally controlling and physically abusive. My ex and I have agreed to try to co-parent our 3-year-old son.
My parents, who were pushed away due to the control issues, jumped in and rescued me and my son. They are co-investors on my new house and wholeheartedly participate in my son's life.
I have a new guy who surfaced at the time of my separation. He was going through a similar break-up. The new love has blossomed to a point where he is moving in.
He is in is 50s, has three adult kids, two grandkids, and works as a labourer.
My parents are livid. They feel that I am making a bad choice. Financially I make much more than he does. It is not an issue with me, because he will pay rent.
My parents have met him and feel he is no match for their daughter. They are taking a strong stance against the new guy, perhaps selling my co-investment home and limiting future finances. They see him as a freeloader and want me to find someone in my league.
I am in counseling and get support for "living my own life." I would like your opinion, if you think I am making a mistake with the new guy for the disruption it may cause.
-- Torn
Dear Torn: I align with your parents, but perhaps for different reasons.
I don't know (or care, really) if this man is in your league.
What in this arrangement is good for your son? In his very short life, he has experienced emotional and physical abuse between his parents, and in short order his mother has invited a new man into the home.
No. Just no. There are many reasons for caution, but the reason that should matter the most to all of you was revealed in an eight-year study published in 2005 by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which concluded: "Young children who reside in households with unrelated adults are at exceptionally high risk for inflicted-injury death. Most perpetrators are male, and most are residents of the decedent child's household at the time of injury." The study also noted that children residing with a single parent (and no unrelated adults in the household) are at NO increased risk.
I'm not saying that this man is dangerous to you or your children. I am saying that you are not being prudent.
Engage in this relationship if you want to, but you are both rebounding, and this man should not be moving into your home until your life is more stable and you know him much better. He could be the greatest guy in the world, and if he is, he will respect your needs as a protective parent, and date you without moving in.
Dear Amy: One of my best friends is about to turn 30. Within the last few months, he has been depressed, and overall seems unhappy. Recently he emailed our close group of friends to share this information and to ask that we consider a weekend at the beach to help him celebrate his 30th. He said it would mean the world to him!
He even offered to pay for us to fly there.
I don't make as much money as my friends. If I tell him this, he will offer to pay, but I don't feel comfortable with him doing that. I am a grown adult and should pay for myself. I feel incredibly guilty, though, because I am getting married soon and he is in the wedding. He is spending time and money on me for all of my wedding-related activities and parties and I feel bad that I won't/can't offer support in return.
Should I suck it up and pay for a short and expensive weekend, or tell him that it just won't work?
-- Worried Friend
Dear Worried: You should take him up on his offer. He is crying out for companionship and willing to help you get to him. Let him do this, be a great and supportive guest, and celebrate his birthday -- and your friendship.
Dear Amy: "Priority Parent" was wondering how to correct children on the playground.
Your response was too wordy for kids! Children don't need to be told what NOT to do (especially when they already know). Simply say, "The slide is for going down -- not up." "Wood chips belong on the ground."
-- Simple Speaker
Dear Speaker: Thank you!
One of the worst kept secrets is that the next Chevrolet Corvette will be a mid-engine car. Adn the reason is because the current architecture has been taken as far as it can go.
Some good guess renderings have leaked so we wanted to ask if you like it and do you think it will be a huge success or will the move to mid-engine alienate and upset the Corvette traditionalists?

VANCOUVER—A chicken-catching company at the centre of an animal cruelty investigation in British Columbia says it will require staff to wear body cameras after an animal advocacy group released video of alleged abuse.
Dwayne Dueck, president of Elite Services in Chilliwack, says it will be mandatory for one supervisor and two staff members in each barn to wear cameras on their vests, and the video will be reviewed at the end of each day.
The announcement comes after the SPCA in British Columbia launched an investigation following the release of undercover video by Mercy for Animals that shows workers allegedly hitting, kicking and throwing chickens.

A statement from Elite Services says six staff members have now been fired, including two who were let go prior to the video being released, three who were fired immediately after, and one more who was terminated after the company did a “detailed forensic review” of the video.
Jaguar Land Rover has brought two new startups into its Portland Tech Incubator: LISNR and PILOT Automotive Labs. Previous cohorts at the incubator have ranged from parking apps to drones; these two continue to build on JLR's creative approach to the automotive future.
LISNR uses ultrasonic audio to transmit data. That's right — it transmits and receives sounds we can't hear. LISNR calls them Smart Tones. Any two devices — two vehicles' black boxes, say, or a car and a pedestrian with an enabled smartphone in their pocket — can send and receive messages once they're in range of each other. All the devices need is a microphone or a speaker, depending on whether they're sending or receiving, which keeps their power requirements low.
LISNR is already being used in non-automotive applications, like the Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center. The company was also part of the inaugural AutoMobili-D startup expo at the 2017 North America International Auto Show in Detroit.
PILOT promises to make any car autonomous. A sensor plugin is installed on your car's roof to take in data. (The sensor is mounted on a roof rack in the image above.) You can use that data to help you improve your driving, like many OBD-II port plug-in devices do, or you can connect it to your steering and braking systems and let it take over some simple driving tasks. It also connects to the cloud to learn of traffic situations and share its data.
PILOT brings some of the current advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to any car, like road sign recognition, lane keep assist, and blind spot monitoring. So using the term “autonomous,” as the startup does on its website, might be a bit premature. This is SAE Level 2 at best. But it is a step toward bringing life-saving collision mitigation technology to cars already on the road.

There was excitement at London Luton Airport, as easyJet's very first LEAP-1A powered A320neo “quieter aircraft” flew in to land.
The new plane touched down in Luton yesterday (June 14) at about 5.45pm, having flown over from Toulouse, France, where a ceremony attended by Carolyn McCall, easyJet CEO, Fabrice Bregier, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft and Airbus COO, and Gaël Méheust, CFM international CEO, took place.
easyJet CEO Carolyn McCall
Compared to previous aircraft, the NEO brings the town significant environmental and operational benefits – up to 15 per cent saving in fuel burn and CO2 emissions, and a reduced noise footprint of 50 per cent on take-off and landing phase.
It even has a special livery in celebration and was created for easyJet by Airbus, Toulouse, who design and manufacture aircraft.
Carolyn McCall, easyJet CEO, said: “We strive to reduce our carbon and noise impact on the environment and local communities.
“By using modern Airbus aircraft and flying them efficiently we have reduced the carbon impact of our flights by a third since 2000.”
However, Andrew Lambourne from environmental campaign group, LADACAN, questioned the news.
He said: “We welcome this long-awaited step, but let's remember that we were promised quieter aircraft hand-in-hand with significant expansion.
“Let's hear details of measures to attract quieter planes to Luton by way of reduced landing fees for quieter types and increased fees for noisier types, and let's have some visibility of aggressive targets to achieve an increasing percentage of quieter aircraft .
“Meanwhile, we are still calling on the airport operators to tighten noise controls, raising noisy flight penaties.”
But Carolyn was proud to announce that easyJet is Europe's largest customer for the NEO, adding:“With the addition of the A320neo and A321neo to the future easyJet fleet and with further planned efficiency improvements, easyJet has now set itself a tougher carbon emissions target of 72 grams by 2022.
“This is a 10 per cent reduction from today's performance and a 38 per cent improvement from 2000.
“With 130 NEO aircraft on order we are also Europe's largest customer for this revolutionary new plane and really looking forward to operating the NEO and realising its cost, customer, carbon and noise benefits.”
Neil Thompson, London Luton Airport's operations director, said: “Our airline partners are already operating some of the newest and quietest aircraft in the skies and we're delighted they are now introducing even quieter planes, earlier than anticipated.
“Working constructively with all of our partners and local communities we have the toughest noise control measures of any major UK airport and we look forward to the arrival of more of these quieter planes in the coming years.”
The easyJet A320neo has a 186 seat layout, and is powered by CFM LEAP-1A engines.
Based at London Luton Airport, it will start operating commercial flights on June 16 to Amsterdam, Madrid and Edinburgh.
FAISALABAD:- Two robbers were killed and two others fled away after a shootout with police here on Sunday. The shootout occurred near the shrine of Qaim Sain where police approached a four-member gang of robbers. Upon sighting the cops, the robbers started firing and tried to flee which led to a shootout. During crossfire, two robbers were killed and two others managed to escape from the scene. The police recovered arms the spot and shifted the bodies to hospital for post-mortem.

WITH regard to the recent tour of the Middle East by Prince William, I have been struck by the dignity and sensitivity he showed when talking to politicians and religious leaders, visiting sites important to all three religions, the tomb of his great-grandmother Princess Alice and somewhere as sensitive as Yad Vashem.
He warmed to the youngsters playing football at Jaffa, reaching out to them as others are not always able to do. His formal addresses did not shirk the problems of the region but one felt that he was sincerely concerned to do what he could to address them.
His visit could be a lesson to many of our politicians, and especially to our current Foreign Secretary, in showing how diplomacy works.
As Jayne Dowle says (The Yorkshire Post, June 28) in her article about Boris Johnson, Great Britain deserves a strong and persuasive representative, not a comedy turn.
Perhaps we should offer Prince William the job.
Cyclists must be responsible
From: Elisabeth Baker, Leeds.
DRIVERS are currently being urged to take more care when overtaking cyclists, and an interviewee on the Radio 4 PM Programme on June 29, when supporting the idea, referred to them as being less protected than motorists.
Some cyclists are looking for trouble through their own behaviour. Yesterday on a country road I saw a cyclist wearing only shorts – no top, no protective helmet – holding on to his handlebar with only his right hand, as he was holding a mobile phone to his left ear with his left hand. He seemed to be oblivious of other road users.
If cyclists want to be taken seriously as road users, they should look after themselves, as well as expecting drivers to look out for their wellbeing.
I am firmly of the opinion that all cyclists should have insurance and their cycles should have clearly visible identifying registration numbers. My views on cyclists who ride on pavements are not printable in a family newspaper.
Hope for an end to polio
From: David Mitchell, Chairman, The British Polio Fellowship.
AFTER reports of polio surfacing in Kenya and Venezuela, news that Nigeria has marked 22 months without a new case gives renewed cause for optimism.
Perhaps we are on track to see this terrible disease vanquished by the time we mark 80 years of The British Polio Fellowship in 2019.
Success is down to the hard work of vaccinating on the ground, but money matters.
Problems in Venezuela are largely down to the economy, so you can see why acts such as the Gates Foundation paying off Nigeria's $76m debt to Japan are so important in helping countries defeat polio.
That amazing donation led to 80 per cent vaccination coverage achieved; remarkable in a sometimes high-risk country with access and security challenges.
The British Polio Fellowship supports the efforts of Rotary and others working to make global eradication a reality.
Once achieved, survivors will need support with post-polio syndrome (PPS) that still affects 120,000 people in the UK. Even after the last case of polio, its unwanted legacy will live on for years to come.
Next stop the electric bus

GOOD news about the increased number of ‘real time' screens in the Leeds bus shelters (The Yorkshire Post, June 29) – and ‘next stop' screens on the buses themselves perhaps?
Speaking of which, I hear that Sherburn-in-Elmet's Optare is supplying 31 all-electric double-deckers to Transport for London. Leeds remains the only major European city still clinging grimly and overwhelmingly to all-bus public transport.
May we assume that ‘Transport for Leeds' will soon include Optare stock, or are the duplicitous ‘hybrids' – diesel-electrics – the best we can hope for?
Be wary of backing war
From: Coun Tim Mickleburgh (Lab), Boulevard Avenue, Grimsby.
AS A peace lover, I used to have difficulty with Remembrance Sunday. Indeed I still don't like to see the parade of soldiers or the involvement of politicians who have taken us into wars that really had nothing to do with us.
Yet, through making older friends, I have come to realise that people want to remember those who died for their country, and to ensure such as the Second World War never happens again. So I'm happy to attend a local ceremony each year.
Armed Forces Day is something different. It exists to celebrate what the forces do today. Yet, apart from UN peace-keeping missions, it has meant us being involved in the likes of Iraq and Afghanistan, wars I certainly never supported.
So by all means remember the fallen on November 11, but be very wary of an event which can be seemed as supporting what the military do, namely going to war.
Keep our Post Offices open
From: John Appelyard, Firthcliffe Parade, Liversedge.
IT has been announced that a further 12,000 bank closures will take place in the UK, and there is also to be a reduction in the number of cashpoints.
This makes it even more necessary to support our local Post Offices, which in my opinion are one of the finest institutions that we have in the UK.
You can access your high street bank account at any Post Office branch in the country.

The Dickey's at 105 S. Dixieland Road reopened thanks to a new franchise owner.
The Dickey's in Rogers, Fayetteville and Lowell closed in mid-January. The previous franchise owner is no longer with Dickey's, Callie Head, public relations manager, said.
Mike Stennett is a 25-year Steak and Shake franchise owner and decided to add a Dickey's location when the opportunity presented itself.
“We found out it's a great brand with a quality product and jumped on it,” Stennett said.
Stennett began overseeing Steak and Shakes in Branson, Mo., for his father. He branched into Northwest Arkansas with his wife, Lisa, where they opened a Fayetteville and Rogers location in 2005 and 2008. Stennett will continue managing Steak and Shake locations in Fayetteville, Rogers and St. Louis, and adding the Lowell Dickey's operation gives him the chance to continue doing what he loves, where he loves.
“We're continuing to grow and move forward in NWA,”Stennett said. “We're excited for Dickey's to be here and hopefully we can grow the brand here.”
Stennett is looking to reopen the Rogers and Fayetteville location by the end of the year.

On Saturday afternoon, the New Jersey Devils' season came to an end, as they were defeated by the Lightning to end their postseason run. Despite the loss, they accomplished a great deal in 2017-18 and finished well ahead of most's expectations. With the organization now moving ahead and looking into the future, there's plenty of reason to be excited about the direction of the Devils heading into 2018-19.
Devils' Core Young and Talented
One of the keys to the Devils success this season was due to the performances from their core players — starting with Taylor Hall. After a tough 2016-17, he increased his point totals by 40, finishing with career highs in points (93), goals (39), and assists (54). Had he not produced at an MVP level, it's unlikely the Devils would've qualified for the postseason.
While Hall was by far and away the Devils' best player this season, the team still managed to get significant contributions from other players. Kyle Palmieri, who missed 19 games due to injury, finished with 44 points in 62 games — good for a 58 point pace over an 82-game season. Palmieri has been one of the Devils' most consistent players since being acquired in a trade in 2015, and despite injuries, this season was no different.
The Devils also relied on several first and second-year players to make the playoffs. Nico Hischier finished his rookie campaign with 52 points (20 goals, 32 assists), while Miles Wood finished with 19 goals, an 11-goal jump from last year. Blake Coleman, who only had two points in 23 games last season, finished with 25 in 79 games this season and was one of the team's top defensive forwards.
In addition to Hischier, Wood, and Coleman, Jesper Bratt made a name for himself with a strong preseason and first half of the regular season. Despite totaling only nine points in his final 34 games, Bratt finished the season with 35 points in 74 games. He was a regular through most of the season and spent plenty of time on the top line with Hischier and Hall — pretty impressive considering he was a sixth-round pick just in 2016.
On defense, Will Butcher proved to be a steal and had one of the best rookie seasons for a defenseman in franchise history. He finished with 44 points in 81 games, which is the most for a rookie defenseman since Scott Niedermayer's in 1992-93. At 23-years old, he figures to be a valuable part of the Devils going forward and should see an increased role next season.
What all these players mentioned above have in common is that they're 27 years old or younger. All are under team control for the foreseeable future, as well. That positions the Devils to build on this year's success not only in 2018-19 but in the years to follow.
Devils Filled with Exciting Prospects
When Ray Shero took over as Devils general manager in 2015, the Devils' pipeline was lacking speed and skill. Since then, the organization has made a priority of drafting young forwards who fit the speedy style of hockey they want to play. They even saw the benefits of that this season with Hischier and Bratt.
Over the next season or two, the Devils should see more of these prospects making a push to make the NHL roster. John Quenneville, who missed plenty of time with injury this season, has been knocking on the door for a couple of seasons now. He's played in 14 NHL games the last two seasons but hasn't been able to maintain a regular spot with the big club. Could 2018-19 finally be the season he cracks the NHL roster?
Quenneville is not the only forward in the AHL who has a shot at the NHL next season. Nick Lappin finished as the Binghamton Devils' second-leading scorer with 53 points in 65 games. He's also played a total of 49 games with the big club since 2016 and could be ready for a shot at a regular spot much like Quenneville.
While Lappin and Quenneville may be the closest players to earning an NHL spot, other prospects are on the way, too. Joey Anderson, who just won a National Championship with the University of Minnesota Duluth, signed an ELC with the Devils during the playoffs. Michael McLeod, the team's first-round pick in 2016, will also begin his first full professional season in 2018-19. The organization also has a few promising prospects over in Europe, such as Jesper Boqvist, who could be a year or two away from making their NHL debuts.
The Devils may not be as loaded on defense as they are up front, but they do have a couple of prospects that should help their back end over the next few seasons. That said, they do lack an A-level defense prospect and is something they make take a look at in this year's entry draft.

Final Thoughts on Devils Season
The Devils are already reaping the benefits of their young players, such as Hischier and Butcher, at the NHL level. Their best players are locked up long-term, and they have more talent working up through the system. The Devils do have quite a few needs entering the offseason, but they'll have around $20 million in cap space to help address some of them. Given that and the prospects they have coming up, the Devils are in a prime position to sustain their success beyond the 2017-18 season.
Charlie Angus: “The only discussion we've had on the environment is ‘this pipeline versus that pipeline.' There's no talk about how we get to move forward or laying out the roadmap,” Angus said. ( Justin Tang / THE CANADIAN PRESS file photo )
OTTAWA—NDP leadership candidate Charlie Angus says his opponents in the race are too focused on pipeline politics, and proposes that Canada adopt a “carbon budget” to curb emissions in the long term instead of squabbling over particular resource projects. “The only discussion we've had on the environment is ‘this pipeline versus that pipeline.' There's no talk about how we get to move forward or laying out the roadmap,” Angus said in an interview Wednesday. “I'm saying: ‘Let's look at the horizon and where we need to be, and let's lay out the plan of how to get there.' ” The MP from northern Ontario is one of five candidates vying to replace Tom Mulcair as leader of the federal NDP. Angus plans to release his plan to tackle climate change on Thursday, and his campaign provided it in advance to the Star. The plan is centred on a “carbon-budget” proposal, which Angus compared to the system in place in the United Kingdom. He said it would work like a hard cap on emissions, which would be mandated by legislation and determined on a sector-by-sector basis by a panel of experts and stakeholders.

Angus would also create a new crown corporation to advise Ottawa on where to invest money for clean technology and renewable energy, and, in this way, “take the politics” out of climate-change planning. “Twenty years, we've talked about how we're going to meet our international targets. There are all kinds of positive platitudes, and no plan, no direction for it, and, year after year, the greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise,” Angus said. “We need a roadmap. We need a direction to go.”
The NDP has consistently attacked the Liberal government for maintaining targeted emissions reductions that were set under the previous Conservative administration. Canada has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below the 2005 level by 2030. Angus and other New Democrats have also argued the Liberals aren't doing enough to meet that target, while the government insists its incoming regulations on methane, the phase-out of coal-fired energy, a carbon-pricing plan, and other measures, will get the job done. At the same time, environmental policies — particularly pipelines — have become a faultline in NDP circles, dividing supporters of a managed transition away from fossil fuels from those that want to halt projects that would increase emissions. The most glaring example is Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which will more than double the amount of oilsands bitumen that it already carries from Alberta through B.C. to the Pacific Coast. The project was approved by the federal government last year and has provoked a family feud in the NDP, with Alberta Premier Rachel Notley at loggerheads with B.C. leader John Horgan, who has vowed to block the project. Niki Ashton, a Manitoba MP who is also in the race for the federal leadership, has called for a “united statement” of all candidates to oppose the pipeline expansion. Fellow contenders Peter Julian and Guy Caron have said they don't want it to go through, while Ontario MPP Jagmeet Singh has not announced his position — despite some prodding by his opponents at the latest candidates' debate in Newfoundland on Sunday. Angus also did not say whether he opposes or supports the project, but said that, as leader, he said he would aim to bring the Alberta and B.C. members together to resolve their differences. He also blamed the federal government for approving a pipeline that would increase oil tanker traffic in the water off Vancouver, and for relying on a process that allowed it to go through without wider support. “This is not going to be a simple solution, but we're here because of an incoherent national energy strategy that's gone on for decades,” Angus said. NDP members will vote on a new leader this fall.

The chief of police in Tempe, Arizona, where an Uber self-driving car just hit and killed a pedestrian, has told the San Francisco Chronicle that “I suspect preliminarily it appears that the Uber would likely not be at fault in this accident.”
Chief Sylvia Moir explained after viewing the car's own video of the event that “she came from the shadows right into the roadway,” and that “it would have been difficult to avoid this collision in any kind of mode.”
A lighted crosswalk was nearby but the place where the accident occurred was in the dark. The car would almost certainly have been aware of the pedestrian, but it's also possible that she moved out in front of the car faster than the car could reasonably be stopped.
The details are known only to Uber and the authorities at present and it wouldn't be right to speculate too far, but Moir certainly seems to suggest that the latter scenario is a possibility.
New Delhi
Shortly after a US$2 billion (S$2.6 billion) bank fraud was uncovered last month (February) at India's state-owned Punjab National Bank, a picture emerged of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the alleged fraudster.
The photo showed PM Modi posing at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan 23 with a large business delegation that included billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi, who is at the centre of the unfolding scandal.
That was enough for opponents and even one of PM Modi's coalition partners to question his commitment to rooting out corruption – a key part of his pitch to voters.
Government officials said the jeweller was just part of a separate, non-official business delegation, and that the prime minister had only stopped by for a photo.
Still, the scandal may already be having an impact. On March 14, PM Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost three by-elections in the populous and politically crucial states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
While investigations continue into India's biggest-ever bank fraud, the by-election results show the BJP's reputation is on the line as it faces several state-level polls and a general election over the next 12 months.
Riding to power on a pledge to unearth unaccounted wealth, PM Modi justified a move to ban 86 per cent of the country's currency in November 2016 on an anti-graft push, a policy that hurt the economy due to its botched implementation.
“This case could well deliver a blow to the Modi administration's anti-corruption bonafides,” said Mr Michael Kugelman, Asia programme director at the Woodrow Wilson Centre in Washington, D.C.
“The government's response will be subjected to ample scrutiny in India and beyond, not just because it has emphatically and repeatedly called for crackdowns on corruption, but because of Modi's close ties to big business.”
Mr Nirav Modi, who has dressed actresses including Kate Winslet and Priyanka Chopra, has been accused – along with his uncle Mehul Choksi – of defrauding Punjab National Bank. The bank alleges the duo and their associates worked with some rogue employees and used fake guarantees to obtain loans from abroad. Both deny the allegations.
Though Mr Nirav Modi shares the same surname as the prime minister, the two are not related.
In addition to the photo, critics are also looking to undermine the government with a video from 2015 of the prime minister addressing Mr Choksi as Mehul-bhai – an affectionate term for brother.
Mr Jagdish Thakkar, a spokesman in the Prime Minister's Office, did not respond to a call seeking comment.
PM Modi's administration had formed a so-called Banks Board Bureau to improve governance standards and underwriting processes at state-run lenders. However, the bureau said it has not heard back from the Finance Ministry on recommendations made a year ago, according to a statement on March 19.—Agencies

SPOILER ALERT: Do not read if you have not yet watched “Postpartum,” the 12th episode of the second season of “The Handmaid's Tale”
When Bradley Whitford tries to put his experience with “The Handmaid's Tale” into words, the first thing that comes to mind is that it is a “brutal show” and “overwhelming to watch.”
He's not the first to say so.
But he also says it has been a “profoundly creative experience,” all-around, including costume fittings, shooting his scenes, and looping dialogue after production.
“It is obviously one of the most emotionally brutal shows that has ever been made, and it is truly the sweetest, kindest set you've ever been on, which I think enhances the work. But it is quite a contrast once they say action,” Whitford says.
The veteran actor made his debut as Commander Joseph Lawrence on the Hulu and MGM series with Wednesday's release of the second season's penultimate episode, “Postpartum.” As the architect of Gilead's economy, Lawrence was one of the few commanders left still willing to take in Emily (Alexis Bledel) as a handmaid after all the incidents at her other postings.
“I'm wondering why such an important, brilliant man would take in such a s—-y handmaid,” Emily says to Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd) on Lawrence's doorstep before she's handed over once again.
While the episode doesn't jump to answer the question, it is apparent that not all of the rules in Gilead apply to Lawrence.
Art adorns his walls, books are out in the open, and his response to Emily's pious introductory speech was summed up with one word: “super.” Meanwhile his wife (Julie Dretzin) has suffered some mental blows and his one-eyed martha, Cora (Victoria Fodor), isn't afraid to speak her mind. (Margaret Atwood fans will note the latter character's name is the same as the other martha serving the Waterfords in the novel on which the series is based, potentially highlighting Lawrence's future importance.)
“It's an amazing character. You get these characters once in a while where there are several things going on simultaneously— several contradictory and dangerous things,” Whitford says.
Whitford is certainly no stranger to varied roles, having headlined series like the critically acclaimed “The West Wing” and “Trophy Wife” while also guest-starring on shows like “Transparent,” “Happyish” and “Shameless.” But when it came to starring in this Elisabeth Moss led project, he says he and fiancée Amy Landecker were “obsessed” from a viewer standpoint, making Lawrence a role that he was intensely interested in landing.
“What Lizzie, and Yvonne [Strahovski], and Alexis, and what everyone is doing on that show is a generational achievement in storytelling,” he says. “I've done this enough that you can see it's a wonderfully creative atmosphere because everybody's blood is flowing and there are great performances across the board. I could see from the outside that creatively everyone is at their best. When you see a situation like that you want to get in there. And I'm telling you it's everything.”
This may also be the first time in the actor's decades-long career that he's been a part of something as culturally relevant as he feels “Handmaid's is.” He recalls reading Atwood's original tome in the 1980s when certain right-wingers wanted to restrict women's access to healthcare, noting that nowadays such enthusiasts are “explicit” and that they don't even “try to camouflage” it anymore.
“It's certainly [ironic to film in Canada]. I can tell you people in Canada are pretty bewildered as to why we have a president as contemptuous towards someone like Justin Trudeau but [who] is hot for dictators all over the world,” Whitford says. “As an American you're certainly a little self-conscious of it. The show hits something for me culturally and politically. Misogyny is at the reptilian brain stem of a lot of right-wing politics. Misogyny is why abortion is such an issue. It's perhaps why in this country we were willing to enthusiastically elect an African American man but not so much a woman as president.”
Whitford remains fairly quiet on the role his character plays on orchestrating and maintaining the fictional world of Gilead, what he wants with a handmaid like Emily, and what kind of fallout viewers can expect between the pair heading into the finale, but he does have an idea of a few real-life historical figures to whom he'd liken Commander Lawrence. That shortlist includes Robert McNamara, the U.S. secretary of defense who essentially orchestrated the escalation of the Vietnam War and then spent the rest of his years living in a state of regret. It's just another art-imitating-life, life-imitating-art moment that's becoming synonymous with this show.
“Holy God, it's terrifying. I did ‘Real Time With Bill Maher' with Michael Moore and he went on and on about how one of the most fascinating things about the show is in those flashbacks and the moments where we didn't realize what was happening,” Whitford says. “One of the moments that he found most terrifying was when Alexis's character got in trouble because one of her students saw a picture of her with her wife and so she basically endangered her job at the university… that happened at a high school in Texas this year.”
That “truly scares” Whitford, who recalls watching Bruce Miller accepting awards for “The Handmaid's Tale's” first season and saying things to the effect of, “Let's make sure this is a dystopian fantasy and not a documentary.” Whitford says that line got laughs at the time, but “it's not as funny now.”
“We're certainly not there yet and it would be irresponsible to overstate it, but there are elements of that misogyny present today,” he says. My favorite quote now is from Sinclair Lewis, who said, ‘When fascism comes to America it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.' That feels sort of dead on.”
“The Handmaid's Tale” streams new episodes Wednesdays on Hulu.
A body was discovered in a rural area east of Clare in Webster County on Saturday afternoon.
The Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation is assisting the Webster County Sheriff's Department in the investigation. An autopsy is to be performed on the body. The name of the victim has not been released until all relatives are notified.
Last week, the sheriff's department received a report of two missing individuals, 26-year-old Jessica Gomez of Fort Dodge and 26-year-old Mackenzie Knigge of Clare. Knigge was found safe last Thursday in Indiana. Gomez is still missing, but officials have not commented on whether her disappearance is connected to the body found Saturday near Clare.

SAN FRANCISCO—Red lanterns sway in the wind. Street lamps from the 1930s cast a yellow-green glare onto century-old buildings. Neon glows from a pair of dive bars. Figures are silhouetted waiting outside a restaurant and a lone woman makes dragon beard candy in a tiny storefront window. All are nighttime scenes along Grant Ave. in San Francisco's Chinatown.
The avenue, which runs north and south, is one of the oldest streets in the city. In the late 1800s, it became home to Chinese immigrants who were fleeing unrest at home, seeking opportunity here or following the Gold Rush. Many of the neighbourhood's buildings today can be traced to reconstruction efforts after the 1906 earthquake.
Grant Ave. is a bustling street during the day, often filled with tourists in search of souvenirs or locals shopping for food. But at night the street is quiet, allowing for leisurely strolling and new discoveries. Many stores close early with only a few bars, restaurants and bakeries open late. It's an interesting place to stroll this time of year and reflect on the area's culture and history as Lunar New Year approaches, Feb. 16, launching the year of the dog.
At the intersection of Grant Ave. and Washington St. are a pair of dive bars located 10 steps away from each other. One is the Li Po Cocktail Lounge, named for a poet in China's Tang Dynasty, dating to the 1930s. Inside its red lacquered doors sits a golden Buddha statue behind a wraparound bar. The Li Po is known for its $9 (U.S.) Chinese Mai Tai made with three rums, pineapple juice and a “Chinese Liqueur” served in a plastic hurricane glass and packing a wallop to the unsuspecting. Nearby is the Buddha Lounge, a dinky, quirky dive known for betting on your drink in a game of Liar's Dice between you and the bartender.
Where Grant Ave. meets Broadway St. near the North Beach district is China Live, which opened last year and serves as an anchor point for the revitalization effort within the greater Chinatown neighbourhood. The four-storey building is a culinary and cultural landmark. It includes multiple restaurants, bars, a retail market and an event space. China Live was founded by George Chen and his wife, Cindy Wong-Chen. George Chen is known as the creator of two well-known, now-closed restaurants elsewhere in the city, Betelnut and Shanghai 1930.

Joe Nathan Duncan is charged with capital murder in the homicide of 91-year-old Mabel Fowler of Dothan. (Source: Dothan Police Department)
Dothan police say a homeless man killed the elderly woman who had recently given him a job. Joe Nathan Duncan, 58, is charged with capital murder in the death of Mabel Fowler, 91.
Fowler's body was found at her home Saturday, located off Hodgesville Road. Police say they believe she was killed that morning, though her body was discovered around 8 p.m. by her caretaker who had been trying to reach her.
During a press conference Monday, Dothan Police Chief Steve Parrish confirmed Fowler had hired Duncan to help with yard work about three weeks before her death.
“She was never married or had any kids,"Chief Parrish said. "What she did have was a giving heart.”
The chief said surveillance video at a nearby business captured Fowler checking her mail Saturday morning, then showed Duncan entering her home not long after. Parrish said the video was a key piece of evidence in charging the man with murder.
“I know the question is going to be asked, did he confess?" Parrish stated. "The answer is, by the lies he told us we've got our man.”
Dothan Mini Storage South is located directly across the street from Ms. Fowler's home. They installed their surveillance system just days before she was killed as a way of providing security for their business. The decision ended up being key in the investigation.
One of the cameras at the front of the business faces the elderly woman's driveway.
“To know if for no other reason that these cameras stopped somebody from ever doing the same thing again," said manager Gary Frederick. "If he had not been caught, if he did this, it's a good chance he'll do it again. Just to know that helped catch him, it makes us feel real good.”
A preliminary investigation shows Fowler may have died from blunt force trauma, and an edged weapon was possibly used.
“This is a difficult case," the chief said. "It's one that resonates throughout our community and reminds us how violent people can be and how little value they have for life.”
Fowler's family says knowing how she may have died has been one of the most difficult parts of coping with her death.
“This type of death is entirely different. I have been in that room with her, symbolically speaking, and walked through that thing, seeing what she went through. It's just about more than you can take. It was a gruesome, gruesome thing,” said Marvette Holland, the victim's cousin. “We love her. We miss her.”
Holland says he would visit her at least once a week but never encountered Duncan.
Police say robbery was the motive. They are also looking for more evidence, a black book bag that belonged to Duncan.
According to police, the suspect has an extensive criminal history dating back to the 1970s that includes drug charges, assault, and burglary.
Police also urge anyone looking to hire help to feel free to contact the department to get a cursory check on potential hires. It provides some details about the person's background.
Police credit the Houston County Sheriff's Office, the Houston County District Attorney's Office, and Dale County Sheriff's Office with help in the investigation.
Suspects convicted in capital murder cases could face the death penalty.

Google is now expanding its team of chip experts so that it can build its own chipsets for future Pixel smartphones. Manu Gulati was instrumental in Apple's bid to build custom chips for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. Photo: Bloomberg
Los Angeles: Internet search giant Google has hired Indian-origin engineer Manu Gulati, who was Apple's chip architect for iPads and iPhones, to play a key role in building its upcoming flagship pixel phone, according to media reports.
Gulati, who had worked at Apple for almost eight years as a micro-architect, announced the job change through LinkedIn.
He is now the Lead SoC Architect for Google. He has at least 15 Apple patents related to chip design under his belt and will be key in Google's plan to build its own processors, the CNBC reported.
Google is now expanding its team of chip experts so that it can build its own chipsets for future Pixel smartphones. Gulati was instrumental in Apple's bid to build custom chips for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV.
In the past, he has been responsible for the A4 and A9 chips which powered the 2010 iPad. Apple currently builds its own smartphone processors but Google does not.
Apple's newest A10X chips, for example, are built-in house instead of by companies like Intel or Qualcomm. Qualcomm currently supplies its Snapdragon processor for Google's Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. Google's new hire could help the company differentiate Pixel from the many other smartphones by other vendors that run Android on Qualcomm (QCOM, -0.92%) chips.
And Gulati's exit is seen as a set back for Apple (AAPL, -0.98%), which has filed a number of chip-related patents that credit Gulati as an inventor.
Gulati's LinkedIn profile says he is now Google's lead SOC architect. SoC stands for system on a chip. He has also been employed by Broadcom and AMD.
With Gulati now part of its team, Google can have an edge over other companies while it comes as a significant blow to Cupertino-based Apple.
“Apple filed a total of 15 chip-related patents that credit Gulati as one of the inventors. Some of these filings describe fundamental chip architecture, while others are more specific to certain applications,” the report said.
If Google begins building processors in house, like Apple, it would potentially cut down on Google's reliance on Qualcomm, the report said. Other firms, such as Huawei and Samsung, have also started to build chips in-house, allowing them to rely less on potential supply restraints from outside parties. A spokesperson for Apple was not immediately available for comment, the report said.
Google confirmed that Gulati is now working for the company but declined to provide additional details.
The federal government has penalized 769 U.S. hospitals who had high rates of patient injuries and other hospital acquired conditions such as the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, according to NPR. The penalties are based on the percentage of avoidable complications that patients are experiencing in the hospitals, such as bed sores, blood clots, falls and certain infections. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services determined the penalties based on which hospitals have the highest rates of these complications. This year was the first year that hospitalized were also penalized for the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria “superbugs” methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile (C. difficile or C. diff). The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimates there were 6,300 cases of infections from MRSA last year and the agency reported C. difficile was found in 100,000 cases last year. Hospitals penalized by Medicare for spread of #AntibioticResistance -Does your hospital have a strong ASP? https://t.co/4fRmmWEeOV — DASON (@DASON_duke) December 23, 2016 The Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program, which is run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, examines rates of infections from hospital surgeries and procedures to determine which hospitals are the lowest performing in patient safety. The hospital-acquired complications often take place after procedures such as hysterectomies, colon surgeries and the insertion of urinary tract catheters and central line tubes. Complications such as bed sores, hip fractures and blood clots are also factored into the hospital scores, along with other complications. The Federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimates there were 3.8 million hospital injuries last year, which amounts to 115 injuries for every 1,000 patient hospital stays, according East Bay Times. Approximately a quarter of a million of those injuries involve patients who became infected with bacteria resistant to antibiotics while in the hospital. The CDC estimates that 2 million people acquired antibiotic-resistant infections last year, 23,000 of whom died. They estimate that between 20 and 50 percent of all antibiotics prescribed in hospitals are either not needed or inappropriate. The overuse of antibiotics — not just in hospitals but among outpatients and in farm animals used in our food supply — has led to the spread of stubborn bacterial strains that can be deadly for patients who become infected with them. How hospitals, nursing homes keep deadly ‘superbug' outbreaks secret https://t.co/1TTbNhjQHj#MRSA #healthpolicy — HCSM News (@HCSMnews) December 23, 2016 The government informed the hospitals that they would be cutting 1 percent of their Medicare payments as a penalty for the high rates of injuries, which is expected to cost larger hospitals over a million dollars each. The cuts will affect Medicare payments over this federal fiscal year, which runs from October 2016 through next September. The federal government does not penalize specialized hospitals, such as those that treat psychiatric patients, veterans and children, which are exempt from the penalties. Hospitals that are designated “critical access” facilities because they are the only provider in the area are also exempt from the penalties. The Affordable Care Act requires that Medicare penalize the lowest performing 25 percent of the remaining hospitals, even if they have reduced their complication, injury and infection rates from previous years. The penalized hospitals will lose about $430 million in total, which is 18 percent more than they lost last year, according to an estimate from the Association of American Medical Colleges. The list of hospitals penalized for patient safety is out. Is yours on the list? https://t.co/ZkiqJCH7cX pic.twitter.com/95XqMGSDN8 — Kaiser Health News (@KHNews) December 26, 2016 To see if your area hospitals are on the list of those penalized, you can refer to Kaiser Health News, which has listed all of the low-performing hospitals that were penalized nationwide. The database is searchable, allowing you to search by city, state or hospital name. Note that Maryland hospitals are exempted from the penalties because Maryland has a separate payment arrangement with Medicare. [Featured Image by Chaikom/Shutterstock]

In the Toronto region, where home prices climbed 20 per cent year-over-year in the first quarter of 2017, the median price of a two-storey home rose to $894,919 from $734,414 last year, according to a Royal LePage report. Bernard Weil / Toronto Star ) Order this photo
More than six in 10 Torontonians want to see the federal government apply cooling measures to the fevered housing market, says a new poll by Campaign Research. The finding comes as the Toronto region continued to show double-digit price gains in the first three months of the year, according to a quarterly report by Royal LePage. The poll also coincides with a meeting Tuesday between federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau, his provincial counterpart Charles Sousa and Toronto Mayor John Tory. The three levels of government will discuss how to help balance the property market without stifling its economic benefits — something that requires extreme caution, according to some experts. The poll results obtained by the Toronto Star, show that 58 per cent of Canadians and 64 per cent of Torontonians want Ottawa to intervene in the rising cost and steep competition for real estate. "There's no doubt there definitely is an appetite among people in Toronto and British Columbia generally to see some movement of some form of government intervention," said Eli Yufest, CEO of Campaign Research.
Article Continued Below
The online study, conducted between April 3 and 11, shows younger people are most likely to support government intervention. About 70 per cent of respondents aged 18 to 35 agreed the government should step in. The reasons are obvious, said Yufest. "They generally are the ones who finished school recently and they're just starting off in their careers and they probably don't have the funds to buy a house in Toronto,” he said. “So they're the ones who probably need the most support." A foreign buyers tax, such as the one implemented last year in Vancouver, is the preferred mechanism for tamping down soaring prices, according to 39 per cent of national poll respondents.
A vacant homes tax is the best course according to 17 per cent of Torontonians, although only 13 per cent of Canadians favoured that option. Eleven per cent of all respondents favoured tighter mortgage rules. Seven per cent said the government should do nothing and 15 per cent said they didn't know. The poll surveyed 1,970 respondents across Canada and is considered accurate within 2 per cent 19 times out of 20. Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper doesn't support government intervention. But if they are going to act, politicians should avoid policies that are aimed only at tempering prices and, instead, consider measures that have broader objectives, he said. "If we decide as a society that it is better for Toronto that homes be occupied by renters or owners and, if people are leaving them vacant, we should encourage them not to and impose a tax. If they still don't want to, it fills the coffers," he said. "You can't do it just to manipulate prices because these measures have been shown to have an immaterial or short-term impact on home prices," he said. Vancouver, the most obvious example of foreign buyer and vacant home taxes, is showing signs of rebounding, said Soper. His company's House Price Survey shows that after seven months of falling real estate values in Vancouver, buyers appear ready to re-enter the market. Soper says the correction cycle could be over as early as this summer. "In the coming weeks, it is possible that six months of pent-up demand will be unleashed on the market, sending prices sharply upward again," he said. In the Toronto region, where home prices climbed 20 per cent year-over-year in the first quarter of 2017, the median price of a two-storey home rose to $894,919 from $734,414 last year. Bungalows went to $752,114, from $630,444 in the first quarter of 2016, according to the Royal LePage report. Price rises were particularly intense in communities outside Toronto. Richmond Hill had the largest first-quarter aggregate price (comprising two-storey homes, bungalows and condominiums) increase of 31.5 per cent to about $1.3 million. International interest helped push aggregate prices up 26 per cent in Markham, said the real estate company's report. "Despite sellers beginning to decide to cash in on current rates of appreciation in the region, an extreme pre-existing lack of inventory has helped home values jump higher," it said. But Scarborough remained one of the most affordable areas outside of Toronto's downtown. Its aggregate price climbed to $625,487 in the first quarter, a 17.3 per cent year-over-year increase. Help with housing: Poll 63% Toronto-area respondents agree the federal government should intervene to cool housing prices in major cities. That compares to 50 per cent of those on the Prairies and 58 per cent on average nationally. 65% Canadians aged 18 to 44, who agreed the government should try and cool the property markets, compared to 52% of those over age 44. 41% Canadians with incomes between $20,000 and $60,000 per year, who believe the government should impose a foreign buyers tax, compared to 38% of those with an annual income over $60,000.

PenFed's new card pays 2% cash back
Posted: 12 pm ET
The nation's third-largest credit union has just unveiled a credit card that pays 2 percent cash back on all purchases, and charges no annual fee.
If you don't mind the legwork, Pentagon Federal Credit Union's offer is a decent one.
CARD SEARCH: Going on vacation? Take a card that charges no foreign transaction fee.
To qualify for the Power Cash Rewards Visa card, you'll have to become a member of this credit union. Membership is open to military personnel and their families, but anyone can join by first joining one of two non-profit groups, Voices for America's Troops or the National Military Family Association. A one-time $17 fee applies.
Members must open a savings account with a $5 minimum deposit. That's enough to earn you 1.5 percent cash back on purchases with your Power Cash card. Earn another 0.50 percent by either opening a PenFed checking account or by meeting the bank's military service criteria.
Other features include:
A $100 sign-up bonus if you spend $1,500 in the first 90 days of card ownership.
12 month zero-percent interest on balance transfers.
No foreign transaction fees.
A variable APR of 9.24 to 17.99 percent based on creditworthiness.
How the card stacks up
You can compare Power Cash rewards program with likes of the Citi Double Cash card and the Discover Cashback Match, the only other programs offering 2-for-1 rewards on everyday spending.
The Double Cash card pays 1 percent back on purchases and then another 1 percent back as you pay your bill. Both have the same balance transfer fee of 3 percent, but the Citi Double Cash card has a longer 18 months interest-free. The Citi Double has a variable APR of 13.49 to 23.49 percent, so for those who qualify for lower interest rates, it's hard to best PenFed's 9.24 APR.
The Citi Double Cash card also comes with some great travel protections that PenFed doesn't offer, but it also has a foreign transaction fee of 3 percent, making a card like the PenFed Power Cash possibly the more economical choice for travel abroad.
The Discover Cashback Match offer is only good for the first year of card ownership. After that, you'll earn 1 percent on all purchases, except for the quarterly rotating categories that can earn up to 5 percent back.
CARD SEARCH: Get travel rewards credit card that pays more today.
Other PenFed reward cards
PenFed offers two other rewards credit cards. The Platinum Rewards Visa Signature card pays 5 times points at the gas pump, 3 times at the supermarket and 1 point on other purchases. The Premium Travel Rewards American Express card offers 5 times points on all airfare purchases and 1 point everything else.

PESHAWAR, Jul 4 (APP):Federal Minister for Information, Broadcasting, National History and Literary Heritage Barrister Syed Ali Zafar on Wednesday said that after the merger of Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, everybody should strive to make the process successful.
Talking to media here after a joint meeting of the committees of federal and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments to facilitate the merger process, he said FATA's merger was a historic step of the century, as a big area was merged into the province. “We have to make this process successful.”
He said the package for facilitating the merger of FATA areas into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would be announced in a few days after a meeting in Islamabad.
He said during the fruitful meeting, all issues about the merger process were discussed in detail.
The KP chief minister and other members of the provincial committee would attend the next meeting in Islamabad to finalize the package, he added.
He said the package would include judicial reforms, tax exemptions, administrative measures, infrastructure development, funds transfer matters and fulfillment of promises made with the people of FATA, he added. The details were being finalized by the sub-committees, he said.
The minister said after the next meeting of the committees, the caretaker government would lay down the guidelines for the next government, which would be helpful to take the merger process forward.
The minister said it was clearly mentioned in an article of the Constitution, that provincial assembly election in FATA areas would be held in a year. The Election Commission would carry out delimitation of constituencies and then elections would be held in those areas, he explained.
To a question, he said the caretaker government was totally impartial and would not be part of any blame game. “If somebody wants to talk to anybody, it is their right. We are doing our work and after completion of our constitutional period we will go back.”
To a question, he said the government was trying to resolve issues of FATA and the financial commitment which was made by the federal and provincial governments should be fulfilled.
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said on Friday preparations for the 2018 soccer World Cup were on track and that authorities had no concerns regarding the state of the 12 venues that will host matches.
Mutko told Reuters that authorities were working seriously on curbing racism in Russian soccer and that stadium security had been increased in the run-up to the tournament.
Russia will host the World Cup from June 14 to July 15 in 12 venues spread across 11 cities including Moscow, St Petersburg and Sochi.
GAZA CITY - Egypt reopened its border with the Gaza Strip Monday for the first time in months to allow Muslims from the blockaded Palestinian enclave to travel to Makkah for the haj pilgrimage, authorities said.
"The crossing was reopened this morning for four days in one direction for 2,500 pilgrims," Hisham Adwan, director of information at the crossings authority of the Hamas-run interior ministry, said. "About 800 pilgrims will leave the strip today," he added, saying they had all already received Saudi visas.
The Rafah crossing with Egypt has been largely closed in recent years apart from occasional openings.
Israel has also maintained a crippling blockade on Gaza for a decade that it says is necessary to stop Islamist movement Hamas, which rules the strip, from obtaining weapons or materials that could be used to make them. Egypt is the only other country with which the strip has a land border. Egyptian authorities accuse Hamas of supporting Islamist factions in the country.
But Hamas has moved closer to the Egyptian government in recent months and officials privately hope the Rafah crossing will be at least partially reopened from next month.
One pilgrim who was waiting to cross the border told AFP he had been trying to travel to Makkah since 2014.

LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - British buyout firm Bridgepoint has mandated Rothschild to sell the residential care business of Care UK, four financial sources familiar with the matter said.
Private equity backers have been ubiquitous in Britain's care homes sector. Another British private equity firm Terra Firma had to write down its investment in Four Seasons, one of the country's biggest care home operators.
But Care UK's care homes had a much higher proportion of beds paid for privately by residents and was therefore less reliant on government spending, sources said.
“Care UK has a very good portfolio of assets and its new care homes are pretty good,” one of the sources said, adding that private equity and infrastructure funds had shown interest.
Bridgepoint and Rothschild declined to comment.
The private equity backer of fast food chain Pret A Manger delisted and acquired Care UK in 2010 in a 414 million pounds ($584 million) deal, financed by a 250 million pound high yield bond.
A healthcare division of the group is not part of the sale, sources said. Bridgepoint had sold parts of the business since, and several sources said it was too soon to estimate a valuation.
In the year ending September 2017, the residential care division accounted for 32.9 million pounds of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and 300.7 million pounds of annual revenue.
Care UK's entire EBITDA was 38.7 million pounds on a revenue of 658 million pounds, according to its website.
Care UK operates 118 care homes with close to 8,000 beds.
On its website, Bridgepoint says Care UK enjoys long-term opportunities in residential and social care underpinned by favourable trends in healthcare outsourcing and the demands placed on health systems by an ageing population and higher expectations from the public.
Care UK could be at risk of a higher wage bill, if Britain's plan to leave the European Union results in fewer European healthcare workers competing for jobs.
ENGLEWOOD — Before Jimmy and David and Jay and Johnny, even before Jack, even before Ellen and Oprah and Kelly, there was Ruth.
For about 20 years, Ruth Lyons' talk show aired at noon on local television stations. Called “The 50 Club” because the studio held 50 people, it later expanded to be “The 50-50 Club,” but her format of music, guests and ad-libbed conversation with them and her sidekicks set the formula for talk shows since then.
Area residents too young to remember the show may have received one of the toys supplied to hospitalized children through her Christmas Fund. She boasted that every donation received from viewers and businesses was processed by volunteers from the station, with every cent going to buy toys.
Local officials and businesses paid attention. She didn't advertise products she disliked, and her commercials could guarantee sales in the area. When she complained on the show that a “DEAD END” sign on a street entering a cemetery was appalling, the city replaced it with “NOT A THRU STREET.”
In 1950, a group of 20 women from Clayton traveled to Cincinnati, an ambitious trip when State Route 49 was only a two-lane highway through many small towns, to attend “The 50-50 Club.”
In the photo, Lyons is standing at the left of the back row.
The History Center, 114 Valleyview Dr., Englewood, is open by special appointment from November through March. Call 832-8358 to make arrange a visit. Everyone is welcome to attend the Randolph Township Historical Society meetings at 1 p.m. on the second Wednesday of each month.

It's been about a year and a half since Pusha T released his album Darkest Before Dawn: The Prelude. That's a great LP, but to hear Pusha talk about it, it's not the real album; it's merely the opening shot for his long-awaited new opus King Push. As HipHopDX points out, Pusha recently sat down for a Complex video interview at an Adidas event, and he said a few words about the forthcoming King Push, which at one point was going to be entirely produced by Pusha's old collaborators the Neptunes. Pusha now says that the album is mostly done, but that this time he's got a different superstar producer collaborator. Kanye West apparently produced most of the album.
When asked how far along the album is, Pusha said, “I'm going to say I'm at 85%. That's a confident 85. Great lyrics, great beats. Beats are phenomenal. It's time. It's rap time.”
And as for the production, “It's mostly Kanye West. The beats, I'm telling you, I'm giving you a sign! Good beats! Crack! I'm answering you. Bruh! Great beats! Great super-producer beats! And raps! Amazing raps! I'm telling you!”
Here's the interview; the King Push stuff starts around the 2:30 mark.
Pusha has reportedly been helping Kanye West on his own new music.

CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Phil Mickelson missed the PGA Championship cut after a 74 on Friday for an 11-over total and said he had to improve on his "atrocious" recent results to make the U.S. Presidents Cup team.
Steve Stricker concurred as he considers his captain's picks head of next month's biennial competition between the United States and an International team minus Europe.
"I'm not scoring well. I'm hitting the ball in every bad spot," Mickelson told reporters. "I mean the British (Open) and here have been atrocious."
Mickelson was 10-over and missed the cut last month at Royal Birkdale. He said he still has hopes of turning it around and competing in the Presidents Cup on Sept. 26-Oct. 1 at Liberty National in Jersey City, New Jersey, where he is a member.
"I would love to be on it but the way I'm playing, I've got to play better. I'll come out and play the first two FedExCup events," Mickelson said.
"If I can play well in those, I have a chance to get on the team on my own (through points). If I play well in them and don't make it, I have a chance to be a (captain's) pick. But I've got to play well in them."
Stricker had a better day on the Quail Hollow course, shooting 70 for three-over to clinch his leading 26th consecutive cut made in major championships.

He said the Presidents Cup, and Mickelson, weighed on his mind ahead of his Sept. 6 announcement of two captain's picks.
"We had a talk in Akron (at WGC-Bridgestone last week). He told me he wants to be on this team more than anything," Stricker told reporters.
"And I would love to see him on the team. But like anybody else, I've got to see who's playing well at the time. I know he's struggling a little bit right now. And I told him I'd like him to play well from here on out and show me something."

Stricker said he appreciated Mickelson's intangibles -- his leadership and experience.
"I know how important he is on a team. How good he is with the young guys and how good he is in the locker room," Stricker said. "But it's the same for all the guys... you want the best guys playing the best at the end of the year."
Mickelson shot the worst score of his career at the PGA Championship on Thursday, an eight-over 79.
On Friday he said he felt good physically and is swinging the club well, but needed to make a mental adjustment.
"It's not like I'm hitting the ball crooked," he said. "I'm just hitting it in the wrong spot. Not really controlling my thought process, where I want the ball to go. I'm just not real focused out there," Mickelson added.
Gas prices across B.C. vary, with lowest in Vernon and highest in – you guessed it – Metro Vancouver
Everyone is talking about the soaring price of gas lately – and not just in B.C.'s most gridlock-prone cities.
According to GasBuddy.com, gas stations in Vernon are offering the lowest prices across the province as of Tuesday afternoon, sitting steady at about 117.9 cents per litre. Prince George is next in line, with 119 cents per litre on average.
Some of the highest costs, meanwhile, are being recorded in Metro Vancouver, to the tune of 154 cents and above.
Dan McTeague, a senior petroleum analyst with Gasbuddy.com, has pointed to a months-long national trend in which Canadians are seeing an average increase of 15 cents a litre compared to last year.
Causes include increased demand, gas shortages, and refineries shutting down for spring maintenance.

(Reuters) - In its quarterly earnings report on Thursday, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) gave the first update in two years on what it calls its active installed base, the number of major products such as iPhones, iPads and Macs in use in the world. Apple said the base expanded 30 percent from two years ago to 1.3 billion.
That increase should have been seen as positive because Apple aims to become less dependent on selling iPhones and shift to selling its existing customers services like Apple Music or add-on devices like the Apple Watch or AirPods.
But analysts voiced skepticism. Apple's best-selling product, the iPhone, has seen relatively flat unit sales over the same two-year period. On Apple's earnings conference call, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said that the combination of trends implies users are hanging on to their devices longer, and he asked Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook whether investors should be worried about that.
Cook responded that it was up to investors to decide what to focus on, but said he was comfortable with customers buying used iPhones.
When customers sell their old iPhone for a new one, the old iPhone “winds up with another customer somewhere else that is perfectly fine with having a previously owned iPhone. And so I view all of that to be incredibly positive. It's more people on iPhones, the better,” Cook said.
Laura Martin of Needham & Co pressed Cook on whether the larger device base meant more devices per user, or more users - an important question, because a user with both an iPad and iPhone is likely to only purchase one Apple Music subscription, for example.
Cook said “there are many, many, many more” Apple users than two years ago but declined to give an actual figure.
The signals on how well Apple is monetizing users were mixed. Sales of its “wearable” accessories - Beats headphones, AirPods and the Apple Watch - were up 70 percent year-over-year in the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 30. But services revenue - which includes Apple Music, iCloud and the App Store - fell short of analysts' expectations for the December quarter, at $8.4 billion, and was down slightly from the previous quarter.
Apple has yet to disclose plans for how it will distribute the television shows in which it has been investing in recent months, which could become a large business.
“They've been building up the services business for several years, knowing full well that at some point the gravy train on smart phones is going to end,” said Bob O‘Donnell, head of Technalysis Research.
BEIJING, July 4 (APP):A troupe from Pakistan will perform at the sixth Lanzhou International Drum Cultural Art Week to be held in Lanzhou city, Gansu Province of China, from July 5 to 10.
Art troupes from South Korea, Zimbabwe, Nepal, Ukraine and Egypt will also present their performances during the week, according to Chinese media stated here on Wednesday.
The festival is held to promote Lanzhou tourism resources through cultural performances and propel economic and social development in the city.
TOKYO (Reuters) - The United States, Japan and South Korea will hold two days of missile tracking drills starting on Monday, Japan's Maritime Self-Defence Force said, as tensions rise in the region over North Korea's fast-developing weapons programmes.
The United States and South Korea conducted large-scale military drills last week, which the North said made the outbreak of war “an established fact”.
North Korea has fired missiles over Japan as it pursues nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in defiance of U.N. sanctions and international condemnation. On Nov. 29, it test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile which it said was its most advanced yet, capable of reaching the mainland United States.
This week's exercises will be the sixth drills sharing information in tracking ballistic missiles among the three nations, the defence force said.
It did not say whether the controversial THAAD system would be involved. The installation of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system in South Korea has angered China, which fears its powerful radar could look deep into China and threaten its own security.
North Korea's missile test last month prompted a U.S. warning that North Korea's leadership would be “utterly destroyed” if war were to break out. The Pentagon has mounted repeated shows of force after North Korean tests.
The United States has also pressured China and other nations to cut trade and diplomatic ties with North Korea, as part of international efforts to dry up Pyongyang's illegal cash flows that could fund its weapons programmes.
On Sunday, South Korea said it would impose new unilateral sanctions on 20 institutions and a dozen individuals in North Korea, barring any financial transactions between those sanctioned and any South Koreans.
“This unilateral sanction will prevent illegal funds flowing to North Korea and contribute to reinforce international communities' sanctions against North Korea,” South Korea's finance ministry said in a statement.
The move is largely symbolic as trade and financial exchanges between the two Koreas have been barred since May 2010 following the torpedoing of a South Korean warship, which the North denied.
Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera said the ministry plans to include 730 million yen ($6.4 million) to help build a new missile interceptor system, the Aegis Ashore, in its next fiscal year budget request, public broadcaster NHK reported.
North Korea regularly threatens to destroy South Korea, Japan and the United States and says its weapons programmes are necessary to counter U.S. aggression. The United States stations 28,500 troops in the South, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War.

Taylor Swift will NOT have to pay $3 million to David Mueller, the former DJ who allegedly groped her during a meet-and-greet four years ago.
He had sued her for ruining his career . . . because he was fired after her people complained to his bosses. They claimed he reached under her skirt and grabbed Taylor's naked booty, but he denies it.
The judge threw out the case against Taylor on Friday, saying she can't be held liable because Mueller wasn't able to prove that she personally attempted to have him fired.
Also, the jury will rule on Taylor's countersuit for $1. She's accusing Mueller for sexual assault and battery, and the $1 amount is just a symbolic thing to use this as an opportunity to stand up for other women.
A final verdict is expected this week.

KARACHI - Special Education Department of Karachi University Monday organised 1st international conference entitled “Empowering persons with disabilities, and developing resilience and inclusive sustainable development” at its premises.
Addressing the inaugural ceremony, Ahsan Ali Mangi Secretary, Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, Sindh Government, said that around 15 percent (1 billion people) of world population live with some disability which needs special assistance and technologies to ensure their undeterred access to all services, unbundling their potential and availing opportunities in life.
The developed world has developed special legal frameworks and access standards to ensure free and easy access of all, including PWD, in buildings, public transport, information electronic and otherwise etc. All these steps have been taken not as welfare for the PWD but as their fundamental right being equal citizens of the country.
He informed the audience that awareness about special needs for persons for disabilities was acknowledged by the government of Pakistan in early 1980s, resulting in legislation by the federal government for training, welfare and employment of persons with disabilities, a special education department was also created at the federal level with the aim to create institutions and training centres to cater to the educational and skills needs of PWD. Government of Pakistan also signed and ratified UN convention on the rights of the persons with disabilities in 2011, however general awareness of the issue in the society and positive steps to ensure rights and access to PWDs remained less than desired.
Prof Dr Nasir Salman, dean faculty of education KU said that we must realize that PWDs, in growing numbers, exists each day of the year. We also must remember that while we aim to increase awareness of disability, the larger societal need extends way beyond awareness. Our nation still lacks a strong commitment to assuring that each person living with disability is provided an opportunity to realize a quality of life so many is still denied. Today, most people living with disability are discriminated against in employment and access to a quality education.
He added that today the real question that must be asked is will we as a nation on each day of the year really commit to allow each person living with disability to advance on a successful path, free of unnecessary obstacles to maximize his or her quality of life. When that is the reality, we can then celebrate as a nation that we did something right.
Chairperson, department of special education, Dr Humera Aziz said that this conference is merely one of the many endeavors the department has taken to better understand the diversity in its entirety.
It will also promote a feeling of togetherness which will be achieved while addressing this gigantic task at hand i.e. educating children with special needs. It will serve to be an experience of morale boosting, motivational and contributive as well as a role of defining opportunity.
Prof Dr Shahida Sajjad, Aftab Abdul Khan, Prof Dr Muhammad Ilyas Khan also spoke on the occasion.

MARGAO: Raia panchayat on Sunday, in continuation of the July 30 adjourned gram sabha, resolved to form a special committee with appointment of a surveyor to help reassess the house tax and the trade tax since it has not been done for a very long time.
The proposal was moved by Peter Carvalho and supported by the former sarpanch Xavier Fernandes. Carvalho pointed out that there are instances wherein mud houses have been renovated and reconstructed as bungalows while the tax has remained the same. House tax is the main source of revenue generation for the panchayat, Carlvalho maintained. His argument gained support from other villagers before a resolution was passed to that effect.
The villagers resolved to file a complaint over an occupancy certificate issued for a project at Arlem. They asked the sarpanch to immediately withdraw the occupancy certificate given to the builder. In this regard, the sarpanch Zelia Gonsalves e Fernandes assured to file a complaint.
The gram sabha also resolved that the panchayat should conduct a post-occupancy audit to verify whether the building projects are as per the plans or not.
The issue of migrants staying in the village was also largely debated with several villagers expressing their views on it. Some suggested inspection of rented rooms while others felt that one month's rent should be collected from the owners by the panchayat.
The villagers also resolved that an inspection should be carried out on a project at Arlem to verify the complaint filed before the panchayat. “We, all the panchayat members will carry out the inspection along with the complainant and if there are any irregularities found, we will take action,” assured deputy sarpanch Mario D'Souza.
Maria Vales highlighted the need for having fire safety measures in place and it was resolved to write to the police to step up efforts to control instances of rapes in Goa. The panchayat was also asked to write to the police about alleged drug peddling and prostitution activities. Earlier, the panchayat secretary read out the administrative reports and annual reports. Various village-level committees were also formed.
Starbucks today announced that a new line of bottled teas under its Teavana brand will soon hit the market in four states. The news comes approximately eight months after Starbucks and Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI) announced a partnership in which the beer giant would manufacture and distribute the teas.
Teavana Craft Iced Teas will be distributed in select grocery and convenience retailers in New Hampshire, New York, Vermont and Missouri, according to a Starbucks news release. The line comes in four flavor varieties: Pineapple Berry Blue Herbal Tea, Peach Green Tea, Passion Tango Herbal Tea and Mango Black Tea. The drinks are brewed using premium tea leaves and botanicals and made with no artificial flavors. The teas contain 100 calories or fewer and are sweetened with 21-22 g of sugar per 14.5 oz. bottle, depending on variety. They have a suggested retail price of $2.39.
Select varieties will roll out to participating Starbucks locations nationally later this summer, and the company plans to launch the line nationally at grocery and convenience stores in 2018.
The launch comes as demand for ready-to-drink (RTD) tea continues to grow. According to IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm, multi-outlet sales of RTD tea reached nearly $3.6 billion for the 52-week period ending on November 27, up nearly 4.84 percent as compared to the same timeframe a year prior.
LONDON — A London museum has revealed that the remains of five archbishops of Canterbury were discovered inside a secret tomb beneath its building.
The Garden Museum posted a statement and video Sunday revealing the find, which was made more than a year ago.
The museum sits on a site that used to house the former St. Mary-at-Lambeth Church and is located next to Lambeth Palace, the archbishop of Canterbury's London residence.
The remains were found while builders were renovating the building. They lifted some slabs to reveal a hidden crypt.
Garden Museum director Christopher Woodward says five archbishops were buried in the tomb, including Richard Bancroft.
Bancroft became archbishop in 1604 and played a major role in production of the King James Bible.
The remains of the others have not been identified.

A study led by Tiago Simoes, a PhD student at the University of Alberta, identified a 240-mllion-year-old fossil as the ancient ancestor of modern lizards and snakes. For the past 20 years, scientists thought the fossil, which was found in the Dolomite Mountains in northern Italy, was only related to, but not actually, a lizard.
“It's almost like a Rosetta Stone in terms of trying to understand exactly what was going on between older reptiles and modern lizards,” Simoes said.
Before now, he added, scientists knew almost nothing about the earliest stages of the evolution of lizards. They used to think the earliest known lizard was 170 million years old, but Megachirella wachtleri, the species Simoes helped identify, actually came 75 million years before.
“You can say it's a link between modern lizards and primitive reptiles,” Simoes said. “That sweet spot between older groups of reptiles and modern families of lizards was pretty unknown.”
His role in the study was to compile a massive data set of more than a hundred lizard species, both living and extinct, to perform what the researchers call a phylogenetic analysis — a kind of evolutionary tree to see how different species relate to one another.
To do it, he spent four and a half years collecting data on hundreds of specimens, which involved visiting more than 50 museums and universities across 17 countries.
His research team also used CT scans to examine the fossil, sort of like the kind used in hospitals, but with a much higher resolution because the specimen is so small. Unlike dinosaur fossils, the Megachirella wachtleri that Simoes studied was only about eight centimetres long, bearing a strong resemblance to many of the lizards that walk the Earth today.
He said he was interested in the study because of how little scientists knew about the evolution of lizards. Like with birds, there are about 10,000 known species of lizards alive today, except scientists know much less about how the latter evolved over time.
“Differently from birds and mammals, we know nothing about how they came up, how they first evolved, which species were their ancestors or their closest relatives,” the researcher said.
“It's a pretty big question about one of the major components of modern biodiversity, that's why I'm interested,” Simoes said. “There's way less people studying them than other groups of reptiles, like dinosaurs. But the scientific questions about them are no less important.”
Since his release by Israel, Sinwar has built up his power in the secretive military wing and is believed to have ordered the execution of a top rival last year in a power struggle.
Show me a 30-second spot in which a burly lumberjack is devouring a quinoa salad and I will show you a vendor that is not serious about staying in business.
Right or wrong, we've been conditioned to accept binary designations for our food. John Gray should write a sequel to his 1992 bestseller called Men are From a Mars Wrapper and Women are From a Venus DeMarco Salad. Gender stereotyping in the grocery aisles is so endemic, it's practically a self-governing law.
At least, they're different to marketers. Unlike other parts of the culture, gender stereotypes are not frowned upon in food advertising. If they were, there'd be no Hungry-Man frozen dinners and no Go Girl energy drinks. Big Chocolate would never feel a need to brand along masculine-feminine lines and tell consumers Crispello is for women while Pocky is for men. There'd be no Little Black Dress vodka, Mancan white wine, Powerful Yogurt, Luna bars, Bronut and even loaves of Canadian bread that segregate men and women.
In a recent interview with Freakonomics Radio, Indra Nooyi, the chief executive at PepsiCo, nudged the battle of the sexes into the realm of snacking. Here's what she said, for example, when asked about alleged differences in chip eating:
And what you are, first and foremost, is your gender.
“When you eat out of a flex bag — one of our single-serve bags — especially as you watch a lot of the young guys eat the chips, they love their Doritos, and they lick their fingers with great glee, and when they reach the bottom of the bag they pour the little broken pieces into their mouth, because they don't want to lose that taste of the flavour, and the broken chips in the bottom.”
It sounds like she may have accidentally observed subjects who just came from an experiment down the hall called “Legal Marijuana and the Munchies.” But if she's right and chips turn men into chimps, she's also convinced powerful social factors prevent women from going all caveman on their empty calories.
“Women would love to do the same, but they don't,” says Nooyi. “They don't like to crunch too loudly in public. And they don't lick their fingers generously and they don't like to pour the little broken pieces and the flavour into their mouth.”
So her plan is to add “a bunch” of new products to the PepsiCo suite of brands, which already includes Lay's, Tostitos, Mountain Dew and Fritos. These new products will be lab-designed to achieve “low-crunch,” but with “the full taste profile.” Nooyi says these yet-unnamed snacks will not leave powdery residue on dainty lady fingers and will be scaled for convenient transport “in a purse.”
As a man, I think this is great news. Well done, PepsiCo! It's about time feminine foods ceded the moral high ground of healthy eating to spend a little time in the quicksand of masculine bad for you.
Please target my wife as soon as possible, Ms. Nooyi, with new irresistible lines of junk food so I can give her the same disapproving glance she sends my way whenever I cram an ice cream sandwich into my face while shouting at CNN. Please use your black arts of food persuasion to trick her into filling her purse with shrunken-down flex bags of salty Girlitos, which I can pilfer when she's forcing our children to eat broccoli. Please get my wife hooked on stuff we can finally enjoy together without guilt, shame or recrimination.
This weekend is a great time to remember how food marketers love to put men in the crosshairs of celebrated overeating. According to a story on Fox News, Super Bowl weekend correlates with the mass bingeing of foods few dieticians would recommend to either sex. The numbers are staggering: this weekend will translate into the consumption of 1.3 billion chicken wings, 11.2 million pounds of potato chips, 4 million pounds of pretzels, 3.8 million pounds of popcorn, 14 billion hamburgers and more than 50 million cases of beer.
And if you believe women will account for 50 per cent of this reckless ingesting, please come over and take the ghastly seaweed chips my wife stockpiles in the pantry, which is evidence the food marketers are failing me.
Just look at the way PepsiCo now groups its products into three categories — “Good For You,” “Better For You” and “Fun For You” — and it's easy to pick out the products that are targeted at males. Hint: apparently women don't like to have fun.
At least, that's how it used to be.
Thanks to PepsiCo, soon women will be encouraged to eat just as poorly as men do. Now that's equality.
Every January the Navajo Times names its “Person of the Year.” This time around, for the first time, the honoree is deceased. The Times' reporters, photographers and editorial staff have named Ashlynne Mike as their 2016 “Person of the
Year.”
11-year old Ashlynne, a Navajo, was the little girl kidnapped from a school bus stop in May and then brutally murdered. Her younger brother was also taken, but he escaped unharmed. The case caused heartbreak and sadness across the United States.
The Times decision to name Ashlynne as their “Person of the Year” was based on how, in death, she brought attention to the need for the Navajo Nation to introduce the Amber Alert system across their nation.
The young girl was taken in the late afternoon, yet an Amber Alert was not issued until many hours later; early the next morning. Her body was found near the Shiprock pinnacle. The suspect in the case was arrested and charged soon after.
ISLAMABAD - If the current dry season continues, reservoirs will reach their dead level by the end of February.
“In case the drought continues in the country (Allah forbids), the existing storage may deplete by the end of February 2017, but even then with the help of run-of-river the existing wheat crop can get matured,” says a position paper of the Indus River System Authority(IRSA) available with The Nation. The report said that the three early raiser rivers such as Kabul, Jhelum and Chenab will help fill the crop requirement for the remaining season.
The report based on the water availability situation of the past 17-18 years from 1999 to December 20, 2016, says that previously the shortages in Rabi season vary from 49 percent (maximum) to five percent (minimum) and the shortage of 17 percent unprecedented. During the years in review, the country faced the highest water shortage in 2001-02 when the shortage, during Rabi season, reached to 49 percent. Similarly, during the Rabi season of 2010-11, there was minimum water shortage which was five percent.
The Water Accord 1991 empowered the IRSA to determine water availability in the country and provincial share twice a year, once for Kharif season and the other for RABI season. Rabi season starts from October 1 while Kharif starts from April 1. The IRSA has anticipated that during current Rabi seasons the provinces will face 17 percent water shortage.
As per the anticipated water availability situation, the rivers flows were three percent less than the anticipated water situation. The IRSA has anticipated 10.06 million acre feet (Maf) flows in the Indus, Kabul, Jhelum and Chenab. In the Indus, the flows were three percent higher and it has received 5.24 Maf of water against the anticipated 5.10 Maf. However flows in Kabul were five percent less and received 1.54 Maf water against the anticipated 1.62 Maf, Jhelum flows were 13 percent less and it has received 1.36 Maf water against the anticipated 1.57 Maf water, while Chenab has received six percent less water and the flows were 1.66 Maf against the anticipated 1.77 Maf.
Presently, provinces have reduced their indents because of annual canal closure (December 26 to January 26, 2017). Punjab indent is 23,200 cusecs, Sindh 10,000 cusecs, Balochistan 2,600 cusecs, and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 3100 cusecs. The reservoirs outflows are less than its inflows, in Tarbela reservoir, the inflows are 18,200 cusecs against the outflows of 12000 cusecs and in Mangla, the inflows are 5332 cusecs against the outflows of 10,000 cusecs.
As per the report, the rivers inflows are lightly less than the anticipated flows, however, the losses anticipated at the start of the season were 1.17 Maf but the actual loss remained at 0.43 Maf. About 0.8 Maf water was saved on account of losses, the report said.
So far provinces received five percent extra water in their canals with respect to allocation and received 17.91 Maf water against the anticipated 17.04 Maf. It is hoped that all the provincial targets of wheat crop have been achieved, except for Barrani Area which is dependent on rainfall, the report added.
From October 1st to December 20th, Punjab received four percent extra water and withdrew 9.71 Maf water against the anticipated allocations of 9.31 Maf, Sindh withdrew seven percent extra water and received 7.24 Maf water against the anticipated allocation of 6.75 Maf, Balochistan withdrew three percent less water and received 0.60 Maf against the anticipated 0.62 allocations while KP received its full share of 0.36 Maf, the report said.
According to the operation statement of IRSA at the start of season – by December 20th – Tarbela and Mangla reservoirs level were anticipated at 1413 feet (dead level is 1380 feet) and 1099 feet (dead level 1040), however, they stood at 1418 and 1103 feet respectively.
Regarding the weather outlook for the current month, the report said that as per the international weather forecast rainfall is expected in the next week hopefully from Wednesday evening to Friday evening. The rain may cover Jammu in Indian Occupied Kashmir, Muzaffarabad, Abbottabad, and Islamabad up to Lahore.
SIALKOT - Iranian Ambassador in Pakistan Mehdi Honardoost has stressed a need for making an all-out effort to strengthen bilateral trade relations.
He was addressing a meeting of the Sialkot exporters held at Sialkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) after visiting several leading industrial units in Sialkot. The Iranian ambassador assured the business community that the Iranian trade markets in its border areas along Pakistan would soon be activated. He added that all the hurdles, obstacles and trade barriers would be removed from the way of the promotion of the bilateral trade ties.
Mr Mehdi also assured the easy access of the Sialkot exporters to the international trade markets of Iran and in its neighbouring countries through Iran, saying that all the borders of Iran were open for Pakistani trade.
He said that Iran was much keen to develop its bilateral trade with Pakistan besides promoting the business-to-business contacts between Pakistani and Iranian businessmen. He said that both Pakistan and Iran are all weather friends due to which Iran was also making efforts to increase the mutual trade volume with Pakistan. He said that easy access of Pakistani products would be ensured to the international trade markets of Iran. He said there was a visible day by day betterment between the trade, culture and diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Iran.
He said that there was 35 percent increase in the bilateral trade between Pakistan and Iran during the last year. He added that there was a huge potential of bilateral and mutual trade promotion.
He said that Sialkot exporters should come forward, explore and capture the international trade markets of Iran and other neighbouring countries through Iran. He said that the Sialkot exporters could explore and capture the international trade markets of Iran by exporting their world class diversified export products.
He added that Pak-Iran Gas Pipeline project was a great and key project to bring economic revolution in the region. He said that Iran would soon activate its border markets with the international border of Pakistan to encourage the bilateral trade between Pakistan and Iran. He said that the Sialkot exporters should focus their attention on the international trade markets of Iran and enjoy all the trade benefits at all the Iranian Free Trade Zones.
Mr Mehdi said that there were bright opportunities of establishing joint ventures in different trade fields. He further said that several Iranian companies were showing keen interest in establishing joint ventures with the businessmen at Sialkot.
"All the Iranian doors are open for you to promote the bilateral trade between Pakistan and Iran," he stated.
He said that the promotion of business and trade was the top priority of Iran and for the goal Iran was making efforts to promote contacts between the businessmen of Sialkot and Tehran.
He said that the banking transactions in Iran were being made much easy for Pakistani business community to encourage the maximum bilateral trade. He said direct air links would soon be restored between Pakistan and Iran as the direct passenger flights between Iran and Pakistan would be started within next couple of days.
Presenting his welcome address, SCCI President Zahid Latif Malik said that both Iran and Pakistan are brotherly Islamic countries sharing religious, cultural and socio-political heritage, as we have common views on most of the global issues.
He said that both the countries are eager to expand bilateral cooperation in diverse fields to benefit from each other's expertise to make progress. "We understand that both the countries have agreed to set up a mechanism to ensure implementation of existing agreements, aimed at substantial increase of two-way trade. So far, Pakistan and Iran have not been able to build their relationship on an economic footing as indicated by discouraging trade figures. "I may stress here for need to take immediate and drastic steps to increase bilateral trade," the SCCI President. The SCCI president suggested the regular exchange of the mutual trade delegations besides encouraging holding the single country trade exhibitions.
He said both Pakistan and Iran should facilitate and encourage frequent exchanges of trade delegations in order to create effective linkages between the business communities of both the countries.
Later, the Iranian ambassador visited several industrial units in Sialkot. He witnessed the production processes of surgical instruments and sports goods. He also witnessed the craftsmanship of Sialkot-based artisans. He highly hailed the production of Sialkot-made export products, and said that the Sialkot exporters have great potential to explore and capture the international trade markets of Iran.
The Red Wings are 1-4-0 with a minus-16 goal differential since Nov. 28, but head coach Jeff Blashill says the blame isn't solely on goalies Petr Mrazek (left) and Jimmy Howard (right). (Photo: David Guralnick / Detroit News)
Detroit — With goals going in by the bushelfuls in some recent games, the Red Wings hope some better play all around the ice, not just in goal, helps them against the Florida Panthers on Monday night at Little Caesars Arena.
“I think it's on all of us,” Jeff Blashill said, after a 1-4-0 run in which the Red Wings have a minus-16 goal differential, since Nov. 28. “Team defense, the coaches, the goaltender, we've all got to be better.
“What happens at times, you give up easy goals, breakaways, back-doors things like that and it eats away at you as a goalie, in terms of your confidence. And then you don't play as well.”
Going into play Monday, the Red Wings are tied with the Coyotes and Ducks for the most goaltending changes in games, with five. Seven other teams have four.
2017-18 DETROIT RED WINGS SCHEDULE
While Jimmy Howard faulted himself for not stopping more shots Saturday in the 6-1 loss to the Blues, defensive breakdowns and carelessness with the puck and some poor positioning of a defenseman's stick that resulted in a deflected goal were clearly significant causes of the lopsided loss.
“I think they go hand-in-hand, team defense and great goaltending and I think I'm responsible for both.”
Asked if it will affect how he uses Howard and Petr Mrazek, Blashill said, “We'll continue to make decisions as we move along, but we know we can't give up that many goals.”
Howard has played in 24 games and Mrazek in 10. Howard is 9-9-0 with a 2.95 goals against average and a .905 save percentage, two measures of performance that have suffered mightily in the recent deluge of goals against the Red Wings.
Mrazek is giving up an average of 3.73 goals per game and saving at a rate of .888.
Blashill faced the difficulty of Howard playing well for much of the first 25 games of the season while trying to find time for Mrazek to play.
Right now, neither goalie is hot. But they also lack defensive support.
The Wings continue to think they played as well against the Blues for the first two periods of the 6-1 loss, as they did against the Jets in the previous game, a 5-1 victory.
But they know it is not enough, and they know it is a 60-minute game.
“The hardest thing you have to do is stick with the great process, when the process was great,” Blashill said. “We have to make sure.”

Attorney General Patrick Morrisey warned consumers to exercise caution when looking for employment opportunities to pay off those holiday purchases.
Gifts and travel expenses are just some of the things that put a dent in credit and bank account statements.
“The post-holiday season can be a time when consumers try to recoup expenses incurred Morrisey said. “That often means looking for additional employment, but those interested must proceed with caution. Do your research, check the Internet and call our office with any questions.”
Consumers should be particularly cautious of work-at-home positions. Such opportunities may promise flexibility and extra income, but may sometimes result in nothing more than lost time and money.
Additional tips include:
Use extra caution when looking at job ads with generic titles, such as administrative assistant or customer service representative.
Check the business' website to make sure the opening is posted there. If you're still not sure, call the business to check on the position.
Use caution when ads urge you to immediately apply and use phrases such as “Teleworking OK,” “Immediate Start” and “No Experience Needed.”
Do Internet search for the position. If the same job posting appears in several cities, it may be a scam.
Be very cautious of any job that asks you to share personal information or hand over money. Scammers often use the guise of running a credit check, setting up a direct deposit or training costs to convince you to part with your cash.
Consumers who believe they may have been the victim of a fraudulent job posting or wish to report a suspicious listing can contact the Attorney General's Consumer Protection Division at 1-800-368-8808 or visit the office online at www.wvago.gov.

NEW DELHI: China's road and other military infrastructure construction in the Doklam area near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction continues to cause concern in the Indian security establishment, with People's Liberation Army now trying to circumvent Indian troop positions with an road axis in the region.Sources say PLA troops are “trying to work around or outflank” the Indian Doka La military outpost, which is located on the ridge that dominates Doklam, by constructing a new 1.3-km long road and “communication trenches” around 4-km away from the spot.This alternative axis could allow them access towards the Jampheri Ridge in south Doklam, as the PLA had earlier wanted before the 73-day troop stand-off last year.But Indian security establishment officials on being contacted on Monday, refused to say anything on the matter. India is “highly sensitive” about the Jampheri Ridge because it overlooks its militarily-vulnerable Siliguri Corridor or the so-called “Chicken's Neck” area.Officials say China remains keen to usurp Doklam or the Dolam Plateau, disputed between Beijing and Thimpu, to add strategic depth to its narrow Chumbi Valley, which juts in like a dagger between Sikkim and Bhutan.India in the past had never objected to PLA patrols in Doklam but was forced to intervene in mid-June last year when the PLA troops attempted to disrupt the status quo by constructing the road towards the Jampheri Ridge.Indian soldiers from their Doka La post had then stepped down just around 100 metres ahead to physically block PLA troops from extending the road. It had led to the 73-day face-off between the two armies before troop disengagement from the actual faceoff site on August 28 after extensive diplomatic parleys.But the PLA had constructed military infrastructure and helipads as well as deployed around 1,600 troops in north Doklam (separated from south Doklam by the Torsa Nala rivulet) throughout the winter for the first time after the disengagement, as was earlier reported by TOI.Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman herself recently admitted in Parliament that the PLA had undertaken “construction of some infrastructure, including sentry posts, trenches and helipads” near the face-off site, while her junior minister Subhash Bhamre had also said that the situation had the potential to escalate in the coming months.
FORMER Prime Minister Mian Nawaz Sharif completed his GT Road journey on Saturday peacefully and addressed a mammoth rally at Data Darbar, which sent a loud and clear message that he would remain central to Pakistani politics. It is satisfying that no untoward incident took place despite apprehensions expressed by some circles that anything could happen in the prevailing environment when terrorists still have the capacity and capability to hit targets of their choice as we have witnessed in the case of Quetta attack on Saturday.
The plan of the rally by Mian Nawaz Sharif was dubbed by some as ill conceived but instead, Nawaz Sharif was able to portray his image as crowd puller and that his support base was intact. The main point stressed by Mian Nawaz Sharif throughout his mobilisation campaign was to restore sanctity of the vote and respect for the mandate of the people. He dilated upon the theme in more details in his Lahore address when he expressed his desire to get the Constitution amended to ensure sanctity of the vote. Though he did not explain but understandably he had in his mind Articles-62 & 63, under which he was dismissed. There seems to be no logic of retaining provisions of the Constitution that remain inactive since 1973 and were activated to disqualify a prime minister. But while celebrating Independence Day today, we must confess that democracy in Pakistan remains a confusing business because the structure that supports it — the Constitution, Parliament, the Judiciary — have been systematically weakened. If the Generals are guilty of repeatedly blocking the political process, the politicians too are guilty of treating their own electorates with contempt and of flagrant abuse of office. On August 11, 1947 Father of the Nation in his speech said, “ The first duty of the government is to maintain law & order and the second thing that occurs to me is Bribery and corruption. That really is a poison”. And today, the poison Quaid referred to has spread like cancer in Pakistan. This is the greatest dis-service one can do to the Father of the Nation and we, as a Nation, do it daily. One wonders when we will decide what is in the best interest of Pakistan?

There is no one path to finding your future success. At the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, we have many open doors that lead to what you want to accomplish in life.
Just last month, more than 3,300 people received a degree from UWM and are now beginning new chapters in their lives, whether starting new jobs, doing research or continuing to graduate school. Along the way, these individuals experienced many unexpected steps and just as many successes. Here are just a few of their remarkable stories.
Sandra Plascencia faced many obstacles on her way to earning a degree in social work from UWM. She was born in a small town in Mexico as the youngest of eight children and didn't have much financial support, yet she became the first from her family to go to college. Sandra made new friends by getting involved in UWM's clubs, events and activities.
She completed an internship at the Department of Health and Human Services in Waukesha, which solidified her desire to help others through social work. Sandra told us that the path to her dream belonged to many. “When you're a first-generation student, this dream… it's not just mine,” she said.
“It's of all of the people that came before me — my parents, my siblings, even my grandparents when they were raising my parents.”
Before coming to UWM, Abbey Palmer had a successful career as a massage therapist. A car crash left her unable to continue with the physical demands of that work, and she needed to find a new path.
Abbey decided to pursue her love of languages and linguistics, which opened up possibilities that she hadn't known before.
Over the past two summers, Abbey has traveled to China and Russia, and she has taught English to refugees. The next steps on her new path lead to the University of Oxford in England to work on a master's degree. She is both proud and amazed at the direction her life has taken. “I'm going places,” she said, “and I've been places just in the past few years that I never thought about as possibilities.”
Ali Bakhshinejad ran a business with his brother in Iran, but he wanted to broaden his world even further. After earning a master's degree in Iceland, he came to UWM and immersed himself in research and entrepreneurism while earning a doctorate in engineering. He did not know anyone when he came here and wasn't sure how he would feel.
Ali told us about the incredible acceptance and encouragement he received by being involved in UWM's Student Startup Challenge and I-Corps program. The experiences helped him promote his business ideas and research, which could lead to better treatment for brain aneurysms. He is considering several job offers and has found a home in Wisconsin, where he intends to stay.
Sandra, Abbey and Ali are all examples of how life's sometimes-unexpected chapters can lead to new paths to success. These remarkable individuals are learning, exploring and thinking at greater levels than ever before – and they did it right here in Milwaukee. With their new experiences and education, all three are confidently walking through open doors to their futures. That is the power of getting a college degree.
Please visit us and learn about what your paths to success can be. From now through Sept. 14, if you take a campus tour, you will receive free tickets to Summerfest, State Fair or a Milwaukee Brewers game.

SET PORT CONDITION X-RAY
Hurricane Information: The Captain of the Port (COTP) Houma is hereby setting Pon Condition X-RAY for Port Fourchon, Louisiana OITshorc Oi l Port, Jlouma Navigation Canal, Port of Morgan City, Port of I beria, I ntracoastal City, the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, and all tenninals, faciltllcs, and waterways in the Captain of the Port (COTP) l louma area of responsibi l ity at 0800 Friday, October 6,
201 7, in preparation for what is now Tropical Stonn Nate. Based on current stonn track projections, this tropical stonn is predicted to make landfall late Saturday night or early Sunday morning. l lowever, at this time there remains a large amount of uncertainty of the track with the possibility that hurricane force winds could be experienced anywhere within the COTP Zone. A Hurricane watch has been set. The COTP will continue to closely monitor weather conditions and may modify requi rements under this condition or change the condition as predictions change. Questions can be
directed to the Houma 000 at (985) 665-2437.
Port Condition X-RAY: Gale force winds arc predicted to arrive within 48 hours. In addition to direction given by COTP Houma under Port Condition WHISKEY, the following actions must be implemented:
• Vessels not intending to remain in port shall either make preparations for getting underway immediately for storn1 evasion or ensure mooring plans previously submitted to COTP Houma have been approved.
• From MM 63 to MM 47 on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. mooring and/or movement of red nag barges is prohibited.
• Make preparations for storm arrivaL
Port Waterwav Status: All ports and waterways in the Houma COTP zone are currently open. COTP Houma will issue additional MSIB's as the stonn approaches and port conditions change, including bridge or waterway closures. Mariners throughout the Houma COTP zone are encouraged to use all means available to monitor the path of the stonn and remain prepared to take action as the system progresses.
Post Storm Considera tions: Once the stonn passes. U1e U. S. Coast Guard will be focused on search and rescue, port security. pollution response and the restoration of commercial operations. Should the port be closed, before reopening the port. COTP Houma must consider the possibility of shoal ing and other navigational hazards, the status of aids to navigation. the status of port security and the readiness of port infrastructure to receive vessels. Based on these factors, COTP Houma will work closely with entities to detennine the ability to resume operations and the priority for reopening waterways. Post-storm port and waterways status will be delivered via MSIBs, Broadcast Notice to Mariners and Homeport. Additionally, the COTP may organize if necessary a post-stonn Port Coordination Team conference call with senior representatives from other federal, state, and local government agencies and industry stakeholders to assess. outline, and prioritize the recovery cfTort for the COTP Zone:
Despite the continent's transport infrastructure lagging behind global standards for decades, Africa is bracing itself for a transport revolution as more countries embrace the onset of new technology.
Despite the continent's transport infrastructure lagging behind global standards for decades, Africa is bracing itself for a transport revolution as more countries embrace the onset of new technology.
This sets the scene for a new era of intelligent mobility in Africa, writes Kevin Pillay – Vice President for Mobility at Siemens Africa (Siemens.com).
Intelligent mobility involves the electrification, automation and digitalization of existing transport infrastructure, and gives every citizen access to safe, reliable and efficient modes of transport.
The need and demand for intelligent mobility in Africa has never been greater – World Economic Forum competitiveness data reveals that only three African countries feature in the top 50 globally for quality of roads, quality of rail and quality of ports infrastructure respectively.
World Bank data also indicates that the Sub-Saharan African railway network has declined to 59,634km today, down from 65,661km in 1980 with only about 70% of the railway network in operational state.
At face value, it seems as though the continent faces insurmountable transport challenges. But the reality is that we are already setting the wheels in motion to create interconnected, more modern and efficient African transport networks that keep economies on the move, rather than hindering them. This development will not happen overnight, and will be realised one step at a time.
Intelligent traffic systems
Many African cities have traffic infrastructure plagued by unreliable power supply. To the frustration of motorists, timing of traffic lights stays the same regardless of actual conditions, and many are faulty and take weeks to repair. This means that the road infrastructure can't handle peak traffic, not because of technology but because of the lack of proper technological investment.
The challenge is partly that these traffic systems have grown in an unco-ordinated way, with lots of different suppliers and systems cobbled together. Speeding and traffic light violations are a problem, and there is limited technology deployed to support effective traffic law enforcement.
Concern of this situation has been expressed by officials and road users alike, who say congestion and accidents have reached alarming levels. Inefficiencies in these transport systems affect a country's ability to attract and maintain investment.
So where do we begin?
The adoption of intelligent traffic systems (ITS) will keep Africa's busiest cities as fast-moving investment destinations. ITS includes deployment of smart sensor systems with intelligent algorithms to automatically adapt to improve traffic flow.
Two-way communication can be enabled by running fibre between traffic junctions and a central control centre to gather information from intelligent networked systems, sensors and cameras at every junction. This allows traffic lights to be adjusted according to demand.
Nigeria's Edo State government recently announced its intention to upgrade to a technologically-advanced ITS system that provides real-time traffic information in Benin City. As part of the integrated solution, motorists and commuters will be informed about travel times, weather conditions and traffic jams on radio or online.
With all traffic management systems automated and digitalized, technology like automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras can be utilised to efficiently enforce traffic rules.
Average speed over distance (ASOD) technology captures the time when a specific vehicle enters and exits the ASOD zone. The journey time is compared against the distance travelled and authorities are automatically notified if the prescribed speed limit was exceeded.
This improves the safety of drivers, passengers and pedestrians. It also minimises the risk of corruption, while promoting best practice among traffic enforcement officers who are exposed to a new skillset when trained in operating these new systems.
Automated rail infrastructure
Another effective means of reducing congestion on overburdened and under maintained roads in Africa is through greater investment in upgrading passenger rail networks.
Some of the world's cities with the most advanced transport networks feature fast, efficient, safe and clean rail mobility networks powered by Siemens, and African cities can benefit from expertise in centralised traffic management and automation systems, including train control systems with minimum line side equipment linked to modern control centres.
A clear case in point is the Gauteng Nerve Centre (GNC) in South Africa. The 3400 m2 state-of-the art control centre for centralised rail traffic management in South Africa's economic hub of Gauteng accommodates 35 train control operators in one place, and constantly monitors Gauteng's rail traffic where over 600 trains carry more than 500,000 commuters on a daily basis.
The GNC boasts world-class automation capabilities and can immediately respond to any operating failures, accidents and other incidents, thereby enabling greater efficiencies in rail operations and train safety, while offering a more reliable service through higher infrastructure utilisation.
Siemens' proven railway capabilities are set be bolstered further, following the mobility business' recent announcement of its intention to merge with French railway engineering specialist Alstom.
With a strong presence in, and dedicated commitment to Africa, this anticipated partnership will create an African champion in mobility.
Intelligent, integrated mobility ensures environmental sustainability
Transportation is the world's second-biggest producer of greenhouse gases. In 2015 motor vehicles, trains, ships, and planes emitted 7.5 billion tonnes of CO 2 into the atmosphere, accounting for almost a quarter of all CO 2 emissions worldwide.
Today transportation-related emissions are already about 60 percent higher than in 1990. One of the reasons for this is the dramatic increase in the number of vehicles in developing countries and emerging markets – of which Africa is home to many.
According to forecasts, transportation-related CO 2 emissions will increase by another 67 percent between now and 2050. Clearly, in view of this, the global community must take decisive action to bring about a worldwide transition to sustainable transportation systems.
A well-integrated intelligent multi-modal transport network promotes a culture of eco-friendly travel and healthier living, as it reduces traffic congestion and CO 2 emissions by transporting more people more safely and more comfortably, using newer and cleaner technology without relying on fossil fuels.
The time for intelligent mobility is now
If Africa truly wants to unleash its full potential, then sufficient funds must be responsibly invested in upgrading existing transport and logistics infrastructure like road, rail and ports, in addition to new concepts that include electric bus rapid transport and ferries, to name a few.
Intelligent and integrated traffic systems are part of the future of transport in the world's advanced cities. If Africa seizes the opportunity, many of its cities will be on that list, and the continent's citizens will reap the rewards. That is the way forward.

THIS week, the Saint Lucia men's national volleyball team takes its first step towards qualifying for the 2018 FIVB World Championships. Saint Lucia is hosting the Eastern Caribbean Volleyball Association (ECVA) Zonal Qualification Tournament, which runs until August 14 at the Beausejour Indoor Facility.
Among the sponsors for the tournament is the nation's leading telecommunications service provider, Flow. Flow is providing the Saint Lucia Volleyball Association (SLVA) with a 100MBps high-speed broadband internet service to facilitate live score updates on the North and Central America and Caribbean (NORCECA) website.
Eight teams in two groups, Pool D and Pool E, are set to compete over the course of the week. Saint Lucia, which opens its campaign today, will play French St. Maarten, Dutch St. Maarten, and Anguilla in Pool D. St. Kitts and Nevis, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Antigua and Barbuda will contest Pool E.
Shermalyn Sidonie-John, Marketing and Communications Specialist for Flow, offered words of encouragement to team Saint Lucia.
“We wish the national team the very best. We are delighted that we can play a role in helping them work towards qualification for next year's World Championships. We join the SLVA in urging Saint Lucians to come out in large numbers to cheer our boys as they seek to top their group and defend home court this weekend,” she said.
Flow has been a consistent partner to volleyball and sports in general in Saint Lucia and the wider Caribbean over the years. In recent weeks, tens of thousands of Saint Lucians delighted in watching fellow countrywoman, Julien Alfred, as she captured gold at the Commonwealth Youth Games, live on Flow Sports.
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - With its 160 rooms and rumoured ghosts hiding among the darkened corners, the mystery of Winchester House, built by Sarah Winchester, the widow of rifle company magnate William Winchester, still draws droves of people to San Jose to try and uncover the building's secrets.
In the new film “Winchester,” out in theatres on Friday, it is Oscar-winning actress Dame Helen Mirren who attempts to shed a light on the enigma of Winchester, who died in 1922 leaving her labyrinth of a home to become an attraction.
Mirren compared the widow Winchester, whom she called “fascinating,” to jilted spinster Miss Havisham from Charles Dickens' “Great Expectations,” a literary character famous for being an eccentric, distraught recluse who lives in the past.
Actress Helen Mirren poses for a portrait in promotion of her role playing the heiress to the Winchester fortune in the upcoming film "Winchester" in Los Angeles, California, U.S., January 29, 2018. REUTERS/Mike Blake
“Winchester” follows psychologist Dr Eric Price (Jason Clarke), who is hired by the Winchester rifle company to evaluate the sanity of the black-veiled Sarah, after she hired carpenters to work around the clock to build more and more rooms in her mansion.
“One of the legends that grew up around her was the legend that she bought the house to placate the ghosts who had been murdered or killed by the Winchester rifle, and the sense of guilt, the pressure and the weight of those spirits upon her,” Mirren said.
As Dr Price's investigations continue into the house, more and more spooky events happen in the house, which is known as one of the most haunted houses in America.
“Ghost stories have been told by people over fires for thousands of years so the world of the spirits is very present in the human experience. We talk about it, we think about it, it's in our art, it's in our culture. It's an authentic part of the human experience,” Mirren said.
Hundreds in NC, SC and GA face deportation after ICE operation
Nearly 200 unlawfully-present foreign nationals were arrested in the states of South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia last week after a series of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.
Department of Homeland Security's Enforcement and Removal Office says the operation was conducted to identify and capture immigration fugitives, re-entrants and at-large criminal aliens.
One-hundred and ninety unlawfully-present aliens were arrested last week. Nineteen of those came from South Carolina, 84 came from North Carolina and 87 were arrested from Georgia. The three-state operation was just part of a nationwide operation.
Rawalpindi - Scores of patients and attendants faced a lot of difficulties as medical stores remained closed in the city on Tuesday, the second consecutive day of the strike by drug manufacturers, distributors and sellers against amendment in Drug Act 1976 by Punjab government.
Similarly, the patients either in OPD or in wards were also in trouble because of non-availability of medicines.
According to details, all the medical stores situated in cantonment areas, city areas, and private housing societies such as Bharia Town and DHA remained closed causing problems for the patients in need of medicines.
Meanwhile, the protestors set up two protest camps; one outside Al-Amin Plaza on the Mall Road near Military Hospital and the second at Bohar Bazaar, main market for medicines dealers dealing in wholesale in Rawalpindi.
The medical stores situated near Holy Family Hosptial, Benazir Bhutto Hosptial, and District Headquarters Hospital also remained closed.
Talking to the media men, Malik Arshad Awan, District President of All Pakistan Chemist and Druggist Association, said that they would continue their strike and protest against the provincial government for bringing in strict laws against manufacturers and distributors of drugs.
The manufacturers and distributors are up in arms against the government for amending the drug act and introducing new laws. Under the new laws, manufactures and sellers of spurious drugs have to face jail term from three to 10 years and fine from Rs 25 million to Rs 50 million.
The representative of the chemist explaining the concerns of his community said that the government did not need to include the distributors and retailers in the law. He said that the fake, spurious, and unregistered medicines were not prepared by the sellers. He said that the manufacturers needed to be held responsible. He said that the sellers could be held responsible for selling medicines with expiry dates.
He noted that the new punishments were harsh for the crime such as selling expired or misbranded medicines.
Amina Bibi, an attendant told The Nation, that she brought her son for medical treatment in OPD of DHQ but could not get his medicine because of closure of medical stores. “He is suffering with high fever and the doctors injected him instead of giving tablets or syrups,” she said.
The medical store owners should end strike and open the stores so that patients could purchase medicines, many other patients said. Meanwhile funeral prayer in absentia was offered for the martyrs of Mall Road Lahore carnage at Bohar Bazaar.
The Druggists, Pharmaceutical and Chemists Associations organised the funeral prayer which was attended by a large number of people and representatives of religious and political parties, including Malik Arshad Awan, Basit Abbasi, Dr Muhammad Zakriya, Raja Mushtaq and Sheikh Adil, the druggists' elected representatives.
Following the prayer, the participants expressed their anger and grief over the killing of senior police officers, traffic wardens and chemists in a suicide blast on Mall Road during a protest against Punjab government for amending Drug Act 1976.
They also criticised the government for not providing proper security to the protestors in Lahore. They demanded earlier arrest of the perpetrators behind the suicide blast which claimed 13 precious human lives and caused severe injuries to 84 others.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing may be running high but Corporate America is finding China to be a reliable source of profit growth this year.
Whether they sell construction equipment, semiconductors or coffee, many major U.S. companies have reported stronger second-quarter earnings and revenue from their Chinese operations in recent weeks.
They are benefiting from a Chinese economy that is growing at almost 7 percent, several times the rate of U.S. expansion, a Chinese housing boom, and a slide in the U.S. dollar, which makes American exports more competitive and increases dollar earnings once they are translated from foreign currencies.
Chinese President Xi Jinping's ambitious plan to build a new Silk Road that will improve links between China and dozens of countries in Asia and Europe, and includes many billions of dollars of new roads, bridges, railways and power plants – is also helping American firms to sell heavy equipment and other products.
Caterpillar Inc, a bellwether for industrial demand in China and beyond, reported its sales in Asia-Pacific rose 25 percent in the second quarter - thanks to China. Shipments of large excavators to Chinese customers more than doubled in the first half of the year.
"We now expect demand in China to remain strong through the rest of the year," Brad Halverson, Caterpillar's group president and chief financial officer, told investors.
Caterpillar's Japanese rivals Komatsu and Hitachi Construction Machinery Co reported similar strength in demand for heavy machinery. Komatsu's China sales almost doubled in the firm's April-June quarter.
“China's grown pretty well relative to the U.S. over this period and the currency's relationship has changed in favor of the U.S. companies,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.
DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS
Chinese companies are also benefiting from the robust domestic economy. For example, Chinese auto manufacturer Geely Automobile Holdings announcing last week that its July sales climbed 89 percent from the year-earlier-month. Geely and many other major Chinese companies report their results in the next few weeks.
American companies in China have been collectively reporting better prospects even as they complain that the Chinese authorities are not allowing them enough access to parts of the Chinese market and discriminating against them as they seek to compete against Chinese rivals.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has been considering punitive tariffs against a range of Chinese goods but it has held off on taking action after Beijing backed tougher United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea earlier this month.
However, senior U.S. officials said over the weekend that Trump on Monday will order his top trade adviser to determine whether to investigate Chinese trade practices that force U.S. firms operating in China to turn over intellectual property. The move could eventually lead to steep tariffs on Chinese goods.
And despite some negatives in the Sino-U.S. relationship, a July report by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai showed that 82 percent of U.S. companies in China expect revenues to increase this year, up from 76 percent a year ago.
“In general China is still a growth market for lots of US goods and services... the Chinese consumer is driving more and more the growth in China itself - that's a very positive shift in compositional growth for a lot of U.S. companies that do provide goods and services for consumers, as opposed to building skyscrapers,” said Joe Quinlan, head of thematic investing at Bank of America, U.S. Trust.
In the chip industry, Skywork Solutions, which according to Goldman Sachs gets about 85 percent of its sales from China, reported its fiscal third-quarter revenue rose 20 percent, thanks in part to demand from Chinese phone maker Huawei. And Qualcomm, which gets around two thirds of its revenue from China, said last month that China remained a strong growth story for the company.
And many other foreign companies are also doing well. The European liquor industry is benefiting from a resurgence in Chinese consumer demand.
Remy Cointreau, which battled a steep slowdown in China after Xi launched an anti-corruption drive in 2012 – hitting a lot of lavish wings and dining by businesses - said it saw a "clear improvement in consumption trends" this year.
"We see the fast-growing upper middle class driving strong consumption growth for our upmarket cognac brands," the company's Chief Financial Officer Luca Marotta said last month.
Closer to home, Kweichow Moutai, the Chinese maker of the liquor baijiu and the world's largest alcohol firm by value, saw first half profits gain 27.8 percent.
Chinese stock market gains this year have in turn helped confidence among retail investors.
"I feel the wider economy is improving," said Ding Mingwei, 26, a manager at an education technology company in Shanghai. Ding, who says his own investments are up this year, now plans to spend more on hotels, dining out and funding hobbies such as playing the guitar.
For some companies, China growth helped to offset problems elsewhere. Starbucks U.S. growth cooled in the third quarter but same-store sales for the coffee chain in China surged 7 percent.
Among the Japanese companies to benefit, Sony's sales in China were up just under 50 percent in the three months to June, making it the electronic group's fastest-growing geographic segment.
COMPETITION INTENSIFIES
There are some sectors that are proving a tougher slog for foreign companies.
Major international automakers, even those reporting increased revenues, have pointed to squeezed margins in one of the world's most competitive markets. U.S. automaker General Motors, for example, saw a strong April-June quarter, but said it faced "pricing challenges".
And some economists warn that it is unclear how long the Chinese economy and the markets can keep their buzz.
"The strong rebound is largely being driven by the property market and export growth, which both seem unsustainable," said Nomura Chief China Economist Yang Zhao in Hong Kong.
He said he expects China's economic growth to cool by the fourth quarter.

Shrewsbury Town boss Paul Hurst admits that the unpredictability of Darrell Clarke has made this weekend's game at the Memorial Ground “impossible to prepare for.”
Bristol Rovers made it six-unbeaten away at Doncaster Rovers last weekend and Shrews boss Hirst is aware of the task facing them on Saturday.
“They are starting to really climb the table and are in good form” said Hurst.
“It's always difficult going there. They get well supported, a big crowd and play with lots of energy. Darryl's not frightened of changing the team around both in personnel and formation.
“I watched their game against Doncaster and he changes it round quite a lot within that game, so it's one that can be relatively difficult to prepare for.
“But, we've got to go there and be at our best, be strong, be physical, be up for the game and give everything to try and go away with a positive result.”
Like Rovers, Shrewsbury have added to their ranks on deadline day, Abo Eisa, Nathan Thomas, Sam Jones all joined the club on Wednesday.
Hurst confirmed that his three new recruits will come into contention for Saturday's game, but wouldn't say if they would start.
“I've got to make some decisions” He admitted.
“It may take a while for teams that have made signings to see how they settle down and to see what sides they go with.”
“It's a lot more difficult for me now, but I'm glad because I wanted us to be as strong as possible going into this second half of the season.”
With Rovers in fine goal-scoring form, they will have to be at their best if they're to break down a Shrewsbury side that have conceded just 20 goals all season in the league, the lowest in the whole of the EFL.
Their 1-0 win at Portsmouth last weekend saw them keep their twelfth clean sheet the league this season thanks to stand in goalkeeper; Craig MacGillivray.
MacGillivray came in due to the three-match ban for Dean Henderson and is expecting another stern test against the Gas.
He said: “Once again it will be a very tough game, as every game in this league is”.“I don't know exactly what their run is, but I know they've won their last two, so they will be in good form, good spirits and it's up to us to go there and try and get the result.
“Wherever you go it's always going to be a tough game, but once again we will do our homework, prepare right, as we did today, and give ourselves the best chance of getting three points.
“I'm sure it still stings them from when they got beaten by us at home, pretty comfortably in the end, but we know they will definitely want to come and get a bit of revenge and we need to be ready for that.”
The Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan Sapar Isakov told journalists about the blockchain, why he did not dismiss Aibek Kaliev and explained whether it is embarrassing for him to use public transport.
24.kg news agency offers the readers answers of Sapar Isakov to the most acute questions.
About the blockchain in public procurement
It's about smart contracts that are used in different parts of the world. The system of state procurement today has many errors. It raises questions from the public and deputies, there are many examples of deception, tricks. And the blockchain system excludes it.
It will be some kind of electronic currency, which is validated by real financial means — the national currency of Kyrgyzstan. It will be used only in the public procurement system.
I do not say that this will be done in the near future. There are consultations with the National Bank and the Ministry of Finance, issues are being worked out with technology companies so far.
Why video cameras within Smart City project are not installed yet?
The project dragged out due to celebration of the New Year in China. Borders are closed.
The agreement signed with Huawei and the investors is a direct investment agreement. The state does not invest money in the project. The government will start paying only when a certain number of video cameras are installed.
The cameras will be installed in two stages. The first phase will be testing mode in order Huawei and the State Registration Service to draw up design and estimate documentation. After that, we will see exactly how much money is needed for each intersection to equip it with the required equipment.
In order to make the project effective, the government will hire an international company for technological supervision. This will allow knowing exactly that the necessary equipment is installed at the best price.
Will the odd Smart City investors not bring a scandal instead of money?
In the near future, representatives of the investor will come to Kyrgyzstan and answer all questions from journalists. Co-investor of the project Beijing China Veterans Lingxin Capital Management found the company AKA Minerals and Mining. Otherwise, the government would have to invest $ 9 million.
My main goal, as prime minister, is to implement the project. We have not been able to do this for many years. I think that this time we did everything right. Direct investments come to the country, but there are no risks for the state.
Why the investment agreement on Smart City is marked «For official use only»?
The government of Kyrgyzstan is ready to publish it, but it can not do this without the consent of all the parties that signed the treaty.
The investment agreement on Smart City project comes into force after solving a number of issues and a feasibility study must be ready. While the conditions are being met, the work will begin in the testing mode.
How much money is needed to modernize Bishkek Heating and Power Plant?
Before taking the blame for the breakdown at Bishkek HPP, I thought a lot. I realized that our power system is not perfect, it needs correcting. I agree with the deputies who expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that there are people in the power industry who have no relevant education or professional skills. Now I have a great moral right to resolve all issues aggressively and promptly.
Modernization of HPP should be continued. Old equipment can fail any time.
Why Aibek Kaliev is not fired so far?
Before giving up on a person, one must understand the degree of his guilt and what Kaliev and his team have done. I gave instructions to the National Energy Holding to show these figures. I see a different meaning in demands of some politicians to fire him. I demanded to dismiss the director of the HPP, because he directly deals with the enterprise every day. And it was he who allowed what happened there. There are many companies in Energy Holding. Aibek Kaliev is responsible for everything. Let's wait, see the result of work of the commissions investigating the causes, and then we will draw up conclusions. I have never seen that Kaliev somewhere took bribes, was involved in corruption.
About increase in tariffs for heating and electricity
This is the most painful issue. But, if we hide the problem and engage in populism, then there will not be any sense.
Tariffs for heating should be increased. The HPP goes into the red, it is subsidized by the state. But there is not enough money to replace the old equipment. With the correct explanation, citizens will understand why we need to raise tariffs, but we need to take care of those who can not fully pay for heating.
About Russia's assistance in fiscalization of tax procedures
Russia agreed to provide a gratuitous system of fiscalization. It will cover all tax procedures. Russia will provide both the software itself and specialists who will help to implement it.
Are you ashamed to use public transport?
No, I am not. It is important to do your work so that when you use public transport, people greet you, hug, take pictures with you, reach out for you. I dream about this.
About the fear to lose the post of Prime Minister
It is important for me to be realistic and to show the people the real situation. I, of course, would like, like any other state official, to work as long as possible and bring as much benefit to the country as possible. We have already started many projects. But if you hide a disease, then once it will overcome you and you can finish badly. It is not in my principles to hide something. To solve the problem together, you need to show it. I'm not afraid to lose the seat of the Prime Minister.
FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WOWO): A proposal to bring nearly $62 million worth of mix-used development to Fort Wayne's downtown Riverfront project was announced Monday.
Mayor Tom Henry was joined by representatives of Continental Property Group for the announcement.
The project would be located on 3.34 acres at the northeast corner of Harrison and Superior Streets, directly east of the new Promenade Park, which is under construction and part of the Riverfront projejct. The private development would be a seven-story mixed-use development with approximately 150 apartment homes and approximately 20,000 square feet of retail space, as well as a parking garage with more than 1,000 spaces.
“This is exactly the type of private investment we have been working to attract along the riverfront. Not only will the project bring more people to the riverfront, but it will also leverage private investment to assist in the construction of a much-needed parking garage,” said Mayor Henry. “This development is another example of the positive momentum we're experiencing in Fort Wayne. This unique project further positions our community and region as a point of destination for economic development opportunities, job growth and quality of life amenities that are attractive to businesses, individuals and families.”
RELATED: What's next with Riverfront Development?
The Fort Wayne Redevelopment Commission will consider the proposal for the new riverfront development Monday at its 4 p.m. meeting. During the meeting, the development agreement will be discussed. It calls for investing property taxes paid by Continental Property Group, as well as revenue from the parking garage, in to the development.
On January 16, 2018, the Fort Wayne City Council will also consider a proposal to invest a portion of Local Income Tax and Community Economic Development Income tax over 25 years.

The City will not have to borrow or bond for any costs of the parking garage or project.

TUNIS (Reuters) - A commitment by key Libyan actors to hold elections in December faces multiple obstacles, including the lack of a legal framework for polls and escalating conflict in parts of the country.
French President Emmanuel Macron, Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, Khalifa Haftar, the military commander who dominates eastern Libya, and the participants of the International Conference on Libya listen to a verbal agreement between the various parties regarding the organization of a democratic election this year at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, May 29, 2018. Etienne Laurent/Pool via Reuters
French President Emmanuel Macron called the agreement reached in Paris on Tuesday a historic step towards reunifying and stabilising Libya, which has been in turmoil since a NATO-backed revolt toppled Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
Tripoli Prime Minister Fayez Seraj, eastern commander Khalifa Haftar and the leaders of two rival parliamentary assemblies endorsed - but did not sign - an eight-point statement that set the date for parliamentary and presidential elections on Dec. 10, with a commitment to establish the constitutional and legal basis by Sept. 16.
But the question of how such a basis will be set - whether by a referendum on a constitutional draft, a new election law, or an adaptation of Libya's post-uprising constitutional declaration - was left open.
The issue is central because opponents of Haftar, the dominant figure in eastern Libya and a possible candidate for president, want to ensure that presidential and civilian powers over the military are clearly defined before polls are held.
Members of the body that drafted the new constitution called on Wednesday for a referendum before the election, but analysts say that would be hard to achieve.
Haftar's rivals suspect that, given the chance, he would return the country to authoritarian rule. They also blame him for destroying parts of Benghazi and displacing large numbers of residents in a three-year campaign for control of Libya's second-largest city.
Haftar says he is ridding Libya of Islamist extremists and is committed to the electoral process.
As the meeting in Paris took place, Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) pressed on with a campaign against Islamists and other opponents in the eastern city of Derna, where the United Nations says fighting is having a “devastating” impact. On Wednesday, the LNA said it had taken control of sites in the Saida Khadija neighbourhood inside Derna, after advancing from the outskirts of the city.
Conflict has also flared in recent weeks in the southern city of Sabha, on the dividing line between two loose alliances that have supported rival political camps in Tripoli and the east since disputed elections in 2014.
There was no mention of the fighting in the Paris statement, though Seraj told reporters he had “appealed for an end to combat in all of Libya - enough blood has been spilt”.
Analysts say the conflict and the several hundred thousand people displaced by it could skew the outcome of an election. Some Libyans have said the country is too divided to cope with a national vote.
Security is another challenge. Suicide attackers targeted the offices of the electoral commission in Tripoli in May, killing at least 12 people.
Libya has no national security forces to oversee polls, or effective national institutions that can settle legal challenges. There is no consensus over how to unify the security forces and other divided bodies including the central bank - a further goal set out in the Paris statement.
Suspicion is visible on both sides. Some west Libyan armed groups, including from the key military power base of Misrata, see France as too close to their rival Haftar and stated their opposition to the Paris talks before they began.
A senior LNA source stressed that Haftar had not put his signature to any deal. “Sitting does not mean agreeing, and no agreement was signed at the Paris meeting,” he said.
More than 40 eastern members of parliament issued a statement supporting pledges referenced in the Paris declaration to move parliament to Benghazi and to encourage a military unification dialogue in Cairo, a process seen to favour the LNA.
“It's very easy to get Libyans to agree to something, but when it comes down to hashing out the details, that's when the squabbles tend to start,” said Tarek Megerisi, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.
Sylvania's Tree City Film Festival is a great opportunity to see local handmade films, thanks to the festivals 50-Hour Film Challenge and Shorties programs. But the festival also includes some films many people might not normally see: the short films nominated for this year's Academy Awards.
Now in its sixth year, the Tree City Film Festival will be showing both the live-action and animated Oscar-winning shorts at 7pm on Friday, April 27th and at 2:30pm on Saturday, April 28th at Olander Park's Nederhouser Community Hall. Jennifer Archer, Director of the Sylvania Community Arts Commission, which puts on the festival each year, talks about why a community-driven filmmaking festival is also showing Oscar-award winning films.
Usually unseen cinema
How many of this year's Academy Award-nominated short films have you seen? Do the names DeKalb Elementary, Dear Basketball, or Revolting Rhymes even sound familiar? Probably not, as it's hard to see these films normally.
“The closest place to see them is in Ann Arbor,” Archer explained, “where a theater runs them one day a year.” Other than a handful of nominees that the Academy releases on YouTube every year, the only way to see the shorts is theatrical events like this. Or, you could go to film festivals to see them.
Amy Buckey, an advocate and patron of the Sylvania arts community, told Archer and the SCAC about this event, and hoped to get the films shown. So, a few years back, the TCFF started showing the shorts as part of their program. “We thought it would be great if we could show these award-winning films that would be almost impossible to see otherwise,” Archer said. Plus, most people only see a handful of short film each year, like the animated shorts before big-studio animated productions, like Pixar and Disney have done for years.
Something for everyone
Archer said she hasn't seen any of them yet. “I like seeing the films for the first time with the entire audience, so we get to gain the same excitement and magic that they do.” Luckily she won't have to wait long to see some of them, as the live-action shorts are the first event at the festival, and the animated shorts open the second day of the festival.
The Tree City Film Festival is one of Archer's favorite yearly events, and the shorts are just a small part of it. “We're getting people interested in film,” she said, “and inspiring people to make something. There's something really cool about that.” And who knows, maybe someone who comes to this year's festival and sees a spectacular work like the animated short “Lou” might come back next year to try out the 50-Hour Film Challenge.

Leaders of an Iowa-based organization that sends millions of meals to poor and malnourished people around the world are hoping to find more volunteers for the effort in the New Year. Meals from the Heartland executive director Susan Bunz the meals cost roughly $1.20 to package and typically contain rice, soy protein, vitamins, minerals and dried vegetables.
“We did 15.7 million meals during the year last year and a little over a million meals stayed in the United States, with the bulk of that staying in Iowa,” Bunz says.
One of the biggest annual volunteer efforts in the country is the Meals From The Heartland “Hunger Fight.” The event this past September in Des Moines drew roughly 13,000 volunteers who packaged more than 4.2 million meals over four days. Bunz says they didn't reach a goal of 5 million meals mostly because there weren't enough volunteers. She says the event used to draw more people from all over the state, but many are organizing meal-packaging efforts in their own communities.
“A lot of communities are conducting their own hunger fights, so they may not come down here…but they're still doing their part,” Bunz says.
This was the ninth year for the Hunger Fight, but the Meals From the Heartland organization has a package center that's open year-round. Bunz says they host mobile packaging events around the state and it's easy for Iowans to sign-up online and volunteer to help.
“It's only two-hour shifts, it goes fast, and you can feed a lot of people in a short amount of time,” Bunz says.
According to the organization's website, Meals from the Heartland has packaged about 65 million meals since the organization was founded in 2008.
HYDERABAD, April 17 (APP): The Vice Chancellor Liaquat University of
Medical and Health Sciences Jamshoro Prof. Dr. Naushad A. Shaikh has informed that the university management has started monitoring the anti-state activities in order to save the campus from anti-state elements if any.
The Vice Chancellor informed this while addressing a
news conference with a selected media gathering of his own choice at
his office on Monday to brief them about the situation erupted after
the arrest of university student Noureen Leghari from Lahore on
charges of planning terrorist act on the day of Easter celebrations.
He claimed that the report of a high level committee of the university
headed by the Pro-Vice Chancellor with Deans,Director Students Affairs and Hostel provost as its members has found no clue regarding involvement of Noureen Leghari in anti-state activities.
The report revealed that student Noureen Leghari
attended her classes regularly with concentration on study and always
achieved good results in the university examinations, the Vice
Chancellor claimed that she had four close friends in the university
among them three belonged to Hindu community which indicated that she
possessed no thoughts of extremism.
There is the possibility that Noureen Leghari was in
contact with someone on social media therefore the university
management unable to determine her future thoughts and planning, the
Vice Chancellor said and added that after missing from home and
university, she had no contact with any one since last two months and
finally her location was traced in Lahore.
The Vice Chancellor maintained that university
students are studying in the campus in cordial atmosphere and no sign
of anti-state activities has so far been found by the management
except usual Islamic activities including prayers and discussion on
Hadis during prayers break at the students' common rooms.

university management has formed committees which started monitoring on the
activities of students in the campus, he added.
The Vice Chancellor said that the university
management is extending full cooperation with the parents of Noureen
Leghari and the concerned security agencies in respect of her
activities in the campus.
TORONTO (Reuters) - The driver suspected of killing 10 people and injuring 15 others when he plowed a rental van into pedestrians in Toronto made his first court appearance on Tuesday, where details of a motive for the attack were expected to emerge.
While the worst mass killing in Canada in decades has the hallmarks of other deadly vehicle assaults by Islamic State supporters in the United States and Europe, officials said it did not represent a threat to national security.
Suspect Alek Minassian, 25, entered a Toronto courtroom on Tuesday morning. His head was shaved and he was looking down as prosecutors announced they were charging him with 10 counts of first-degree murder.
The proceedings began after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addressed the attack outside of parliament in Ottawa, calling on all Canadians to stand united with Toronto.
“We cannot as Canadians choose to live in fear every single day as we go about our daily business. We need to focus on doing what we can and we must keep Canadians safe while we stay true to the freedoms and values that we all as Canadians hold dear,” Trudeau said.
The prime minister said that, while it would take time before the motives of the attacker were understood, the incident had not changed the country's threat level or security preparations for a G7 summit in Quebec in June.
People left flowers at a makeshift memorial, which grew as commuters returned to work on Tuesday morning. Blank white posters left against a stone wall were covered with messages.
The Canadian flag was lowered to half-staff at parliament and at Toronto city hall.
Minassian, who was not previously known to authorities, attended a high school program where one classmate remembered him as “absolutely harmless.”
The officer who apprehended Minassian was praised for making a peaceful arrest even as the suspect shouted “Kill me” and claimed to have a gun.

Canadians mourned as the victims began to be identified on Tuesday.
“We are a peaceful, tolerant, free society. The horrific violence on Toronto's Yonge Street will strengthen rather than undermine these truths,” columnist John Ibbitson wrote in the Globe and Mail national newspaper.
The attack shook the usually peaceful streets of Toronto, a multicultural city with a population of 2.8 million. The city recorded 61 murders last year.
Downtown Toronto's iconic CN Tower, which is normally lit up in the evening, went dark on Monday evening.
The drama started at lunchtime on a warm spring day, when the driver drove his vehicle into the crowds. The street was soon covered in blood, empty shoes and bodies.
Canada is still recovering from the shock of a highway crash in Saskatchewan earlier this month that killed 16 people on a bus carrying a junior hockey team.

The real estate sector in Pakistan is experiencing a lull. With newer tax regulations, stock market trading in real estate backed securities isn't expanding at a favorable rate according to Muhammad Ejaz, Chief Executive Officer at Arif Habib's Dolmen REIT. This highlights how so far the new regulations by the government have been ineffective in delivering favorable results.
The need for real estate taxation
In an ideal situation, within developing countries, the revenue contribution from property tax should have a share of one per cent or more in the GDP; while developed countries have a share of two per cent. Western European countries, United States, Canada and Australia on average collect property taxes close to two per cent of their GDP while various transition countries in Central and Eastern Europe and former Soviet Republics revenues from PT represents close to one per cent of their GDP.
In reality, real estate taxes in developing countries often yield under 0.1% of the GDP, and rarely more than 0.5%. But they can be more than 50% of local government revenues. While the potential of real estate taxes to strengthen national revenues is limited, the potential to finance improved local government services - local and government accountability and governance - is considerable. Many developing countries (including Egypt, Namibia, and Vietnam) have consequently embarked on real estate tax reforms. Thus, if Pakistan employs this tax revenue effectively within each respective provincial domain then there's a chance that it can expand the overall tax base in the country.
These taxes can be employed to create a benefit charge that can be used to finance services that would improve the property values and seen as a medium to pay for various services like local roads, sewerage, refuse collections etc. The efficiency of real estate taxes appeal to the location specific attributes that provide a relatively immobile tax base, less vulnerable to tax competition than others. With lower rates the inefficiencies from marginal increases are likely to be modest and their progressivity arises from the positive correlations between property ownership, income and wealth.
This is classic theory of real estate taxation and countries have successively aimed to incorporate these in their standard taxation laws. However, Pakistan's progress has been slow and inconsistent and the new reforms introduced have been largely difficult to administer. This can be attributed to the fact that as with any economic agent, property tax is costly to administer in an effective way as the cost of maintaining a full roll of liable taxpayers and an effective system of valuation and revaluation are expensive. Secondly, as with many other taxes, property tax is hugely unpopular with taxpayers and elected local politicians.
Present trends in Pakistan
Overall, there seems to be more activity in Gwadar that is seen to be shadowing Karachi's property market at the moment. The Zameen.com's Market Report for 2017's 1Q shows that the realty sector in different cities such as Lahore, Gujranwala, Karachi and Islamabad are moving close to stability but this has been at a slow pace. However, with new tax regimes in place the effects are yet to be realized throughout the economy.
Pakistan's real estate sectors are experiencing a steady growth but this isn't showing up on the country's stock exchange on the real estate backed securities. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is a security that invests in real estate through property or mortgages and trades on major exchanges like a stock. Arif Habib's Dolmen REIT is the only share in the last decade that has been listed at the PSX and since then its Chief Executive Officer Muhammad Ejaz has proposed the finance ministry to do away with additional taxes as this would help the government document construction and real estate projects. Therefore, while some would argue that the tax base under new regulations in expanding it isn't accruing a marked difference on the country's stock market.
Under the Federal Budget 2016-17 the tax regime for the real estate sector was redefined and the DC rates (Collector Rate) became the prerogative of the provincial governments. However, this caused a problem when the gap between the DC rates and market prices widened; engendering a black economy that couldn't be accounted for. Resultantly, neither the government of Pakistan nor the income tax authorities had any idea of the total income individual sellers and real estate sector was generating as a whole. To correct this Finance Act 2016 was introduced which further deteriorated the situation, causing an 85% decrease in property transactions. To contain, an amnesty scheme was passed by the National Assembly in December 2016 which became a mechanism to increase tax revenues and document the tax filers. This was seen as a rather controversial move owing to the fact that with a nominal amount a previous non-filer could become a registered tax payer. But the government is optimistic that in the near future this would bring almost Rs7 trillion.
Furthermore, under the new budget that announced on May 26, a three-tiered capital gains tax has been introduced to encourage foreign investment in the equity market for the next three fiscal years. This has been introduced as a way of undermining the negative impacts of frequent changes in capital gain tax regime on foreign institutional portfolio investment.
Overall, with the increase in tax rates and the imposition of newer taxes, the costs for the firms would go up and hence cause an overall shift in the markets. Albeit the new tax regime introduced by FBR and proposals for the local governments seems to be counter-productive as a way of essentially declining transactions, however, in the long run they should be welcomed because as prices fall, the trading activity will eventually increase.

FIFA are plotting a revamp of the Club World Cup - and turn it into a summer extravaganza involving 24 teams.
The competition would be held once every four years, just like the World Cup, and involve a group stage before a traditional knockout round.
Some of the world's best teams from all continents would be split into eight groups of three before the quarter-finals.
The finalists would play a maximum of five matches.
But the plans might not go down well with some of Europe's elite sides, who have recently called for fewer games on the calendar.

FIFA have held "promising" talks in recent weeks with confederations, associations and top clubs around the globe in a bid to give the competitions the green light.
A special meeting is expected to be held next month where the revamp could be given the go-ahead.
Another new 'Nations League' could also be ratified by FIFA - with both tournaments expected to bring in a combined revenue of around $25billion (£17.9bn).

A source told the BBC: "Not everyone will agree with this but we want to give an opportunity to discuss the offer that has been made.
"The discussions so far have been promising. This is not about selling football.
"We have serious investors and the secure finances would be shared with everyone involved in the game."
The unscheduled 'extraordinary' meeting in May might also see plans for a 48-team World Cup in 2022, rather than the initially-planned 2026, authorised.
Alabama fishing enthusiasts hoping for a longer red snapper season finally got their wish Wednesday, as Gov.Kay Ivey announced an additional 39 days to the federal season.
The new season will now include every Friday, Saturday and Sunday from June 16 to Sept. 3, as well as July 3, 4 and Labor Day. Both state and federal waters will remain closed Monday through Thursday each week.
President Donald Trump granted Ivey's petition for a longer season after she made requests via letter and in person at the White House.
"Many thanks are due to the president, Secretary (of Commerce Wilbur) Ross, Congressman Bradley Byrne, Alabama's congressional delegation and the local Gulf Coast government entities for their fight to increase the length of the red snapper season," Ivey said.
An announcement last month from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) sparked outrage, as the organization limited private, recreational red snapper fishing to just three days.
The charter industry, however, was allowed to harvest the same fish for 49 days.
Rep. Bradley Byrne from Alabama's 1st District, along with four other members of Congress, petitioned Ross on May 15 for a longer season. The letter cited faulty data from NOAA as the reason for the shortened season.
"This is a huge victory for recreational fishermen and our Gulf Coast communities," Byrne said. "As soon as the three day season was announced, my staff and I went to work with other Gulf Coast congressmen to fight for an emergency extension. Today's announcement will provide some much-needed relief to our fishermen and help benefit our economy in Coastal Alabama."
The extended season is only effective for the 2017 season, but officials say they will be working towards long-term consistency in the red snapper season.
The governor's office wants to remind fishermen that they are still required to report information regarding their harvests either online, through the Official Outdoor Alabama App or via paper forms at select coastal public boat launches.
Information reported by fishermen could be crucial to maintaining the current season length, as well as potentially adding more days in the future.
Further information on how and what to report can be found on the Outdoor Alabama website.

Hughie Fury claims his heartbreaking loss to Joseph Parker has made him hungrier to become world heavyweight champion.
Fury was gutted to lose to WBO king Parker in September and will make his comeback against Sam Sexton at the Whites Hotel in Bolton on May 12 when he fights for the British title.
The Traveller insists that setback has only made him more determined to realise his world title dream.
“That just makes you more hungry to get back there,” he said. “To me, it's just a step back, but no matter what, I still believe I will be a world champion.

“I believe I am a world-level fighter and now I just can't wait to get this fight. It's like taking two steps back to take three steps forward. I want to get the British title behind me and get back to the top.
“I feel good now, I feel great. I'm looking forward to the fight on May 12. It is what it is. What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.
“Sam Sexton is just a stepping stone. I want to get him out of the way and move forward.”

Fury has based his training camp at the Whites Hotel under the watchful eye of his dad, Peter, and says he has learnt the lessons from his defeat to Parker.
“There are a lot of things you can look back at, but if you are always looking back, you will never move forward,” he said.
“I've learned off that fight. I've looked at the video a thousand times. Yes, there's a lot I should have done more, but you can't turn back time. Now it's about moving forward and improving.”

ISLAMABAD, Dec 11 (APP):The visiting delegation of French Senate and National Assembly, Monday counting the cordial relations between Pakistan and France, highlighted the role of Friendship groups and their significant role in strengthening friendly ties.
Talking to the Foreign Secretary, Tehmina Janjua who received the delegations led by Jean-Bernard Sempastous and Pascal Allizard at the foreign office here, the Parliamentarians welcomed this opportunity to visit Pakistan which was an important country. They acknowledged Pakistan's sacrifices in the fight against terrorism. They also vowed to maintain regular contacts with their Pakistani counterparts, a foreign office statement said.
Jean-Bernard Sempastous is the President of France-Pakistan Friendship Group of the National Assembly of the French Republic. Senator Pascal Allizard is President of the France-Pakistan Friendship Group in the French Senate.
Foreign Secretary said that Pakistan considered France an important political, economic and security partner, bilaterally as well as within the context of the European Union. She briefed the parliamentarians on the improved security situation in the country and particularly conducive environment for trade and investment. She added that the Friendship Groups play a key role in bringing the two countries closer. She welcomed interest of French companies in investing in Pakistan.
Tahmina briefed the delegation on the regional security situation and Pakistan's efforts in the fight against terrorism. She also briefed the parliamentarians on relations with India and Afghanistan and the government's policy of a peaceful neighborhood. She impressed upon the parliamentarians to play an active role in the resolution of Jammu & Kashmir dispute and upholding the principle of human rights.
The simultaneous visits of the Friendship Groups of the French Parliament are testimony to the fact that Pakistan and France enjoy deep and close relations. The Friendship Groups play a key role in developing mutual understanding and creating political goodwill between the two countries.
During the visit, the French parliamentarian would interact with Pakistani parliamentarians, including Chairman Senate, Speaker National Assembly.
From cramps to mood swings, most of us have experienced some unfortunate form of PMS. So why, in 2017, is it still so taboo to talk about it?
That's a question that Natalia Vodianova is setting out to answer. In partnership with Flo, a leading women's health platform and app, the supermodel is debuting a new weekly video series, “Let's Talk About It. Period.” that features candid Q&A's with tastemakers like Emily Ratajkowski, Soo Joo Park, and InStyle Editor-In-Chief Laura Brown about that oh-so-special time of the month.
By bringing humor to the conversation, Vodianova aims to free the dialogue that surrounds female wellness and sexuality, while also inspiring women to take control of their health. "I hope that very soon we will have different attitudes towards this [topic],” said Vodianova, of the project that is also supported by the UNFPA. “[If we can all] laugh about the fact that you stained your white perfect pants, that's when something will click in everyone else's minds. And they'll say it's normal.”

The first video, which launches today on the Flo platform, features a frank sit-down with Vodianova and Victoria's Secret Angel Alexina Graham, where they discuss topics like powering through painful cramps on set and the stigma that still surrounds menstruation. “I think it's ridiculous how people don't talk about it,” said Graham. “It's still such a taboo thing, but it happens to every woman. People do get uncomfortable a lot—like too much information—but I talk about it all the time. I think it's important."
Graham also points out that being on your period isn't always so bad. When Vodianova asked her to name three reasons why she loves her monthly flow, she was quick to respond. “[It means] I'm not pregnant, I get bigger boobs, and I feel healthy, like it's cleaning out my body,” she said. “Also, I can binge on chocolate!”

As more and more TV shows from both sides of the aisle find a home in the ever-broadening definition of “dramedy,” viewers are treated to actors giving some of the most raw and emotional performances we have seen in the medium, and often in shows labelled comedies.
This Emmy season alone, we have watched stand-out performances from such past nominees as William H. Macy as the softie shyster Frank Gallagher on Showtime's “Shameless” and Anthony Anderson as Dre Johnson, a father realizing that his own marriage is fragile in ABC's “Black-ish.” There are also newcomers, including Freddie Highmore as Shaun Murphy, the titular autistic savant in ABC's “The Good Doctor” (a performance that won praise from the Autism Society in Los Angeles), and Jason Mitchell as Brandon Johnson, a promising chef from the streets of Chicago who is navigating old and new worlds in Showtime's “The Chi.”
And while all this might be entertaining to those observing from their couches or bedrooms, pulling off the performances can be both emotionally and physically exhausting for these actors.
Related Milo Ventimiglia Wants 'This Is Us' to Explore His Character's Time in Vietnam Potential Lead Actor Emmy Nominees Are Double-Dipping Roles
“I think a lot of times, what happens to me is I just allow myself to be,” says Mitchell, who is having a jam-packed year thanks to movies including awards darling “Mudbound” and this summer's remake of “SuperFly.” He points to a scene in the pilot of “The Chi” in which his character has to attend the funeral of his kid brother, a gunshot victim due to mistaken identity. “If you allow yourself to actually be there, how can you not be hurt? It's such a healing feeling to talk about.”
This is in contrast to a scene a few episodes later that involved a late-night brawl that ends with another bullet hole. “It was one of those nights where you get to work at 5 o'clock and you know you're not going to leave until like 5 o'clock,” Mitchell says. If only he could have siphoned some of the energy from one of his co-stars in that scene, teenager Alex R. Hibbert.
But Mitchell, a New Orleans native who lost his best friend to this kind of violence, says these types of stories are important to show on screen because they cut down misconceptions and stereotypes.
Similarly, “This Is Us” star Milo Ventimiglia says he's gotten much support from recovering addicts for the way his NBC family drama depicted Jack Pearson's battle with alcoholism.
Ventimiglia says he likes that the wildly popular series handled “the affliction of alcoholism, the damage it creates and the impact of one's actions” as well as “the hopeful nature of someone saying, I have a problem [and saying] I need to fix this. I need to show my family that I will remain the patriarch, the strong one, the great husband, the great father. And, hopefully, they'll be understanding to support that I have a problem.”
He continues, “I know it sounds a little general, but what I really try to do is represent Jack as a real person, knowing that I have friends and colleagues who have dealt with alcoholism or drug abuse or things like that.
“I try and live Jack's life in a way that is realistic to what friends have told me about their own existence.”
He's proud of a small scene from this season in which Jack has to tell his teenage daughter, Kate (played here by Hannah Zeile), that the man she idolizes has a drinking problem. He knew he nailed it when similarly-afflicted friends called to thank him for showing an all-too-real moment of their lives. Ventimiglia's other challenge with this scene? “I'm a much bigger softie than Jack Pearson is,” he admits.
“I would have a hard time reading that scene because I understood the weight that Jack is carrying having to admit having this problem to his child,” Ventimiglia says. “But Jack? Jack's not an emotional man and he has to keep it buttoned up. I think that might have been the biggest challenge of that scene is to hold it together; keep it on that razor's edge where tears aren't falling, but this man is crumbling.”
Luckily for him, the “This Is Us” set does not skimp on Kleenex.
HOUSTON (AP)  A federal judge has ordered a civil trial of the Texas prison system and its leadership in a civil rights lawsuit arising from the heat-related death of an inmate, saying state prison officials refused to provide air conditioning that could have also kept 21 other inmates alive.
Larry Gene McCollum, a 58-year-old Waco-area taxi driver, was among 22 inmates who have died front the heat in Texas prisons since 1998, including 10 during a 2011 heat wave alone, U.S. District Judge Keith Ellison of Houston wrote.
McCollum was serving a one-year sentence in the Hutchins State Jail near Dallas for writing a bad check when he died of a heat stroke on July 22, 2011, just seven days after he arrived at the jail.
In an 83-page opinion filed Tuesday, Ellison, who visited state prisons during the peak of the summer heat, wrote that prison logs showed that the day before McCollum's death, the outside air temperature was above 90 degrees for at least nine hours and above 100 degrees for at least six hours, peaking at 107 degrees and staying at 106 degrees at 6:30 p.m., when the last recording of the day was taken. Humidity never fell below 40 percent that day.

Although the log represents that the heat index at 3:30 p.m. was 116 degrees, a chart provided by the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston and used by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice computes the heat index was about 150 degrees.
The jail utilizes air handlers for ventilation, which circulate outside air through the facility without changing its temperature, Ellison wrote.
"Larry McCollum's tragic death was not simply bad luck, but an entirely preventable consequence of inadequate policies. These policies contributed to the deaths of 11 men before McCollum and 10 men after him," Ellison wrote.
The TDCJ will appeal the ruling to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal, said spokesman Jason Clark.
"The safety, security, health and overall well-being of offenders is of paramount importance to the TDCJ," Clark wrote in a statement.
The attorney for McCollum's family, Jeff Edwards of Austin, said he and his clients are gratified that the facts will finally be heard by a jury and receive a full hearing. Of the 109 prisons in the Texas system, 30 are fully air-conditioned.
State law required all county jails to be air conditioned. Many inmates have trouble acclimating themselves to a prison in the middle of summer where air-conditioning is unavailable, Edwards said.
"All this is going to say is 'Let's look at the facts.' We believe they will speak for themselves" when presented to a jury, he said.
The ruling was sealed Friday and unsealed Tuesday.
USA Supports Ugandan Forces in Somalia
The Government of the United States of America, through the Department of State, on December 31, 2016, handed over non-lethal equipment to support the Ugandan Military Contingent in Somalia.
The equipment support worth billions of Ugandan shillings included 02 dozers, 04 motor graders, 04 Compact rollers and 04 front-end loaders.
Others are 02 trailer tractors, 02 low bed vehicles, 04 recovery trucks, 02 tele-handlers and an assortment of spare parts.
The site coordinator at the Department of State, Mr James Watters, handed over the equipment on behalf of the Government of the USA.
He reiterated US government continued support to AMISOM in the fight against terrorism and commended the good works of the African Union peacekeepers in support of the Federal Government of Somalia.
The Uganda Contingent Commander in AMISOM, Brig Sam Okiding, received the items on behalf of the Government of Uganda at the African Union's Halane camp in Mogadishu, Somalia.
He appreciated the continued support from the US Government towards the fight against terrorism in Somalia and to the UPDF in particular.
He noted that the machinery donated is enough to establish a ‘Mission Enabling Unit' that could carry out various infrastructural projects in Somalia to enhance peace and security.
Brig Okiding further observed that:
“These machines will help in the rebuilding and maintenance of the main supply routes used by the AU forces. This will enhance free movement and safe passage, hence facilitating humanitarian activities, governance and Somalia's recovery process.”
This support comes only a few months after the USA again supported the Ugandan forces in Somalia with a donation of several Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles that have greatly enhanced AMISOM operations. Other MRAP vehicles were delivered to facilitate training in Peace Support Operation Centre in Nakaseke district.
The US Government is a key contributor to the UPDF in several fields like equipment support and training among others. This has impacted positively in the capacity building and professionalization within the UPDF and significantly contributed to the Ugandan Government's regional peace endeavors and the fight against terrorism.

Burnley opened 2017 with defeat as they suffered their first ever loss at the Etihad against the 10 men of Manchester City.
Gael Clichy and Sergio Aguero scored for the hosts in the second half for City, who had Fernandinho sent off, while Ben Mee responded for the away side.
Jeff Hendrick tries to find a way through
The returning Jeff Hendrick was the expected replacement for suspended midfielder Dean Marney while winger Johann Berg Gudmundsson stepped in for Steven Defour as Scott Arfield was shifted in to the centre of the park.
With an exceptionally well-oiled first half display from the Clarets, the home side failed to craft anything from their own design.
• Burnley fans react to Man City defeat
• Manchester City 2, Burnley 1: As it happened
Burnley were organised, working hard to protect each other as a pack, though any ground they conceded was often self-inflicted.
Mee was the culprit in an early example of that, gifting Pep Guardiola's side possession in his own third, but Tom Heaton responded superbly to save at the feet of both Kelechi Iheanacho and Raheem Sterling.
The Nigerian striker had another sight of goal moments later, collecting Yaya Toure's pass on the edge of the box, but his delicate shot, targeting the far corner, was diverted for a corner off the boot of Michael Keane.
The visitors were rarely troubled but they were the instigators of their own undoing once again when losing the ball from their own short corner and allowing City to break.
However, the hosts were wasteful and failed to make the most of their numerical advantage on the counter.
Everything else City contributed was merely speculative as they struggled to get in behind. Toure's shot from the edge of the box from Jesus Navas's pass was beaten away by Heaton while Kevin De Bruyne bent an effort around the upright.
City, though, were reduced to 10 men just after the half-hour when Fernandinho was dismissed for the third time in six games.
The City skipper lunged in two-footed on Gudmundsson after the ball broke and was deservedly shown red by referee Lee Mason.
After that the Clarets went to see the half out though Ashley Barnes went close when slicing wide of the target from the edge of the penalty area once Gudmundsson had helped on Keane's ball forward.
The home side's frustration's forced Guardiola to make changes at the interval, introducing Aguero and David Silva at the expense of Iheanacho and Navas respectively.
And it made a difference as the goals came around the hour. Neither substitute had a hand in the opener but Clichy applied a finish that both would have been proud of.
The full back picked up the ball on the angle of the area, side-stepped Arfield and tucked the ball in to the far corner.
The second came four minutes later and it was another that could so easily have been avoided.
Mee got the ball tangled beneath his feet as he attempted to cut out De Bruyne's threaded pass, Heaton raced off his line to foil Sterling but Aguero was on hand to fire the rebound in to the net off the upright.
That could've knocked the wind out of Burnley's sails but they refused to roll over against their title-chasing opposition.
They engineered a nervy finish with 20 minutes remaining when halving the deficit. Nicolas Otamendi swiped Sam Vokes's header off the line from substitute Defour's corner but Mee, against his former club, smashed the rebound in off the underside of the crossbar.
The Clarets pressed for a third draw in as many visits to the Etihad with Andre Gray slicing wide on the volley before Claudio Bravo reacted well to flick Keane's looping attempt over the bar.
It was another bright display from the Clarets but the wait for a first win on the road continues.

EAGAN, Minn. — The Minnesota Vikings made a splash on the free agent market last month, with their fully guaranteed contract for quarterback Kirk Cousins and the signing of defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson for another instant upgrade for the starting lineup.
There's another addition coming, too.
Running back Dalvin Cook, his promising rookie season cut painfully short at four games because of a torn ACL in his left knee , has passed the six-month mark in his rehabilitation and remains on track for full action when training camp begins.
He'll be a limited participant in practices this spring and minicamp, head athletic trainer Eric Sugarman said, and has impressed the team at each stage of his recovery. There's no reason why he won't be ready to play in the season opener on Sept. 9.
"Dalvin's knocked the rehab out of the park," Sugarman said. "He's done a great job. He's been here every day since the injury occurred, post-surgery."
The Vikings started their off-season workout program last week at their sparkling new training facility, with state-of-the-art equipment that certainly hasn't hurt Cook's quest to come back as the same dual-threat player who was briefly on display last season after being drafted in the second round out of Florida State .
Cook took part in strength and conditioning activities on the indoor turf with the rest of his teammates on Tuesday, when the Vikings opened a portion of the workout to reporters.
"You've got to trust yourself and know that you did everything in your power to get your knee back to where it's at," Cook said.
"I attacked this thing every day, and I did what I needed to do to get to this point, so I had no doubt when I first touched the field that it was where I wanted to be at."
Cook had reconstructive surgery on Oct. 9. The first two weeks were the toughest part, with Sugarman pushing hard on his knee in the early struggle to regain that critical range of motion in the joint.
Sri Lanka are keen to visit Pakistan in September for a T20 series to become the first high-profile team to tour the country since 2009.
Sri Lanka are keen to visit Pakistan in September and become the first high-profile team to tour the country since the deadly attack in 2009.
Gunmen attacked a bus carrying Sri Lankan players in Lahore eight years ago, wounding six players and killing six security staff and two civilians.
Pakistan have played most of their home international matches in the United Arab Emirates as a result of the attack and the unpredictable security situation that was its legacy.
The country has since been largely starved of international cricket, apart from a short visit by Zimbabwe in 2015.
A three-match T20 series against Sri Lanka may see the return of international cricket on home soil.
"I am keen to take my team to Pakistan," Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) President Thilanga Sumathipala said at the Asian Cricket Council's annual general meeting in Colombo.
"We have had our security experts visit and make an assessment, and things look positive with things improving all over the country and especially Lahore being cleared.
"We have three T20 games coming up against Pakistan in September and we would like to play at least one of those games in Lahore."
The International Cricket Council also wants to support the tour of a World XI to Pakistan next month, subject to security clearance, for a three-match T20 series to help revive international cricket in the country.
Sumathipala called for support for Pakistan from the Asian neighbours.
"I call upon each one of you as members to play your role and give Pakistan the security of your support," he added.
"There is always risk - there were two attacks in London during the Champions Trophy - but cricket continued under the security assurances of the ICC, so likewise we too must be as accommodating and understanding as possible with our members and extend our fullest support to them as the cricketing family of Asia."
DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani proposed to parliament on Sunday a conservative state budget of about $104 billion for next year, with the outlook for the economy and state revenues clouded by tensions with the United States.

Rouhani announced a draft budget for the Iranian year starting next March 21 of 3,681 trillion rials ($103.9 billion at the official exchange rate), excluding the spending of state enterprises.
That is up about 6 percent from the budget plan for the current year, but since inflation is running at nearly 10 percent, the budget extends the conservative fiscal policy which Rouhani introduced after taking office in 2013.
In a speech broadcast live by state television, Rouhani described the budget as one that would work towards full employment, eliminating poverty and creating social justice.
After struggling for years under sanctions, Iran's economy picked up in 2016 after most restrictions were removed under a deal with world powers on its nuclear programme. Gross domestic product grew 12.5 percent last year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
But that leap in growth was almost entirely due to a surge in the oil sector as Iran became able to increase its oil exports; the rest of the economy, which is more important to the welfare of most Iranians, improved much less. The IMF projects growth of just 3.5 percent this year.
Unemployment, officially put at around 12.5 percent, is a major cause of public concern and Rouhani said in his speech that 840,000 people would enter the job market next year.
Rouhani is under pressure to boost economic growth and create jobs as his hardline opponents, who were against the nuclear agreement, say he has failed to improve living standards as much as hoped after the lifting of sanctions.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has taken a hawkish approach towards Iran, has said Tehran's missile programme should be curbed and wants to punish Iran over its roles in Yemen and Syria.
Trump has also dealt a blow to the nuclear deal by disavowing Iran's compliance with its terms, and the U.S. Congress may re-impose sanctions or impose new sanctions. This threat has deterred many foreign banks and companies from doing business with Iran.
As in past years, the draft budget shows spending and revenues in balance, although the actual result will depend on fluctuations in oil prices. Next year's budget assumes oil prices of about $55 per barrel, Iranian news agencies reported, up from about $50 assumed for the current year's budget.
The total draft budget, including state enterprises, amounts to 11,949 trillion rials, according to the text of the proposed plan published by Iranian news agencies.
The draft budget has to be passed by parliament and approved by a clerical body that vets legislation before it becomes law.

Former “Sex and the City” star Cynthia Nixon has unveiled her candidacy for governor in her home state of New York.
Nixon's bid could create a significant primary challenge for the Empire State's incumbent Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo, a Democrat, is believed to have his eye on running for the White House in 2020.
Nixon has indicated that her decision to run was spurred by Donald Trump's election as president.
“This is a time to be visible,” Nixon said in the YouTube video distributed Monday that confirmed her campaign, the subject of rumors for weeks. “This is a time to fight.”
Nixon platform on her campaign website seems to focus on progressive concerns of income inequality, health care availability, concerns about mass incarceration, and in a nod to attracting downstate voters “fixing our broken subway.”
Nixon talks up her New York City bona fides, noting that she has never lived anywhere else but the city. She grew up with a single mother “in a one-bedroom fifth floor walk-up,” Nixon says in the video. She declares herself to be “a proud public school graduate and a proud public school parent.” She laments that New York has become “the most unequal state in the country with both incredible wealth and extreme poverty.”
Nixon played career-focused lawyer Miranda Hobbes on HBO's “Sex and the City” from 1998-2004. She won an Emmy for her work on the show in 2004, as well as a 2008 Emmy for her work as a guest actress on NBC's “Law & Order: SVU.” Nixon also appeared in the two “Sex and the City” films released in 2008 and 2010, respectively.
Nixon also has a long list of theater credits, including a run last year in the revival of “The Little Foxes,” for which she earned a Tony Award as featured actress in a play. She won a Tony for lead actress in a play for her work in 2006's “Rabbit Hole.”

PALM BEACH, Fla (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that a controversial memo attacking federal law enforcement written by congressional Republicans vindicates him in the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Trump's fervent embrace of the memo raised again the prospect that he may use it as justification to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is conducting the investigation, or Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller.
Tweeting from his resort in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump said the memo “totally vindicates” him but added “the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their (sic) was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction.” He called the investigation “an American disgrace.”
The White House told Reuters on Friday there would be no changes at the Justice Department as a result of the memo's conclusions.
The memo, written by Republicans on the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee chaired by Devin Nunes, argues that the federal investigation of potential collusion between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia was a product of political bias against Trump at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Justice Department.
Trump approved the release of the formerly classified memo without redactions, despite objections from the FBI in a move that deepened tension between the White House and senior law enforcement that has existed since Trump first took office.
Democrats contend the four-page memo mischaracterizes highly sensitive classified information and was intended to undermine the Mueller criminal probe that was launched in May 2017 as an outgrowth an earlier FBI investigation.
Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that Trump's decision to allow the release of the memo was “part of a coordinated propaganda effort to discredit, disable and defeat the Russia investigation.”
Some Republicans also were critical of the memo's release. John Kasich, the governor of Ohio and a former rival of Trump's for the presidential nomination, released a statement on Saturday calling it “a disservice to our country.”
Asked by reporters on Friday whether the memo made him more likely to fire Rosenstein or whether he had confidence in him, Trump replied, “You figure it out.”
Dismissing Rosenstein or Mueller would trigger a political firestorm much like the sacking of FBI Director James Comey by Trump last year.
Mueller also is examining whether Trump has obstructed of justice in trying to thwart the Russia investigation.
QUESTIONS OF AUTHORITY
The memo alleges the FBI concealed the Democratic ties of a source the agency used to justify surveillance on Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser with links to Russia. The memo revealed the names of senior FBI and Justice Department officials, including Rosenstein, who it said signed off on the surveillance.

The document was commissioned by Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House intelligence panel. He said it laid bare “serious violations of the public trust, and the American people have a right to know when officials in crucial institutions are abusing their authority for political purposes.”
On Saturday, Nadler circulated a memo to House Democrats disputing the conclusions of the Nunes memo and arguing that Page was a lawful target of surveillance, according to NBC News.
“Carter Page was, more likely than not, an agent of a foreign power. The Department of Justice thought so. A federal judge agreed,” Nadler wrote in the memo.
Mueller's investigation so far has led to guilty pleas by two of Trump's foreign policy advisers to charges of lying to the FBI, and indictments of former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates.
On Friday, the Justice Department backed Mueller by dismissing a civil suit filed by Manafort claiming Rosenstein had exceeded his legal authority in giving Mueller “carte blanche.”

The Republican memo focused on court-approved surveillance of Page and said the FBI used a source who was strongly biased against Trump, former British spy Christopher Steele, to justify the action.
It alleged that a dossier of alleged Trump-Russia contacts compiled by Steele, and funded in part by Democrats, formed an “essential part” of requests to a special court to be allowed to conduct electronic surveillance on Page that began in October 2016.
Despite the memo's charges, neither the focus on Page nor the FBI's investigation of Trump-Russia ties began with the Steele dossier.
Page came to the FBI's attention as early as 2013, when he met in New York with Russians who were officers of the Kremlin's foreign intelligence service, sources have said.
The memo acknowledges that the FBI counterintelligence investigation began in July 2016, three months before the request for electronic surveillance on Page, as a result of the activities of another Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos.
Steve Vladeck, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Texas-Austin, said it was unprecedented for the president to feud so publicly with leaders of the U.S. intelligence agencies.
“You do long-term damage to these institutions if you convince a large swath of the American public that they can't be trusted,” Vladeck said.

Jessica Chastain turned to Planned Parenthood as a young woman. “That's where I got my birth control pills,” she says. “That's where I learned about sex education. It was a very important place to me.” The Oscar-nominated actress acknowledges that such services weren't always available.

“I'm the first woman in my family not to have a child as a teenager,” Chastain says. “I'm the first one to go to college. When my grandmother was younger, she didn't have access to birth control or sex education. My mom, the same thing. It's very important in our society to protect women who financially don't have the means to pay for healthcare, and Planned Parenthood does that.”
But the nonprofit, which is 100 years old, has been under fire. The Trump administration and pro-life Republicans are threatening to cut funding for the organization that provides medical services for women, including abortions. “Politicians in D.C. are mounting the biggest attack on women's health in a generation, and blocking access to Planned Parenthood is their top priority,” says Dawn Laguens, the group's chief brand officer. “Women are resisting these attacks. They know speaking up and speaking out can change the direction of this government.”
If the Republican legislation passes, Planned Parenthood wouldn't receive federal funds for its roughly 650 health centers across the U.S., where 2.5 million patients visit annually for cancer screenings, breast exams, STD tests, birth control, and more.
“I'm absolutely worried that if we don't support Planned Parenthood and healthcare for women, we'll head backward,” says Chastain. “I guess I'm not surprised by the war on women's healthcare. I think it's something I've seen for the majority of my life.”
