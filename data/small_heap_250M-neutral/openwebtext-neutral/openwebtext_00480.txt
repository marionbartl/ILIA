But it turns out that there are some really smart and creative legal minds on the GOP side, and now that the GOP runs the Senate, the sauce for the Democrat goose also flavors the Republican gander, if that isn't too disagreeable an abuse of metaphorical license. Ted Cruz is one such legal mind; in the words of legendary Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz, “…one of the best students I ever had.”
Democrats tend to love sneaky lawyer tricks because their side is so good at them. The passage of Obamacare under the Senate rules governing “reconciliation” is the most prominent example of creatively applying the rules to get what they want.
Parker Lee reports for Independent Journal Review on how that legal mind of Senator Cruz may have come up with a game changer for Obamacare.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)...now says he's found a decades-old rule that they hope will allow Republicans to pass a more thorough, far-reaching health care reform bill. However, Cruz's strategy — which would leverage the power Vice President Mike Pence has as president of the Senate — “might blow up the Senate too,” Bloomberg Politics notes. (snip) Traditionally, it has fallen to the parliamentarian — who advises the Senate “on the interpretation of its rules and procedures” — to determine what should and should not be considered a reconciliation bill. According to Cruz, however, a provision in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 would allow Republicans to both drastically increase the scope of their new health care reform bill and still let it fall under reconciliation by essentially bypassing the parliamentarian and leaving that decision up to Vice President Pence. As Cruz put it: “Under the Budget Act of 1974, which is what governs reconciliation, it is the presiding officer, the vice president of the United States, who rules on what's permissible on reconciliation and what is not. That's a conversation I've been having with a number of my colleagues." Who exactly those colleagues are remains unclear, though it's known that the Texas senator did meet with both President Trump and Vice President Pence over the course of the last week: Welcomed @SenTedCruz to my office in the @WhiteHouse. Looking forward to working closely with the Senator on important legislation ahead. pic.twitter.com/F8stH4k1iR — Vice President Pence (@VP) March 8, 2017 Cruz said this process would allow Republicans to include a number of provisions that would make the health care reform bill much more attractive to conservatives. For example, Cruz notes that Republicans could “repeal all of the insurance regulations in Obamacare that have increased premiums,” in particular one that decreased competition by preventing insurers from selling across state lines. Still, it remains to be seen whether or not Cruz's colleagues will be eager to employ the senator's “radical” interpretation of the rule. Being similar to 2013's filibuster reform, it runs the risk of “fundamentally altering the way Congress works.” In terms of fellow Republicans eager to see a more thorough replacement of Obamacare, however, Cruz certainly has plenty of allies.
Sure there would a storm of outrage and claims that the Cruz interpretation, as voiced by VP Pence as presiding officer of the Senate, was illegitimate. Yet, the passage of Obamacare by reconciliation stands as an example of how the rules can be flexible. The arcana of Senate rules and precedents are not the sort of thing to stir up a mob. Try getting activists to turn out for a cause whose justification that puts them to sleep with a boring law school lecture.
As for the notion of changing the way the Senate works, that is inevitable. The Democrats have not demonstrated any fealty toward the filibuster, having junked it for judicial appointments to the federal bench below the SCOTUS. As Karin McQuillan noted here two days ago,
The sixty vote requirement is not in the Constitution. It's just a Senate rule. A rule that McConnell refuses to question. A rule that will destroy the Trump Presidency more thoroughly than Obama and the Deep State.
Trump is a reform president, and Reform Number One is fully replacing Obamacare, not "Obamacare Lite" to be followed (maybe, maybe not) by phases two and three, where the good stuff supposedly will happen. The GOP base is sick and tired of reforms scheduled for a "later" time that never comes.
Cruz's approach would still keep the filibuster intact, but would strengthen the hand of the party holding the presidency, since the veep would in essence replace the parliamentarian – a nonpolitical office that really shouldn't have such a crucial political function. The prospect of empowering the presidency over a Senate minority is a mixed bag for Republicans that might face a Democrat president pushing a policy that the GOP might want to stop with a filibuster.
But does anyone really believe the Democrats would not once again limit filibusters if it suited their goals? Why be suckers, allowing the Dems to block total re-doing of their flawed and harmful legislation?
YouTube personality Josh Paler Lin gave a homeless man named Thomas $100, then followed them with a hidden camera to see how they would spend it.
When they followed Thomas straight to the liquor store, they had their doubts.
But when they emerged, it was obvious that everything wasn't quite as it seemed…
When Thomas emerged from the liquor store, they headed straight to the local park… where they proceeded to hand out food to other homeless people.
Stunned by what they were seeing, Josh ran over to talk to the man. What they heard next broke theirs heart.
After giving up their job to care for their sick parents, Thomas suffered a string of tragedies that left them helpless. First, their father died of cancer, and just two weeks later their mother passed away from kidney failure. With no one to pay the rent, their apartment was taken away from him, and they were left on the streets, where he's been for 4 months.
Josh was so moved by the story that they handed the man another $100 on the spot. But they wanted to do more. So they created an Indiegogo campaign.
Thousands of people have already backed the campaign to support him. It has already quadrupled the $10,000 goal, totaling over $43,000 at the time of writing, and counting. (It's gone up over $2000 just since we started writing this article!)

The Chittenden County prosecutor on Thursday brought disorderly conduct charges against a Burlington man police say targeted two women of color with Ku Klux Klan recruitment fliers.
"He clearly knew this was an act of hate," State's Attorney T.J. Donovan said at a news conference, where they were flanked by police and city leaders.
A judge Thursday found probable cause to charge William D. Schenk, 21, with two counts of disorderly conduct, enhanced by a hate crime penalty based on prosecutors' belief that Schenk was motivated by the victims' race. If convicted, Schenk faces more than four years in prison.
Donovan said police arrested Schenk in Morrisville. Schenk is due Friday morning in Vermont Superior Court in Burlington to answer the charges.
On Oct. 29 and 30, two Burlington women reported receiving KKK recruiting posters at their homes. Police earlier this week identified a person of interest in the incident and referred the case to the state's attorney.

Donovan said Vermont has long protected the First Amendment rights of citizens, no matter how unpopular. But they noted the U.S. Supreme Court does not recognize hate speech as protected speech.
"The threat was implicit in the content of the message," Donovan said. "It does not pass the test for freedom of speech when it is a threat."
The three-term prosecutor said the long, violent history of the KKK would lead a reasonable person to conclude the fliers constituted a threat.
The Southern Poverty Law Center describes the KKK, first formed in the wake of the Civil War, as the most infamous hate group in U.S. history.
Jocelynn Harvey, one of the women who received a flier, said they were relieved police arrested the man they believe targeted them
"It sends a message to areas outside of Burlington that it won't be tolerated," Harvey said of racist acts.
Police chief Brandon del Pozo thanked the public and federal law enforcement agents for help investigating the case.
"Insofar that a police department reflects its community's values and responds to them, in this case it worked out just right," del Pozo said. "Our officers ... are very proud to be part of an investigation that made it clear racism and hatred and intimidation are things that will not be tolerated."

Mayor Miro Weinberger said the charges would send a clear message to those who promote racism in Burlington.
"You don't get to threaten people of color in this community," Weinberger said. "If you do, you should expect a robust marshaling of resources and effort in response."
City Councilor Selene Colburn, P-East District, was at first critical of how police responded to the flier incident. Del Pozo later apologized for a dispatcher who failed initially to take the report of the fliers seriously. Colburn on Thursday thanked police for acknowledging the mistake and "acting immediately to ensure a thorough investigation."

Mary Brown-Guillory, head of the newly formed Champlain Area NAACP, thanked Burlington police for their support and encouraged city residents concerned about racism to join the organization.
Allen Gilbert, executive director of the Vermont ACLU, said their office vigorously defends the right of unpopular groups to practice free speech. But they declined to defend Schenk's actions, as described by police.
"When a person is singling out specific people with a specific message and delivers that message personally to their place of residence, that is seen by a reasonable person as a threat or intimidation," Gilbert said.
The investigation
The authorities said tips from a former girlfriend of Schenk and a copy center employee led police to their suspect.
Del Pozo said FBI agents also were instrumental in finding Schenk.
"They called us up and said, 'There's a person who is a kind of fits that description who is in our files as a white supremacist,'" Del Pozo said of their discussions with federal agents.

Donovan said in interviews with police, Schenk said they were a recruiter for the KKK. Donovan said police were unable to find evidence of that claim.
Del Pozo said police also are investigating the distribution of KKK business cards on Quarry Hill Road in South Burlington and attempting to tie that incident to Schenk.
Donovan said Schenk admitted their actions were intended to intimidate the women.
Donovan said Schenk has ties to Plattsburgh, N.Y., and formerly lived in Wilmington, N.C. Police said they have yet to determine how Schenk found the addresses of the woman they say they targeted.
Schenk was in custody Thursday and it was not immediately clear whether they had an attorney. The Chittenden County Public Defender's Office had no comment on the case.

A behind-the-scenes fight between agribusiness tycoons and members of Donald Trump's camp who want more diversity in the Cabinet has turned the selection process for Agriculture secretary into a months-long battle.
The usually low-profile post remains the only Cabinet-level job without a nominee in the final days before Trump is inaugurated. Word leaked out two weeks ago that Trump was poised to pick former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue, but the announcement never came.
Story Continued Below
Now, sources say Perdue's status as the favorite may be in doubt amid a last-minute push for former California Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado, who offers Trump one last chance to put a Hispanic in the Cabinet.
As the various sides have battled for weeks, Trump's farm policy advisers and the rural voters who helped propel them to victory have been left almost entirely in the dark.
“It's very risky to think you know anything, because you don't,” said John Block, a member of Trump's agriculture advisory council who served as Agriculture secretary under Ronald Reagan. “We don't know anything.”
The parade of candidates to Mar-a-Lago and Trump Tower range from Texas agriculture commissioner Sid Miller — who's also a rodeo cowboy — to Susan Combs, a former Texas agriculture commissioner who penned a steamy romance novel and supported abortion rights. Most recently, Indiana Agriculture Director Ted McKinney and Kip Tom, an Indiana farmer who ran for Congress last year, have also visited Trump Tower.
Trump appeared ready to use the post to pick a Hispanic for their Cabinet in late December, but members of their agricultural advisory committee — a group of about 70 farm-industry leaders who supported the president-elect during the campaign — caught wind of the plan and publicly complained. Leading the opposition was a handful of agribusiness moguls and politicians from Indiana with close ties to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, including Tom and Forrest Lucas, the founder and CEO of Lucas Oil.
Lucas was “apoplectic,” after hearing this month that former Texas Rep. Henry Bonilla, a one-time television executive and former chair of the House Appropriations Committee's agriculture panel, was in the running, one source said, and called Pence to air their grievances. Others have also called Pence multiple times to shoot down various candidates who don't come from a traditional Midwestern farming background, according to a source with direct knowledge of the conversations.
After that, Perdue, a two-term governor of Georgia who has the support of farm groups, re-surfaced as a top contender.
Even so, a late-game push by major agricultural leaders from the Midwest for Maldonado last weekend appears to be gaining some traction, a source familiar with the discussions said, though it's unclear whether the moderate West Coast Republican will be able to muster enough support to overtake Perdue.
Maldonado's support “has grown from just agriculture folks in California and the communities of color space into a broader ag space," said a source familiar with the Trump transition.
Hanging in the balance: The Department of Agriculture, one of the largest federal agencies with a $150 billion budget. It oversees America's food system, hands out food stamps to more than 40 million people and spearheads development projects in rural areas that helped Trump win the election.
“It defies logic to figure out why it's taken so long,” said Dan Glickman, who served as Agriculture secretary under President Bill Clinton. “It befuddles me.”
Trump has reportedly taken longer than any president-elect since Franklin Delano Roosevelt in February 1933 in announcing their Agriculture secretary. Barack Obama chose Tom Vilsack, the Agriculture secretary who left last Friday, on Dec. 17, 2008, while George W. Bush picked Ann Veneman for the job on Dec. 20, 2000.
Part of the problem, agriculture sources say, is there's no point person for the search in the transition; instead, warring factions within Trump's orbit are constantly communicating via the media and unofficial backchannels.
At the same time that agribusiness leaders are pushing one of their own for the job, some in Trump's inner circle have been aggressively pushing to add diversity to the Cabinet. It would be the first time since before 1988 that a president didn't name a Hispanic to the Cabinet.
“It would be shameful to not have a Latino in their Cabinet,” said Eric Kessler, founder of Arabella Advisors, who played a crucial role in selecting Vilsack. “And given the disproportionate role of Latinos in our food chain, from growing, to producing to serving, USDA seems like a terrific place for a Latino voice.”
But even those asking for a Latino acknowledge that the pool is especially small for agriculture — a field that's dominated by old white men.
“There's a relatively short list of Latinos and Latinas who are available for a Cabinet position,” said Arturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. “They have to be a Republican, and they have to be someone who didn't endorse their opponent.”
Elsa Murano, a Cuban-born professor at Texas A&M University who once served as the food safety undersecretary at USDA also made visits but it's unclear whether they remain in contention.
Murano told POLITICO on Tuesday that they haven't received word about the position and declined to discuss the process.
Javier Palomarez, chair of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said their organization repeatedly lobbied Trump's team to pick Maldonado.
"He grew up as a migrant farmworker; he's picked the crops; they ran a family operation that depended on agriculture," they said. "No one has come close to that kind of experience."
But Maldonado, while well-liked by Republicans in California, had some of their own liabilities, including a vote to raise taxes in the legislature and a reality TV audition tape laced with sexual humor.
After serving all eight years of the Obama administration, Vilsack stepped down from their post last Friday.
Vilsack, who has repeatedly expressed frustration about the lack of nominee, told POLITICO he's leaving a copy of their recent exit memo on the USDA's work and a unaddressed note on their desk for their successor.
“Hopefully it will be helpful to them or her," they said.

For everyone familiar with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's brand of smashmouth politics, it seemed like the case of the quarantined nurse was tailor made for him. There they are, up against the White House, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Kaci Hickox, who had spent a month in Sierra Leone treating Ebola patients and was the first person in New Jersey to be subject to a mandatory 21-day quarantine. (He said they were ill. They said they aren't.)
But Christie, used to having the stage and the microphone, hadn't dealt with the likes of Hickox before. They went on the airwaves to blast the policy, taking on Christie in a series of interviews conducted from a tent where they were kept in isolation. "It is not a sound public health decision and well thought out," Hickox said during an interview with CNN. "Many of the experts in the field have come out to agree with me. So I think that we need to stress the fact that we don't need politicians to make these kinds of decisions. We need public health experts to make these decisions."
We've seen this movie before, where Christie seemed only to be emboldened by such a fight, challenging teachers and reporters and any manner of person who went up against him. And yes, often this approach had been directed at women. At a rally for Mitt Romney, a woman heckled Christie, shouting something about job numbers going down. Not skipping a beat, they shouted right back in their New Jersey way: "You know, something may be going down tonight but it ain't gonna be jobs, sweetheart."
The theater of it all had become their biggest asset and biggest liability.
And the rally ends, inevitably, with Christie arguing with a teacher pic.twitter.com/YyLsoJVTWQ — daveweigel (@daveweigel) November 2, 2013
And at first, it seemed like Christie was on pace to win this round as well. It allowed them a kind of reverse Hurricane Sandy -- they had embraced President Obama in the run-up to the 2012 election after the storm did extensive damage to the Garden State, and had come under heavy criticism from Republicans for doing so. This time Christie was very publicly breaking with Obama.
"I don't believe when you're dealing with something as serious as this that we can count on a voluntary system," they said Sunday on Fox News. "The government's job is to protect [the] safety and health of our citizens. And so we've taken this action, and I absolutely have no second thoughts about it."
Except now they are having second thoughts, and Hickox has been released. (Christie still took a shot at her, however. “I'm hopeful that this morning if all goes well we'll be able to release them and send them back to Maine,” they told the New York Times.)

Aerial view of porphyry copper deposit at Butte, Montana. Image credit: Stephen KeslerANN ARBOR—Climate helps drive the erosion process that exposes economically valuable copper deposits and shapes the pattern of their global distribution, according to a new study from researchers at the University of Idaho and the University of Michigan.
Nearly three-quarters of the world's copper production comes from large deposits that form about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) beneath the Earth's surface, known as porphyry copper deposits. Over the course of millions to tens of millions of years, they are exposed by erosion and can then be mined.
Brian Yanites of the University of Idaho and Stephen Kesler of the University of Michigan examined data on the age and number of exposed porphyry copper deposits worldwide. When they compared those data to the climate in each region, they noticed a pattern: The youngest deposits are in areas of high rainfall, such as the tropics, where erosion was rapid. Deposits are older in dry areas that have low rates of erosion.
Then they counted the number of deposits in the different regions and found something striking. Where erosion is rapid, there were relatively few deposits, but locations with low erosion rates contain lots of deposits. Such regions include the Atacama Desert in the Andes Mountains and the American Southwest—both places where porphyry copper mining is important to the economy.
By using porphyry copper deposits as a marker of a specific depth (2 kilometers) beneath the Earth's surface, Yanites and Kesler were able to determine how rapidly the overlying crust had been eroded. The results showed that climate-driven erosion influenced the age and abundance of exposed copper porphyry deposits around the world.
Their findings are scheduled for online publication May 11 in Nature Geoscience.
“An important conclusion of this paper is that climate has a strong impact on the rate at which mountains are eroded and on the distribution of global copper resources. This effect persists over very long periods of Earth's history,” said Kesler, an emeritus professor in the U-M Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences.
“The length of time is surprising. Most people would say that rainfall and climate are important to erosion, but usually only over short periods—perhaps up to a million years. This study shows that the effects have extended for tens of millions of years.”
Yanites is an assistant professor in UI's Department of Geological Sciences and a former postdoctoral researcher at U-M.  They are a geomorphologist, studying Earth's topography. Kesler is an economic geologist, studying the formation of deposits that can be mined for raw materials.
“This is the first time that we've found a connection between geomorphology and economic geology,” Yanites said. “It's exciting to think that erosion and the building of our mountain landscapes influences where society gets its resources from, and it's another line of evidence showing the importance of climate in shaping the landscape.”
Copper mine at Copper Mountain, British Columbia. Image credit: Stephen KeslerThe study shows that the number of porphyry copper deposits in a region reflects the cumulative history of erosion experienced by the rocks there. As erosion removes overlying material, underlying rock rises toward the surface. So the amount of time a rock unit spends at a specific crustal depth depends on the history of erosion above that zone.
Rocks that are rapidly exhumed spend less time at depths of around 2 kilometers that are most favorable for the processes that form porphyry copper deposits. Therefore, fewer deposits will be observed when this level is exposed at the surface.
Yanites compared the relationship between erosion rate and the number of copper deposits in a region to a game on the TV show “American Gladiators,” where competitors had to run past tennis-ball-launching cannons to reach their goal.
“The faster the competitors run, the lower the chance that they will get hit because they spend less time in the ‘danger zone,'” Yanites said. “Similarly, rock layers that spend less time in the porphyry production zone—due to rapidly eroding landscapes above—have less of a chance of getting injected with one of these valuable deposits.”
Kesler said the new paper is the result of a fortuitous collaboration that developed several years ago after Yanites attended a talk by Kesler about a mathematical model describing how copper deposits move through the Earth's crust after forming at a depth of 2 kilometers. Yanites was a U-M postdoc at the time.
“Because we know how many deposits are at the surface, and we know the ages of those deposits, the model calculation told us how many deposits were in the subsurface,” Kesler said. “And because we know the rate at which we mine copper, we could show that there are enough deposits to supply the mining industry for only a few thousand years. This puts a limit on what you might essentially call the sustainability of our lifestyle on the planet, even with good recycling.”
Yanites borrowed data from the study by Kesler and retired U-M professor Bruce Wilkinson and used it to reach novel conclusions about the climate signal in exhumation patterns revealed by porphyry copper deposits. The work by Yanites and Kesler was supported in part by the National Science Foundation.

I've asked Amy Young to share their “Open Letter to Pastors,” with us. I came across this article a few years ago and it really spoke to my heart. I hope it serves to encourage you as it does me. Link to original here.
Dear Pastor,
Tone can be tricky in writing. Picture me popping my head in your office door, smiling and asking if we could talk for five minutes. I'm sipping on my diet coke as I sit down.
You know that I'm not one to shy away from speaking my mind, part of the reason you love me (mostly!), so I'm guessing that internally you brace yourself wondering what might be next.
I set my can down and this is what I'd say.
A few years ago I sat across from a woman who told me they don't go to church on Mother's Day because it is too hurtful. I'm not a mother, but I had never seen the day as hurtful. They had been married, had numerous miscarriages, divorced and was beyond child bearing years. It was like salt in mostly healed wounds to go to church on that day. This made me sad, but I understood.
Fast forward several years to Mother's Day. A pastor asked all mothers to stand. On my immediate right, my mother stood and on my immediate left, a dear friend stood. I, a woman in their late 30s, sat. I don't know how others saw me, but I felt dehumanized, gutted as a woman. Real women stood, empty shells sat. I do not normally feel this way. I do not like feeling this way. I want no woman to ever feel this way in church again.
Last year a friend from the States happened to visit on Mother's Day and again the pastor (a different one) asked all mothers to stand. As a mother, they stood and I whispered to her, “I can't take it, I'm standing.” They know I'm not a mother yet they understood my standing / lie.
Here's the thing, I believe we can honor mothers without alienating others. I want women to feel welcome, appreciated, seen, and needed here in our little neck of the body of Christ.
Do away with the standing. You mean well, but it's just awkward. Does the woman who had a miscarriage stand? Does the mom whose children ran away stand? Does the single woman who is pregnant stand? A.w.k.w.a.r.d.
2. Acknowledge the wide continuum of mothering.
To those who gave birth this year to their first child—we celebrate with you To those who lost a child this year – we mourn with you To those who are in the trenches with little ones every day and wear the badge of food stains – we appreciate you To those who experienced loss through miscarriage, failed adoptions, or running away—we mourn with you To those who walk the hard path of infertility, fraught with pokes, prods, tears, and disappointment – we walk with you. Forgive us when we say foolish things. We don't mean to make this harder than it is. To those who are foster moms, mentor moms, and spiritual moms – we need you To those who have warm and close relationships with your children – we celebrate with you To those who have disappointment, heartache, and distance with your children – we sit with you To those who lost their mothers this year – we grieve with you To those who experienced abuse at the hands of your own mother – we acknowledge your experience To those who lived through driving tests, medical tests, and the overall testing of motherhood – we are better for having you in our midst To those who are single and long to be married and mothering your own children – we mourn that life has not turned out the way you longed for it to be To those who step-parent – we walk with you on these complex paths To those who envisioned lavishing love on grandchildren -yet that dream is not to be, we grieve with you To those who will have emptier nests in the upcoming year – we grieve and rejoice with you To those who placed children up for adoption — we commend you for your selflessness and remember how you hold that child in your heart And to those who are pregnant with new life, both expected and surprising –we anticipate with you This Mother's Day, we walk with you. Mothering is not for the faint of heart and we have real warriors in our midst. We remember you.
3. Commend mothering for the ways it reflects the Imago Dei (Image of God) by bringing forth new life, nurturing those on their path, and living with the tension of providing both freedom and a safety net.
I know I might be an unusual one to be speaking about Mother's Day; but maybe that's why so many talk to me about mothering, I've got the parts, just not the goods. Thanks for listening and for continuing to mother us in a shepherding way. Even though I'm a bit nervous to come on Sunday, I will be here. But if you make us stand, I might just walk out =).
Warmly and in your corner,
Amy

Dave Humphries
My interest in shortwave radio started in the early 1960s, I bought a National Transistor Radio that had the shortwave radio bands on it, I got the radio so I could listen to the local AM stations Top 40 Hits but that changed when I switched to shortwave.
I could not believe what I was hearing, stations from all over the world in dozens of different languages, I was totally amazed as to how I could hear all these stations in my flat situated in Melbourne Australia.
I used to look forward to the evenings so I could sit in my chair with a set of headphones and listen to the world, I had no idea what DXing was I simply enjoyed listening to music and news from the world over.
In the mid 1970s I did what many others did and got into CB Radio, I was just as amazed to find I could talk to fellow CBers in the USA, Japan and many other countries, it was then that I found out what a QSL Card was, I also learned about sunspots, the 11 year cycle, ionosphere and skip.
About the same time I rekindled my interest in Shortwave Radio, I got a circuit diagram for a Receiver and went off the electronics shop and bought the components, building the radio took me about three months of spare time but I got it finished, with great expectation I connected a length of wire to the antenna terminal, by this time I had the wife and four kids standing around waiting to see what would happen, all of a sudden the radio sprung into life and the kids were dancing around the kitchen to fantastic music from the UAR Radio Dubai.
I Like so many other shortwave listeners I used a Realistic DX160 for quite a few years, my circumstances changed and I went for years without shortwave, I got hooked on HiFi equipment and worked as Manager of a large Melbourne HiFi Shop, as time went on my hearing started to deteriorate and I got Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) so music did not sound the same anymore.
Fifteen years ago I got back into shortwave, bought several desktop radios the Lowe HF-150 being my favourite, for the first time I started chasing QSL cards and finished up with a reasonable collection, once again my circumstances changed and I started playing guitar in a Counrty Band, this went on until six months ago.
Now in retirement I decided it was time to get back into shortwave, not knowing what to expect when I found out that so many of the major broadcasters were shutting down I bought a couple of Portable Radios put up a couple of random wires plugged the headphones in and now enjoy the hobby again.
I do not go along with the rumours that shortwave radio is finished, I believe shortwave has never been better, with some of the major broadcasters leaving the airwaves it has made it so much easier to hear those lower powered stations that were so hard to hear because of splatter caused by the big guys, there seems to be plenty of smaller broadcasters that have filled the void left by major broadcasters which to me has made the hobby of SWLing so much more interesting.
I couldn't agree more! Many thanks, Dave, for sharing your story!

What does it take to build a cloud-first headless CMS? Let's have a look at the journey that Kentico set out on a couple of years ago, to build Kentico Cloud—the headless CMS of the future, and the technologies we used.
Building a cloud-first headless CMS, which is a multitenant SaaS platform based on a microservices architecture that can scale as needed, is not a trivial task. A lot of planning and strategizing goes into the process of architecting, designing, and implementing the service to make sure it works for all the users, no matter where they are coming from and where they are heading. In this blog post, we are going to have a look at different parts of the Kentico Cloud architecture to show you what is under the hood of Kentico Cloud.
Building Something New
I had the privilege and luxury of being part of the original Kentico Cloud team. For me, as a Software Architect and Developer, it was always a dream to build an interesting project from scratch. The excitement of the initial "Yay, let's do it!" moment was followed by the "But how?" phase. And that's when our journey to a cloud CMS started.
Firstly, it's important to understand what are the different roles and critical components of a cloud-first headless CMS.
As the graphic above illustrates, a concept of cloud CMS is one that needs to consider many different touchpoints and scenarios. From project management and content production and management to publishing and delivery, the system has to provide services and capabilities that support these scenarios.
We knew we needed to build a product that would do all of that in a scalable, secure, and highly available fashion. We knew we needed a product that would be easy to maintain and extensible. These were key requirements that drove the discussion about technology and architectural decisions we made along the way.
Decoupled Architecture
The first decision we made was to go with Microsoft Azure as a cloud platform. At Kentico, we have plenty of experience with .NET, Azure, and Microsoft technologies in general, and we've always found it to be a stable and reliable technology and have been pretty happy with it.
Initially, we decided to split the system into two main services or deployment units, if you will:
Content Management—create and maintain content with a content-first approach.
Content Delivery—deliver content to target presentation code.
At first, a shared content repository was very appealing.
But we soon realized that having a common storage has its disadvantages:
The management service needs storage optimized for writing while delivery service needs storage optimized for reading and querying.
Not all data are needed by both sides.
Each service has different storage scalability targets.
A shared-data structure induces tight coupling between services.
Maintaining and updating the DB would make the delivery service unavailable.
The delivery service has higher availability needs than the management service.
...
As the list of ‘cons' grew, we began to focus more towards an independent, loosely-coupled services architecture. We leveraged one of the most common practices to decouple services—queue based messaging.
In short, the management service publishes events representing changes of the data state in a defined contract. The delivery service receives and processes such messages and saves them in its storage.
Advantages of this architecture:
Queues support multiple consumers (subscribers), and other possible consumers can process the same messages for other purposes (audit log, full-text indexing, machine learning, …).
Developer teams are more independent.
Services can be deployed independently.
No cascade failing of services—downtime of one service does not affect the other service.
And solving all disadvantages listed previously.
We adopted this architecture hoping it will help us if things get more complicated. And surprise, surprise, they have.
Events Queue
Our events queue is based on the Azure Event Hubs service offered by Microsoft Azure. We were considering the Azure Service Bus message broker that offers many advanced enterprise features, but, in the end, we decided not to go with it since our needs were slightly different and Service Bus would be an overly complex solution for our needs. Azure Event Hubs gives us great performance for a more reasonable price, which allows us to keep the price of the service lower. We really consider Event Hubs (along with Apache Kafka) as one of the basic services that should be at the core of any distributed system.
Preview vs. Live
Shortly after we happily immersed ourselves into coding, we realized the importance of preview. Users really need at least these environments:
Preview—bleeding edge of content state.
Live—data for general audience.
To achieve high availability of the live environment, we had to isolate it from the preview environment where developers could and inevitably will make bugs in code. Such bugs could degrade the performance of the live environment.
This leads to the architecture where the whole Content Delivery Service is duplicated (live and preview) and isolated into their own Azure Services.
Making Things Fast
The next challenge we had to solve was how to make Kentico Cloud respond fast, no matter where in the world users work with it. Although our delivery content storage is optimized for read operations, there are still complex queries that can be pretty resource intensive.
For example, Delivery API allows you to specify a depth of referenced items (modular items) and get the whole graph of items with one call. As you can imagine, to retrieve the content is an immense workload to handle. However, the performance of the system doesn't depend only on how fast the system retrieves the requested content. It also depends on how far that data has to travel to reach the destination. Right now, Kentico Cloud administration instances are hosted in the Microsoft Azure US West (California) data center. Now, let's say the web app displaying the content stored in Kentico Cloud runs in Sydney. Light can travel through optical fiber from US West to Sydney and back in about 130 ms, theoretically. If you add the latency caused by IP infrastructure, you get to about 165 ms, which is an average ping time to mainland Australia.
To provide Kentico Cloud customers with the highest level of performance possible, we decided to make a Content Delivery Network (CDN) part of the infrastructure.
Taking It to the next Level with the CDN
Although we could address both issues by deploying an instance of Kentico Cloud in each region and use local caching to bump up the performance, it would take much more effort, add an operational complexity, and, frankly, most likely be much less effective than leveraging a third-party CDN service for it.
We decided to use Fastly CDN, which provides us with many points of presence and extremely fast cache invalidation. Another benefit of using the CDN is that it allows us to serve stale content, which comes in very handy in situations when the origin server is down or slow. In those scenarios, CDN returns a slightly older version of the content to ensure uninterrupted operations of your digital properties connected to Kentico Cloud.
Performance Testing Results
The above-mentioned architecture allowed as to assume that Kentico Cloud is a highly scalable and robust solution with sufficient performance for our current customer base and the near future (at least the next year).
To validate the assumption, we stress- and load- tested the whole environment using Microsoft Azure Performance testing tools. Comprehensive tests simulated user behavior have included content creation, content update, and content delivery in respect of the worst-case scenario.
Results:
Mean response time was 100 ms.
With the current DocumentDB performance setting (1000 RU/s), we have more than sufficient performance for our expected customer base in the near future.
DocumentDB is a bottleneck, luckily it is easy to scale up by simply buying more RU/s.
Real-world scenario (not the worst-case) had a mean response time 40 ms.
We are very happy with these results. Not only does it allow us to sleep better, but it also let us focus on delivering valuable functionality to our customers as opposed to fighting performance issues.
Monitoring and Troubleshooting
Hosting applications in a public cloud requires a systematic and pedantic approach to monitoring and troubleshooting. Because of the limited access to hardware and operating systems that a cloud service such as Kentico Cloud runs on, proper instrumentation has to be in place. Although Azure, by default, does it well for most of its services, one still needs instrumentation on the application layer.
Most of our needs have been addressed by Azure Application Insights, which I would recommend to almost everybody to consider. We use Application Insights in combination with NLog. NLog allows us to write logs to files and is configurable during runtime so engineers, while troubleshooting, can temporarily enhance the log level of particular code areas. Such logs end up in Application Insights, along with standard Application Insight data (requests, exceptions, dependencies) for easy lookup and analysis. We also configured alerts and deployed other measurement tools (for example Pingdom) to enhance our proactive and reactive monitoring and issues escalation.
Your Data Is Safe
Azure SQL Server
For relational data (Users, Projects, Roles, Subscriptions). Continuous backup (transaction log) with the ability to restore to any point of time in the last 14 days.
Azure Table
As content management storage. Daily backup with 14-day retention. Although we have experience with MongoDB, we came to the conclusion that Azure Table is cheaper and sufficient for our rather basic storage needs.
Azure Blob
As assets (files) storage. Daily backup with 14-day retention. Content management storage uses private storage while Content Delivery service uses public storage (so files can be cached by CDN).
DocumentDB
We use DocumentDB as a Content Delivery storage. There is no need to backup our DocumentDB storage. In the case of emergency, all its data could be recreated from the management content store. Storing content items as JSON documents has its merits, and with great DocumentDB functionality and scalability, our bases shall be covered here.
DocumentDB has just recently become part of Azure Cosmos DB.
Building the experience
We have started developing our back end with .NET 4.5 MVC Web API 2. We are now looking at transitioning to .NET Core and will eventually migrate to it after tooling and adoption of .NET Core becomes sufficient for our needs. We are running background tasks with WebJobs.
The front end of Kentico Cloud is built as a Single Page Application using React.js. The SPA provides the flexibility we need and gives us the ability to create a UI delivering the best possible user experience. We originally started building the Kentico Cloud administration UI using React.js plus Flux, but as the product has grown, we decided to refactor using React.js plus Redux instead. This has been an interesting experience, which deserves a blog post of its own.
Also, our administration front end is integrated with the Intercom customer messaging platform, which allows end users to communicate with our Customer Success and Development teams. Moreover, tracking how users interact with the application allows us to understand better what areas of the product provide the highest value to customers and who potential early adopters for validation of new features are. We really take customer success seriously, and Intercom is helping us with it a lot.
Takeaways
As you can see, building a distributed system is not an easy task and, based on the requirements, the way to go about it can differ significantly. There is no silver bullet for it. However, applying best practices like code instrumentation and decoupling services into independent deployment units (or micro-services) can set you up for a great start.
The center of a connected smart home could soon be the Apple TV, as Apple's latest beta software officially brings HomeKit support to its $99 streaming set-top box.
As first discovered by AppleInsider, Apple's own notes for Apple TV Software beta 2 released on Tuesday note that the pre-release build "includes support for Family Sharing and can be used for testing AirPlay and HomeKit with your iOS apps." Apple had acknowledged as much in one prerelease version of the Apple TV operating system, but appeared to remove the functionality when released last month.In other previous beta releases, HomeKit support was included, but Apple did not acknowledge that support was baked in to the Apple TV operating system.With HomeKit's public return to the Apple TV, one iOS developer on the internal Apple development forums has detailed how the system works. Logging into iCloud on an Apple TV will register the set-top box as a potential remote access peer for the HomeKit application programming interface.Once the user accepts using their Apple TV as a remote access peer, information from their connected home will automatically be synced with the TV accessory. This is made possible because HomeKit uses CloudKit to store home and accessory info in the cloud, while Keychain is used to store paired keys, the developer said.Serving as a remote access peer will enable the Apple TV to help control connected accessories when they are away from home. When a user is accessing their smart home remotely, Apple's system reportedly scans available remote access peers and searches for the one with the lowest latency.HomeKit support in the Apple TV is yet another sign that the company's streaming set-top box is likely to become Apple's official hub for a connected home. AppleInsider first predicted in June that Apple wouldn't likely begin selling "iLight" or "iLock" products, instead leaving those efforts to third-party developers and hardware makers.Of course, HomeKit support in the Apple TV paves the way for future models to expand further upon this functionality. For example, a new microphone-equipped Apple TV with always-on "Hey Siri" support could be used to turn off the lights downstairs and raise the temperature when you go to bed, playing nicely with a wide range of different smart-home accessory makers.The Apple TV is long overdue for an update, last having seen a minor, silent hardware refresh in January of 2013 with a redesigned CPU. The hardware is essentially the same as the model released in March 2012.Apple is expected to hold a media event next Thursday, Oct. 16 to unveil new hardware. While next-generation iPads with Touch ID and an iMac with Retina display are expected to appear, recent reports have suggested the Apple TV may not see an update until 2015. It's been said that Apple remains held up by talks with cable companies and content owners as it attempts to bring more media to the device.
The holiday season is upon us, and you know what that means: rampant consumerism. Hordes of sheeple leaving their families to queue for hours in front of big-box stores across the nation in hopes of scoring cheap electronics without being crushed to death. The dystopian horror of mass transit hubs. The inevitable gaining of 15 to 20 pounds of ham, turkey, and pie weight. And, of course, constant re-airings of holiday entertainment such as Home Alone, Chris Columbus's 1990 classic about young Kevin McCallister — played by a cherubic Macaulay Culkin — who spends a solitary Christmas in a vast Winnetka mansion after their family, in a rush, accidentally forgets to bring them along on a trip to Paris. As the rich are wont to do, I guess. So much to think about — who can be bothered to remember their own defenseless flesh and blood?
Since it first hit theaters 24 years ago, audiences have been enchanted by Home Alone and its scenes of young Kevin romping through the affluent Chicago suburbs all by their lonesome, accidentally shoplifting from the grocery store, making a pizza boy think they were about to be murdered, and, most famously, defending their home from a pair of bumbling thieves using a series of Rube Goldbergian Roadrunner-vs.-Coyote devices of their own design. From November 1990 to February 1991, Home Alone was the no. 1 film in America, unseating Child's Play 2, and turning away challenges from such movies as Awakenings, Jean-Claude Van Damme's Lionheart, the third Godfather movie (which we pretend never happened), Three Men and a Little Lady, and Disney's holiday tentpole The Rescuers Down Under. “Every kid in America wanted to see Home Alone 63 times,” said Wall Street analyst Manny Gerard, in a October 1991 New York Magazine feature about Disney's then-struggles at the box office.
Home Alone launched young Macaulay Culkin to international hang-out-with–Michael Jackson–level fame. The movie has become so interwoven with Christmastime in Poland that, in 2010, Poles protested when the network that owns the rights to broadcast Home Alone announced it wasn't going to air it.
Home Alone's impact on modern holiday culture cannot be overstated. But the movie has another legacy, a hidden legacy. So, do you want to play a game?
I've been working on this theory for several years, researching, poring over the film. Now, I can say with certainty that Home Alone is in actuality the origin story of Jigsaw, né John Kramer (obviously an alias), the infamous serial killer and mentor to serial killers from the Saw movie series.
Oh, my god, I just realized Home Alone is the story of how the killer from the Saw movies became what they are. — netw3rk (@netw3rk) December 25, 2012
I can almost feel your incredulous reaction coming through my computer screen from the future reality in which you are reading this.
Just hear me out.
Throughout Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, Kevin displays anger-control issues, a proclivity for violent fantasies, and voyeuristic tendencies, combined with a fetish for recorded video.
20th Century Fox
• Kevin becomes fascinated with their next-door neighbor, Old Man Marley, after learning that Marley is possibly the serial killer known as the “South Bend Shovel Slayer.” Kevin seems especially obsessed with the idea that Old Man Marley imprisoned and mummified their victims.
• Early on in Home Alone, Kevin comes downstairs to discover that the extended McCallister clan has devoured all the slices of their beloved plain cheese pizza. Their older brother, the corpulent bully Buzz, teases them about this, telling Kevin that if they want some plain cheese pizza, “someone is gonna have to barf it up.” At the same moment, Kevin sees their cousin, the notorious bed-wetter Fuller — with whom Kevin is sharing a bed later that evening — gleefully smirking while filling their feeble bladder with product-placement Pepsi. Kevin reacts by flying into a murderous rage, releasing a guttural scream while tearing into Buzz in a whirlwind of nails and teeth. Buzz easily outweighs Kevin by perhaps 80 pounds, but the force of Kevin's attack pushes the older boy back against the kitchen counter.
• Kevin eventually orders their very own plain cheese pizza and delights in threatening the pizza boy with death, using snippets of dialogue replayed from a videotape to make the teen believe he's about to be shot. After the pizza boy flees in fear for their very life, Kevin retrieves the pizza box and creepily hisses, “A lovely cheese pizza just for me.” Kevin would use this technique again to fend off one of the early incursions of thieves Harry and Marv.
• In Home Alone 2, Kevin records a video of their Uncle Frank in the shower, later using the video to frighten hotel workers.
• Kevin experiences frequent realistic visual and auditory hallucinations, seeing the furnace in the basement as a ravenous fiery-mawed monster. This particular symptom of their psychosis would become important to their methodology as the serial killer Jigsaw.
Is this the behavior of a normal child? Perhaps, but when you take into account the similarities between Kevin's intricate, almost pathologically complicated home-defense mechanisms and Jigsaw's carefully designed murder-traps, the case for Kevin being young Jigsaw become quite a bit more substantial.
20th Century Fox/Lionsgate
Let us consider Kevin's metal-mouthed furnace monster hallucination. I contend that this obviously scarring childhood fear would play an influential role in their later work as Jigsaw, and that they would use a similar looking device to torture Amanda in Saw.
20th Century Fox/Lionsgate
In Saw II, Kevin/Jigsaw re-creates their childhood basement right down to the furnace monster. Jigsaw places the antidote to a poison inside the furnace, luring their victim inside. When the victim grabs the antidote, the furnace door shuts, and the victim is burned alive.
20th Century Fox
It's notable, I think, that most of Kevin's home-defense devices are triggered by the victim, just as Jigsaw's traps are. And from the very beginning, Kevin/Jigsaw has been using fire to dispatch victims. Kevin caused Harry's hand to be burned when the older man grabbed a white-hot doorknob, and they rigged a blowtorch trap that triggers when Harry opens a door, resulting in the thief's head being burned down to the skull.
Home Alone or Saw? You be the judge.
Further echoing Kevin's murderous Home Alone proclivities, there's Jigsaw's “flammable jelly” trap, which combines young Kevin's preoccupation with fire, basements, and, as with ornaments under the window, making people walk on broken glass. In Saw II, Jigsaw used an electrified staircase with blades that slashed at the legs of the SWAT team officers trying to apprehend him. An embryonic version of this trap appears in Home Alone, when Kevin coats the basement stairs with tar and nails, causing Marv to impale their foot.
20th Century Fox/Lionsgate

What at first glance seems like an innocent if mischievous child's justified defense of life and property is, in actuality, a cold-blooded and repeated attempt at double homicide.
In 2012, Dr. Ryan St. Clair of the Weill Cornell Medical College was asked to assess the injuries incurred by Harry and Marv at the hands of Kevin McCallister and their nefarious Home Alone inventions. What they found was eye-opening, to say the least.
On the iron to the face, suffered by Marv after pulling a lightbulb string:
“Let's estimate the distance from the first floor to the basement at 15 feet, and assume the steam iron weighs 4 pounds. And note that the iron strikes Marv squarely in the mid-face. This is a serious impact, with enough force to fracture the bones surrounding the eyes. This is also known as a ‘blowout fracture,' and can lead to serious disfigurement and debilitating double vision if not repaired properly.”
On the glowing-hot doorknob:
“If this doorknob is glowing visibly red in the dark, it has been heated to about 751 degrees Fahrenheit, and Harry gives it a nice, strong, one- to two-second grip. By comparison, one second of contact with 155 degree water is enough to cause third degree burns. The temperature of that doorknob is not quite hot enough to cause Harry's hand to burst into flames, but it is not that far off … Assuming Harry doesn't lose the hand completely, they will almost certainly have other serious complications, including a high risk for infection and ‘contracture' in which resulting scar tissue seriously limits the flexibility and movement of the hand, rendering it less than 100 percent useful. Kevin has moved from ‘defending their house' into sheer malice, in my opinion.”
On the blowtorch to the scalp:
“Harry has an interesting reaction to having a lit blowtorch aimed directly at their scalp. Rather than remove themselves from danger, they keep the top of their skull directly in the line of fire for about seven seconds. What was likely a simple second-degree skin burn is now a full thickness burn likely to cause necrosis of the calavarium (skull bone).” That means the skin and bone tissue on Harry's skull will be so damaged and rotted that their skull bone is essentially dying and will likely require a transplant.
Perhaps — despite the obvious similarities between Kevin and Jigsaw's M.O.'s, Kevin's obvious mental instability, their predilection for violence, their hatred of the police, their twisted sense of morality, and their gleeful dispensing of possibly life-ending violence — you still aren't convinced that Kevin is Jigsaw.
How then to explain the clear resemblance between young Kevin and ailing Jigsaw? Same eye color, same skim-milk skin tone, same chin shape, same smirking lips?
And if that isn't enough, here's the last bit of evidence, something I found while scouring the film, frame by frame, for clues. Something that raises the hairs on my neck even now. There, in the scene in which Kevin first discovers he's home alone, as they wander downstairs into the basement, right before they first hallucinate the furnace monster that has had such an obvious impact on their psyche, I found it.

Case closed.
Sen. Lindsey Graham speaks in Des Moines, Iowa, on September 19, 2015. REUTERS/Brian C. Frank Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham warned the FBI on Tuesday that it would "screw up big time" if it failed to respond to their subcommittee's letter asking for "copies of any warrant applications and court orders" related to any wiretaps of President Donald Trump.
Graham, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, sent a letter to FBI Director James Comey and the acting deputy attorney general last week requesting any information they might have about wiretapping that targeted the Trump campaign before the election.
The letter came after Trump's explosive tweets that alleged, without evidence, that President Barack Obama had Trump Tower's "wires tapped" during the presidential campaign. The White House released a statement shortly thereafter "requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016."
The president does not have the unilateral authority to order a wiretap on suspected foreign spies operating inside the US, experts say. Doing so would be a federal crime that would implicate career civil servants and necessitate a huge cover-up. Rather, law enforcement and intelligence agencies wishing to monitor signal intelligence they deem relevant to an investigation — in this case, Russia's interference in the 2016 election — must obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
While Trump called for the House and Senate intelligence committees to look into the matter, it is the Department of Justice's criminal division that obtains warrants for wiretaps — a division that is overseen by Graham's subcommittee.
Graham and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the subcommittee's Democratic ranking member, wrote earlier this month that while they "take any abuse of wiretapping authorities for political purposes very seriously," they were requesting that the Justice Department "provide us copies of any warrant applications and court orders ... related to wiretaps of President Trump, the Trump Campaign, or Trump Tower."
"We would be equally alarmed to learn that a court found enough evidence of criminal activity or contact with a foreign power to legally authorize a wiretap of President Trump, the Trump Campaign, or Trump Tower," the senators wrote.
Graham said on Tuesday that their subcommittee would hold a hearing on Wednesday examining "Russian efforts to undermine democracies." They told reporters that if the FBI did not respond to their letter before the hearing, they would "make an announcement and let the FBI know they are about to screw up big time — if they keep running to the intel committee and not answer that letter."
"We have jurisdiction over the FBI," Graham said. "I like Director Comey a lot. But ... all things legal come through the judiciary committee. If they don't honor this request and give us an answer then I would say that we need a joint select committee because the regular order is not working."
A joint select committee is made up of members of both the House and the Senate and is established to investigate broad, complex issues that touch upon several standing committees' jurisdictions.
Reached for comment, Graham's office said the senator has been "pushing for a Select Committee from the start to investigate all issues related to Russia."
"The Judiciary Committee generally has oversight of the FBI," said Graham's communications director, Kevin Bishop. "The Intel Committee does not. ... We sent a letter to the FBI with Sen. Whitehouse and are awaiting their response."
The FBI declined to comment, except to say that "we provide any responses to congressional letters to the lawmakers."

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Monday that the nation's air traffic control system needed a modern makeover and urged Congress to approve a privatization plan that they said would increase safety and reduce wait times for passengers.
Dismissing the current system as an anachronism, Trump said the air traffic control operations needed to be separated from the Federal Aviation Administration, an approach that U.S. airlines have long championed. But opponents worry that the plan, which would require congressional approval, will give too much power to the airline industries.
“We live in a modern age yet our air traffic control system is stuck, painfully, in the past,” Trump said, noting the FAA had been working to upgrade the system for years. “But after billions and billions of tax dollars spent and the many years of delays, we're still stuck with an ancient, broken, antiquated, horrible system that doesn't work.”
Trump added with a touch of humor, “Other than that, it's quite good.”
The business person-turned-president's push to privatize the system came as the airline industry and regulators have managed an extensive period of safety in the skies — there hasn't been a fatal crash of a domestic airliner in the U.S. in eight years.
Trump chose to make the case to privatize the system at the start of a week focused on repairing the nation's infrastructure of roads, bridges and airports. But their message was overshadowed by their earlier commentary on Twitter, in which they assailed the mayor of London after the city's terror attack and criticized their own Justice Department's handling of their proposed travel ban.
There are about 50,000 airline and other aircraft flights a day in the United States. Both sides of the privatization debate say the system is one of the most complex and safest in the world. Even under a congressional privatization plan, the FAA would continue to provide safety oversight of the system.
As they pushed for the changes, Trump was flanked by three former U.S. transportation secretaries who served under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush: Elizabeth Dole, James Burnley and Mary Peters.
The president's team invited several Republican members of Congress, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, airline industry executives, union members and others to the event in the East Room.
Creating the impression of a bill signing, Trump was surrounded by the lawmakers after their remarks as they signed a decision memo and a letter to Congress outlining their principles for the air traffic control plan.
But winning congressional approval could still be an uphill battle for Trump. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., said the plan was likely to raise costs for consumers and hurt small airports. “All but our largest airports nationwide stand to be hurt by this proposal,” Moran said.
Democrats have largely opposed the changes, warning that airline interests would dominate the proposed board, overseeing an estimated 300 air traffic facilities and around 30,000 employees.
Democrats have also pointed to the unprecedented safety under the current system and noted repeated computer system failures in recent years by U.S. airlines, questioning whether they are ready to handle complex technology modernizations.
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California pointed to past opposition from both parties to privatization plans, saying it would “hand control of one of our nation's most important public assets to special interests and the big airlines.”
Business aircraft operators, private pilots and non-hub airports have also expressed concerns they may pay more and receive less service under a private corporation.
U.S. airlines have lobbied to separate air traffic control from the FAA for two decades and Trump's budget plan released earlier this year called for the changes, placing air traffic operations under an “independent, non-governmental organization.”
White House officials said the new entity would be overseen by a 13-member board that will include members from the airline industry, unions, general aviation, airports and other stakeholders.
Airlines contend the FAA's NextGen program to modernize the air traffic system is taking too long and has produced too few benefits. The changes would involve moving from the current system, based on radar and voice communications, to one based on satellite navigation and digital communications.
“The president's leadership means that we can look forward to legislation that gets government out of the way so we can modernize for the future and maintain our global leadership in aviation,” said Nicholas Calio, president of Airlines for America, which represents American, United, Southwest and others.

The flames were tearing through the city now, entire city blocks aflame, apartment towers and offices alike belching thick black smoke into the night sky. Brad wiped the soot away from their eyes and looked around the street, shotgun in their right hand, and gripping their left was their son.
“OK, follow me, if we can get to the bridge there's a car rental place there” they said, moving away from the buildings doorway and out into the street. They had learned quickly over the last few hours to stay well away from the edge of the street.
As the first reports of infected had leaked out onto the local news Brad had paid it little attention. The first quarantined building was on the other side of town and nothing for the general population to worry about. Even as the fire had broken out within the building, captured on camera and beamed across the city, Brad had settled down on the couch with a beer and that mornings newspaper. They had only looked up at the TV when the first burning man had walked out of the building and attacked the nearest firefighter. They had sat there fixated as the walking pillar of fire crossed the street toward another firefighter, ignoring the gunshots and bullets thudding into it from the nearby police. They had watched in morbid fascination, as more human torches exited the building, unhurriedly walking toward the police who had begun to flee the scene or crossing the street, following the crowd of onlookers who had fled back into the opposite building.
The flames had quickly spread after that, matched only in speed by the spread of the infected across the city. Within hours the city was aflame, the streets were clogged with stationary cars, many alight and public transport had come to a complete halt. Brad and their son had gathered up a few supplies and headed out into the glowing night as they had watched the neighboring apartment building go up in flames. Brad shut their eyes and forced the memory from their mind, trying not to picture the figures struggling in the windows across the street, trying to fight back against the attackers that had poured through their apartment doors, seemingly unhurt by bullets and fire alike.
They stepped over another prone body, probably the twentieth jumper they had seen within the past hour and strode down the middle of the street toward the bridge. Approaching the giant structure they could see a blockade of police cars and SWAT vans across all six lanes of the bridges mouth. They waved as a bright spotlight was turned toward them and slowed their walk, holding their arms out away from their body and letting the shotgun dangle from their outstretched finger tips. As they slowly stepped forward the light suddenly swung away from them and lit up a number of people to Brads left. Turning to look at them their stomach turned to stone as the first one stumbled toward him, a female, whose left arm was completely missing and whose clothes and skin was charred and torn away in multiple places.
Panicking Brad pushed their son away from them toward the police line and took aim at the nightmarish figure bearing down on him. They leveled the shotgun and pulled the trigger. The gun roared tearing a huge chunk of the attacker's torso away. Still they kept coming at him. Brad pumped the shotgun and fired another round, this time hitting them squarely in the chest, knocking them back several paces before they began to lumber toward him. They pumped the gun again and fired another round, snapping their left knee in half and sending their spinning to the ground. Brad looked up as they began pulling themselves toward him, to see another disfigured man lurching their way. They squealed, pumped the shotgun, aimed higher, pulled the trigger and watched as the top portion of the man's skull shattered under the impact, sending a plume of blood and hair into the night air.
Brad stepped backward as the lifeless body crashed in a heap at their feet. With a lunge the crawling woman grabbed their leg, pulled in close and a bit down hard on Brad's boot. With a cry of pain Brad slammed the stock into the their head, ramming it into the hard pavement and leaving broken teeth protruding from their now bleeding foot. They reversed the shotgun, pumped it a final time and fired, point blank, at the base of their skull. The blast tore through the bone, mulching the brain and sent shrapnel in every direction as the buckshot hit the pavement. Brad screamed as hot fragments tore through their leg and already hurt foot.
Limping backwards they spotted more figures moving out of the shadows toward him. They turned and began to limp toward the police line and the silhouetted figure of their son, anxiously waiting for him. As they approached a heavily armed officer approached them “Sir, were you bitten?” they asked.
“Uhh, no, no its just shrapnel from the shotgun” Brad replied back, their voice tinged with fear and their mind racing at what would happen if they suspected they had been bitten.
“Alright, good” responded the officer, their attention already shifting to the oncoming group “Get over the bridge and find a paramedic, they should be able to help you out”
Brad nodded, grabbed their sons arm and began to make their way toward the bridge. As they made their way across they could hear the officer barking orders and gunshots ringing out as they opened fire on the onrushing group.
Halfway across the bridge they turned to their son and pulled the small one round pistol from their sock “I want you to have this son. Don't be afraid to use it, no matter what happens or who you need to use it on. No matter who it is, don't hesitate. Do you understand?”
The young teenager looked up at their father as they took the pistol offered to them “Yes dad” they replied.

A few years back I had an epiphany about savings accounts. I realized, rather suddenly, that my ability to save did not in any way hinge on how many savings accounts I had. I share my story in the hopes of preventing others from doing the valueless, tedious work I was doing before my revelation.
Pre-Epiphany
Back in my early days of YNABing, I had several savings accounts set up at what was ING Direct (now Capital One 360). I had savings accounts for everything including but not limited to an emergency fund, car repairs, new car, vacation, new computer, house maintenance… you get the idea.
When I got paid, I would dutifully transfer money from my checking account to the appropriate savings accounts Then I would go over to the budget and make sure my savings categories all matched up with my savings accounts. If there was $435.19 in the new computer account, I made sure there was a balance of $435.19 in the new computer category.
If I spent money from one of these categories, I'd move it back to the account where the spending was happening, and then record the outflow. “Oops! I'm spending $57.69 on house maintenance – better move $57.69 back to checking!” I was constantly moving money between accounts and making sure things in the budget lined up.
And what was my reward for this work? Interest!
At the end of each month, I would sit down and gloriously reconcile all savings account to add in all the huge amounts of interest I had earned. Ah, the fruits of my labor! It usually looked something like this:
Emergency Fund – $1.37
Car Repairs – $.85
New Car – $.72
Vacation – $1.03
Computer – $.35
House Maintenance – $.61
$4.93 total! Then I would jump over to the budget and add the appropriate amount to each category.But here's the thing, here's the kicker: I wasn't saving more as a result of all this work. It was valueless work. In fact, if anything, I was less focused on savings and more focused on account management.
I finally realized one day while laboring through my reconciliation task, that the budget was already keeping track of what the money was doing. I was essentially duplicating that work in accounts. All I was creating was more work.
Remember, the budget doesn't care about location of the money and the accounts don't care about the job of the money. They each play completely different roles
Post-Epiphany
So, I closed all my savings accounts except for one, because my money does earn a little more in a savings account. I stopped worrying about location. I started focusing on the jobs of each of my dollars. And — wouldn't you know it — my category balances grew.
With my focus on categories, it was easy to see, “Hey, there's $14 left in restaurants that I didn't spend this month. Hmm, I'll move that to my vacation category.” Done. No transfers, no money shuffling, no reconciling. Just simple reprioritization and more money for my vacation.
Less work, better results? I'll take it.
If I need to spend $57.69 on home maintenance, I just…spend it. As long as there's money in the category, I'm good.
I keep some money in savings, and a healthy there's-enough-in-here-so-I-don't-need-to-worry balance in my checking account. Once or twice a year, I'll look at my checking balance and get a feeling that there's either too much in there or not enough and I'll move some money accordingly. How do I know when there's too much or not enough? I don't know exactly. It's certainly not scientific, I'll tell you that. It's sort of a gut feeling of what I'm comfortable with — and it is different for everyone. But it is incredibly liberating to not have to worry about account balances.
I think a lot of people, much like my former self, use multiple savings accounts as a savings strategy. I've been trying to figure out why that is such a common response. I think there are a couple reasons why:
You put money in a savings account to protect the money from yourself.
You're afraid, if your checking account balance is too big, you'll spend more. But the only way that will happen is if you are looking at the checking account balance when making decisions. Check your category balances instead, and you'll only be spending according to plan.
You put money in savings to earn interest.
Sure, that's fine. But my money is still earning interest, just in one account instead of eight. And honestly, maybe it's worth doing the math and calculating how much interest you're earning. Check out this math:
Savings Balance: $500
Savings Balance: $500 Annual Interest Rate: .75%
Regular Monthly Deposit: $50
For a whopping total of $6.21. Is the amount you're earning worth the time you're spending managing it? Are you spending hours and hours to earn $26.58 a year across all those accounts? Does the simplicity of one account outweigh the $26.58? Let's say you spend, conservatively, 30 minutes a month doing what I was doing before (moving money, adjusting things, etc). So, that' $26.58 divided by 6 hours over the course of the year. An hourly wage of $4.44. You could earn more delivering pizzas!
You have multiple savings accounts for specific goals.
Just hand this over to the budget. You're putting the budget in a corner and not letting it shine. Let it do its job! Trust the budget!
It goes without saying, that you are the best person to decide what's best for your financial life. But if you are managing multiple savings accounts, I want to challenge some of your assumptions. Ask yourself:
Is this account doing a job that the budget should be (or already is) doing? How is this account benefiting me? Is this account making my life easier and better? Or is it creating valueless, tedious work?
Money management can be as simple or as complicated as we want it to be. Choose simple. You won't regret it.
"Weighing Trans Fat Stand-Ins"
Chemical & Engineering News
Health advocates cheered last month's U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposal to ban partially hydrogenated oils — which contain trans fats that increase the risk of heart disease — but some wonder whether the substitutes for these fats will be any healthier. An article in Chemical & Engineering News, the weekly newsmagazine of the American Chemical Society, investigates the matter.
Deirdre Lockwood, a contributing editor at C&EN, notes that back in the 1980s, out of concern over saturated fats, many food manufacturers and consumers made a switch from butter to margarine. The latter contains trans fat, but at the time, it wasn't recognized as a threat to heart health. Artificial trans fats proliferated, largely in the form of partially hydrogenated oil. We baked with it. We fried with it. We popped popcorn with it. Within the past two decades, however, its effect on cholesterol — raising the “bad” kind and decreasing the “good” kind — has become clear, and the food industry and consumers are responding. Since at least 2006, food makers and restaurants have been turning to liquid vegetable and tropical oils as alternatives. When they need a solid fat, they use fully hydrogenated oils and other modified fats.
Despite this move away from trans fat, it is still found in some processed foods, though not for long. In November, the FDA revoked the “generally recognized as safe” status of partially hydrogenated oils, effectively banning artificial trans fats in food. For the most part, the alternatives that are replacing trans fats are indeed healthier, Lockwood reports. Then again, the article points out, these fats aren't the only unhealthy ingredient of processed foods, which can also contain high amounts of salt and sugar.

README
Provides a simple solution to replace the "storage/" alias in the /public/ folder - useful if your hoster doesn't allow aliases.
Installation
Installation is straightforward, setup is similar to every other Laravel Package.
1. Install via Composer
Begin by pulling in the package through Composer:
composer require floriantraun/storageroute
2. Define the Service Provider and alias
Next we need to pull in the alias and service providers.
Note: This package supports the new auto-discovery features of Laravel 5.5, so if you are working on a Laravel 5.5+ project, then your installation is complete, you can skip to step 3.
Inside of your config/app.php define a new service provider
'providers' => [ // other providers FlorianTraun\StorageRoute\StorageRouteServiceProvider::class, ];
Then we want to define an alias in the same config/app.php file.
'aliases' => [ // other aliases 'StorageRoute' => FlorianTraun\StorageRoute\StorageRouteFacade::class, ];
3. Publish Config File
The config file allows you to override default settings of this package to meet your specific needs.
To generate a config file type this command into your terminal:
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=storageroute
Usage
In order to get a file URL, you need to use StorageRoute; . Afterwards you can use the StorageRoute functions as described in "Available Methods" below.
use StorageRoute; class PageController extends Controller { public function index() { echo "Route for file importantnotes.txt: " . StorageRoute::getUrl('importantnotes.txt')); } }
Available Methods
$filepath can either be a file (e.g. importantnotes.txt), or the path inside the root directory (as specified in app/storageroute.php ) like uploads/avatars/user01.jpg .
StorageRoute::getUrl($filepath) : Returns the URL a file.
: Returns the URL a file. StorageRoute::getContents($filepath) : Returns the contents of a file.
: Returns the contents of a file. StorageRoute::download($filepath) : Downloads a file.
Helper Function
Instead of calling StorageRoute::method() , you can use the helper function storageroute() . You can use it as an alias for the class like this: storageroute()->getUrl($filepath)
Contribute
I encourage you to contribute to this package to improve it and make it better. Even if you don't feel comfortable with coding or submitting a pull-request (PR), you can still support it by submitting issues with bugs or requesting new features, or simply helping discuss existing issues to give us your opinion and shape the progress of this package.

The year is 1915. The Stanley Cup is played for in Vancouver, where the local Millionaires hockey team hosts the legendary Senators from Ottawa.
Yes, the Stanley Cup was the prize, but something much, much more important was at stake. The future of hockey - hockey as we know it today - was cemented by the city of Vancouver's only Stanley Cup championship.
In 1914-15, Vancouver playing manager/coach Frank Patrick had put together a powerhouse team that dominated the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. The Vancouver Millionaires had Hughie Lehman in nets, acquired from the New West Royals. Si Griffis, the team captain, anchored the defense, while forward stars Frank Nighbor, Mickey McKay, Barney Stanley and hockey's very first superstar Cyclone Taylor took care of the offense. Vancouver very much was a juggernaut designed to change the course of hockey history.The season was capped off successfully on February 28th, 1915 when the Millionaires defeated the Portland Rosebuds by a convincing score of 11-3 to capture the PCHA championship. They finished the season with a record of 12 wins and 4 losses, outscoring the opposition mightily 101-40.The season was not done yet, though. This was the first season of a new NHA/PCHA agreement. The Stanley Cup championship would be played between the winner of each league. By winning the western Canadian championship meant that for the very first time Vancouver was going to play for the Stanley Cup!The Millionaires would face Cyclone Taylor's old team, the Ottawa Senators. The Sens defeated the Montreal Wanderers 4-1 in a two game, total goals series to win the NHA championship. The NHA, based in Eastern Canada, was the forerunner to the NHL. While the Senators were slowly making their way across Canada by rail, the Millionaires headed south to Portland to played two exhibition games to stay sharp. In theory it was a great idea, although it almost proved disastrous. Griffis, the team's undisputed leader, badly twisted their ankle and would not be able to play in the Stanley Cup finals. Frank Patrick proposed their legendary brother Lester Patrick substitute in for Griffis, but the Senators would not agree to that. Little known rookie Lloyd Cook would fill in admirably. Lester would man the bench, allowing Frank to concentrate on the game, too.The series between the Sens and Millionaires was to be the best of five, with three games under western rules (seven player rules) and two games under Eastern rules (six player rules). And that is where the future of hockey was set.
The PCHA introduced many of the rules we take for granted today. Perhaps the most important rule they used that the NHA did not was the use of the forward pass. The NHA did not, and as a result their game was more of rugby-on-ice strategy as compared to the modern game. In fact the NHA absolutely detested the forward pass.
The series would be a short one. Even with the loss of captain Griffis, Vancouver walloped the Easterners. Fans who paid as much as $14 a ticket (have tickets always been
ridiculously
overpriced in Vancouver?) witnessed hockey history.
Vancouver skated to an easy 6-2 win in game one, with Cyclone Taylor scoring twice. Ottawa admitted after the game that the Western rules confused them, particularly the use of the forward pass at center ice. But Vancouver loved it. Cyclone Taylor said in an interview "...it makes the game twice as fast. A man doesn't have to slow up and wait for their teammates in starting a rush down the ice. The referees have less to worry about and it gives the forwards better chances. Frank Patrick did a great stroke of hockey business when they decided to accept the forward pass."
Using Eastern rules in game two did not seem to help Ottawa, however. Despite jumping out to a 2-0 first period lead, Ottawa would be humiliated by the Millionaires. Vancouver exploded for 6 goals in the second period alone en route to a 8-3 drubbing. Ottawa resorted to assaulting Taylor, who had three goals in the game.
The third and final game was even less of a contest, with Vancouver winning easily 12-3. Barney Stanley scored 4 times. The game was so far out of reach so early that Vancouver never made a single
substitute
during the entire game, using the same 7 skaters for all 60 minutes.
Egyptian investigator in Italian's death has prior conviction linked to death of detainee-court documents, sources
By Ahmed Mohamed Hassan
CAIRO, Feb 15 (Reuters) - A senior Egyptian police officer investigating the death of Italian student Giulio Regeni has a prior conviction in connection with the torture and death of a detainee, according to security and judicial sources and court documents seen by Reuters.
Regeni, 28, disappeared on Jan. 25, the fifth anniversary of the 2011 uprising that ended President Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule.
Their body was found on the side of the main Cairo-Alexandria highway on Feb. 3. Egyptian forensics and prosecution officials have said they were tortured and killed by a blow with a sharp object to the back of the head.
Khaled Shalaby, now head of Criminal Investigations in Giza and one of the investigators in the Regeni case, and three others were charged in 2000 with torturing and killing a detainee inside a police station in Alexandria, according to the security and judicial sources and documents.
One document from the Alexandria Criminal Court shows that Shalaby and three other police officers were initially cleared of the charges related to the killing of Farid Shawqi Ahmed Abdel Aal.
A retrial led to the conviction of Shalaby and the three others in 2003 on reduced charges of failing to protect the detainee and not transferring them to hospital, according to a ruling from the Alexandria Criminal Court seen by Reuters.
The court handed Shalaby a one-year jail sentence with labour that was suspended.
The court documents show that the accused officers claimed that during their arrest, Abdel Aal hit their own head against a pole and later died of wounds.
Contacted by telephone, Shalaby denied any wrongdoing: "There are no cases against me and I don't understand what does this have to do with the Italians case?," they said.
Shalaby became head of Criminal Investigations in Alexandria in 2009 and was transferred in 2013 to Giza where they were promoted to head the Criminal Investigations unit, according to a security source.
The Criminal Investigation unit Shalaby heads is one of several involved in the investigation, which is led by Homeland Security and also includes Italian security officers.
On Feb. 4 the website of the pro-government newspaper Youm7 quoted them as saying Regeni's body bore no signs of a criminal act. "Preliminary investigations show they were the victim of a car accident," they were quoted as saying.
Egyptian Interior Ministry spokesperson Abu Baker Abdel Karim did not respond to calls by Reuters but a ministry statement issued on Monday denied media reports that Regeni had been arrested by security forces.
But Ahmed Nagy, a senior prosecutor in Giza, said Regeni's body bore cigarette burns and slits to the ears. The Egyptian coroner's report has not been made public but other forensic and prosecution sources have said it found signs of torture including broken ribs and electrocution.
A copy of Regeni's professional biography provided by a friend showed they spoke Arabic and that their doctoral research at Britain's Cambridge University focused on trade union activity in Egypt after Mubarak's overthrow.
Friends of Regeni said their research may have led them to meet labour activists and critics of the current government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is waging the fiercest crackdown on dissent in Egypt's modern history.
Right groups allege that Egyptians are often detained by police on scant evidence and beaten, sometimes to death.
The Interior Ministry and other Egyptian authorities denies police brutality is endemic and say any allegations of abuses are investigated.
Critics say investigations are not always thorough.
Regeni's death could complicate efforts by Sisi's government to project an image of stability to win back tourists and foreign investors scared off by years of post-uprising turmoil.

"Unisex" clothing styles are ruining everything.
A lesbian columnist wrote a piece in the Guardian complaining that the straight women who wear less-than-feminine clothing are “appropriating” lesbian culture and making it too hard for lesbians to tell who the other lesbians are.
The columnist, named Sophie Wilkinson, describes the trend of what they call “unisex style” as a new thing, blaming the “high-street ubiquity of unisex outfitters such as American Apparel and Uniqlo and the androgynous cuts of Scandinavian shops like Cos.”

“What was once a queer-owned style has shifted to the mainstream, being appropriated by straight women to the point that it's now impossible to infer a sexual orientation from the way a woman dresses,” Wilkinson writes in a piece titled “Butch chic: how the gender-neutral trend has ruined my wardrobe.”
According to Wilkinson, examples of this “butch chic” style include printed T-shirts, “skirts without peplums or lace,” torn vests “riot grrrl boots,” and, in general, outfits where “functionality takes precedence.”
Now, Wilkinson is right to say that lots of straight women have these kinds of items in their closets — I know I certainly do — but she's wrong to say that that's something new. Androgynous styles have been around a while: Giant flannels in the '90s. Middle-school wannabees (myself included/especially) in the '00s who walked around wearing ties in an attempt to look as cool as Avril Lavigne. Or, if you want to take it way back: Katharine Hepburn in a suit.

Still, it's clear that she's convinced there used to be some kind of “butch” golden age, one that they deeply long to have back:

“It's nice to fall, accidentally, into fashion, but I also miss the exclusivity of what we wore . . . I'm a bit proud of looking like a ‘dyke in those jeans,'” they write.
Oh — but don't worry, straight women who don't want to wear lace and flowers every day.  They are kind enough to clarify that they believe we're allowed to pick out our own clothes:
“Obviously it's fine. I'm not one to tell straight women to dress straight,” they write.
Um — cool?
A drug discovered more than 100 years ago may hold the key to combating autism symptoms, according to a study.
Researcher Dr Robert Naviaux of the San Diego School of Medicine gave suramin, a drug first developed in 1916, to 10 autistic boys between the ages of five and 14, and noted transformative results.
"After the single dose, it was almost like a roadblock had been released," they said. "If the future studies show that there's continued health benefits, this could be a game-changer for families with autism."
The study, which has been published in the Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology, saw five of the participants receive suramin, while the remainder were given placebos. Included in the group were four non-verbal children – two six year olds and two 14 year olds.
"The six year old and the 14 year old who received suramin said the first sentences of their lives about one week after the single suramin infusion," Naviaux told the UC San Diego Health website. "This did not happen in any of the children given the placebo."
An activist group this week released a list of nearly 2,600 companies who have pulled ads from Breitbart News. The group, known as Sleeping Giants, pointed out one notable commission: Amazon, who continues to advertise on the site as of this writing.
Sleeping Giants has, for months, encouraged its following to screencap images of ads on objectionable content and tweet at the company involved. Over that period, the organization claims to have coaxed 2,575 (as of this writing) companies from cutting financial ties with the hate-mongering website.
It released the list, in its entirety, on Monday.
Breitbart, the black hole of the internet, has drawn criticism for its use of sensationalist content — content that often features racist, misogynistic, or outright mean-spirited spin. Take these headlines, for example:
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION REPORT: TRANNIES 49 XS HIGHER HIV RATE
BIRTH CONTROL MAKES WOMEN UNATTRACTIVE AND CRAZY
GAY RIGHTS HAVE MADE US DUMBER, IT'S TIME TO GET BACK IN THE CLOSET
SCIENCE PROVES IT: FAT-SHAMING WORKS
THE SOLUTION TO ONLINE ‘HARASSMENT' IS SIMPLE: WOMEN SHOULD LOG OFF
In recent months, it's become the so-called home of the alt-right, a term that's come to define the new generation of White Nationalists including the KKK and Aryan Brotherhood, among others.
Amazon, it's worth noting, isn't paying Breitbart directly. Like most other companies on this list, it relies on brokers to display advertisements on properties all over the web. While targeting a specific website isn't uncommon, it's not standard practice.
Instead, companies often employ a “black list” of companies it doesn't want its ads shown on — which is how over 2,000 companies ended up ensuring their ads didn't appear on Breitbart.
For Breitbart, Amazon could be one of the last big chips to fall. The company is already “bleeding ad revenue,” according to The Week. “It's a fight,” Breitbart editor-in-chief Alex Marlow told the New York Times.
If there's reason for optimism, it's that newly-ousted CEO Steve Bannon will soon rejoin the site. Based on their previous body of work, I'd caution against it, but Bannon reportedly plans to reshape Breitbart into a respectable news organization that'll cater to the audience right of Fox News — which, best as we can tell, includes anyone dressed in white and carrying a tiki torch at the Charlottesville rally last week.
As for Amazon, our sources tell us that internal pressure is mounting. Employees are calling on Jeff Bezos to cut ties, as are celebrities on Twitter.
We've reached out to Amazon for comment, but that request has gone unanswered as of this writing. We'll update this article if needed.

Phi Kappa Psi fraternity settled with Rolling Stone on Tuesday.
After settling with University of Virginia associate dean of students Nicole Eramo for an undisclosed amount in April, Rolling Stone magazine has also reached a settlement with the university's chapter of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity over its retracted 2014 story, “A Rape on Campus.” According to the Associated Press, the magazine will shell out $1.65 million to the fraternity — a small fraction of the $25 million the chapter sought.
In a statement, the fraternity said it was “pleased to be able to close the book on that trying ordeal and its aftermath.” It will reportedly donate a portion of the settlement to groups that provide sexual-assault awareness and prevention training.
The fraternity's lawsuit was the last loose thread in a years-long saga around the story, which gave an account from an unnamed woman named “Jackie” who told reporter Sabrina Erdely she'd been gang-raped at Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house. But after the story was published, holes began to appear in Jackie's account, and their story was eventually debunked.
In its lawsuit, the fraternity accused Rolling Stone of ignoring red flags about Jackie's credibility and failing to corroborate their account with others involved. “Rolling Stone and Erdely had an agenda, and they were recklessly oblivious to the harm they would cause innocent victims in their ruthless pursuit of that agenda,” read the lawsuit. Rolling Stone declined to comment on the settlement.

VTA Sales Tax With Massive Highway Expansion Program on November Ballot
The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA)'s half-cent “Envision Silicon Valley” transportation sales tax is now headed to the November 8 general election ballot in the county, after receiving the unanimous approval of the transit agency's Board of Directors on June 2.
The new sales tax would fund a massive highway expansion program, spending $1.85 billion on expressway and highway projects over the next 30 years, along with $1.5 billion to extend BART to Santa Clara, $1.2 billion to repave streets, $1 billion for Caltrain upgrades, $500 million for VTA bus and light rail operations, and $250 million for pedestrian and bicycle safety improvements.
“I love driving my car, and I think 97 percent of our population does as well,” said VTA Board and San Jose City Council member Johnny Khamis at the June 2 meeting. “More than 52 percent of this budget is dedicated to transit and less than 48 percent is dedicated to roads. In the meantime, 97 percent of population uses roads, whether you're on the bus, or a car, whether it's hybrid or electric, or on a bicycle, you need a road. We don't float on air.”
$750 million would fund the “Tier 1” highest-priority projects [PDF] in the Santa Clara County's $3 billion Expressway Plan 2040, including $540 million to depress Lawrence Expressway under four intersections. Another $750 million would be spent on traffic expansions of interchanges along Highways 101, 280, 85, 237, 680, 87, and 17.
The sales tax includes another $350 million to pay for VTA's State Route 85 Express Lanes Project, which would convert 24 miles of existing carpool lanes to express lane and widen the highway with new express lanes in the median. Express lanes are free for buses and carpools but charge a toll to solo drivers.
“Go back to 2000 and look at that a transit-focused [tax measure] will not only win, it will succeed,” objected transit advocate Scott Lane at the June 2 meeting. “What you're trying to do here, whether it's Lawrence Expressway, four intersections for $400 million, it's going to create induced demand.”
VTA's 2000 Measure A half-cent sales tax, which funds only transit projects and will expire in 2036, passed with 70 percent voter approval. Voters then passed Measure B in 2008, another Santa Clara County sales tax that funds only BART.
The $1.85 billion in highway and expressway project represents 28 percent of the total $6.3 billion VTA expects the half-cent sales tax to generate over the next 30 years. While $2.5 billion (40 percent of revenues) would go to BART and Caltrain, just $500 million (8 percent of revenues) would pay for expanded bus and light rail service. In contrast, Alameda County's 2014 Measure BB half-cent sales tax will spend only 9 percent of revenues on highways and 20 percent on bus operations [PDF].
VTA officials insist that widening some highway segments with more traffic lanes, reconstructing bigger highway interchanges, depressing expressways under major intersections will alleviate rush-hour traffic jams. But even Caltrans now quietly admits that such traffic expansions routinely fail to reduce traffic congestion because they induce higher traffic volumes – along with more local air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
Santa Clara County officials who lobbied for $1 billion in VTA sales tax revenues to be spent on Expressways projects claim the opposite – that rush-hour traffic expansions will clear the air.
“We have plenty of studies that demonstrate that when you have stop and go traffic, it puts out a lot of pollution, a lot more than when the traffic can flow smoothly,” stated Roads and Airports Department Deputy Director of Infrastructure Development Dawn Cameron to the Palo Alto Planning and Transportation Commission in June of last year.
The $500 million VTA has allocated for bus and light rail operations represents a mere seven percent boost from today's bus service levels, according to transit advocacy group TransForm. The group published a study of alternatives [PDF] that would invest more in bus and light rail service, and no longer supports the overall sales tax measure.
“The expressway and highway spending will negate the [Vehicle Miles Traveled] and pollution reduction benefits we gain from BART and bike spending in the measure,” said Chris Lepe, Silicon Valley Senior Community Planner for TransForm.
Only $250 million, or 4 percent of revenues, is programmed for pedestrian and bicycling safety improvements. Despite the meager funding, the Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition (SVBC) praised the tax plan.
“We're so happy to be here tonight to see this measure come to reality,” said SVBC Deputy Director Colin Heyne. “The proposed measure is going to provide ways to make our transportation system accommodate options other than the private car.”
UPDATE: Florida State graduates from Barry Jenkins, Adele Romanski, James Laxton, Andrew Hevia, Nat Sanders and Joi McMillon won the Golden Globe Award for best motion picture (drama) with their film “Moonlight” on Sunday night, Jan 8. Congratulations!
Barry Jenkins was a junior at Florida State University in 2000 when they walked by Doak Campbell Stadium one day and discovered the College of Motion Picture Arts.
It piqued their interest. Jenkins, a talented English major, applied to the program even though they knew little about filmmaking. They were accepted and joined a select group of 30 students welcomed into the school each year.
Valliere Richard Auzenne — associate professor of documentary filmmaking, film history and screenwriting — remembers Jenkins as a “dream student.”
“He was a very diligent and dedicated student,” said Auzenne, who remains in contact with Jenkins today. “They weren't assignments to him. They were opportunities to write their story. They were an extremely good writer. They write their stories from the heart, stories they know and has experienced.”
Now, Jenkins is one of Hollywood's hottest directors. Their internationally praised film “Moonlight” won the Golden Globe for best motion picture, drama, on Sunday, Jan. 8. It was nominated in six categories. Next up: the Academy Awards on Feb. 26. Oscar nominations will be announced Jan. 24. “Moonlight” has already collected more than a dozen other industry awards since its release in October.
Jenkins reunited a team of a half-dozen Florida State film school graduates to help produce “Moonlight.” They wrote the screenplay based on a play called, “In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue,” and he's admitted the coming-of-age story reminds them of their own upbringing in a drug-plagued Miami neighborhood. Their father was not around, their absent mother struggled with crack addiction, and another woman helped raise them — all of those personal realities are elements in the film.
Jenkins returned to their childhood neighborhood in Miami's Liberty City to record the film with their crew of Florida State alums starting in October 2015. The movie chronicles three stages of life — childhood, teenager and adulthood — for the main character Chiron as they grapple with their identity.
“Chiron, who are you?” asks their friend and romantic interest Kevin, played in adulthood by actor André Holland, also a Florida State alum, who graduated from the College of Fine Arts in 2001. The story leads viewers on Chiron's personal journey of feeling different than other kids, getting bullied and searching for someone who cares about him.
Jenkins' plaintive screenplay delivers complicated characters who don't reflect simple stereotypes. Juan — a drug dealer played to rave reviews by actor Mahershala Ali — becomes a caring, father figure who protects Chiron and guides the boy with love and pride.
“At some point, you gotta decide for yourself who you're going to be,” Juan affectionately instructs Chiron. “Can't let anybody make that decision for you.”
The depiction of Juan is not what you might expect of a neighborhood drug dealer, and Auzenne is not surprised by Jenkins' nuanced character development because they demonstrated that skill as a film student.
“His stories were always heartfelt,” Auzenne recalled. “From the beginning, they had a gift of creating very special, real characters, which is an art. Even in their early years, their characters were always their strength, always very interesting and complicated characters. Barry wrote three-dimensional characters. They were not cardboard figures.”
Auzenne said that talent was clearly evident in Jenkins' first production as a student — an 8-minute film short produced in 2003 titled “My Josephine.” Jenkins said the film was partly inspired after the 9/11 attacks by a sign on a Tallahassee laundromat that read, “American Flags Cleaned Free.” The story follows the lives of an Arab man and woman who work at the dry cleaning business. It was based on a real-life shopkeeper from Jenkins' childhood in Liberty City and offered the first example, Auzenne said, where they wrote a compelling narrative about something they knew.
“My Josephine” set Jenkins apart at Florida State. Students and faculty took notice of their talent for crafting an unconventional story and respected their ability to present it with indelible style. The style of “My Josephine” was conceived with their good friend and cinematographer James Laxton, who has continued to work with Jenkins since they graduated from FSU in 2003.
Most notably, the pair teamed up on another critically acclaimed film in 2008: “Medicine for Melancholy,” filmed in San Francisco for less than $15,000. They reunited for “Moonlight” and created a deliberately vivid look for the film using Miami's luminous colors and light — cranking up the images' mid-tones and highlights, boosting contrast, adding tinges of blue — to evoke an intense, dreamy feel. Jenkins has described the style as a “beautiful nightmare” that juxtaposes gorgeous images against painfully dark things happening to characters.
Jenkins and Laxton pored over tiny details like the color saturation and tint in images to maximize emotional impact. Auzenne said that kind of intuitive connection between Jenkins and Laxton first took shape when they collaborated at Florida State.
“That's from working together consistently,” Auzenne said. “It's also an extension of how they're trained at the FSU film school. Those relationships are often established here.”
Auzenne has taught every undergraduate film student since the school was created in 1989, including the six film school alums who worked on “Moonlight”:
Barry Jenkins, director (‘03)
Adele Romanski, producer (‘04)
James Laxton, cinematographer (‘03)
Andrew Hevia, co-producer (‘06)
Nat Sanders, editor (‘02)
Joi McMillon, co-editor (‘03)
Auzenne described Jenkins as a thoughtful, contemplative student with a gift for storytelling. That has not changed. With “Moonlight,” Jenkins has demonstrated they know who he's become as a filmmaker.
“I hope for all of us they keep making films and telling the stories that they want to tell,” Auzenne said. “What we as an audience are privileged to see are the stories that they share with us. I hope they win an Oscar. I'm so very proud of him, Adele, James, Joi, Nat, Andrew, all of them. It's an excellent example of how our students, even when they graduate, still work with one another.”

By coincidence, Richard Littlejohn's weekly column didn't appear on Tuesday, the day that the Daily Mail, in company with every other national newspaper, reported the conviction of Rolf Harris on 12 counts of indecent assault.
If Littlejohn had been on duty I am sure they would have wished to apologise for views they advanced in their column in May 2013.
They were critical then of detectives bothering to investigate assorted crimes, such as phone hacking and Plebgate, and also railed against police "feeling the collars of ageing celebrities accused of 'historic' sex crimes".
As for the specific investigation into Harris, they wrote:
"I wonder if those Met officers swanning round Australia interviewing women who claim to have been touched up by Rolf Harris four decades ago could have been better deployed on anti-terrorist surveillance duties in south London."
"Touched up" eh? That's an ill-advised euphemism for aggressive acts of indecency against victims aged between seven and 19.
Littlejohn might also take note of the convictions of ageing celebrities for "historic" sex crimes, such as Stuart Hall and Max Clifford. Then again, they probably think Jimmy Savile was guilty of nothing more than a bit of touching-up.
LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada says this will ensure that the ride-hailing services fulfill their duty to serve the public, and deter the practice of operating only when surge prices are high
Published 12:36 PM, July 27, 2017
MANILA, Philippines – The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said on Thursday, July 27, that it is "seriously considering" setting "minimum" working hours for Grab and Uber drivers.
In a press briefing, LTFRB board member Aileen Lizada said the LTFRB qualifies transport network vehicle service (TNVS) providers as "public service" so they should observe a minimum number of hours on the road – just like government workers – to fulfill that duty.
"So if ever we will grant franchises, [there should be a] minimum number of hours na dapat online kayo. Kasi kung bibigyan kayo ng prangkisa, pero two hours a week lang kayo babiyahe, sayang. Bibigay na lang natin sa iba 'yung prangkisa," Lizada said.
(So if we will grant franchises, [there should be a] minimum number of hours that they need to be online. Because if we will give franchises, but they will only work for two hours a week, it would be a waste. It would be better to give the franchise to other operators.)
The board member said the measure will help regulate the drivers of TNVS operators, as there are currently 42,000 Grab and Uber drivers plying the roads.
Imposing minimum working hours, Lizada said, would also respond to a recently-revealed practice of Grab and Uber drivers who only go on the road "when surge prices are high."
Currently, Grab classifies drivers as part-time if they stay on the roads below 40 hours a week, and full-time if they clock higher hours.
Uber, for its part, classifies drivers as "casual drivers" if they operate below 10 hours, part-time if below 40, and full-time if above 40.
The LTFRB bared the plan a day after its second technical working group meeting with Grab and Uber on Wednesday, July 26. On Wednesday, the agency announced that it ordered the deactivation of drivers who registered with Grab and Uber after June 30, 2017.
Lizada said they hope to be done with the meetings by September 2017, and produce memorandum circulars to fix the regulation deadlock. After that, the LTFRB plans to consult with Congress for a comprehensive law regulating the ride-hailing services.
There are bills filed in both houses of Congress seeking to regulate TNVS providers.
The transport network companies had earlier filed motions for reconsideration to delay the implementation of the LTFRB's order issued last July 7, which instructed both TNCs to purge drivers without adequate documents. – Rappler.com
Support for the Yucca Mountain project is strong among both Republicans and Democrats in the House. But the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, has promised supporters back home that it is dead.
Even if a national consensus were to emerge to revive the Yucca Mountain plan, it could not receive nuclear waste for at least 10 years, proponents acknowledge.
Before President Obama pulled the plug on Yucca Mountain, officials estimated that it would take five years to authorize construction and six years after that before the site was ready to accept fuel, said Brian O'Connell, a nuclear waste specialist at the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners.
For the site to begin accepting fuel within 10 years, “everything would have to be green lights,” they said. “And you could anticipate the instinct will be to go more slowly because of what happened in Japan.”
Scientists and engineers suggest an interim fix is to store more spent fuel in dry casks, already a practice at many plants, although moving them to a remote central site would be better. Some of the casks are at retired or torn down reactor sites and require a high level of security.
South Carolina and Washington State , meanwhile, have sued the federal government, arguing that it has an obligation to accept the waste, some of which comes from the manufacture of nuclear weapons. On Tuesday, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia heard oral arguments in one case.
The not-in-my-backyard politics of nuclear waste have changed in recent decades. Congress chose Yucca Mountain over sites in Texas and Washington in 1987, when those two states were ascendant in the Capitol. The House speaker, Jim Wright, was a Texan, and so was the vice president, George Bush. The House majority leader, Thomas S. Foley, was from Washington State. Mr. Reid was a mere first-year student senator.

Beyond the objections of Mr. Reid's constituents to opening Yucca Mountain, it is not clear that it is a good place to bury nuclear waste. One problem is that the courts have interpreted federal law as requiring the Energy Department to show that the waste can be safely stored in canisters there for one million years. So far, the department has established only that it can contain the material for 10,000 years.
Examination of the mountain has also shown that if the fuel canisters degrade in millenniums to come, water would spread the waste faster than initially thought. Formed from volcanic material, the mountain's rock was assumed to be barely permeable, but it has cracks through which water travels rapidly. In addition, the United States has about 72,000 tons of spent fuel from civilian sites and many tons of military waste — more than Yucca could hold under current laws.
In moving to withdraw the license application for the site last year, President Obama appointed a special panel to explore nuclear waste disposal, and a preliminary report is due in a few weeks.
The panel's members have not been asked to propose a specific site. Instead, they are examining issues like whether the spent fuel should be chemically recycled to recover plutonium produced in uranium-powered reactors for reuse, as it is in France and Japan. Another option is to develop a new class of reactors that would transmute nuclear waste into less troublesome materials.

It is also debating what procedure the United States should use in selecting a repository, which would be needed in any case. So far, the political wisdom has been that Congress should choose a community rather than bargain with localities, although that has been successfully done in some Scandinavian counties. In the United States, the selection process has led to gridlock and the scattering of the waste in numerous locations.
Even the federal government's decision to drop Yucca became a political thicket. When the Energy Department said in June that it wanted to withdraw its application, a panel of three administrative law judges said there was no provision in the law to do that, and it rejected the idea.
That ruling was automatically appealed to the full five-member Nuclear Regulatory Commission. One commission member recused themselves because of previous work on the Yucca Mountain issue, and the others seem to be deadlocked on whether the application can be withdrawn. A 2-to-2 vote would fail to override the three-judge panel, and its ruling would stand.
But Mr. Jaczko, the commission chairperson and a former member of Senator Reid's staff, has refused to bring the matter to a final vote, leaving it unsettled.
At the House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing at which Mr. Dingell spoke last week, Representative John Shimkus, Republican of Illinois , asked Mr. Jaczko why they had suspended the commission's work on judging the technical merits of the repository.

“There's no legal authority to close Yucca Mountain,” Mr. Shimkus said, adding that federal law required the commission to judge the license application.
Mr. Jaczko replied that they had acted within their authority as chairperson. Mr. Shimkus countered, “You better be double-checking your facts, because we're not through with this debate on legal authority, and I hope you're well prepared.”
Utility companies have complained about the Yucca decision, too — but not too loudly because they do not want the lack of a long-term policy to interfere with the potential construction of new reactors or their ability to operate the 104 that are now running. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission recently ruled that it was confident that waste could be stored for decades in dry casks, a policy shift that could help advance the construction of new reactors.
For now, the only national consensus about nuclear waste — that utilities should pay one-tenth of a cent for every kilowatt-hour that their reactors generate into a federal waste fund — is also threatened. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners is suing to end the fee, arguing that it is not needed to support the waste program because Yucca Mountains has been shelved.
Even if the repository were to open, said Robert Alvarez, a former Energy Department official, the challenge would be to move spent fuel faster than it is produced. “Even if they had the ribbon-cutting ceremony today, it will take decades to move the current inventory into a repository,” they said. “By that time, we'll have a comparable amount sitting in pools.”
They and others support expanding the use of dry casks. Workers lower a steel box into the spent fuel pool, place the fuel inside it, drain the box of liquid and then pump it full of an inert gas to prevent rust. The box is then placed in a concrete-and-steel sleeve on a concrete pad surrounded by concertina wire and closed-circuit cameras, resembling a basketball court at a maximum-security prison.
The dry casks require no mechanical cooling because the fuel placed inside them has cooled enough so that the simple circulation of air outside of the steel box will keep the temperature well below the fuel's melting point.
Critics have said that the boxes could become terrorist targets. The nuclear industry maintains that even if a cask were breached, the worst case would be the scattering of some dry radioactive ceramic pellets.
Yet so far the industry has resisted expanded use of dry casks despite a National Academy of Sciences study recommending their use. And even if that resistance disappeared, some fuel has to stay in the pool for several years after it is taken from the reactor, until the heat generation is so small that the fuel will not melt inside a dry cask.
I wanted to join up and give something back to the country that helped me so much Marine Arben Islami, Royal Marines Reserves
They adapted to British life but never forgot where they came from or their encounters with the Royal Marines. So strong was the pull that at the age of 28 they have just passed out and can proudly wear the green beret – the fulfilment of a boyhood dream.
Mne Islami said: "As children we saw the marines in Kosovo and I knew I wanted to be one of them. Then I fled and came to the UK. I didn't have the intention at the time as I was only just a young kid but when I got indefinite leave to stay here and became British I knew I had to.
“I wanted to join up and give something back to the country that helped me so much.”
True to their word, Arben joined the 350-year-old Corps the day after they were granted British citizenship in July 2012.
After 10 weeks of training at the Commando Training Centre in Lympstone they got engaged, and decided to change route, becoming a Royal Marines Reservist where they continued their journey to become a commando.
Eighteen months after they first started training, Arben undertook the notoriously difficult Commando Course. Passing a series of gruelling exercises, they then successfully completed the four Commando tests which culminate in a 30 mile speed march across Dartmoor.
Driven on by war torn memories and a strong will to succeed they crossed the finish line having achieved their ultimate goal – they had become a marine.
On being awarded their green beret, the modest bricklayer, said: “I'm very honoured to be part of the Corps, and I just can't express my happiness enough. I always knew it was going to be a challenge, that I would be pushed to my limits and that is why I wanted to join.
“It is a huge privilege, particularly coming from another country, to join the Royal Marines because they are one of the best forces in the world.”
Mne Islami will now resume their work as a bricklayer and continue to train with the Royal Marines Reserves. They also hope to deploy with 3 Commando Brigades in the future.
Dempsey lines up loan return to struggling Fulham during MLS off-season
Fulham are pinning their hopes of avoiding relegation on re-signing former fans' favourite Clint Dempsey.
The American, 30, was in London on Wednesday trying to finalise a two-month loan deal at Craven Cottage during the Major League Soccer off-season.
Dempsey, who joined the Seattle Sounders last summer, favours a return to the Premier League over spending January and February training with their USA team-mates in Brazil and Southern California.
Return: Clint Dempsey is set to rejoin Fulham on loan during the MLS off-season
The forward negotiated a clause in their contract with the Sounders to allow them to go on loan from January 1 until the end of February, with general manager Adrian Hanauer admitting the move looks likely.
The MLS season ended in late October and does not start again until March 8.
Dempsey joined Fulham from New England Revolution in January 2007 and scored 50 Premier League goals in five-and-a-half years before agitating for a move in the summer of 2012. They joined Tottenham for £6million, spending a year at White Hart Lane — but not before Fulham had accused Liverpool of tapping them up.
West Ham have also expressed an interest in signing Dempsey but Fulham, with whom they reached the 2010 Europa League final, is thought to be their preferred destination.
The forward's versatility, work ethic and eye for goal could play a crucial role in the club's relegation fight, particularly if Dimitar Berbatov forces a move in January.
Fans' favourite: Dempsey was a popular figure during their time at Craven Cottage
“Alex Cross” is Tyler Perry's attempt at starring in a serious movie outside of their normal comfort zone. Now you won't see them running around in drag sporting their familiar Madea getup, but there are times in “Alex Cross” where that might have made things more interesting. Now to be fair, this movie is nowhere near as unbearable as I was anticipating and there are some pretty good moments. But in the end this is all to familiar material and the movie never does anything to set itself apart. In other words we've seen this all before.
Tyler Perry isn't the first actor to portray Alex Cross, the lead character from James Patterson's series of novels. Morgan Freeman took on the role in 1997 with “Kiss the Girls” and in 2001 with “Along Came a Spider”. Not only are these two films considerably different than this new vision, but the Alex Cross character undergoes a hefty transformation as well. He's still a police detective and forensic psychologist but here he's more open to mixing hand-to-hand combat and theirs sawed off shotgun to their Sherlock Holmesesque skills of deduction.
Life is good for Alex. They have a beautiful wife, two lovely children, and one on the way. He's also been offered a cushiony FBI desks job that pays a lot more money and would allow them to spend more time with their family. But isn't it just like a sadistic serial killer to make things more complicated. Alex is called to a high-profile crime scene with their partner and lifelong friend Tommy (Edward Burns). They connect the murder to a man they call Picasso. He's played by an almost emaciated Matthew Fox sporting a shaved head and noticeably fake tattoos. As with all of these movies, Alex and company set out to stop Picasso by picking through clues and getting to the next victim before the killer does. Like I said, it's pretty familiar material.
“Alex Cross” runs the gamut from a crime drama to a revenge thriller. As the movie continues things get grislier to the point of seriously pushing the bounds of its PG-13 rating. Considering the movie does focus on a brutal serial killer and the hunt to find him, it's not unreasonable to expect some rather gruesome content. But while “Alex Cross” does stretch the PG-13 rating, it seems shackled by it as well. I kept feeling as if the movie wanted to be darker, grimmer, and a bit more shocking than it was. I don't think that would transform this into a great film but I can see where it would provide an edge that would help it overall.
But back to one of the bigger questions surrounding the movie. Was Tyler Perry able to pull this off? Let me just say that they were surprisingly adequate but nothing extraordinary or memorable. And while there were no egregious flaws in their performance, there are several times where they overplay a scene and other times where their stale line-reading is a distraction. It's interesting that Idris Elba was initially cast for the part and I can't help thinking they would be a better choice. But as for Perry, I was expecting a lot worse.
Edward Burns probably gives the best performance of the movie even though some of the lines he's given are pretty lame. And then there's Matthew Fox. Their performance is a tough one to peg. There are a few scenes, particularly when he's wrestling with threatening dialogue, where he's not that convincing. But overall I do think they pull it off mainly because they sells ‘crazy' pretty well through the combination of their unusual appearance and their moral apathy. But perhaps the most jarring performance comes from John McGinley as Alex Cross' police captain. He's terribly miscast and every line they say is ridiculously overdone. Their performance stands out but for all the wrong reasons.
“Alex Cross” isn't the worst movie out there. Its biggest problem is that is just not memorable enough to overcome its clear flaws. Most of the movie features too much that we've seen before and the ending feels like a cheap cop out. And while Tyler Perry may not have been the worst choice, I think it's obvious they aren't the best choice. All of this contributes to “Alex Cross” being pretty forgetful. Some ingredients are there for what could've been a good movie. But the ingredients themselves don't equal a fine dish. That's certainly the case here.
VERDICT – 2 STARS
While the ban is only temporary, it could be extended or perhaps made permanent.
Chamonix, the French Alpine town renowned for extreme sports, has placed a six-month ban on wingsuit flying after the sport's deadliest year.
The risky sport, which sees participants ‘fly' at speeds over 100 mph down mountains, skimming the jagged rocks below, has resulted in 35 fatalities to date. Five thrill seekers have already died in the past year.
Chamonix mayor, Eric Fournier, announced the temporary ban earlier this month, after the professional Russian wingsuit jumper, Ratmir Nigimyanov, crashed into a chalet and was killed.
The experienced BASE- jumper, who's won several international competitions, launched their wingsuit from the Aiguille du Midi, 12,605 feet above the town. Shortly after take-off, witnesses reported seeing their body hurtling through the air at a tremendous speed. After hitting a cliff just above town, they crashed into the side of a three-story chalet.
For the many experienced BASE jumpers, around the world, the latest announcement marks a grim chapter for the sport. Many continue to enjoy this wild sport and capture the heart wrenching action on camera.
While the ban is only temporary, it could be extended or perhaps made permanent. At present, the ban does not appear to affect standard BASE jumping, without a wingsuit, though.

New Zealand scientists have found a "perfectly preserved" 106-year-old fruitcake in a remote Antarctic hut, Antarctic Heritage Trust (AHT) said Thursday.
The delicacy, made by British cake makers Huntley and Palmers, was still wrapped in paper and encased in the remains of a tin-plated iron alloy tin, the researchers at the New Zealand-based charity said.
"Finding such a perfectly preserved fruitcake in amongst the last handful of unidentified and severely corroded tins was quite a surprise," programme manager Lizzie Meek said.
Them team believe that the cake, found on a shelf in a hut in Cape Adare, belonged to Robert Falcon Scott's northern party from 1911.
According to Meek, the cake was "ideal high-energy food for Antarctic conditions, and is still a favorite item on modern trips to the Ice."
The huts were the first buildings in Antarctica and are the only examples left of humanity's first building on any continent. They were built by Norwegian Carsten Borchgrevink's expedition in 1899 and later used by Scott's party in 1911.
"The tin was in poor condition, [but] the cake itself looked and smelt (almost) edible," the AHT said on its website, adding that the cake was "in excellent condition."
However, it will remain a mystery as to what the century-old sweet tastes like as it is unethical for conservators to taste-test their finds, Meek told Newshub.
"The fruit cake will go back to where it came from on a shelf in the hut and I guess the story is out there and visitors to the site will be able to see that tin," they said.
A team from the Canterbury Museum in Christchurch has recently finished a 14-month project conserving almost 1,500 artifacts from Cape Adare.
As promised earlier this summer, mobile video calling app Tango has finally made it to the PC. Today, a year after its launch on iOS and Android, Tango is now available for Windows desktop computers (XP, Vista and Windows 7). The company says a Mac version will be available later this year.
As with the mobile product, the new PC version is designed to be easy to use. There is no login or password required. Instead, you just enter in your phone number and email address to get started. For existing Tango users, the PC app automatically populates your address book with your Tango contacts – that is, the folks the app originally discovered in your phone's contact list upon first install. You can also invite people to join Tango from the new PC app via SMS or email.
Although we didn't have much opportunity to experiment with the app in its pre-launch state, there is one major, noticeable difference between it and Skype: it looks like a giant iPhone.
Tango has consistently focused on having a minimalist feature set, and the PC app is no different. At launch, there aren't advanced options like group calling, text chat, file sharing options or credits to purchase. Says Tango Co-founder Eric Setton, of those, text chat would be “great to have” in the future, but it's not something that's immediately planned. As for group calling, Tango thinks of that as more of a business-grade feature, and, given its focus on the consumer, is not interested in including it at this time, either.
What is planned for the near future, though, is a premium level of service. Setton says Tango's voice and video calling will always be free but some yet-to-be announced paid services will be made available later this year as optional add-ons. Tango will not charge for usage or include advertising, Setton confirms, but the company is confident that it can turn a percentage of its 23 million users into paying customers.
In July, the company took in $42 million in series B financing led by Draper Fisher Jurvetson, the same VC firm that first invested in Skype. Angel investors Len Blavatnik and Alex Zubillaga also participated. This funding was on top of the $14 million Tango already had in venture capital.
Windows was chosen as the third platform for Tango based on its size (1.5 billion PC's worldwide) in addition to being the number one feature request from Tango users. To date, Setton says Tango's adoption has followed smartphone trends with 50% of its user base in the U.S. and the developed markets in Asia, Europe and the Middle East. The rapidly growing service is now adding 70,000 to 80,000 new members daily, with 75% of its sign-ups coming through word-of-mouth recommendations. With Tango's Windows launch, those numbers should increase yet again.
You can grab the new Tango PC app from the company's website here.
Aziz Ansari has been nominated for a Golden Globe and received countless accolades for their Netflix series, Master of None. As a fellow Indian Muslim stand-up comic, actor and writer, I knew I had to see the series breaking barriers in diversity and storytelling.
I grew up admiring Saturday Night Live and the talented stand-up comics invited to perform on the Tonight Show. Of course, there were no South Asians on the show then. The only times I remember Indians on Saturday Night Live: Julia Louis-Dreyfus wore a sari to portray an Indian woman at the United Nations in a spoof of Donahue; and, in a more egregious instance, the character of Rajeev Vindaloo, played by Christopher Guest wearing brown makeup, speaking in an Indian accent, and uttering “chocolate babies” for no reason to great howls.
Fast forward to today: Mindy Kaling, Priyanka Chopra, Kal Penn, Irrfan Khan, Anupam Kher, Aasif Mandvi, Anil Kapoor…the list of South Asian stars on television and in film keeps growing. Muslims, in particular, show up more now because of post-9/11 shows like Homeland and 24.
I heard Aziz Ansari and their Master of None co-creator, Alan Yang, interviewed on NPR's Fresh Air about how they wanted to represent first-generation Asian-American voices. I read their essay in the New York Times and grew excited to see the risks they would take since “no one really cares” and this would be their show.
* * *
I am not the first person to notice that their character is not presented as Muslim. When I pointed that out on Facebook, a friend wrote, “I prefer the show without religion.” Why does the show have to be about religion, because the character has a faith other than Christianity?
Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld created characters of Jewish heritage, which never hid their background and occasionally covered Jewish issues. Larry David considers themselves an atheist, like Ansari, but still maintained a Jewish identity for their on-screen persona. I doubt anyone thinks of Curb Your Enthusiasm or Seinfeld as being solely Jewish shows. Jewish life, culture and Yiddish made appearances, but the characters and story lines went beyond that.
“I could not help but note the irony of their refusal to cave to Hollywood norms, while simultaneously erasing a part of their heritage.”
In the “Indians on TV” episode of Master of None, Ansari's character clearly wants to maintain their authenticity by not simply “doing the accent” in auditions. I could not help but note the irony of their refusal to cave to Hollywood norms, while simultaneously erasing a part of their heritage. Ansari explored topics like immigrant parents, minorities on television, sexual harassment and marriage. Growing up Muslim in the South or Muslim life post-9/11 would have been a great addition to the show in light of the current landscape.
In that same Facebook thread, someone asked me if Aziz Ansari had Muslim heritage. Perhaps non-Muslims think every Muslim is named “Muhammad,” “Abdul,” or “Syed.” I thought their background would be evident after Ansari picked a Twitter fight with Rupert Murdoch after the latter held all “Moslems” accountable for the ”growing jihadist cancer.” For many, this was an activist and Muslim defender side of Ansari that few knew.
* * *
Ansari's character on the show is named “Dev Shah.” Time picked Dev Shah as one of the most influential fictional characters of 2015. “Dev” is a masculine Sanskrit name that means “divine” or “god.” While the last name, “Shah,” can be found in Iran as well as India, coupled with that first name, the man is most likely a Hindu from the Indian state of Gujarat. (Unfortunately, that state has witnessed some of the worst sectarian violence India has ever seen.)
To Muslims, their real name has religious and historical significance. The name “Aziz” means “powerful” in Arabic and is one of the 99 names of Allah. “Ansari” refers to a group of “helpers” or “Ansar” that accompanied Prophet Muhammad on their migration from Makkah to Medinah.
When I first heard their name, I knew they had a Muslim background right away. However, most Americans likely have no context for either “Dev” or “Aziz,” much less Islamic or Indian political history. As Ansari wrote, no one cares.
“Eponymous shows worked for Roseanne Barr, Jerry Seinfeld, Larry David, Ray Romano and Louis CK, to cite a few examples.”
Truth: you can be a Muslim and be named Tom or Larry or Jerry. A name does not make you Muslim. However, if no one cares, why go out of your way to change it? Why didn't they just name their character “Aziz?” Eponymous shows worked for Roseanne Barr, Jerry Seinfeld, Larry David, Ray Romano and Louis CK, to cite a few examples.
I read that Aziz Ansari's parents are Muslim, but they consider themselves an atheist. Full disclosure: I am married to an atheist raised as a Muslim. Like Ansari's alter ego, they have liberal political leanings and does not hew to any religious-based restrictions on food and drink. They dated non-Indians and non-Muslims for most of their life. They have an Arabic name given to them by their Muslim parents. While they have rejected religious practice and belief, they would not choose another name merely to distance themselves from Islam.
Ansari and my husband do not constitute the entirety of the “Muslim atheist” population. Diversity exists in the Muslim world, more than most realize.
* * *
Like Ansari, I appear to be very Americanized. I speak Midwestern English, I dress in Western clothes without covering my hair, and my skin tone and hair often have me confused for a Latina. I do not have the stereotypical Muslim look and could “pass.”
However, my name is Sameena Fatima Mustafa, a completely Arabic name. “Fatima” is the name of the Prophet Muhammad's daughter, and “Mustafa” is the closest they had to a surname. Those two names are very common in the Muslim world. Every time I travel, I am either detained or screened again. Randomly selected, every time.
As a performer, I am confronted with prejudice and Islamophobia regularly. I have had people literally walk out when I say I am a Muslim. When I first started stand-up, I worried about how my jokes about Indians and Muslims could be feeding stereotypes. I even briefly used my mother's maiden name, Sultana, as a stage name due to my conservative workplace. It did not take too long for me to realize that being authentic, even at some perceived personal risk, and dropping that cover would sharpen my voice and connection to my audience.
“It did not take too long for me to realize that being authentic, even at some perceived personal risk, and dropping that cover would sharpen my voice and connection to my audience.”
Perhaps Ansari is conflicted like me and other first-generation children of immigrants. South Asian identity confusion is so ubiquitous that it has its own acronym: ABCD (“American Born Confused Desi” where “Desi” means South Asian). We see ourselves as American and Desi, but struggle to assimilate in either world.
As a Muslim, my feeling of otherness started before and deepened since 9/11. During the Iran hostage crisis, Americans saw daily images of angry, threatening Muslims on television. A few years later, I felt compelled to assure my classmates that I would not come to class dressed in fatigues with a semi-automatic weapon. They laughed nervously, but I know they had no counterpoint to the stories told night after night.
If non-Muslim Americans, especially those who work in airport screening and immigration, saw Muslims as relatable (read: not a terrorist or terror suspect) more often, that could shift the dialogue and escalation of suspicion and hatred occurring today. Donald Trump can get away with saying total falsehoods about Muslims and stoking fears, because very few Americans actually know or interact with a Muslim.
Hopefully, with a few positive portrayals, we will get to a point where we can see Muslims on a show that has nothing to do with the Middle East or terrorism. Maybe they could be ordinary Americans with a penchant for pasta and acting with a diverse group of friends and even (gasp!) a significant other who is not Muslim. I would love the opportunity to produce a show like that one day myself.
In the meantime, I have a message for Aziz Ansari: I care.

Sameena Mustafa is a published author, actor, stand-up comedian, and co-founder of Simmer Brown, a South Asian comedy collective, in Chicago.
It was a very interesting story but the plot saddened me a lot, as it is a very crude image of living in a world where status and money play a very important role in the life of the villagers when it comes to choosing their future couple and that means that in many cases they themselves are dissatisfied with the destiny they have forged for themselves and are forced to take extreme measures to get rid of it, or at least it was my first impression then it turns out to be a whole new reason for the harsh actions that were taken in the beggining and then it was imposible to let go of this book, i just hope the author take their time to properly explain the plot, sometimes it feels rushed. I received this as an ARC and decided to leave a review.
US, EU, Canada, Japan, Australia & Others To Sign ACTA This Weekend, Despite Legal Concerns
from the failure dept
Despite serious Constitutional concerns in the US, and significant legal questions in the EU , it appears that the US and the EU, along with most of the other participants in the ACTA negotiations are planning to sign ACTA this weekend in Japan. In the US, this may very well lead to a Constitutional challenge . President Obama, via the USTR, is ignoring the Senate's oversight concerning treaties, by pretending ACTA is not a treaty, but rather an "executive agreement." Pretty much everyone else agrees that ACTA is a binding treaty -- in fact, EU negotiators have been quite vocal on that point.But even if this is considered "an executive agreement," the President does not have the authority to sign an executive agreement concerning intellectual property issues. Executive agreements can only be signed if they cover issues solely under the President's mandate. But intellectual property issues areunder Congress's mandate, and nowhere in the Constitution is the President given a mandate over IP issues. This is a clear end-run around Congress, and seems likely to be unconstitutional.What I really don't get is why they're making such an end-run. As we've seen with things like PROTECT IP, most of the Senate seems to have no problem propping up the entertainment industry's legacy players with bogus laws and "greater enforcement." It seems likely that ACTA would probably sail through the Senate with little problem. But the administration seems to not even want to have the slightest debate on the topic -- which is greatly troubling, considering that the USTR negotiated the agreement in near total secrecy, refusing to allow public comment or debate (outside of leaks which it tried to block) until after the document was done.The others that are listed as planning to sign the document are Japan, Australia, Canada, South Korea, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore and Switzerland. Basically all the countries who took part in the negotiations. The fact that Mexico is on that list is interesting, given that the Mexican Congress hastold the Mexican President that it will not ratify ACTA , and made it clear that Mexico needs Congress to ratify ACTA to have it go into effect. In other words, it sounds like Mexico is facing a similar executive run-around as in the US.It's pretty amazing. This isn't even just about Presidents doing an end-run around the public, but around their own legislatures. And for what? A bailout of some legacy entertainment industry players who are unwilling to adapt.

The plague of empty seats which has befallen the National Football League reached biblical proportions this week, as teams continued to find it hard to fill stadiums.
Naturally, a large number of players also continued their anti-American protests during the playing of the national anthem as Week 14 rolled into stadiums everywhere. And as a result, ticket prices are plummeting.
The league is having such a tough time finding fans to fill seats that some tickets are selling for the unheard of price of three dollars a seat, Breitbart Sports reported on Sunday. In many cases tickets are selling for prices lower than the cost of buying a beer or a hot dog in most stadiums!
But even at these near give-away prices, photos of empty stadiums are still chocking social media as the league's Week 14 begins.
While the Green Bay Packers downed the Cleveland Browns in a 27-21 final, not many fans were around to see the loss at FirstEnergy Stadium. A sea of empty bright orange seats filled the stadium:

Also in the Buckeye State, the Cincinnati Bengals got slammed 33-7 by the Chicago Bears, but fans stayed away in droves. One fan even noted ticket prices were down to $18 a seat.

But Cincinnati may have fared better than the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Raymond Stadium when the Detroit Lions came to town to beat the Bucs 24-21. There seemed like more empty red seats than fans in Florida.

The iconic guitar is over 64 years old
The Gibson Les Paul was first sold in 1952 and was named after the guitarist, Les Paul himself.
Although originally a failure, with guitarists favouring the Gibson SG at the time, the Les Paul created its own legacy for itself, with countless guitarists using the instrument for their work.
Talking about the guitar, Paul McCartney said, “the thing about Les Paul guitars is that they're beautiful guitars. That's due to Les's knowledge of the instrument and due to their technical knowledge. So he, together with Gibson, developed this amazing guitar. For me, it's just beautiful to play. It's a classic. One of the ones I have is 50 years old, so it's a great antique as well as being a classic. It plays great, and I think that's due to Les's expertise. When you pick it up you fall in love with it.”
It truly became an iconic guitar in its own right, with its hollow sound providing for screeching solos, grungy chords and chunky riffs. As a result, blues heroes such as Muddy Waters used the guitar for its thick tone, whilst heavier guitarists such as Slash used the guitar their ferocious guitar solos.
The civil rights movement of the 1960's have left many people with the belief that the slave trade was exclusively a European/USA phenomenon and only evil white people were to blame for it. This is a simplistic scenario that hardly reflects the facts.
Thousands of records of transactions are available on a CDROM prepared by Harvard University and several comprehensive books have been published recently on the origins of modern slavery (namely, Hugh Thomas' The Slave Trade and Robin Blackburn's The Making Of New World Slavery) that shed new light on centuries of slave trading.
What these records show is that the modern slave trade flourished in the early middle ages, as early as 869, especially between Muslim traders and western African kingdoms. For moralists, the most important aspect of that trade should be that Muslims were selling goods to the African kingdoms and the African kingdoms were paying with their own people. In most instances, no violence was necessary to obtain those slaves. Contrary to legends and novels and Hollywood movies, the white traders did not need to savagely kill entire tribes in order to exact their tribute in slaves. All they needed to do is bring goods that appealed to the kings of those tribes. The kings would gladly sell their own subjects. (Of course, this neither condones the white traders who bought the slaves nor deny that many white traders still committed atrocities to maximize their business).
This explains why slavery became "black". Ancient slavery, e.g. under the Roman empire, would not discriminate: slaves were both white and black (so were Emperors and Popes). In the middle ages, all European countries outlawed slavery (of course, hypocritical Christian nations retained countless "civilized" ways to enslave their citizens, but that's another story), whereas the African kingdoms happily continued in their trade. Therefore, only colored people could be slaves, and that is how the stereotype for African-American slavery was born. It was not based on an ancestral hatred of blacks by whites, but simply on the fact that blacks were the only ones selling slaves, and they were selling people of their own race. (To be precise, Christians were also selling Muslim slaves captured in war, and Muslims were selling Christian slaves captured in war, but neither the Christians of Europe nor the Muslims of Africa and the Middle East were selling their own people).
Then the Muslim trade of African slaves declined rapidly when Arab domination was reduced by the emerging European powers. (Note: Arabs continued to capture and sell slaves, but mostly in the Mediterranean. In fact, Robert Davis estimates that 1.25 million European Christians were enslaved by the "barbary states" of northern Africa. As late as 1801 the USA bombed Morocco, Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli precisely to stop that Arab slave trade of Christians. The rate of mortality of those Christian slaves in the Islamic world was roughly the same as the mortality rate in the Atlantic slave trade of the same period.)
Christians took over in black Africa, though. The first ones were the Portuguese, who, applying an idea that originally developed in Italian seatrading cities, and often using Italian venture capital, started exploiting sub-Saharan slaves in the 1440s to support the economy of the sugar plantations (mainly for their own African colonies of Sao Tome and Madeira).
The Dutch were the first, apparently, to import black slaves into North America, but black slaves had already been employed all over the world, including South and Central America. We tend to focus on what happened in North America because the USA would eventually fight a war over slavery (and it's in the USA that large sectors of the population would start condemning slavery, contrary to the indifference that Muslims and most Europeans showed towards it).
Even after Europeans began transporting black slaves to America, most trade was just that: "trade". In most instances, the Europeans did not need to use any force to get those slaves. The slaves were "sold" more or less legally by their (black) owners. Scholars estimate that about 12,000,000 Africans were sold by Africans to Europeans (most of them before 1776, when the USA wasn't yet born) and 17,000,000 were sold to Arabs. The legends of European mercenaries capturing free people in the jungle are mostly just that: legends. A few white mercenaries certainly stormed peaceful tribes and committed terrible crimes, but that was not the norm. There was no need to risk their lives, so most of them didn't: they simply purchased (black) people.
As an African-American scholar (Nathan Huggins) has written, the "identity" of black Africans is largely a white invention: sub-Saharan Africans never felt like they were one people, they felt (and still feel) that they belonged to different tribes. The distinctions of tribe were far stronger than the distinctions of race.
Everything else is true: millions of slaves died on ships and of diseases, millions of blacks worked for free to allow the Western economies to prosper, and the economic interests in slavery became so strong that the southern states of the United States opposed repealing it. But those millions of slaves were just one of the many instances of mass exploitation: the industrial revolution was exported to the USA by enterpreuners exploiting millions of poor immigrants from Europe. The fate of those immigrants was not much better than the fate of the slaves in the South. As a matter of fact, many slaves enjoyed far better living conditions in the southern plantations than European immigrants in the industrial cities (which were sometimes comparable to concentration camps). It is not a coincidence that slavery was abolished at a time when millions of European and Chinese immigrants provided the same kind of cheap labor.
It is also fair to say that, while everybody tolerated it, very few whites practiced slavery: in 1860 there were 385,000 USA citizens who owned slaves, or about 1.4% of the white population (there were 27 million whites in the USA). That percentage was zero in the states that did not allow slavery (only 8 million of the 27 million whites lived in states that allowed slavery). Incidentally, in 1830 about 25% of South Carolina's free Negro slave masters (blacks who had been freed and owned black slaves) owned 10 or more slaves: that is a much higher percentage (ten times more) than the number of white slave owners. Thus slave owners were a tiny minority (1.4%) and it was not only whites: it was just about anybody who could, including blacks themselves.
Moral opposition to slavery became widespread even before Lincoln, and throughout Europe. On the other hand, opposition to slavery was never particularly strong in Africa itself, where slavery is slowly being eradicated only in our times. One can suspect that slavery would have remained common in most African kingdoms until this day: what crushed slavery in Africa was that all those African kingdoms became colonies of western European countries that (for one reason or another) eventually decided to outlaw slavery. When, in the 1960s, those African colonies regained their independence, numerous cases of slavery resurfaced. And countless African dictators behaved in a way that makes a slave owner look like a saint. Given the evidence that this kind of slavery was practiced by some Africans before it was practiced by some North Americans, that it was abolished by all white nations and not by some Africans, and that some Africans resumed it the moment they could, it is a bit unfair that Hollywood movies and novels keep blaming the USA but never blame, say, Ghana or the Congo.
The more we study it, the less blame we have to put on the USA for the slave trade with black Africa: it was pioneered by the Arabs, its economic mechanism was invented by the Italians and the Portuguese, it was mostly run by western Europeans, and it was conducted with the full cooperation of many African kings. The USA fostered free criticism of the phenomenon: for a long time no such criticism was allowed in the Muslim and Christian nations that started trading goods for slaves, and no such criticism was allowed in the African nations that started selling their own people (and, even today, slavery is a taboo subject in the Arab world).
Today it is politically correct to blame some European empires and the USA for slavery (forgetting that it was practiced by everybody since prehistoric times). But I rarely read the other side of the story: that the nations who were the first to develop a repulsion for slavery and eventually abolish slavery were precisely those countries (especially Britain and the USA). In 1787 the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade was founded in England: it was the first society anywhere in the world opposed to slavery. In 1792 English prime minister William Pitt called publicly for the end of the slave trade: it was the first time in history (anywhere in the world) that the ruler of a country had called for the abolition of slavery. No African king and emperor had ever done so. As Dinesh D'Souza wrote, "What is uniquely Western is not slavery but the movement to abolish slavery".
Of course, what was also (horribly) unique about the Western slave trade is the scale (the millions shipped to another continent in a relatively short period of time), and, of course, that it eventually became a racist affair, discriminating blacks, whereas previous slave trades had not discriminated based on the color of the skin. What is unique about the USA, in particular, is the unfair treatment that blacks received AFTER emancipation (which is, after all, the real source of the whole controversy, because, otherwise, just about everybody on this planet can claim to be the descendant of an ancient slave).
That does not mean that western slave traders were justified in what they did, but placing all the blame on them is a way to absolve all the others.
Also, it is worth noting that the death rate among the white crews of the slave ships (20-25%) was higher than the rate among black slaves (15%) because slaves were more valuable than sailors; but nobody has written books and filmed epics about those sailors (often unwillingly enrolled or even kidnapped in ports around Europe when they were drunk).
To this day, too many Africans, Arabs and Europeans believe that the African slave trade was an aberration of the USA, not their own invention.
By the time the slave trade was abolished in the West, there were many more slaves in Africa (black slaves of black owners) than in the Americas.

Leonard Ray Dawson (born June 20, 1935) is a former American football quarterback and a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. They played 19 seasons for three professional teams, the last 14 seasons with the Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs, and played college football at Purdue University.
Dawson led the Texans/Chiefs to three American Football League Championships (1962, 1966, 1969), and a victory in Super Bowl IV over the Minnesota Vikings, for which they won the game's MVP award. Dawson retired from professional football after the 1975 season,[1] and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1987.  They are former sports director at KMBC-TV in Kansas City and former color analyst for the Chiefs Radio Network. Dawson owned the Chiefs single season passing touchdown record which they set in 1964 with 30 touchdowns. The record stood until November 11, 2018 when Patrick Mahomes threw their 31st touchdown of the 2018 season.
Early life [ edit ]
Dawson was the ninth of 11 children[2] of Ohio native James and England-born Annie Dawson.[3] They attended Alliance High School in Alliance, Ohio.[4] They were MVP of the football team and was named outstanding Ohio back of the year by the International News Service. A three-sport athlete, Dawson set school records in football and in basketball, and was the first athlete in 13 years to be named first-team all-state in both sports during the same year.[5]
College career [ edit ]
During the recruiting process, Dawson had to choose between Ohio State University in Columbus and Purdue University in Indiana. While they were reluctant to take over Woody Hayes' split-T offense with the Buckeyes, the true reason for their selection of Purdue stemmed from the chemistry they had established with a Boilermaker assistant coach, Hank Stram, beginning a friendship that would last for more than a half century. During three seasons with the Boilermakers, Dawson threw for over 3,000 yards, leading the Big Ten Conference in that category during each campaign. While at Purdue, Dawson was initiated into the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity.[6]
As a sophomore in 1954, Dawson put together an outstanding first season as the NCAA's leader in pass efficiency, while also playing defense and serving as the Boilermaker kicker. Blessed with a strong offensive line, they threw four touchdown passes in a 31-0 victory over the University of Missouri, then later engineered a huge upset of the University of Notre Dame, which had entered the contest on a 13-game winning streak.[6]
Professional career [ edit ]
Pittsburgh Steelers [ edit ]
Despite being a first round pick in the 1957 NFL Draft, Dawson was unable to make an impact with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Following their rookie campaign, their status in the Steel City became even more tenuous when the Steelers acquired future Hall of Famer Bobby Layne early in the 1958 season.
Cleveland Browns [ edit ]
Dawson was then traded after to the Cleveland Browns on December 31, 1959.[7][8]
After encountering similar problems in battling Browns' quarterback Milt Plum,[9] Dawson was released,[8] having completed only 21 passes for 204 yards and two touchdowns in their five seasons of NFL play.
Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs [ edit ]
Dawson signed with the American Football League's Dallas Texans on June 30, 1962. The move reunited them with Stram, who was beginning their third year as the Texans' head coach.
In that first season, 1962, Dawson led the league in touchdowns and yards per attempt, and was The Sporting News' selection as the AFL MVP. They also led Dallas to the first of three league titles in a thrilling double-overtime victory over the two-time defending champion Oilers in Houston. Dawson ran a ball-control offense in the 20-17 win, and tossed a 28-yard touchdown pass to halfback Abner Haynes. The team then moved north to Kansas City and were renamed The Chiefs in 1963. Dawson was also selected by their peers as a Sporting News 1966 AFL All-League player.
A pinpoint passer, Dawson's mobility helped them flourish in Stram's "moving pocket" offense. They would win four AFL passing titles and was selected as a league All-Star six times, ending the 10-year run of the league as its highest-rated career passer. From 1962 to 1969, Dawson threw more touchdown passes (182) than any other professional football quarterback during that time. In 1966, Dawson led the Chiefs to an 11-2-1 record and a 31-7 win over the Buffalo Bills in the AFL championship game, earning their team the honor of representing the AFL in Super Bowl I, the first championship game between the AFL and their NFL rivals. The NFL champion Green Bay Packers won easily, 35-10, but Dawson had a fairly good performance in the game, completing 16 of 27 passes for 210 yards and one touchdown, with one interception.

While they threw for more than 2,000 yards in each of the previous seven campaigns, Dawson's 1969 season with Kansas City would be their most memorable by making a dramatic comeback from a knee injury suffered in the season's second game. The injury was first feared as season-ending, but after missing five games, Dawson went on to lead the Chiefs to road playoff victories over both the defending champion New York Jets and the Oakland Raiders.
They then capped their year with MVP accolades in Super Bowl IV, the last game ever played by an American Football League team. In the game, Dawson paced the Chiefs to a win over the NFL's heavily favored Minnesota Vikings by completing 12 of 17 passes for 142 yards and a touchdown, with 1 interception, and rushing for 11 yards. The performance was especially notable given the fact that they had been linked to a gambling investigation (by an unrelated gentleman who was named Donald Dawson) in the days leading up to the game.
Dawson pictured later in their career with the Chiefs
With the league's absorption into the National Football League in 1970, Dawson earned one final honor from the league as a member of the second team All-time All-AFL Team.  They are also a member of the Chiefs' Hall of Fame and the Pro Football Hall of Fame. They would earn Pro Bowl honors following the 1971 NFL season, then ended their career in 1975, having completed 2,136 of 3,741 passes for 28,711 yards and 239 touchdowns, with 181 interceptions. They also gained 1,293 rushing yards and 9 touchdowns on the ground. On November 1, 1970, the Chiefs led the Oakland Raiders 17-14 late in the fourth quarter. Facing third and long, a run by Dawson apparently sealed victory for the Chiefs, but as Dawson lay on the ground, they were speared by Raiders' defensive end Ben Davidson, who dove into Dawson with their helmet, provoking Chiefs' receiver Otis Taylor to attack Davidson. After a bench-clearing brawl, offsetting penalties were called, nullifying the first down under the rules in effect at that time. The Chiefs were obliged to punt, and the Raiders tied the game on a George Blanda field goal with eight seconds to play. Taylor's retaliation against Davidson not only cost the Chiefs a win, but Oakland won the AFC West with a season record of 8-4-2, while Kansas City finished 7-5-2 and out of the playoffs.
Retirement [ edit ]
Dawson announced their retirement in May 1976, shortly before turning 41.[1]
In 1966, while still playing for the Chiefs, Dawson became sports director at KMBC-TV in Kansas City. On March 16, 2009, Dawson announced they would step down from anchoring on a nightly basis. They will still report for KMBC during the Chiefs football season and will fill in when other anchors are on leave. From 1985 to 2017, Dawson was the color analyst for the Chiefs radio broadcast team.
From 1977 to 2001, they served as the host of HBO's Inside the NFL, and also worked as an analyst for NBC's AFC coverage from 1977-1982.
In 1985, Dawson began serving as a color commentator for the Chiefs Radio Network. They currently work with Mitch Holthus and former Chiefs player Kendall Gammon.
In 1987, Dawson was recognized for their play with the Chiefs with their induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
In 1996, Dawson was honored by their alma mater and inducted into Purdue's Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame.[10]

Nathan Deal has a plan. You see, too many businesses in Georgia are struggling to get competent applicants to fill their jobs. Governor Deal believes this is in a large part due to drug testing. On this point I agree. From there, Governor Deal not only derails but runs their train of thought clear off the rail system entirely.
You see, Nathan Deal's plan to increase the pool of qualified workers is not something logical, like say legalizing cannabis and recommending the removal of THC tests from drug tests. Nathan Deal's incredible plan is to offer “incentives” (money) to private employers to “notify” state officials when job applicants fail drug tests. From there, the plan gets a bit vague. However, what we do know is that Governor Deal would like to get the Department of Behavioral Health involved. The federal Department of Labor was also mentioned in Governor Deal's remarks.
This problem is nothing new for employers. Even FBI Director James Comey has stated “I have to hire a great work force to compete with those cyber criminals [in China] and some of those kids want to smoke weed on the way to the interview.”
You see, the solution is not to involve the government further into the affairs of private citizens, and it certainly is not to create a system where the state of Georgia is paying businesses to turn over applicants who have failed drug screens so that they may be forced into a bureaucratic nightmare of “drug treatment”. Workplace drug policy is actually quite simple from a business perspective. If you cannot tell that your employee is using drugs by their behavior in the workplace, then why does it matter?
Nathan Deal is absolutely ignoring the root cause of the issue, the same way they did while championing criminal justice reform. The problem being addressed here is not “too many people use drugs (see: marijuana) therefore we must help them!” the problem is “too many businesses are scaring away potentially valuable employees due to the fear of being drugged screened for a substance that doesn't affect their behavior in a notable way”.
Maybe the latter is where we should focus our energies Governor Deal, not the former. I'm sure a loophole in the tax code to allow Nathan Deal to pass along yet another tax break to big business isn't behind this at all. I also truly need to see about getting a sarcasm key installed on my laptop.

Something of pharmaceutical concern that the holistic/alternative medical community and the alternative press have been alleging for numerous years now, finally is being confirmed by a British Medical Journal paper published January 27, 2016.
Professor Peter C Gotzsche, MD, and several students published “Suicidality and aggression during antidepressant treatment: systematic review and meta-analyses based on clinical study reports” after reviewing and including 76 trials with 64,381 pages of clinical study reports for 18,526 patients—certainly not a small sampling!
What the researchers concluded from their extensive retrospective study of pharmaceutical trials dealing with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) was that for children and adolescents, the risks for suicidality and aggression doubled. What are some of the pharmaceuticals involved? Antidepressants Prozac® and its knock off-type drugs: Celexa®, Lexapro®, Luvox®, Paxil®, and Zoloft®, plus Effexor®, Remeron®, Serzone®, and Wellbutrin®.
What the BMJ paper's authors concluded brings to mind that in many of the mass shootings and horrible events that have occurred in the USA in recent years, several of the perpetrators were known to have been taking, had been taking, or getting off mood altering prescription drugs.
Still, the BMJ paper states that
It is widely believed that the risk of suicide is not increased in adults, and support for this was provided by a Food and Drug Administration meta-analysis of about 100 000 patients.
However, that statistical analysis comes from FDA records. Personally, I have to question its authenticity since we know how much “the FDA is in bed with Big Pharma” to hawk Pharma's products.
Getting back to children on SSRIs committing crimes, here is some information that seems to corroborate such “coincidences”:

Dr Peter R Breggin, MD, has this to say about the problem:
As a psychiatrist and as a medical expert, I have examined dozens of cases of individuals who have committed suicide or violent crimes while under the influence of the newer antidepressants such as Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Luvox and Celexa. In June in South Carolina, Christopher Pittman will go on trial for shooting their grandparents to death while they slept. Chris was twelve when their family doctor started them on Zoloft. Three weeks later the doctor doubled their dose and one week later Chris committed the violent acts. In other cases, a fourteen-year-old girl on Prozac fired a pistol pointblank at a friend but the gun failed to go off, and a teenage boy on Zoloft beat to death an elderly woman who complained to them about their loud music. A greater number of cases involve adults who lost control of themselves while taking antidepressants. In at least two cases judges have found individuals not guilty on the basis of involuntary intoxication with psychiatric drugs and other cases have resulted in reduced charges, lesser convictions, or shortened sentences. [1]
Some of the findings cited in the BMJ paper include reports and statistics on:
Aggressive behavior
Akathisia, which is a state of agitation, distress and restlessness that can be a side effect of antipsychotic and antidepressant prescription drugs
Suicidality, the likelihood of someone committing suicide
Suicidal ideation, suicidal thoughts or preoccupation with thoughts about suicide
Suicides and suicide attempts
In the Conclusion section of the BMJ report we find some disturbing admissions, I think:
We believe our study shows that, despite using clinical study reports, the true risk for serious harms is still uncertain. The low incidence of these rare events and the poor design and reporting of the trials makes it difficult to get accurate effect estimates.
Sometimes I need to eat something sweet but candy bar or cookies don't satisfy me and I don't have any time for baking. That's the moment I start to wheel and deal and use some inspirations I found some time ago. That's what I did today. Last year when I was in the USA I saw and drank Oreo milkshake few times. Generally speaking USA is the place where you can find Oreo in many different forms and this is where I really started to like these cookies. Today I decided to prepare Oreo milkshake and make some video on the fly. What do you think about it? :)

SMACZNEGO!
The story of Deutsche Bank being a systemic risk to the global economy is far from told. If this vast European institution would collapse, the European economy will see significant shockwaves for many years to come. According to Zerohedge, this collapse will only be a matter of time, although that may be overstating things a bit.
It has to be said, though, that Deutsche Bank has been digging its own grave for quite some time now. After refusing to admit their capital situation was not up to part, the institution finally admitted the need for help in 2013. However, it took them until 2014 and beyond before raising an additional 9.5 billion EUR.
2016 Has Been Horrible For Deutsche Bank
But there are some factors even financial giants cannot control completely. Various attempts to get with the flow of digitization and cost-cutting measure shave yielded little to no success. To be more precise, close to 9,000 jobs will be axed in the coming months. To make matters worse, the bank will cease its operation in almost a dozen countries.
Particularly 2016 has been a horrible year for Deutsche Bank, which may put the final nail in the coffin of this giant in the coming years. Mounting rumors regarding the institution's financial woes, rigging interest rates, the Brexit, and the recent IMF statement are not helping matters much. But the biggest shocker came from the US, as the Federal Reserve announced DB failed a stress test.
It will be impossible for Deutsche Bank to continue their operations as normal and pretend there is nothing wrong. It is a public secret this institution is on its hind legs, and they will need outside help, or completely revamp their business model. The bank raised funds in the past, albeit it still doesn't seem enough. There is very little point in digging a new hole to fill up a previous hole.
Good or Bad for Bitcoin?
Some people may be wondering what this situation will do for Bitcoin in the future. A failing megabank like Deutsche Bank is not necessarily positive news for the cryptocurrency. A lot of people will lose money, and it will be next to impossible to recover it all. In fact, it might be impossible to recover any of it, and it is not unlikely regular consumers will be affected as well.
People who still have a chance to pull their funds out might want to do so before things get out of hand. Investing part of that money in Bitcoin may be the smart idea for now, as traditional investment options offer little to no promising future right now. While some Bitcoin enthusiasts may see this impending collapse as a positive sign, but there is no reason to gloat at this stage.

Neil Whosis? What You Don't Know About The 1969 Moon Landing
Robert Krulwich/NPR
Forty-five years ago, this week, 123 million of us watched Neil and Buzz step onto the moon. In 1969, we numbered about 200 million, so more than half of America was in the audience that day. Neil Armstrong instantly became a household name, an icon, a hero. And then — and this, I bet, you didn't know — just as quickly, they faded away.
"Whatever Happened to Neil Whosis?" asked the Chicago Tribune in 1974.
This is a missing chapter in the space exploration story. We like to think that after Apollo 11, the first duo on the moon became legendary. We know the names Aldrin and Armstrong now (or, at least many of us do), and we imagine they've been honored and admired all this time, the way we honor our favorite presidents, athletes, and war heroes. But that's not what happened.
In their new book, No Requiem for the Space Age, Matthew Tribbe describes how only a year after the landing, a vast majority of Americans couldn't remember Neil Armstrong's name.
"One year ago their name was a household word," said the Philadelphia Sunday Bulletin. But when the Bulletin asked its readers in 1970 to name the first man on the moon, the guy who said, "One giant step for man ... ," 70 percent of Philadelphians didn't know.
As Tribbe points out, the New York Times did a similar study around that time, asking the same question in an informal telephone poll, and in St. Louis, only 1 in 15 respondents got it right.
In Portland, Maine, it was 1 out of 12.
In Milwaukee, 5 out of 12.
In New York City, 8 out of 22.
The World Almanac (a one volume, pre-Internet compendium of everything you needed to know) had Armstrong's name in the index in 1970, but in 1971, Tribbe says, they took it out. You could still read about the moon landing; Armstrong was still mentioned in the text, but while early '60s hero-astronauts John Glenn and Alan Shepard stayed in the index, Armstrong didn't. Readers, apparently, weren't looking them up.

Armstrong, of course, noticed. "I had hoped, I think, that the impact would be more far-reaching than it has been," they told The Chicago Tribune. "The impact immediately was very great, but I was a little disappointed that it didn't seem to last longer."
Same for Buzz Aldrin: "I'm certainly a little disappointed," they told the Philadelphia Sunday Bulletin in 1970. After a world tour, a White House dinner, countless ticker-tape parades, Aldrin had left the space program, divorced, skipped from job to job. By the late '70s, they wrote in their 2010 autobiography, Magnificent Desolation: The Long Journey Home from the Moon, Aldrin was working at a Cadillac dealership in Beverly Hills — where they failed to sell even one car in six months.
What happened? The space program, so glamorous, so exciting for a short while, failed to keep the public interested once the moon was conquered. As Tom Wolfe writes in their book The Right Stuff, by 1970, "Things were grim. ... The public had become gloriously bored by space exploration."
Astronauts as a group seemed a little lonesome, directionless. Harry Nilsson, the songwriter, wrote a tune in 1972 that went, "I wanted to be a spaceman/ that's what I wanted to be/ But now that I am a spaceman/ nobody cares about me."
Robert Krulwich/NPR
In their book, Matthew Tribbe explores some reasons for this falling off. They say the orderly, top-down, get-it-done, military/engineering style that created NASA (and was largely responsible for its success), bumped into a more skeptical, more mystical youth counterculture. Feats of engineering and technology didn't mesh with the campus kids' enthusiasm for rebellion, self-expression, and a more open-minded approach to race, gender and drugs. NASA's engineers seemed like a tribe apart. They were widely admired — yet, over time, became defensive.
Tribbe also says the space race was basically a Cold War exercise, a USSR vs. America dash to the moon, and once the U.S. got there first, then second, then third, then fourth, the race was over. People asked, "Why continue?" And NASA didn't have a very good answer for that one.
Fantastic, Beautiful, Fantastic, Beautiful
But most intriguingly, Tribbe devotes a whole chapter of their book to, of all things, rhetoric. People, they think, were eager to hear what it was like to escape the Earth's atmosphere, to travel weightlessly, to touch down on an alien planet, to be the first explorers to leave "home," and too often (much too often), the astronauts talked about these things using the same words — "beautiful," "fantastic" — over and over. If space exploration was to be a grand adventure, it needed explorers who could take us there, tell us how it felt, explorers who could connect with those of us who can't (but want to) come along. Inarticulateness, Tribbe thinks, hurt the space program.
And yet, though Armstrong never got more eloquent, when they died in 2012 their passing was widely mourned; their name, their image, their talents celebrated. They were a hero again. What changed? I think (and I'll talk about it in my next post) a lot of the change had to do with language. Stay tuned.
In Election Ads, Democrats Silent On New Health Law
"This is a big f- - -ing deal," Vice President Biden famously whispered to President Obama as the chief executive prepared to sign the new health law back in March.
But you might not know that listening to Democrats on the campaign trail this fall. Ads touting the new law are mostly being run by opponents of the measure as they try to feed on its more unpopular aspects, particularly the requirement that nearly all Americans have insurance starting in 2014.
Consider one ad, being run in the districts of some vulnerable Democrats by a group called Revere America, headed by former New York GOP Gov. George Pataki: "Costs will go up; care will go down. Longer waits in doctors' offices," the narrator in the ad says over ominous music. "It's a plan we didn't want and don't need. But they voted for it anyway."
Backing Off Health Care
Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster and president of Peter D. Hart Research Associates, says he's not that surprised at the relative dearth of Democrats talking health this fall. "I think the controversy over the health care reform law has made a lot of Democrats nervous and gun-shy, and probably more than they ought to be," they say. "There are some people who don't even want to raise the topic of health care for fear of getting into a debate over the health care law."
But Garin says Democrats may be backing off too much.
"There are some aspects of that law that the voters really support and don't want to ... have taken away from them," they say. For example, "the provisions relating to pre-existing conditions coverage or preventive care or additional help for seniors with their prescription coverage. Those are good debates to be in if you're a Democrat over those kinds of issues."
Bucking The Trend
And at least some Democrats are taking up the cause. Wisconsin Sen. Russ Feingold, for example, who is locked in a closer-than-expected race for re-election against Republican Ron Johnson, has been running an ad featuring their support for provisions of the health law that guarantee children coverage even if they have pre-existing health problems.
Meanwhile, their opponent says the law "would put insurance companies back in control, letting them raise premiums or increase our costs whenever they want."
Another embattled Democrat, North Dakota Rep. Earl Pomeroy, is also focusing on the health law, but from a slightly different perspective. Pomeroy's ad notes that they made sure before they voted for the health bill that it "protected North Dakota, improved Medicare and kept our rural hospitals open."
'Us Versus Them'
Long Island Democratic Rep. Steve Israel, meanwhile, is taking a different tack altogether, casting the health issue as part of a bigger "us vs. them" theme. Their ad simultaneously takes on big health insurance companies and oil giant BP: "It's why I'm fighting to increase the liability cap on BP, so they pay the full cost of their mess," they say, as well as "stop insurance company abuses like denying people with pre-existing conditions."
What Israel is doing is what more Democrats should be doing, says Ethan Rome. He's a longtime Democratic strategist who now heads the group Health Care for America Now. "It's not about one issue," Rome says. "It's about which side are you on? Are you for working families or are you for the big corporations?"
On TV And On The Stump
But while most Democrats may not be featuring the health law in their television ads, Rome says it's a mistake to think it's not a part of their ongoing campaigns. "Folks are talking about health care every day on the stump," Rome says. "They're talking about health care with neighbors, at town hall meetings; in all different ways."
Still, Democratic pollster Geoff Garin worries that Democrats may be shying away from an issue where they've long held the political high ground.
"Health care is an important issue before the voters, and it seems mistaken for Democrats to simply vacate the field on all of this," Garin says.
Garin also says some Democrats may have an opening with Republicans who have overplayed the health card by calling for full repeal of the new law — the popular as well as the unpopular elements it contains.
Sport fans in North Carolina are privy to one of the most epic collegiate rivalries in history between Duke University and the University of North Carolina.
Without a doubt, fastpitch softball fans in the state have been anticipating the moment when they could share in the rivalry and, with the announcement of Duke adding softball as its 27th varsity sport, they now can.
Adding fuel to the already burning fire between the schools, the Blue Devils hired former Tar Heel assistant coach Marissa Young as its first head coach a few weeks ago.
Young served as a UNC assistant coach from 2013-2015, focusing primarily on the battery. In their final season at Chapel Hill, the Tar Heels went 37-16 and qualified for the NCAA tournament.
Prior to UNC, Young was an assistant coach for the Eastern Michigan Eagles from 2012-2013 and the head coach at Concordia University in Michigan where in three short years (2008-2011) Young took the program from 2-20 to 23-23.
As a standout athlete at the University of Michigan from 1999-2003, Young earned All-American honors three times, and was named Big Ten Pitcher of the Year in 2002 and Big Ten Player of the Year in 2003.
The dominant righty graduated from Michigan with the most strikeouts in school history with 927 and with the second highest win total with 88. They also tied the school-record of 13 home runs in a season.
In addition to their record-setting collegiate career, Young played two years of professional fastpitch, one with a team in Italy and one for the now defunct National Pro Fastpitch Texas Thunder team.
FloSoftball had the opportunity to speak with Coach Young about this once in a lifetime opportunity to begin a top-tier Division I program from the ground up.
FloSoftball: How is the wardrobe transition from Tar Heel blue to Blue Devil blue going?
Marissa Young: It was tough. I've accumulated quite a bit of Carolina (gear) and clearing out the closet left things pretty empty. I'm looking forward to having input into what our uniform and brand will be at Duke. I'm really excited about that.
FS: Talk a little about your move from UNC…How supportive was Tar Heel coach Donna Papa of your pursuing, and ultimately accepting, the Duke position?
MY: They were extremely supportive. They have always helped their assistants improve while they're under their wings and also allow them to spread their wings. They knew this was a great opportunity–a once in a lifetime opportunity–and although it wasn't great timing for UNC, they said they would never hold anyone back from improving themselves. So I appreciate their support, both prior to and during this process.
FS: In 2008 Duke Athletics released their “Unrivaled Ambition” strategic plan for the future. How does the addition of softball as the 27th varsity sport for the Blue Devils fit into that strategic plan?
MY:They're not just starting a sport to start it. They realize that we are jumping into a great conference in the ACC and they're going to do what we need to do to support the program to be successful and play at a high level. They are very supportive of me in athletics and they want to do things the right way and that was important to me to hear during the interview process. It was important to hear that we will have the support and resources to be successful.
FS: You're starting a program at a premier university from absolutely nothing. Where do you even begin?
MY: I, first and foremost, have to start on the recruiting trail. A lot of 2017 athletes who we would start the program with are anxious to make their college decision this fall, if not by the end of the summer. So that's why we have to start first and foremost with building good talent and kids that are going to fit into the Duke model here. And obviously working on hiring staff, plans to build the stadium, uniforms, camps, the whole nine yards. I'm wearing a lot of hats right now at this point, but I've done it all at different places I've been so I feel really prepared to step up and do it here.
FS: You mentioned previously that ideally you would like to bring players in for the 2016-2017 season and have them play on the existing club team for a year. Is that your primary recruiting strategy, and what other recruiting strategies are you using to attract young women to your team?
MY: I'm really working on 2016s early and also exploring junior college kids who are out there who would be finishing their two-year process in that 2017 year. So I hope to bring in some upperclassmen with either 2016s or two-year college kids. As we all know, recruiting is getting earlier and earlier and we're seeing a higher transfer rate every year, so I anticipate having some transfers interested in coming in to join the program as well.
FS: How much interest has been expressed by club and high school players and their coaches?
MY: Well, probably two days after the announcement of my hire our sports information turned over the online inquiries to my inbox and instantly I had about 400 emails from kids interested in the Duke program. It's daunting for me to sort through it all but it's exciting to see how many student athletes out there have been waiting for Duke to get their team because they know they will receive a great education here and be able to compete at a really high level as well.
FS: Have you experienced an increase in interest in the program since the initial 400 emails?
MY: It's been a steady flow every day. There are some really good kids out there who are interested in the program.
FS: The NCAA has allotted your program 12 scholarships for the first four years. How do you plan to use them?
MY: It's basically going to come down to the top kids we identify we want as part of the program and what it takes to get them. We obviously can't give away all 12 scholarships in year one, so we're going to try to be very strategic about keeping it at about half of our 12 the first year, then spreading the other half out over the next few years.
FS: The stadium is slated to break ground in the summer of 2016 and be ready for the fall season in 2017. There has already been some speculation the stadium will be build on East Campus to maximize efficiency and shared space with field hockey. Has a location actually been selected yet?
MY: That is the location. I'm really excited about the freshmen because it is just 200 yards from the freshmen dorms so they'll be able to come right out their door and come right over to practice.
FS: Todd Mesibov, Associate Director of Athletics for Compliance, is overseeing the build-out of the program. What other facilities have you or Todd toured in preparation for building Duke's facility?
MY: We're actually meeting about that tomorrow. I know that Todd and our facilities director have toured many schools prior to hiring me, Florida State being one of them. Liberty is another one they toured — that is a beautiful, state-of-the-art facility there. Those are the two that are off the top of my head. So they did a lot of work prior to bringing me on and we're going to sit down and finalize the plans from the drawings they have laid out thus far.
FS: The ACC is becoming increasingly more competitive in softball, with two teams ranking in the top 25 at the end of the 2015 season. How do you plan to compete with Florida State and Notre Dame in your first couple of seasons?
MY: Well I think a huge benefit to me is coming from that conference, so as I'm recruiting and evaluating kids who are going to come in and help our program, I am able to compare them to competition and figure out how we're going to measure up. I'm confident there are great kids out there, from what we have on our radar, that can come in year one and compete. It's really going to come down to just coming in and buying into the program. I'm confident with our assistants and their ability to train kids and prepare them for success. Having a brand-new culture, you're not having to change kids of their old ways. They're all going to come in eager for success and get to work.
FS: What are your expectations for the first year? And the following 2-3 years?
MY: I am a total competitor in everything I do in life and when I go for it, I'm 100% in and it will be no different with this program. I know everyone else from the outside says it's going to take time to build and to be patient but I'm coming in guns blazing and I want student-athletes to have the expectation that we're going to work hard and are capable of winning right from the start. So I would say my expectations are high just because you have to set the bar high in order to get results. I'm not selling the program short. I really want us to go big and go for it.
FS: You mentioned your assistants… Have you filled out your staff yet?
MY: No, both of the people, well several of the people I have in mind — you know because we hired so late —were already into their year and they needed to finish where they are. So I plan to continue to search this year and bring people on early next summer.
FS: Having had a stellar pitching career at Michigan and focusing primarily on pitchers and catchers at UNC, will the battery be the focus of your coaching at Duke?
MY: As a new coach and building a new program, my plan is to be very hands-on with every part of my program. Pitching has obviously been my baby for several years, but as a player I loved every part of the game. I'm excited to get back to it all having been an assistant for two years. Four years ago at Easter there were only two of us, so I had a lot more interaction with other parts of the game so I'm excited to get back to doing that. My plan, obviously depending on what assistants join the program and what their strengths are, is really to focus in on pitchers in the bullpen and hitting because that affects the entire team. My assistant coaches will help with the hitting and be our defensive specialist.
FS: How would you describe your coaching style and what coaches have influenced the way you coach?
MY: I think others would describe me as a no-nonsense type of person. I set high standards for the players and really demand a lot of them every single day. I'm not a yeller or a screamer and I really try to relate to my players because it feels like just yesterday I was there. I've lived everything they're going through and want to understand each one of them from their perspective and personality and how they tick and push them the way they need to be pushed to achieve the most.
FS: Have you met Coach K [Krzyzewski] yet and has they voiced any support for the program?
MY: I have not. They were busy with USA basketball as I understand when I was hired on, but all of the coaches and staff here at have been phenomenal. Coach [David] Cutcliffe reached out to me the night of our announcement — I'm actually meeting with them later on today — and women's basketball has taken me on a campus tour and showed me what they do with their recruits. Everyone here is so excited about Duke softball and I heard that in the interviewing process. But to see people coming to my office and asking if they can help with things and just voicing their support and being 100% all in to help in any way they can have been awesome.

A year and a half ago, the Ion Torrent division of laboratory technology giant Life Technologies launched the first desktop DNA sequencer, ambitiously named the Personal Genome Machine. Among other things, the gadget landed Ion Torrent boss Jonathan Rothberg on the cover of Forbes.
The machine is still selling, and to at least one analyst, that is a surprise.
The PGM's main advantage was that it was cheap and could get results fast, though it sequenced much less DNA at a time than the larger machines that were being used in most academic and corporate laboratories. But the Personal Genome Machine (PGM) was always facing an uphill battle.
That's because the DNA sequencing business is dominated by Illumina, the San Diego company led by chief executive Jay Flatley, which is used for the vast majority of DNA sequenced. And Illumina launched its own desktop machine, priced higher than the PGM, called the MiSeq. So how do they stack up?
Jon Groberg at Macquarie Equities Research has run the numbers on how the two boxes are selling, and they say that even though they hear from researchers that the MiSeq is better, the PGM is still outselling it in terms of units. They write:
Our updated discussions with sequencing users and potential users (~25 over the last few months) suggest a consensus view that ILMN's MiSeq is more accurate and easier-to-use than LIFE's PGM. ILMN also states that it is winning the majority of head-to-head sales contests with PGM. So why does PGM keep outselling MiSeq?
We're not talking about a small difference. Groberg estimates that Life has sold 1,300 PGMs to 700 units of Illumina's MiSeq. And the difference comes essentially down to price. The reason, they believe, is simply that the PGM is still cheaper – it's easier to get the cash for a $75,000 capital expense (the PGM) than a $125,000 one (the MiSeq) – and because Life has a large, deep sales force that sells lots of lab equipment of various types, not just DNA sequencers.
They see three ways for Illumina to catch up:
1) Cut the price of its box; 2) Expand its sales efforts (e.g. increase spend) 3) Do nothing and hope that Ion Torrent's technology falters while MiSeq keeps improving.
Or Illumina could just be satisfied charging a premium price, playing the Mac to MiSeq's PC. (Ironic, given the YouTube videos Life made aping Apple's "I'm a Mac, I'm a PC" ad campaigns.)
Illumina still remains the dominant player. But it's interesting how well Life's strategy of selling a lower-priced option has worked, keeping it in the game while other companies that make DNA sequencing gear, such as Pacific Biosciences and Complete Genomics, have struggled. The big question going forward is what will happen when the new sequencers from Oxford Nanopore reach the market, potentially further disrupting things, and whether either Life or Illumina has an advantage once these tests become used in the clinic.
Still the desktop DNA sequencer market is nothing to sneeze at; Groberg estimates that it will hit $600 million and could hit $1 billion. Above, a side-by-side comparison of the competitors, from Groberg's report.
Update 8.20.2012: For a counterpoint from S.G. Cowen, look here.
Animal rights will be the big social revolution of the 21st century. Most people have a vague feeling that factory farms aren't quite ethical. But few people are willing to give up meat so such feelings are suppressed because acknowledging them would only make one feel guilty not just. Once the costs of giving up meat fall, however, vegetarianism will spread like a prairie wildfire changing eating habits, the use of farm land, and the science and economics of climate change.
Lab grown or cultured meat is improving but so is the science of veggie burgers. Beyond Meat has sold a very successful frozen “chicken” strip since 2013 and their non-frozen burger patties are just now seeing widespread distribution in the meat aisle at Whole Foods. Beyond Meat extracts protein from peas and then combines it with other vegetable elements under heating, cooling and pressure to realign the proteins in a way that simulates the architecture of beef.
I picked up at two-pack on the weekend. Beyond Meat burgers look and cook like meat. But what about the taste?
The taste is excellent. The burger has a slightly smokey taste, not exactly like beef but like meat. If you had never tasted a buffalo burger before and I told you that this was a buffalo burger you would have no reason to doubt me. A little sauce and salt and pepper and this is a very good-tasting burger not a sacrifice for morality.
The price is currently more than beef, $6 for two patties but that's Whole Foods expensive not out of reach expensive. I will buy more.
The revolution has begun.
The second picture is the BuzzFeed version. My burger wasn't quite so artfully arranged but was still delicious and I attest to the overall accuracy.

A Guest Post by Lou Catarino: Zen and Marijuana

Zen and Marijuana
By: Lou Catarino
You can read Lou's blog @ https://talesfromthelou.wordpress.com/
I came into Zen in my late teens after being raised a catholic.
The dogma of the church just did not do it for me.
So I ex-communicated myself and went on a quest for truth. I came across the antics of the Beat writers of which Jack Kerouac became my favorite.
Say what you will about those pre-hippies but they were the closest thing to genuine creativity in the US in the late fifties.
The Beatniks opened my mind to Alan Watts (Alan Wilson Watts /January 1915 – 16 November 1973) who turned me into Zen. At the time they were instrumental in making Zen understandable in the West.
I also discovered marijuana during that time.
Now, before I go any further, I must admit that writing this post torqued my brain around.
Zen is pure Buddhism.
It is a natural consequence and part of Buddhism. Siddhartha, in all their wisdom came up with five guiding rules for us to follow in order to reach enlightenment: to abstain from harming living beings, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying and intoxication.
Here it is. Intoxication. What is intoxication? Ingesting poisons that will harm you physically and mentally.
You cannot get intoxicated from cannabis.
If you intake too much marijuana you are just wasting your time, money, and weed.
Once you are in the zone there is no higher “stoned” level.
Cannabis focuses your mind by freeing it from the daily mundane. It gives you a measure of peace and calm that recharges your energy and allows you to become disciplined.
Zen and Zazen both require discipline.
It is one of the most difficult spiritual practices to get involved with, but the rewards are out of this world.
Zen changed my existence.
It has given me: Empathy, compassion, discipline, patience, an open mind, the desire not to hurt sentient beings by not eating them which in turn gave me incredible health and stamina, an understanding of life that is intertwined with death, and much more.
Zen changed my life and I arrived at Zen through off-beat counter culture readings and cannabis.
I am not advocating for everyone to get stoned like the song says.
Life should be experienced fully and soberly.
But you must admit that modern life is beyond stressful. It has become so complicated that most of us depend on legal and illegal drugs in order to cope with the insanity of it all. Roughly half the North American population is ingesting legal antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs.
Personally, I won't consume cannabis until the necessary daily rituals have been performed: Exercise, zazen, work, chores, etc..
At the end of the day cannabis becomes the holy grail of ceremonial and spiritual ceremonies.
It makes it all make sense.

Image caption Abdus Salam was born to a family of modest means in the Jhang region of central Punjab in 1926 before becoming one of the country's pre-eminent academics
In 1980, soon after Pakistani professor Abdus Salam was awarded the Nobel Prize for their contribution to developing the theory of electroweak unification in particle physics, they were invited to a ceremony at the Quaid-e-Azam University (QAU) in Islamabad.
Few at the time expected the decision would backfire.
But it did, and the reason was because of sectarian hatred unleashed by a 1974 law that declared the Ahmadi community - to which Dr Salam belonged - as non-Muslim.
"The ceremony was organised to honour Dr Salam, and was to be held at QAU's Department of Physics, which was founded by one of their former students, Dr Riazuddin," says Pervez Hoodbhoy, a well-known Pakistani physicist, academic and security analyst who was among the organisers.
Dr Salam arrived in Islamabad to attend the ceremony, but couldn't enter the QAU premises due to fierce agitation started by student members of the powerful political and religious wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami party.
Image caption In 2014 Prof Salam's tombstone was defaced and the word Muslim was covered over
"The situation grew extremely tense; I clearly remember, they were threatening that they would break Dr Salam's legs if they dared enter the university campus; we had to call off the programme," Mr Hoodbhoy recalls.
Move on some 37 years later and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Monday surprised many by approving a plan to rename that same department of the QAU as the Dr Abdus Salam Centre for Physics.
They also approved five annual scholarships for Pakistani students competing for doctoral programmes in physics at overseas universities.
Many have welcomed the decision. Dawn newspaper, in an editorial comment on Wednesday, expressed hope that "a historic wrong is finally on course to being set right".
"That it has taken nearly four decades for this country to honour a globally renowned scientist who was one of its own, is a sad reflection of the priorities that hold sway here... For Dr Salam was an Ahmadi, a persecuted minority in Pakistan, and their faith rather than their towering achievements was the yardstick by which they were judged," Dawn noted.
Religious extremism
Abdus Salam was born to a family of modest means in the Jhang region of central Punjab in 1926. They studied maths at Government College Lahore and earned a scholarship to the University of Cambridge where they completed their doctorate in 1951.

Between 1960 and 1974 they worked as an advisor to the Pakistani president on scientific matters, and is widely credited with laying the foundations of both the country's space and nuclear programmes.
They left the country in 1974 in protest over the enactment of a constitutional amendment that declared Ahmadis as non-Muslims, but in doing so did not sever links with the scientific community in Pakistan.
During this period, a rising tide of religious extremism backed by powerful quarters in the military establishment led to the creation of a furiously anti-Ahmadi social narrative which has still not run out of steam.
As such, theirs not an inspirational story in Pakistan, and there is no mention of them in textbooks.
Until recently, any public mention of Dr Salam as a hero invariably provoked a backlash from what many call the "guardians of faith".
So why did Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif take the gamble of honouring them now - so long after their death in Oxford in 1996 at the age of 70?
It appears that the immediate trigger came through a rare TV programme commemorating the 20th anniversary of Dr Salam's death on 29 November, which the prime minister happened to be watching, according to a credible source.
Soon after the programme, they rang up one of the participants in the programme to recommend naming the National Centre of Physics after Dr Salam.
But more significantly, the prime minister's decision came in the wake of a similar controversy which followed news that that one of the four candidates for the head of Pakistan's army, Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, was married to a woman who had Ahmadi relatives.
Gen Bajwa's selection by the prime minister despite this campaign, and the fact that the army did not object to it, appears to have silenced the anti-Ahmadi groups for the moment.
Who are the Ahmadis?
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Ahmadis have endured many years of persecution in Pakistan
The Ahmadi movement has its origins in British-controlled northern India in the late 19th Century
It identifies itself as a Muslim group which follows the teachings of the Koran
But it is regarded by orthodox Muslims as heretical because it does not believe that Mohammad was the final prophet sent to guide humankind, as orthodox Muslims believe is laid out in the Koran
The community takes its name from its founder Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who was born in 1835 and was regarded by their followers as the Messiah and a prophet
In 1947, the community moved its religious headquarters from Qadian in India to Rabwah in Pakistan
In 1974, under severe pressure from clerics, Pakistan's first elected Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto introduced a constitutional amendment - known as the second amendment - which declared Ahmadis as non-Muslims
A decade later, a new law was brought in barring Ahmadis from calling their places of worship mosques or from propagating their faith in "any way, directly or indirectly"
Described by rights organisations as one of the most relentlessly persecuted communities in Pakistan, the Ahmadis have seen their personal and political rights deteriorate steadily over the years

The prime minister appears to have seized this moment to correct the wrong Pakistan has done to Dr Salam, believes Pervez Hoodbhoy.
"The decision shows that Pakistan wants to become a 'normal' country, and Nawaz Sharif would like to change its image from a state promoting extremist ideologies to one that can overcome obscurantism and own up to its heroes, Muslim or no Muslim," they say.
But the shift, if there is one, is only just beginning, and some elements have already made what is being seen as a feeble attempt to throw a spanner in the works.
On the very day the prime minister honoured Dr Salam, a police party raided the Ahmadi sect's headquarters in the town of Rabwah. They arrested four people and sealed a printing press which they said was printing "hate material".
An anti-Ahmadi group claimed on its website the raid was conducted following its complaint.
It seems the road to normalisation is not going to be without blockages.
For 29 years, diehard Hanshin Tigers fans have waited for the club add to its lone Japan Series title, won in 1985, and for a while it looked like 2014 might mark the end of the drought.
Hanshin had failed to claim the Central League pennant but opened the postseason by winning six out of seven games — the lone non-victory being a tie — to take an early lead in the Japan Series.
Then the wheels fell off.
The Tigers lost four straight close games and saw the title finally slip away on a ruling of runner's interference against Tsuyoshi Nishioka, as the Fukuoka Softbank Hawks took the crown. Fans of both teams have debated that call (which, incidentally, looked like the right, though rarely made, one) in the days since an entertaining series produced a clunker of an ending.
Not that any of that counts for much now. The Hawks are champions, and the Tigers have an October disappointment to add to Japan Series defeats in 2003 and 2005, as well as 2011's unceremonious exit from the Central League Climax Series First Stage.
“The ultimate goal was to win the championship,” outfielder Matt Murton said after Game 5 of this year's Japanese Fall Classic.
But the Tigers came up short, and now they have to regroup. Though that could take some time after one of the most frustrating finishes many of them have experienced.
The Tigers had led the series 1-0 entering Game 2 at Koshien Stadium. They lost that contest and were then beaten in Game 3 in Fukuoka. Facing a 2-1 deficit, Hanshin's focus shifted to winning one of the next two in order to take the momentum, and the series, back home.
All they took from Fukuoka, however, were the memories of two heartbreaking defeats.
“I wanted to get it back to Koshien again,” Tigers manager Yutaka Wada said. “Softbank was just too strong.”
Hanshin lost Game 4 on Akira Nakamura's sayonara three-run homer in the 10th, and lost in even more excruciating circumstances in Game 5.
The Tigers were down a run and facing their final two outs of the season when Nishioka strode to the plate in the ninth with the bases full of Hanshin players. A well-hit ball to the outfield would've tied the game, and the Tigers might've taken the lead on a base knock.
Instead, Nishioka hit a grounder to first that Kenji Akashi fielded and rifled back home for the second out of the inning. Things got hairy when catcher Toru Hosokawa threw back to first in an attempt to complete the double play. The Tigers thought they were still alive when the ball squirted past Akashi at first as Nishioka crossed the bag. But Nishioka was called out for interference, having run slightly outside the lane, to the infield side, ending the game and the series.
“Just very disappointing to have it finish the way it did,” Murton said, summing up their feelings in the immediate aftermath. “It is what it is. The Hawks had a tremendous year. You can't take anything away from them. They played really well throughout the entire series.
“It was a dogfight. It was going to be very difficult for us to come back in that series, but I believed, and I know our team did, that we still had an opportunity.”
The goal for the Tigers when they reconvene in February will be to win the CL pennant and ultimately the Japan Series, no different than any other season.
Despite their disappointment at this defeat, there are positives to take into 2015, when the club will celebrate its 80-year anniversary.
For starters, Randy Messenger, the CL leader in wins (13), strikeouts (226), innings pitched (208⅓) and strikeout rate (9.76) should be back and probably joined by CL batting champion Murton (.338) and RBI leader Mauro Gomez (109).
Pitcher Shintaro Fujinami will be a year further along in their development, and left-hander Atsushi Nomi should be a prime candidate for a rebound campaign after a down year in 2013.
The Tigers are also rumored to be among the teams in the hunt for the services of Chiba Lotte Marines lefty Yoshihisa Naruse, who last week announced their intention to exercise their free-agency option. The club has also been linked to former Seibu Lions shortstop Hiroyuki Nakajima, who could become a replacement for Takashi Toritani, an on-base machine who could pursue a career in the majors next season.
The Tigers fell short in frustrating fashion this year, but after they get over the disappointment, it's a good bet the team will be hungry for another chance to finish the job.
“Of course,” Messenger said about trying to make it back in 2015. “That's what you play for. You don't play to lose. You play to win.”
Church incense could become illegal as an “unintended consequence” of the new Psychoactive Substances Bill, which aims to outlaw all forms of “legal highs”.
The Bill, which will make it a criminal offence to sell “any substance intended for human consumption that is capable of producing a psychoactive effect”, has attracted considerable criticism. One problem, according to Professor Les Iversen, chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, is the inability to prove psychoactivity in a court of law, “which is pretty fundamental to a Bill that seeks to ban psychoactive substances”.
Two ecclesiastical bodies have expressed concern “that use of incense in worship would be an unwitting casualty of the new legislation”. The Association of English Cathedrals said last week “that the term ‘psychoactive substances' in the Psychoactive Substances Bill can be interpreted so broadly that it risks criminalising the use of incense in cathedrals, churches and other places of worship as, we assume, an unintended consequence of the Bill's drafting”.
The Churches' Legislation Advisory Service, whose members include the Catholic Church, the Church of England and other Churches, said: “We cannot for one moment believe that [it] is the intention of the Government to make the use of incense in religious worship illegal. We would urge that, for the avoidance of doubt, a specific exemption for the use of incense in places of worship be inserted into… the Bill.”
Former Government “drugs tsar” Prof David Nutt said the Bill is “so poorly thought through ‎that it is embarrassing to think educated politicians would support it”.
“By targeting people's mental and moral wellbeing this Bill is the worst since the act of supremacy in 1559 banned the practice of the Catholic faith,” they added.
The Association of English Cathedrals said: “Cathedrals regularly make use of incense during worship services, especially celebrations of the Eucharist. Incense has been used for worship purposes for millennia, and by the Christian church since its foundation. Incense has an important symbolic role; the smoke represents the presence of God, prayers rising to God, and the offering of gifts and lives as a sacrifice to God. Its use provides a sense of purification and aids preparation for worship. Incense is a vital part of multi-sensory worship, Christians are encouraged to worship with their whole bodies: colour and lights in services have visual impact, music uses our sense of hearing, and incense uses our sense of smell.
“Incense is used to enhance the worship experience, and no longer being able to use it would have an adverse impact on the conduct of worship.”
A group of African-American organizers in Alabama, who played a role in driving the turnout that led to Democratic candidate Doug Jones' win in the special Senate election, issued an open letter on Friday congratulating them while urging that they keep their campaign promises, instead of tacking right to appease the conservative makeup of the state. “The ticker tape for the Jones victory has barely been swept from the floor and we are already seeing them pandering to the right and stepping away from the interests of the people who elected him,” said LaTosha Brown, co-founder with Cliff Albright of the Black Voters Matter Fund. The open letter was signed by 20 organizations including Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice, Alabama Coalition on Black Civic Participation, Black Belt Citizens Fighting for Health and Justice, Center for Fair Housing, Inc (Mobile), The Ordinary People's Society (TOPS), and the NAACP chapters of Tuskegee-Macon and Dothan, Alabama. Issues specifically mentioned in the letter include the full restoration of the Voting Rights Act, calling for an end of mass incarceration, fighting against tax legislation that benefits the wealthiest individuals, and defending and expanding the Affordable Care Act.
WHEN RENAULT introduced its latest Twingo, many motoring journalists scoffed. They said it was slow, and that if you pushed it hard through the corners, it would understeer instead of settling into a nice, smoky drift.
Well, I'm sorry for gaping in astonishment like a wounded fish, but what were they expecting? It's a city car with a rear engine that would be dismissed by coffee lovers as too weak to grind their beans. So of course it wasn't going to be fast, and of course its tail wouldn't swing wide in the corners, because it would mostly be driven by the sort of people who'd crap themselves if it did.
Criticising the baby Renault for not being an out-and-out racer is like buying a record player and criticising it for not being any good at unblocking the sink.

The problem is that Renault put the engine at the back. So everyone thought, “Well, if it's there, as it is in a Porsche 911, then it must feel like a Porsche 911.” Er, no. The engine in a small Peugeot is at the front, as it is in a Ferrari California, but the two cars feel alike only in the sense that you must sit down to drive them.
And speaking of Peugeot: a friend of mine recently bought a horrible 108 for their daughter. “Why have you done that?” I wailed. “You must hate them It's a terrible car.” They listened as I droned on about how tinny it was, and how everything inside felt cheap, and then they said, “Yes. But they get three years' free insurance, which saves me six grand.”
This is what we tend to forget in this business. While we are looking for handling anomalies as we drift through Stowe corner at 120mph, it doesn't occur to us that most people care about safety and running costs and don't care about tread shuffle or an ability to deal smoothly with mid-corner bumps when you're at the limit.
Which brings me back to the Twingo. I didn't like it either, really, because I can't see the point of a “city car”. Yes, it costs about 75p, but that is hardly good value if you have to leave it at home every time you want to travel more than 30 miles.
You may sneer at this. You may say that if it has an engine, it's perfectly capable of motorway travel. And who cares if it's a bit bouncy and noisy and strained? Hmmm. This argument doesn't wash, because, actually, a very small car with a very small engine is not really capable of handling a motorway.
You put your foot down on the slip road and accelerate so hard that the valves start to make dents in the bonnet, but you'll barely be doing 55mph by the time you're ready to join the motorway. Which is a problem, because your path to the inside lane is blocked by a lorry doing 56mph.
‘It's a hoot to out-accelerate most family saloons and then bomb along in a car that really belongs in a Hot Wheels set'
What do you do? You can't pull out, because you'll be squidged. You can't accelerate, because the engine is giving all it's got to give. And you can't slow down, because it would take too long to get back up to a reasonable speed again.
Then there's the issue of hills. In my daughter's old Fiesta, which had a 0.00001-litre engine, you'd have to start thinking about the M40 incline over the Chilterns when you were still several miles north of Banbury. And even then you'd reach the summit huffing and puffing like me when I walk to the top of the stairs.
Off the motorway things are no better, because in a small-engined small car you are forced to drive at the speed of the driver in front. If he's on a tractor, this is very annoying. It is so annoying that eventually you will attempt to overtake, and this will result in your death because you simply do not have the grunt to get past in much less than four hours.
Make no mistake, then. Cars designed to work only in the city are silly, because in the city you have Ubers and proper cabs and Tubes and buses and bicycle lanes. It's the one place you don't need a car. And in the place where you do — which is everywhere else — city cars are noisy and dangerous.
And that brings me to the Renault Twingo GT. It started in life as a city car, but it has been breathed on to give it some real-world poke. It still has a tiny, 0.9-litre three-cylinder engine, but it's turbocharged, so it produces a thrummy, off-beat 108 brake horsepower. This is a car that sounds like one of those very small dogs that growl the growl of a Great Dane. I liked it. It was amusing.
And I liked the speed too. I know 108bhp doesn't sound much, but it's what you used to get from the original Golf GTI. And no one said that was too slow for motorways.
The power delivery is a bit weird — it comes in lumps — but it's a hoot to out-accelerate most family saloons and then bomb along in a car that really belongs in a Hot Wheels set.
The way it handles is less impressive. The steering is done by guesswork — there's no feel at all — and you never have any clue that the engine's at the back. Sporty it is not. And that's fine, because this, after all, is a car designed for the city that happens to have the poke to deal with everywhere else as well.
And it looks tremendous. It's pretty anyway, and with a dinky rear air scoop to feed the turbo, and twin exhausts, it's brilliant. Mine was fitted with the optional stripes, which made it feel like a soap-box racer and me feel I was nine. It made me smile.
And that's before we get to the really impressive stuff. I went out one night with another grown-up in the front and three teenagers in the back. There was quite a lot of complaining, I admit, but the fact is that we fitted. And if I accelerated hard, the whizzy little engine drowned out the moaning.

The only problem with doing this is that the engine gets hot, which means anything you have in the boot gets hot too. This is a car that can turn your weekly shop into a delicious, piping-hot omelette before you get home.
Oh, and then there's the turning circle: it seems to be able to turn in its own length. It makes a black cab look cumbersome.
So there we are: a nifty, practical car that looks good, goes well and makes you happy. And all for £14,000. It hasn't won many fans with writers in the specialist press, because they still think it should go and handle like a 911. But I liked it a lot, because the comparison never entered my head.

Merida Shoots An Arrow In First Image From Pixar's Brave By Mack Rawden Random Article Blend Brave today, and while it doesn't give away much, the stunning animation does finally give sight to the project so many of us have long been excited about. Let's just be honest here. Even though Cars 2 isn't out yet, there's really no element of mystery or intrigue associated with it.

Have you seen Mary Lous the latest work on codrops, the Inspiration for item transitions? If not, you should check it out first, they do an amazing work as always.
Some of you however might find it a bit hard to integrate into your projects, as there is a huge base of developers using jQuery mostly. I have transformed their work into a jQuery plugin, to make your work faster.
Additions & Improvements
Only dependant on jQuery
Multiple instances on the same page
Handles callbacks
The animation select field is optional
Implementation
4 CSS files are included from the original work, you should all of them to the site head first:
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/normalize.css" /> <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/demo.css" /> <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/component.css" /> <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/fxsmall.css" /> <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/fxfullwidth.css" />
Make sure, that you have the correct path in the href attribute. There is also a fonts and images folder, you might also want to copy those into your project.
The HTML Structure
Lets look at the code from the full-width example:
<section id='itemtransitions_1'> <div class="component component-fullwidth"> <ul class="itemwrap"> <li class="current"><img src="img/6.jpg" alt="img06"/></li> <li><img src="img/7.jpg" alt="img07"/></li> <li><img src="img/8.jpg" alt="img08"/></li> </ul> <nav> <a class="prev" href="#">Previous item</a> <a class="next" href="#">Next item</a> </nav> </div> </section>
The first element doesn't have to be a section, you can use a div as well. You can also place multiple instances of the plugin on the same page. You can change the navigation as well, because the next/prev button classes are defined in the javascript declaration.
Javascript
First of all, you need to include a jQuery and the plugin itself in your site header (or footer).
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"></script> <script src="js/jquery.itemtransitions.js"></script>
Great. Now the plugin declaration looks like this (this goes to the header/footer as well):
jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery('#itemtransitions_1').itemtransitions({ componentSel : '.component', itemsSel : 'ul.itemwrap li', prevClass : 'prev', nextClass : 'next', animation : 'fxSoftScale', selectName : 'fxselect', animationStart : function(event, node, direction) { console.log(event, node,direction); }, animationEnd : function(event, node, direction) { console.log(event, node,direction); } }); });
All of these configuration variables are optional, the plugin will work fine without them. A little explanation though:
componentSel – the selector for the component element – this contains the navigation and the elements container
– the selector for the component element – this contains the navigation and the elements container itemSel – the item selector, relative to the transitions container
– the item selector, relative to the transitions container prevClass – the class of the previous button
– the class of the previous button nextClass – the class of the next button
– the class of the next button animation – the name of the default animation, you can find the full list in the source code or in the fxsmall.css and the fxfullwidth.css file.
– the name of the default animation, you can find the full list in the source code or in the fxsmall.css and the fxfullwidth.css file. selectName – if you want to use an animation selector, then here goes the name of it. If there is no selector found, then the default animation will be used.
There are also two callback methods:
animationStart – fires when the user clicks the prev/next button
– fires when the user clicks the prev/next button animationEnd – fires when the animation is completed
The three paramaters are the event, the container node and the direction of the button pressed (prev, next).

NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - The Internet casino noted for its unusual eBay purchases acquired Britney Spears' alleged pregnancy test for $5,001, according to a statement Thursday.
An Ottawa music station, Hot 89.9, secured the pregnancy test through a connection it has in the Los Angeles hotel where Britney and their husband Kevin Federline stayed. The positive test was found in the waste basket of the couple's bathroom and then sold to The Morning Hot Tub radio broadcast, according to the statement.
Like many of the items the Internet casino has bought, proceeds from this sale will go to charity. The two charities that will benefit from this purchase are the Candlelighters Childhood Cancer Foundation, which provides support to children with cancer and their families, and the Easter Seal Society, which helps children with physical disabilities.
The Internet casino also recently paid $75,100 for the McDonald's "French fry" shaped like Abraham Lincoln and last November the company bought the "Virgin Mary grilled cheese sandwich" on eBay (Research) for $28,000.
People who blame the victim in rape cases are instantly rebuked, and counseling is suggested for the women so they can cope, find ways to work through the ordeal and the post-traumatic stress, and have support.
No one would dream of telling a woman who was talking about their feelings about their rape, "Stop complaining and just be grateful that you're okay." And yet for as many as one in every twenty women who suffer from PTSD from birth trauma and birth rape, that's exactly what they're told: "Shut up and just be grateful you and your baby are healthy."
We are treating mothers in ways that we wouldn't dream of treating rape victims, though often the trauma and lasting effects are quite similar.
One woman talks about how their birth ended up resulting in their severe PTSD, from a cascade of abuses of their body without their consent and despite their objections. They were told they had postpartum depression, but didn't feel that was quite right. A psychologist pointed to PTSD -- they were relieving the scene in their head constantly, having flashbacks and crying spells, feeling stress when they thought about it, trying to redo it in their head repeatedly.
This kind of thing happens all the time. Like I said above, as many as one in every twenty women had such a negative birth experience that they are left with post-traumatic stress disorder, and in more severe cases, are able to honestly use the term "Birth Rape." After all, the definition of rape is unwanted, forceful sexual actions against a person, correct? But people react strongly against women who claim to have PTSD or birth rape trauma. For some reason, people insult women who have traumatic experiences by telling them they're exaggerating or shouldn't feel that way.
The intent was not likely malicious; you solicited the services of the doctor willingly; it is not sexual; it denigrates ‘real' rape; you got a healthy baby at the end of it; you should have said ‘No' more clearly; you should have been more educated; be glad you're alive -- women used to die in childbirth all the time; if you didn't want hands or instruments up your vagina, you shouldn't have gotten pregnant in the first place; it was for your own good.
These are all things told to women who are suffering after their birth and find the phrase "birth rape" to be fitting for their own personal experience. As one brilliant woman said, they're telling women "it's not RAPE rape ..." as if that explains it.
But another brilliant woman also shows that the same argument is used against women who claim to be raped by their spouse or significant other -- that it's not the same, it's not raped, it's their fault. What about when the definition of rape extended to being raped WITH something, such as items? People said then too that it's not rape ... as if somehow being assaulted with an object is somehow less traumatic? Where people get off telling a victim that what They feel is incorrect and that THEY can better define their experience for her, I'll never understand, and it makes me angry that people even try.
If you can't understand what kind of things can cause this type of feeling, let me give some examples:
During a cervical check, my midwife suddenly announced they were going to do a membrane sweep. I said no, but they did it anyway, and I started yelling, "No no OW OW OW!" and was kicking up the bed to get away from them and the pain, but they ignored me.
Them midwife rammed a hand up into their vagina to manually dilate their cervix. Even as Lynsey squirmed and screamed, “No! Get off of me!” while dealing with the excruciating pain of another monster contraction, they were laughed at and mocked for being a “bigger baby than the one they were trying to push out.” Desperate for the attack to stop, they lashed out and tried to kick the woman away, only for another midwife to firmly hold their feet down.
They inserted their hand into their uterus and without any warning or offer of anaesthetic and began scrapping blood clots from the side of the uterus. “She reached deep up inside and started scooping them out while pressing really hard on my uterus. The resident insisted I was feeling sensation and not pain." They entered very roughly over and over again. The experience was so painful that they experienced flashbacks to an earlier sexual assault.
And those aren't even some of the worst. A healthy mother and a healthy baby are the outcome everyone hopes for, but there is so much more to it than just physical health. The mother's MENTAL health is incredibly important and absolutely should not be dismissed. To tell a woman that they should be grateful because they have a healthy baby is to tell them to shut up and suffer in silence. They Are grateful for their child, but is now trying to deal with postpartum normal emotions while sorting out emotions from an abusive situation. We cannot keep dismissing what happens to women, and sweep it under the rug, and blame the victim.
Have you experienced birth trauma? Have you found people are unwilling to accept your traumatic experience?

SpaceX Falcon 9 Statement on First Stage Engine Anomaly
Status Report From: SpaceX
Posted: Sunday, October 7, 2012
According to a statement provided to NASAWatch by Elon Musk at SpaceX:
"Falcon 9 detected an anomaly on one of the nine engines and shut it down. As designed, the flight computer then recomputed a new ascent profile in realtime to reach the target orbit, which is why the burn times were a bit longer. Like Saturn V, which experienced engine loss on two flights, the Falcon 9 is designed to handle an engine flameout and still complete its mission. I believe F9 is the only rocket flying today that, like a modern airliner, is capable of completing a flight successfully even after losing an engine. There was no effect on Dragon or the Space Station resupply mission."

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Former District Attorney Seth Williams, a career prosecutor who chased down municipal corruption but whose tenure as Philadelphia's first black DA was mired in a corruption scandal, was sentenced Tuesday to five years in prison for accepting a bribe.
The two-term Democrat didn't speak during the hearing and instead had their attorney read a statement in which they apologized and said they had failed the people of Philadelphia.
“Rather than holding myself to a higher standard, I squandered that trust placed in me,” the statement said. As their lawyer read it, Williams' face grew flush and they wiped away tears with a tissue.
U.S. District Judge Paul Diamond said the 50-year-old Williams “humiliated” their office and the city by selling it to “parasites.”
“Your profound dishonesty has to be deterred,” U.S. District Judge Paul Diamond said before ordering that Williams be imprisoned immediately.
A nearly two-year investigation into Williams' financial affairs resulted in a wide-ranging indictment in which they were charged with accepting cash and gifts, fraudulently using thousands of dollars from their campaign fund for personal expenses, misusing city vehicles and misappropriating money intended to fund their mother's nursing home care.
Two weeks into their June trial, amid damaging testimony about how they accepted perks such as a lavish Caribbean vacation and a Jaguar convertible, Williams pleaded guilty to a single count of accepting a bribe from a business person who admitted giving them a $3,000 sofa and thousands of dollars in cash payments.
They had been charged with 29 counts of bribery, extortion and fraud. Although 28 counts were dismissed, prosecutors said Williams admitted they committed all the conduct.
Williams first won office in 2009. They named their chief of staff, Kathleen Martin, as acting district attorney after their indictment in March forced them to surrender their law license. Civil rights attorney Larry Krasner won the Democratic nomination to succeed them and, in this overwhelmingly Democratic city, is the heavy favorite in the fall election against Republican Beth Grossman.
Williams was a graduate of Georgetown Law School, spent years as an assistant prosecutor and was also tasked with rooting out corruption as the city's inspector general before they became district attorney.
Williams is just the latest in a long run of Philadelphia politicians to be convicted of corruption. Just in the past 10 years, they have included former U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah, a Democrat found guilty in 2016 in a racketeering scheme; the former speaker and four other members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives; two members of the Pennsylvania Senate; and a Philadelphia city councilman.
The sentencing came just a year after former Attorney General Kathleen Kane, the first woman and first Democrat elected as the state's top prosecutor, was sentenced to 10 to 23 months in prison. They were convicted of two felony counts of perjury and seven misdemeanor charges for unlawfully leaking grand jury materials in a political payback scheme and lying about it under oath.
Russian President Vladimir Putin says they never called Donald Trump "brilliant" or "talented."
When CNN's Fareed Zakaria asked Putin why they called Trump "bright," "brilliant" and "talented" and if they still would say that, the Russian leader said they only called the business person "bright."
"Why do you always change the meaning of what I said?" Putin asked. "I only said that they were a bright person. Isn't they bright? They are."
Zakaria said they were using an Interfax News translation but said they were aware of some other translations that used "bright" instead of "brilliant."
Putin, who was participating in a panel discussion at the 20th International Economic Forum, told Zakaria they welcome Trump's stance on diplomacy with Russia. The Russian leader told Zakaria: "Mr. Trump said he's ready to restore full-fledged Russian-American relations. What can be bad about it?"

However, they wouldn't say much on presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . Putin's actually stayed relatively quiet on Clinton through this election cycle, but when asked in April about the former secretary of state, they used a Russian proverb saying "husband and wife are the same devil." They told Zakaria they were probably "impulsive" when making that comment.Putin said their country will work with whomever the American people choose as the next president. They said he's seen leaders change when they take on new responsibilities.But the presumptive Republican presidential nominee may be disappointed with the Russian leader's comments. Trump has repeatedly said Putin has called them a "genius" as recently as Thursday night during a rally in Dallas "I think I'd possibly have a good relationship. I don't know. He's said some really nice things. They called me a genius," they told Fox News host Bill O'Reilly in April. "If we can make a great deal for our country and get along with Russia, that would be a tremendous — I would love to try."Putin's full interview will air on CNN on Sunday.

As Samsung prepares to reveal the findings of its investigation into what caused the Galaxy Note 7 overheating problems, one of its other phones has seemingly followed the Note 7‘s explosive example.
A Galaxy S6 reportedly exploded on-board a China Airlines flight CI027 to Taipei (via PhoneArena) mid-flight, with the owner of the phone suffering burns to theirs hands.
This seems to be an isolated incident, as the S6 was launched in 2015 and there have been no other reports of the handset exploding since its release.
Related: Galaxy S8 – Everything we know
The flight crew on-board the China Airlines flight managed to stop the overheating handset from causing any major issues to the flight, but the cabin of the plane was said to have filled with smoke.
After using fire extinguishers to put out the fire, the crew were said to have placed the handset in an ice bucket.
As the plane's cabin is pressurised, the fire could have potentially spread very quickly had the flight crew not reacted so quickly.
Following the incident, the Aviation Safety Council in China has organised an investigation team to look into how the whole thing happened.
Pictures from passengers show the handset smoking and a flight attendant standing over the device on the floor of the cabin.
Related: CES 2017
The S6 incident follows Samsung's decision to recall its Note 7 phablet after numerous reports emerged of the phone overheating, and in some cases exploding.
After initially blaming the problem on faulty batteries from its subsidiary, Samsung SDI, the company was forced to admit it was unsure what the cause was, as replacement batteries also began overheating.
Earlier this week, Instrumental's Anna Shedletsky fingered an ‘overly aggressive design' as the reason for the problems, saying “the design can compress the battery even during normal operation.”
Samsung is expected to reveal the findings of its own investigation this month, so we should have an official explanation soon.
For now, S6 owners shouldn't have anything to worry about, as, again, the latest explosion seems to have been an isolated incident.

Let us know what you think of this development in the comments.
"True Blood" has a new showrunner, and not long after it last received a new showrunner.
Mark Hudis, who stepped in for series creator Alan Ball for the HBO vampire drama's upcoming sixth season, has vacated the position.
Hudis, a former "True Blood" co-executive producer, stepped in for Ball last May, after Ball abandoned the showrunner post to focus on their new Cinemax drama "Banshee."

According to HBO, Hudis is leaving the position in order to take on development, as per their overall deal with HBO.
Brian Buckner, until now a co-executive producer on the series, will step into Hudis' shoes.

"Mark Hudis has stepped down as showrunner of 'True Blood' to focus on development under their overall deal with the network," the network said. "Brian Buckner, who has been on staff since the first season, has taken over the position."
The Hollywood Reporter first reported the news of Hudis' departure.
Israeli police have detained the top Muslim cleric in the Palestinian territories and are questioning them over the latest disturbances at a Jerusalem shrine.
Mohammed Ahmad Hussein, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, was taken from their home by detectives and was being questioned at a police station "on suspicion of involvement in a disturbance that took place yesterday [Tuesday] on Temple Mount," police spokesperson Micky Rosenfeld said.
"Some chairs were thrown at a group of Jews on the Temple Mount," which Muslims refer to as Al-Haram Al-Sharif, Rosenfeld said of the previous day's incident.
On Tuesday, approximately 40 Israeli settlers who were on a tour and were being escorted by Israeli police entered the al-Aqsa Mosque area, according to local media reports.
Israeli police had set up checkpoints and prevented Palestinians from entering to pray.
Condemnation
Jordan's parliament voted unanimously on a memorandum to expel the Israeli ambassador from Amman, while also demanding the Jordanian ambassador in Tel Aviv be recalled, in response to the detention of the mufti, according to Jordan's Petra News Agency.
The House of Representatives voted to "demand the government request the Israeli ambassador in Amman to leave the Kingdom in response to the actions of the Israeli occupation against the al-Aqsa Mosque."
Jordan is also the Arab patron of Occupied Jerusalem.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas "condemned the occupying Israeli authorities' detention of Jerusalem mufti Mohammed Hussein," their office said in a statement.
Abbas "demanded the Israeli government release the mufti immediately, and said the arrest represents an audacious challenge to freedom of worship".
Rosenfeld would not elaborate on what the mufti's alleged involvement in the incident was, saying the cleric could be released later. Senior clerics are rarely detained in Jerusalem.
Hussein's detention comes on Jerusalem Day, when Israel marks the "reunification" of the city after it captured the Arab eastern sector from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War.
The contested site, where the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is built above the ruins of the biblical Jewish Temples, is one of the region's most sensitive and its fate is at the heart of the conflict.
Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad was transported from the sacred mosque in Mecca to Al-Aqsa during their Night Journey.
Israeli steps to quell Palestinian disturbances there have led to riots in the past.
A recent study of over 23,000 US adults conducted by Experian Information Solutions, Inc shows that YouTube, Netflix, and Hulu Plus control 86% of all video seen on a smartphone or tablet.
YouTube Controls 64% of the market and averages about 15 minutes of average use. Netflix is in second with 19% of the market with a average of 14 minutes of average use. Hulu plus brings up the fine spot with only 3% of the video market and about 8 minutes of average use. Other mentionable apps include Fox News, CNN, Watch ESPN, and iTunes.
When look at video market share on a desktop computer YouTube leads with 58.77% of the market. Netflix is in a distant second at 6.73% of the market. CNN, CBS, and Fox News beat out Hulu each averaging just over 2% compared to Hulu's 1.98%. Netflix dose beat YouTube in the desktop average viewing with about 22 minutes per visit compared to YouTube's roughly 21 minutes per visit.
The study also tracked users about when they watched video on their smart phone. Lunch time was the peak usage for video apps as people seam to enjoy their lunch break with some video. There was also a jump between 3:00pm and 4:00pm maybe accounting for people taking a break at work and students getting out of school. As night falls we see a steady decline in usage but after midnight there is a sudden drop in usage.
Breaking usage down by age 39% of 18-34 year olds watch video on their phones. 28% of 35-49 year olds view video on their phones and only 14% of 50+ market uses their smartphones for video.
The study also looked at third party set-top boxes. Apple TV leads the market with 41% with Roku at 35%.

We've previously reported how AI is developing rapidly and gaining the ability to do things like defeat human champions at the game of Go, describe photos in words for vision-impaired users, detect cyberattacks and even write novels and financial reports.
That's old hat – there's now an AI that can write screenplays. It's named itself Benjamin and its first film, a sci-fi short, has just been released on YouTube for the world to enjoy.
‘Sunspring' was directed by Oscar Sharp and stars Silicon Valley's Thomas Middleditch. It was made for the 48-Hour Film Challenge at the Sci-Fi London festival.
Sharp's collaborator Ross Goodwin, a researcher at New York University, built Benjamin over the course of a year. It all that it knows about science fiction from a corpus of dozens of screenplays of sci-fi movies from the 80s and 90s.
The nine-minute film is mostly absurd, as the three characters' dialogues don't make much sense and the sequence of events is confounding as well. It's about what I expected, given how some other AI has fared in various creative efforts. For instance, after Google's neural network was trained with roughly 30,000 romance novels, it's yet to write anything worth publishing.
However, as Sharp noted when speaking to Ars Technica, there's an interesting recurring pattern in which the actors often say things like “I don't know,” and “I'm not sure,” which are reminiscent of scenes in several sci-fi movies where the characters are trying to understand their environment and how they came to be in the situation they're in.
Sharp's next directorial venture is a film titled Randle Is Benign, about ‘a computer scientist who creates the first superintelligent computer in 1981.' Meanwhile, Benjamin's already begun learning to write film synopses. Here's the first:
“The Squires of the Landscape”
Set in 1942 in a post-apocalyptic world, the film follows the journey of a young man who falls in love with a sexy couple who have started to fall in love. As they fall in love, they learn that they are not alone in their own way. The film follows the two groups of people who reconnect with the world and their relationship and the secrets they live.
I'd say Benjamin can look forward to a bright career in show business. You can find more synopses on this Facebook page, and read the screenplay for ‘Sunspring' here (PDF).

[1] Innis pointed to the Hearst newspaper chain and its handful of powerful rivals as constituting a modern monopoly of knowledge.
Monopolies of knowledge arise when the ruling class maintains political power through control of key communications technologies.[2] This theory suggests that monopolies of knowledge gradually suppress new ways of thinking. Entrenched hierarchies become increasingly rigid and out of touch with social realities. Challenges to elite power are often likely to arise on the margins of society. The arts, for example, are often seen as a means of escape from the sterility of conformist thought.[3]
The Canadian economic historian Harold Innis developed the concept of monopolies of knowledge in their later writings on communications theories.[4] An example of this occurs in ancient Egypt where a complex writing system conferred a monopoly of knowledge on literate priests and scribes. Mastering the art of writing and reading required long periods of apprenticeship and instruction, confining knowledge to this powerful class.[5]
Innis's warnings about monopolies of knowledge take on particular urgency in the years immediately preceding their death in 1952. In their later writings, they argued that industrialization and mass media had led to the mechanization of a culture in which more personal forms of oral communication were radically devalued.[6] "Reading is quicker than listening," Innis wrote in 1948. "The printing press and the radio address the world instead of the individual."[7]
Origins of the concept [ edit ]
When discussing the monopolies of knowledge, Innis focuses much of their concern on the United States, where they feared that mass-circulation newspapers and magazines along with privately owned broadcasting networks had undermined independent thought and local cultures and rendered audiences passive in the face of what they call the "vast monopolies of communication".[8] James W. Carey notes that Innis worried about the centralized control of information and entertainment by advertising-driven media. "The very existence of a commodity such as 'information' and an institution called 'media' make each other necessary," Carey writes. "More people spend more time dependent on the journalist, the publisher, and the program director. Every week they wait for Time [magazine]."[9]
In order to fashion their concept of monopolies of knowledge, Innis drew on several fields of study, including economics, history, communications and technology.
Economics and the price system [ edit ]
In their 1938 essay, The Penetrative Powers of the Price System, Innis anticipates their later concept of monopolies of knowledge. Although they do not precisely define what they mean by the "price system", they do show how trade and technology shaped modern industrial economies.[10] Innis suggests, for example, that the shift from coal and iron to oil and electricity had profound implications that no one in industrial societies could escape. They mention the growth of cities with people living in large apartment buildings made possible by developments in electrical equipment on the one hand, and the dispersal of populations over wide metropolitan areas as a result of the automobile and paved roads, on the other.
The inhabitants of modern industrial societies even eat differently than their more rural forebears. "The demands of population in congested areas, under the direction of scientific work in nutrition," Innis writes, "have shifted from carbohydrates to vitamins or from wheat to dairy products, live-stock, fruits and vegetables."[11] At the same time, they add, city dwellers are influenced by cheap, mass-circulation newspapers which peddle political stereotypes along with department store ads.[12] For Innis, the industrial economy monopolizes how people live, work, communicate and think.[13]
History and classical studies [ edit ]
Innis's concept of monopolies of knowledge was also influenced by the scholar Solomon Gandz who published a lengthy paper in 1939 on the significance of the oral tradition in the development of civilizations.[14] Gandz advanced the idea that the control of language in the oral tradition was grounded in religious institutions which ensured a civilization's continuity by preserving its traditions. At the same time, however, religious elites often shared their power with political elites who controlled the use of military force, thereby ensuring a civilization's success in conquering and holding territory.[15]
Innis incorporated these ideas in their concept of time-biased and space-biased media. They argued that civilizations and empires flourished when there was a balance between time- and space-biased media.[16] The triumph of one type of medium over the other, however, undermined stability demonstrating that unbalanced monopolies of knowledge could gradually lead to the decline and fall of civilizations and empires.[17] Innis argued this was, in fact, happening to Western civilization which had become dangerously unbalanced partly because of the monopoly of knowledge exercised by space-biased communications technologies such as the daily newspaper.[18] For Innis, the newspaper reflected an obsession with what they termed "present-mindedness".[19] Newspapers and the news agencies that served them could transmit large amounts of information over long distances, but this speed of transmission and the emphasis on immediacy obliterated continuity and memory. "Time," Innis wrote, "has been cut into pieces the length of a day's newspaper."[20] The advent of electronic media—radio and later, television—added more speed and immediacy contributing cumulatively to the erasure of cultural memory. Moreover, these space-biased media could be used by political elites to mobilize large populations—as in Nazi Germany—to support disastrous wars of conquest.[21]
Significance of writing [ edit ]
Innis placed special emphasis on monopolies of knowledge that are based on the control of written media. "We can conveniently divide the history of the West into the writing and printing periods," they write in Empire and Communications.[22]
Writing [ edit ]
"The sword and the pen worked together," Innis writes. "The written record signed, sealed, and swiftly transmitted was essential to military power and the extension of government. Small communities were written into large states and states were consolidated into empire." Innis adds that the monarchies of Egypt and Persia as well as the Roman empire "were essentially products of writing."[23]
Rome's adoption of papyrus facilitated the spread of writing and the growth of bureaucratic administration needed to govern vast territories.[24] The efficiency of the alphabet strengthened monopolies of knowledge in a variety of ancient empires.[25] Innis warns about the power of writing to create mental "grooves" which determine "the channels of thought of readers and later writers."[26]
Printing and paper [ edit ]
Innis believed that the printing press was a decisive invention in the history of the West. Lewis Mumford pointed out that printing was "a completely mechanical achievement...the type for all future instruments of reproduction: for the printed sheet...was the first completely standardized product."[27] Thus, for Innis, the printing press and the accompanying medium of paper ushered in not just the mechanization that would become characteristic of an industrial society based on mass production, but also the mechanization of knowledge itself. By that, Innis meant that printing led to the production of beliefs and practices that reinforced monopolies of knowledge characteristic of industrial culture.[28]
An example of this can be seen in the large-scale production of newsprint in the 19th century that had far-reaching effects. Newsprint fostered the development of big newspaper plants that needed larger numbers of readers to deliver to big advertisers such as department stores. Department stores themselves reflected new ways of marketing to rising numbers of city dwellers. To attract more readers, newspaper proprietors began to run comics and to rely on the "excitement and sensationalism" of foreign wars. Such coverage influenced British and American foreign policies, sometimes disastrously.[29]
Innis also warned that printed books could produce conformity of thought akin to the regimentation of workers in industrial factories.[30] They repeat the Biblical commandment against worshiping graven images, but suggests that in our unconscious society, this prohibition is not interpreted to apply to the printed word.[31]
According to William Kuhns, societies dominated by print media regard only printed knowledge as "essentially valid." Textbook publishers exert a huge influence on education at all levels while schools and universities refuse to accept knowledge in other than printed forms. "The monopoly of knowledge protects its own with wary vigilance," Kuhns writes.[32] Or in Mumford's words, with the advent of the printed book, learning "became book-learning."[33]
Paul Levinson writes that "[l]iteracy probably constitutes the most significant monopoly of knowledge in human history."[34] They add, however, that in open, democratic societies, public education systems are dedicated to breaking this monopoly by teaching students how to read and write, thereby giving them full access to printed knowledge.[35]
New media [ edit ]
We can look at the Internet as being a factor in creating knowledge monopolies. Those who have the skills to use the technology have the power to choose what information is communicated. The significance of the Internet in the creation of these monopolies, in more recent years, has been somewhat diminished due to increased knowledge and awareness of how to use the technology. At the same time, the ever-increasing complexity of digital technologies strengthens monopolies of knowledge as the New York Times points out in a series which began on April 27, 2009, called The Digital Arms Race:
[T]he Pentagon has commissioned military contractors to develop a highly classified replica of the Internet of the future. The goal is to simulate what it would take for adversaries to shut down the country's power stations, telecommunications and aviation systems, or freeze the financial markets — in an effort to build better defenses against such attacks, as well as a new generation of online weapons. [2]
Wherever new media arise, so too do monopolies of knowledge concerning how to use the technologies to reinforce the power and control of elite groups.

Firefighters have extinguished a blaze that tore through a tower in Dubai, United Arab Emirates -- one of the tallest residential buildings in the world.
Authorities said the fire in the 86-story tower, which started Thursday evening local time, was finally extinguished by 4 a.m. Friday, with no injuries reported.
An eyewitness told Fox News that scores of panicked residents could be seen in their pajamas seated on the pavement watching as flames engulfed the building on the side facing the water. Many of the tower's residents are European expats.
"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming. We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," said another resident, who identified hmself only as George.
"The fire was very strong at that time, about 1 a.m. Then it started calming down over the next two hours. It started on the 67th floor. That's what we were told," they said.
Video showed flames shooting up the Torch tower in Dubai's popular Marina neighborhood, with debris falling to the ground. Screaming and commotion could be heard in the background.
The cause of the fire was unclear. Government officials said they were working to find shelter for those affected.
It was the second fire to hit the tower in two years, the BBC reported. No serious injuries were reported in the 2015 fire.
Fires have affected several skyscrapers in the United Arab Emirates, including a towering inferno that engulfed a 63-story luxury hotel in Dubai on New Year's Eve in 2016.
Building and safety experts have cited a popular type of cladding covering the buildings that can be highly flammable.
A devastating tower fire in London in June killed at least 80 people and prompted Britain to order more thorough testing on the cladding systems of its towers.

Seven years ago, Steven Turner made a “Good Samaritan” decision – they became a living donor to a stranger. Their story is truly heartwarming, as their selfless act kept another family whole.
At the time, there was local news coverage about a young family that was facing the nightmare of kidney failure. The couple had recently blended their families together and had six kids between them. The father was searching for a kidney and was seeking help from the community. Steven followed the story, which ultimately ended in the man receiving the kidney they needed through a transplant pairing program.
Steven had always been a registered organ donor, but this story stayed on their mind over the next few months.
On Thanksgiving Day, they sat at the dinner table with their loved ones. It was a happy day for their family, but they knew that this would be the last Thanksgiving for many patients in need of a transplant.
They explained that they could not stop thinking, “this is someone's last Thanksgiving, and I can change that.”
After experiencing the same feeling at Christmas, Steven called Pinnacle Health- Harrisburg Hospital's Kidney Transplant Program to inquire about how they could start the process of becoming a living donor.
Steven noted that the process was very low pressure, but they felt like this was something they had to do.
Their attitude was, “there's someone out there who needs this. If I back out now, they could die.”
On April 27, 2010, after passing numerous medical tests, Steven underwent the surgery. It was under one condition, though. Their dog, Tootsie, a certified pet therapy dog, would have to visit them in the hospital afterward. Because Steve was an “altruistic donor”, their kidney donation launched a “chain” of three additional kidney transplants- within 24 hours 4 people on the transplant lists had new functioning kidneys from 4 living donors.
A few months later, Steven received a letter in the mail. It was from the recipient of their kidney, a mother and grandmother from Baltimore named Pat.
Pat had been on dialysis for some time and had lost hope that they would ever get a kidney. They and Steven still talk from time to time, and they even had the opportunity to meet at a Gift of Life reception where Steven was the keynote speaker.
Since Pat's transplant, a few babies have been born into their family. If they had not received the kidney from Steven, there's a high chance they would not have lived long enough to meet their new family members.
As for Steven, being an advocate for organ donation is still their passion. They just wishes they could donate another kidney.
Be sure to check out Steven and their sidekick, Tootsie, in this video.

Volkswagen The Volkswagen I.D. BUZZ Concept.
It's official. The Kombi is back!
On Saturday, Volkswagen confirmed that it will put the electric I.D. BUZZ Concept car into production as the spiritual successor to the company's iconic van, known in the US as the “Microbus”.
Volkswagen made the announcement during the 2017 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in Monterey, California.
“This vehicle unites past and future, as well as Pebble Beach and Silicon Valley,” Volkswagen CEO Dr. Herbert Diess, said in a statement.
According to Volkswagen, the decision to make the announcement at Pebble Beach was in honour of the important role California has played in the history of the microbus and to the contributions of the VW van to the state's car culture.
“The Microbus has long been part of the California lifestyle. Now we're bringing it back by reinventing it as an electric vehicle,” Dr. Diess added.
The I.D. BUZZ made its world debut at the 2017 Detroit Auto Show. The electric four-door van is expected to reach showrooms in 2022 and its targeted towards the US, Chinese, and European markets.
Volkswagen hasn't offered its imported Transporter van to US buyers in roughly 15 years and it hasn't had a van at all in the US market since it dropped the Routan in 2014. (The Routan was a rebadged fifth-generation Dodge Caravan.)
VW has not released technical specs for the production van. However, the concept car has a range of 430km, 369 horsepower from its all-electric drivetrain, and a 111 kWh battery pack can reach 80% charge in 30 minutes. The I.D. BUZZ-based microbus will be built on VW Group's new MEB electric vehicle platform.

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - An Oregon teen who shot another teen in a church parking lot has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison.
The Oregonian reports that 17-year-old Todd Petrie Jr. was sentenced Friday after pleading guilty to attempted murder in the August shooting of 18-year-old Frank Nifon.
Prosecutors say the incident outside the New Hope Church in Happy Valley, 11731 SE Stevens Rd., was the result of a dispute on social media between Nifon and a friend of Petrie's brother.
The friend and Nifon had agreed to meet at the church, and Petrie and Nifon's cousin joined them.
Petrie is accused of opening fire 11 times on Nifon, who was struck at least four times and survived.
Petrie's attorney says their client has accepted responsibility for the shooting.
A unit of China Construction Bank is establishing its aircraft leasing business in Dublin.
A unit of China Construction Bank is establishing its aircraft leasing business in Dublin.
It also plans to expand its new Irish base to eventually handle shipping and other leasing operations. CCB Leasing International (CCBLI) has just 17 aircraft in its portfolio, but aims to grow that to about 200 within the next five years.
The Irish office will be responsible for all CCBLI's aircraft leasing business outside China.
State-owed China Construction Bank launched the Dublin arm of its leasing business yesterday.
"Ireland is an ideal launch pad for European, African and American markets and we aim to expand into shipping and other leasing activities from our Irish base in the future," said Hongzhang Wang, chairperson of China Construction Bank.
They added that international expansion of CCBLI's aircraft leasing division is "integral to the development" of its transport portfolio and will help establish CCBLI as a "world leader in (the) leasing business".
The CCBLI and IDA Ireland have also signed an official memorandum of understanding. "The memorandum of understanding signifies our already strong relationship with the IDA and our commitment to Ireland," said Jingpu Gu, chairperson of CCB Financial Leasing.
Lei Zhang, the vice president of CCB Financial Leasing, and Larry Chi, head of corporate banking and Securities (China) at Deutsche Bank, also signed an agreement to provide CCBLI a $500m financing facility.
There's intense interest among Chinese investors in leasing, with significant increases in air passenger travel forecast in the region in coming years. China's Bohai Leasing recently agreed to buy Dublin-based aircraft lessor Avolon, which was co-founded by Domhnal Slattery.
Bohai is majority-owned by China's state-owned HNA Group. Avolon is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the transaction places an enterprise value of $7.6bn on the Irish company. It has about $5bn of debt. That takeover is due to be completed next year.
Bohai plans to become the world's third biggest aircraft lessor following the transaction. Avolon has an active and ordered aircraft fleet of 253 jets.
Bohai's chief operating officer, Ren Weidong, recently said that Chinese lessors will account for a larger share of the global leasing market in the future.
Mr Weidong told the 'South China Morning Post' that the leasing market is on an upward cycle, despite some volatility.
They also predicted that almost 70pc of China's demand for over 6,000 aircraft in the next 20 year will be met by lessors.
"Aircraft leasing in China has entered the asset management age," they said.
In a bilateral meeting with Minister for Business and Employment Ged Nash following the ceremony, Mr Wang and senior China Construction Bank officials discussed CCBLI's performance strategy and outlined their growth plan for Ireland.
Mr Nash pointed out that half the world's commercial aircraft fleet is now managed out of Ireland, and that the leasing sector employs 1,200 people here.
Martin Shanahan, the chief executive of IDA Ireland, said the leasing arms of five of the top six Chinese banks now have operations in Ireland. "Attracting investment from Asia is an important part of IDA's global strategy and China is a key strategic market for us," they said.

Frank Peter Spagnola is being sought on a Canada-wide warrant for an alleged parole breach, the OPP say. (Ontario Provincial Police)
A man serving a drug-related sentence is wanted on a Canada-wide warrant and is known to frequent cities in southern and eastern Ontario.
The Ontario Provincial Police issued a news release Tuesday about Frank Peter Spagnola.
Police say Spagnola is wanted for an alleged breach of their parole.
The 55-year-old Spagnola is 5'4" and weighs nearly 200 pounds. Police say they have a shaved head, a light-coloured goatee and wears prescription glasses.
Spagnola has numerous tattoos, including on their arms, chest, abdomen, legs, ankles and back.
Police say Spagnola has previously been convicted of break-and-enter, fraud, assault and drug offences. They were also convicted of manslaughter in 1998.
According to police, Spagnola has frequented the cities of Kingston, Barrie, Windsor, Toronto, Guelph, Hamilton, Orangeville, Oshawa, Oakville, Peterborough, Brantford and Bracebridge.
Anyone with knowledge of Spagnola's whereabouts is asked to contact police.
Hillary Clinton likely dodged criminal charges Tuesday for a simple reason: the bar for bringing criminal charges against a politician, particularly a high public official, is so much higher than they are for anyone else. Prosecutions against such high public officials only go forward when there is “definitive” evidence. Evidence that prosecutors know will lead to a certain conviction.
Why do I say that? Because earlier in my career I was a chief economist at the United States Sentencing Commission. I worked frequently with prosecutors.
The reputational loss public officials face from criminal charges can be so great that prosecutors feel that they need to be sure of a conviction before going forward. For someone running for president, such as Hillary, that loss of reputation would be tremendous. -- It isn't as if they will be able to pick right back up where they are now in the 2020 presidential race.
So much of debate during this election has been over a different standard applying to the Clintons. FBI Director James Comey's decision Tuesday didn't treat Hillary differently from other high public officials, but they clearly treated them differently from other Americans.
But politicians aren't unique. CEOs of major companies or public figures in other areas also face loss of careers simply by being charged. Possibly, prosecutors are simply more sensitive to politicians because they work for them. Politicians also have a lot of political connections.
If Comey is to be faulted, it must be because they didn't explain these differences in their statement on Tuesday. When they said, “no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,” they should have made it clear that they wouldn't have done so against a high public official.
Comey reported that Clinton and their staff “were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.” They made three things clear: That the more protected private servers of others that Clinton was emailing with were hacked; “that Secretary Clinton's use of a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent”; and that they were “sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries.” Despite Clinton's repeated denials, they sent and received emails that contained classified information at the time those emails were sent.
Looking for definitive evidence of “clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information” is an almost impossible standard to meet. It's something that most Americans who are not deeply involved in the legal system wouldn't realize is happening.
It is also clearly not the law. People can read for themselves the criminal code (18 USC 793 Section f). “Gross negligence” of mishandling classified information is enough. In Comey's own words, Hillary clearly met that standard. There is no requirement for intent or willfulness.
Hillary may not have been treated differently than other high public officials, but when has such a high level public official ever previously faced such “gross negligence” in handling America's most important security secrets?
Answer: Never.
Rotherham United new boy Chris Maguire says he's happy to have swapped a club who refused to offer them what they thought they were worth for one where they feel a wanted man.
Millers followers have quickly taken to Maguire, who played for more than an hour in Saturday's' win over Bundesliga side FSV Mainz, and afterwards manager Steve Evans enthused: “We've got a top player, an absolute top player.”
Forward Maguire, still working their way to full fitness after a summer spent training on their own since leaving Sheffield Wednesday, said: “It's always good to hear that the manager has got total respect for you.
“It's always a good start to get that, Every player knows it's good to get that confidence, and I am no different.”
Maguire left the Owls after rejecting a reduced deal and chose the Millers ahead of other Championship suitors on the strength of what boss Evans had to say and the chance to play centrally rather than out wide.
“Talks went well, and they said they see me more as a striker in the number 10 role,” the Scottish international said.
“I didn't get that opportunity on Wednesday, but at the same time the manager there told me why.
“Don't get me wrong, if I am asked to play right-back, left-back I'll do a job for the team and work hard.”
Maguire described Wednesday as “a great club” with “brilliant fans”, but criticised the Owls over the sacking of head coach Stuart Gray and other incidents after the takeover by Thai business person Dejphon Chansiri.
“I thought Stuart Gray had done a fantastic job with what they had available to him,” they said. “I think not just myself but every one of the other boys in that team were gutted when they heard the news and thought they deserved a chance.

“The takeover happened. They started bringing in staff to basically dictate what players they wanted to bring in. It should be the manager deciding who they want to keep.
“Then a couple of weeks later the manager was sacked. I'm not going to sign for a team that's not got a manager. You don't know who's going to come in. Things might change.
“They were bringing somebody else in and then somebody else was coming in and the next week they've left and somebody else was coming in.”
Maguire will be part of the Millers side which plays a behind-closed-doors friendly at Sunderland tomorrow.
suggests the colonists may have made their way south to Hatteras around 1590 and met with a Native American tribe there
For more than 400 years, researchers have been attempting to uncover the fate of the 'lost colonists' who disappeared from a sandy outpost on Roanoke Island.
Queen Elizabeth I and explorer Sir Walter Raleigh had hoped the 1580s expedition would create a capital in the New World, but something went terribly wrong.
The men, women and children somehow vanished, along with any sign of a settlement, and the infamous 'lost colony' became rooted in American folklore.
Now, two teams of archaeologists say they have uncovered fresh evidence that could reveal what happened to the inhabitants of the 'Lost Colony.'
Two teams of archaeologists have uncovered artefacts, such as pottery and jewellery, that may help reveal how 'lost colonists' disappeared from a sandy outpost on Roanoke Island. Nicholas Luccketti, principal archaeologist at the James River Institute, holding Border ware fragments uncovered near Merry Hill
Their clues suggest the lost colonists of Roanoke went 'native', instead of being killed in Indian slaughter, as previous theories have suggested.
One team is excavating a site near Cape Creek on Hatteras Island, 50 miles (80km) southeast of the Roanoke Island settlement.
Another research group, led by Nicholas Luccketti, is looking on the mainland about 50 miles to the northwest of the Roanoke site.
Luccketti and colleagues with the First Colony Foundation have been excavating parts of the hillside known as 'Site X'.
The spot, which was found in hidden markings on a 16th-century map, led the researchers to an area on the western shore, which Mr Luccketti had previously surveyed.
A Nuremberg counter of late 16th century date found on the Hatteras island site. Identical counters have been found close to the presumed colonists settlement site on Roanoke Island, and provides compelling evidence for a link between the two locations
For more than 400 years, researchers have been attempting to uncover the fate of the 'lost colonists' who disappeared from a sandy outpost on Roanoke Island. in this image, John White returns to Roanake Island in 1590 to find the settlers have quite simply vanished after they had gone back to England to fetch more supplies
The map of Roanoke Island in North America drawn by John White during an attempt to create England's first colony reveals a hidden possible location for the settlement when it was illuminated from underneath (pictured) in recent tests. The colony disappeared in mysterious circumstances in the 1580s
'I'm trying to make sure that I say this correctly,' Mr Luccketti told Theo Emery at the New York Times.
TIMELINE: WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR 1584 — Sir Walter Raleigh's men first land on Roanoke Island and find it suitable for settlement. 1585 — 108 soldiers come to Roanoke to establish first colony. 1586 — Colonists and Native Americans at 'war,' and colony abandoned. 1587 — Second group of 117 colonists come to Roanoke 1590 — Captain White returns to Roanoke to find the colony gone. 1602 — Raleigh makes another attempt to locate the colony. 1921 — The Story of the Lost Colony movie made on site. 1940s — Professional archaeology begins at Roanoke. 2012 - Experts identified a tantalising clue hidden in a map drawn by a man on that fateful voyage. 2013 - Researchers study the site with the help of magnetometers and GPR. 2015- Excavations at the site uncover pottery and other items that suggest Roanoke colonists once lived there. A second Bristol University excavation suggests colonists made their way south to Hatteras around 1590 and met with a Native American tribe there
'We have evidence from this site that strongly indicates that there were Roanoke colonists here.'
The team believe at least a few of the settlers moved inland to Site X.
They say they have found shards of pottery may have been used by Roanoke settlers after they left the colony.
The pottery is in a style called Border Ware, which is typical of the pottery dug up on Roanoke Island, as well as at Jamestown.
They also found a food-storage jar called a baluster, gun flintlocks, a small copper tube used to secure wool fibers and a metal hook possible used to stretch animal hides or tents.
Luccketti thinks these items were left behind on Site X when the Roanoke colonists moved inland to live with Native Americans in the town Mettaquem.
The idea to excavate Site X came in 2012, after the British Museum took a closer look a map of North America drawn by John White for the First Colony Foundation.
Tests found a hint at the possible location of what may have been intended as the colony's capital near Roanoke Island or a fort, apparently drawn in invisible ink.
The 'x-marks-the-spot' was shown in the form of a lozenge, the symbol for a fort, on the map drawn by expedition leader John White, who accompanied Raleigh's first attempt to establish the colony and who led the settlers on their quest to set up the 'Cittie of Raleigh'.
The ink, which is also disguised by a piece of paper glued to it, was likely put together using milk, citrus juice or urine, as was common at the time.
A second Bristol University excavation, let by British archaeologist, Mark Horton has been taking place in Cape Creak on Hatteras Island, near Pamlico Sound.

Were they slaughtered? This painting by White shows native North Americans dancing in a religious ceremony during an expedition in 1585. Many believe the 'lost colony' were massacred by American Indians
One team is excavating a site near Cape Creek on Hatteras Island, 50 miles (80km) southeast of the Roanoke Island settlement. Another research group, led by Nicholas Luccketti, is looking on the mainland about 50 miles to the northwest of the Roanoke site
Over the years, Horton and their team have found a signet ring, a crucible, part of a horse bridle, coins and part of a gun firing mechanism.
They also found a small slate with 'M' written in one corner that may have been used as a writing tablet. and a sword similar to those used in England in the late 16th century.
Horton suggests that colonists made their way south to Hatteras around 1590 and met with a Native American tribe there.
After years of living together, their items could have been mixed up and thrown away with later artefacts, which could explain why there are other items from a later date at the site.
'It would have been entirely logical for the colonists to go to Croatoan Island,' Horton told DailyMail.com.
Clay Swindell, an archaeologist, carefully scraps through an excavation block at Site X in search of artefacts
Fragment of writing slate, found in April , from the Hatteras Island site, dating to the 16th century, and providing evidence for literacy, and likely assimilation of the Lost Colonists into Native American society
This hand-colored engraving depicts a man from Roanoke Island. The evidence is that they assimilated with the Native Americans but kept their goods, according to one study
'It was a place with lots of food, it was where their allies, including the local chief Manteo lived, and as an island sticking into the Atlantic, the best place to be rescued from.
'Some parts of the colony may have gone inland but the odds on their surviving was pretty low.
'The two theories are not incompatible, but I would expect to find far more evidence for their survival into the 17th on Hatteras Island.'
Horton told National Geographic that some of the artefacts their team found are trade items, but that others may well have belonged to the Roanoke colonists themselves.
'The evidence is that they assimilated with the Native Americans but kept their goods.'
Researchers at the foundation are expected to reveal their findings in detail in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, tomorrow.
New York Times' in-depth report claims some scholars who have seen the evidence are supportive of the research, while others claim more work still needs to be done.
'We need to know more,' Eric Klingelhofer, a vice president for research at the foundation and a history professor at Mercer University in Macon told Emery.
'This whole story is a blank — a blank page, a blank chapter of history, and I think archaeology is the only way to come up with answers.'
If the spending is allowed to continue, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the federal government will pay $135 billion in cost-sharing subsidies to insurers from 2018 to 2027.
The cloud of uncertainty swirling around the subsidies stems from a court ruling in a lawsuit that House Republicans filed against the Obama administration in 2014. Judge Rosemary M. Collyer of the Federal District Court in Washington ruled last year that spending on the subsidies “violates the Constitution” because Congress never appropriated money for them. They ordered a halt to the payments, but suspended their order to allow the government to appeal.
The Trump administration has not made clear whether it will press the appeal filed by the Obama administration. In a letter to Mr. Trump this week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce joined the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and insurers in seeking “quick action” to guarantee continuation of the subsidies. Without the subsidies, they said, more people will be uninsured and unable to pay medical bills.
Democrats say they will not negotiate with Mr. Trump until they stop their drive to repeal the Affordable Care Act. “President Trump is threatening to hold hostage health care for millions of Americans, many of whom voted for him, to achieve a political goal of repeal that would take health care away from millions more,” said the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York.
Having no immediate prospect of a deal with Democrats, the White House is still focusing on Republicans. It is seeking consensus on a repeal bill that can overcome rifts among House Republicans, whose disagreements sank an earlier version of the legislation on March 24.
Even though lawmakers are out of town for a two-week spring break, Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are continuing efforts to revive the bill in talks with Representative Mark Meadows, the North Carolina Republican who is the chairperson of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.
Many conservatives opposed the earlier version of the bill, saying it did not do enough to repeal federal rules that drive up the cost of insurance. Democrats say those rules, including a definition of minimum benefits, provide essential protections for consumers.
Jesse Sapolu played 15 years for the 49ers (1983-97) and in that time the stalwart center and guard won four Super Bowls and went to two Pro Bowls. However, what no one knew during their highly-decorated career was that Sapolu survived two-a-days in the heat of central California with the heart of an 80-year-old man.
Sapolu, now one of the team's alumni coordinators, recently appeared on KNBR to divulge a secret they held for their entire career. Sapolu played with a torn aortic heart valve that left them dangerously short of breath at times. Because of their condition, they also played with an enlarged heart that required two surgeries, including one during their playing days.While growing up in Western Samoa at age 4, Sapolu contracted rheumatic fever and the disease ripped a small hole in their heart valve.Since the valve failed to close properly, Sapolu's heart worked harder. The walls of their heart eventually grew larger, causing shortness of breath. “I would feel like I was drowning at times,” Sapolu said.In the fifth, sixth and seventh grades, school officials banned Sapolu from P.E.“I was 6-2, 240 pounds as a seventh grader,” Sapolu said after watching the 49ers' Friday practice. “Imagine this seventh grader sitting next to the teachers (during recess) and all the kids say, ‘You are big for nothing.' It left an impact on me emotionally. If they let me play, I would never ever complain under any circumstances.”Sapolu finally was allowed to play and later attended Farmington High in Hawaii, where they became the team captain. They attended the University of Hawaii where they monitored their condition. They were eventually drafted by Bill Walsh in the 11th round of the 1983 draft. Sapolu kept their heart problem a secret from the 49ers, but they found out during a physical.The team monitored their heart every year. Sapolu went to Stanford for tests to assess the size and function of their heart.On the field, they learned to take quick short breaths during times of exertion. Again, they felt like they were drowning, particularly as their career advanced and the valve started to deteriorate. But they were letting them play, so Sapolu kept the vow they made as a kid – they never complained.“It was all a mental fear for me from the emotional impact I had as a youngster,” Sapolu said. “I wasn't going to tell anybody about it.”At times Sapolu admitted they were scared, particularly in training camp. “When we were conditioning I was afraid, because I couldn't take a deep breath all the way through,” they said. “I learned to take shorter breaths just to survive.”Sapolu's heart would often race between practices and they would pray for their heart to calm down before they would get to the next practice.Entering their 14th year, Sapolu didn't perform well on their Stanford electrocardiogram. The doctor said they had the heart of an 80-year-old and marveled how they could walk up a flight of stairs without sitting down, much less play professional football.That year, Sapolu's valve was replaced by a valve from a cadaver and they played their final season. Recently, after 14 and a half years from their last surgery, Sapolu had that valve replaced by a plastic one that should last for 35 years.Sapolu exposes their fears and their personal life in a upcoming book called “I gave my heart to San Francisco,” which is due out in October. Sapolu's thoughts on the 49ers, Jim Harbaugh and their heart condition are covered in this interview with Rod Brooks and me. Scroll down to the Sapolu interview and have a listen.
Facial-recognition software meant to weed out travelers with fake passports will be rolled out to all international airports in the U.S. as part of a plan to crack down on identity fraud among visitors from countries with visa waiver agreements, according to Customs and Border Protection.
The move was announced this week as the State Department is expected to tighten restrictions on travelers from visa waiver countries who have recently visited Iran, Iraq, Syria and potentially fought for the Islamic State.
CBP launched the use of facial-recognition technology at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Tuesday to help verify to identify of travelers entering the United States. This comes after a two-month trial of the technology at Washington Dulles International Airport in 2015.
A CBP spokesperson said the facial-recognition technology will be deployed full time at Dulles beginning in February.
Both U.S. citizens returning to the country and first-time visitors from the 38 countries that are allowed to enter the United States without a visa will be required to have photos taken.
In the case of U.S. citizens with e-Passports, the photo will be compared against the data stored in computer chip embedded in the document.
“Any U.S. citizen with an e-Passport arriving at a port that is participating in this project may be selected for facial comparison matching at port discretion,” states a Privacy Impact Assessment update on the project from the Department of Homeland Security.
The program will also be used on first-time travelers from visa waiver program countries who are 18 and older “because DHS has identified an appreciable risk of passport and identity fraud among this population of travelers,” the DHS document states.
“This biometric capability will aid our officers in identifying legitimate travelers while protecting them from fraud and identity theft with little to no delay to the entry process,” said CBP Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske.
Though the photo-recognition program has long been in the works, with the test program operational at Dulles from March to May in 2015, lawmakers and federal officials have grown increasingly concerned with tightening travel protocols since the terrorist attacks in Paris.
The State Department is expected to formally announce its new visa waiver rules in the coming days, but had apparently leaked the plan by posting the information on U.S. embassy websites Thursday morning.
Politico reported that the postings, which were later taken down, state that anyone from the 38 countries visa waiver program countries who have dual citizenship in Iran, Iran, Syria or Sudan or has visited those countries since March 1, 2011, will now be required to obtain a visa before visiting the United States. Some exceptions will be made for individuals who have traveled for business, government, journalistic or humanitarian reasons, Politico reported.
Through the photo-recognition program, photos of visitors and U.S. citizens taken through the program will only be retained when travelers are “subject to an adverse or law enforcement action resulting from secondary inspection,” the DHS document states.
All other facial-recognition images will be deleted, according to the agency.
It was unclear when the facial-recognition software would be deployed to airports beyond JFK and Dulles.

Abyssal adjective 1. of or like an abyss; immeasurable; unfathomable from Dictionary.com
When I look at past economic downturns, I look at five key components to determine how bad they were and what the capabilities and challenges were in terms of getting the country out of the negative cycle. Those five key components are:
Consumer savings and spending/ability to spend Corporate income, health and spending/ability to spend Government financial health and ability to spend The lending and banking system and its ability to extend credit Inflation & scarcity of resources
Some people will look at my list and wonder why I don't talk about unemployment or the price of stocks or other indicators but those items are all symptoms of issues with the five primary items I listed. When corporate income is down affecting corporate health this affects stock prices, causes corporations to reduce spending and also results in layoffs and increasing unemployment. Layoffs and rising unemployment typically cause consumer ability to spend to go down, obviously among the people who are laid off but also among those who fear that they might be laid off and thus need to save their money to prepare just in case they lose their jobs.
The most recent recession of 2001-2002 was a result of problems primarily with #2 and a slight resultant hit on #1. Businesses were struggling and thus were not spending money on non essential items and as a result most firms that rely on corporate customers lost money. When they lost money, they laid people off. Unemployment rose, but those consumers who were not laid off kept spending and this kept the economy from experiencing much more serious issues. Throughout this period, the government was solvent, the lending and banking system lent huge amounts of money to businesses and individuals and prices were flat. With the more severe downturn of 1979, known as a global stagflation, items #1, #2 and #5 were the issues. You had double digit inflation and unemployment, corporate spending was down, it was a real mess. The great depression of 1929 featured massive problems with items #1, #2 and #4. Banks failed en masse, unemployment reached 25% with obvious implications on consumers' ability to spend. If 1/4 of the country's consumers didn't have money to spend, business income went way down and many companies failed completely. As bad as some of these bad economic times were, none of those historic downturns compare with what is coming.
The depression of 1929 was eventually cured by government spending. There is an argument as to whether peacetime government spending and programs before the outbreak of war officially ended the depression or whether government wartime spending ended it, but there is no argument as to where that spending originated. The government went into the red to spend money on employing people and buying goods and services. That got the economy going again. But the government was solvent going into the depression and was not saddled by trillions of dollars in deficits. Making it easier was that the depression, along with recessions like the one in 2001-2002 were more traditional downturns in that they did not have an inflationary component. Economists once thought that stagflation, the combination of rising prices and a recession economy, was not possible. The 1979 stagflation proved that it was possible. It creates an entirely new set of issues in trying to get the economy started again because the worry is that any steps that are taken may fuel additional inflation1.

Our current economic picture features serious issues with all five of my key components. Consumers have had a negative savings rate over the last 6-8 years, grew massive credit card and lending debts and have no more money to spend2 . Corporate income is down thus corporate spending is down3. Corporations have generally stopped hiring and some have started to lay people off, the unemployment rate is higher this year in almost every state than it was last year at this time4. The government is running at huge deficits and is hemorrhaging money on two wars after giving several massive tax cut giveaways 5 6 7 8. The government doesn't have the ability to spend us out of a major crisis. The lending and banking system is reeling from the mortgage and credit crises and as a result has very little money to lend to fund new ventures. Examples of this are the collapse of Bear Stearns and UBS' & Deutsche Bank's flirtation with insolvency9. When major Swiss banks like UBS flirt with failing, it's hard to argue against the idea that the economic sky is falling. Finally, inflation is on the rise, most people know about the huge rise in the price of oil and all the downstream price increases that this causes, but few in the US so far are aware that the entire world is experiencing a food shortage and thus food prices are rising separate from the fact that the price of transporting food is also increasing due to increasing fuel prices. We have experienced the beginnings of serious food price increases here in the US, but in the three month period from December 2007 to February 2008, France experienced a more than 40% increase in food prices. US consumer prices were up 4.1% in 2007, the sharpest increase in prices in 17 years (since 1990).1 That is just the beginning of the inflationary problems, particularly if the government starts throwing stimulus money at the situation.
When you have negative pressures from several of the key components, they reinforce each other and work together to drive the economy down. When it is all of them, the combined downward pressure on the economy has got to be immense. We don't know for sure how bad it is going to get because nothing like this has ever happened before. The only things that are better right now versus any other downturn is that if you compare our current issues with the 1929-1939 depression, we haven't had a major crash in stock prices and we have better regulations on the banking and financial markets (particularly on margin buying) as well as some governmental banking insurance like the FDIC. But how much ability does the FDIC/Federal government have to bail out the banks if they start failing with the severe deficits the federal government is already running? The economy is going to be at least bad enough so that we need a new name to call it. A recess is a small indentation while a depression is a larger hole, so I think this new worse economic crisis should by called an Abyssal, and since it comes with inflation, it will be a Stagflationary Abyssal.
How bad could this Abyssal get? It's always risky to try and predict things like this but I expect to see major corrections in the equity markets. I see a Dow in the 7000-9000 range, the S&P 500 struggling to stay over the 1000 mark and a NASDAQ in the 1400-1600 range. I see unemployment and inflation both between fifteen to twenty five percent. I see many consumers defaulting on their credit cards and the major crisis in the banking and lending industry will be compounded by hordes of consumers defaulting on their credit cards. As a result of these credit card defaults, more banks will fail and major banking insurers will fail as a result as well as investment funds and securities that are based on credit card debt. I believe there will be consumer and corporate bankruptcies on a massive scale. My next article will discuss in depth things that could be done to mitigate this coming crisis.

Related Articles Former restaurant owners hit with $6.1 million restitution, prison sentence in massive wage theft case MARTINEZ — While they were offering the public all-you-can-eat deals on pot stickers, sesame balls and egg rolls, the owners of a Bay Area Chinese restaurant chain were allegedly hiding a sinister secret.
Behind closed doors, according to authorities, the former owners and managers of Golden Dragon Buffet in Brentwood, New Dragon Buffet in San Leandro, Golden Wok Buffet in Roseville and Kokyo Sushi Buffet in Hayward were saving money by failing to pay their workers minimum wage. State investigators estimate they committed $4.5 million in wage theft from 2009-2013, and cheated California out of another $2 million in taxes.
In December, a Contra Costa grand jury indicted eight of Golden Dragon's owners and managers — Brandon Quang, Yu Chen, Rongdi Zheng, Guo Cai Feng, Feng Gu, Lin Jiang, Zhou Xian Chen and Shao Rong Zhang — on 28 charges, including conspiracy, wage theft and workers compensation fraud. That same month, authorities raided four locations connected to the buffet chain, but Quang avoided arrest and fled the country. So did Feng and Jiang. All three are believed to be in China.
The other five defendants have agreed to plead guilty to some of the charges, and prosecutors have asked for sentences ranging from three to six years in state prison. Judge Charles “Ben” Burch is expected to decide on a sentence Friday afternoon.
The restaurants have since taken on new ownership, but former workers who testified before the grand jury described being housed in crowded, racially segregated dorms, and being bused to work 12-hour shifts six days a week without adequate breaks.
The chain's owners recruited workers, mostly recent immigrants, from an employment agency in Southern California. When they got to the Bay Area, some were paid less than $6 per hour, according to prosecutors. When it became known that some of the workers were cooperating with police, one of the owners allegedly kicked them out and threatened to call Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
State labor officials say it is considered the biggest wage theft case in Contra Costa County's history, but in the bigger picture, it's just a drop in the bucket.
“I think that wage theft is one of the most serious threats to our safety and communities in California,” state Labor Commissioner Julie Su said in an interview last year. “I think there's a sense that workers aren't going to complain; that not only are investigators not going to do inspections but also that employees aren't going to come forward.”
Su and others are trying to change that. Prosecutors in the Golden Dragon case credit state investigator Donna Chen with earning the trust of workers at the buffet restaurant who later came forward and testified before the grand jury. The workers' identities were protected. One described living in a garage with 14 others and working 12 hours a day at the Kokyo Sushi Buffet restaurant in Hayward.
“The area we were living in was exclusively for Latinos,” the worker said in grand jury testimony. “And then in the other house is where all the Chinese … servers and everybody else was.”
The defendants are scheduled to be sentenced on Friday, at 1:30 p.m. in Department 23 of the A.F. Bray Courthouse in Martinez.
My favorite thing about harvest is the intoxicating aroma. Like some kind of exotic pie, it's a mix of over-ripe tropical fruit and fresh-baked pastry dough. It permeates the air, and every time I smell it, it sends a little shiver of joy down my spine.
Many things about harvesting grapes and making wine seem very romantic, but in actual fact it's a fairly grueling, manual labor intensive, messy job. Growing grapes is a lot like growing any other crop — tomatoes, corn, you name it — it takes a lot of hours, usually under a hot sun, tending the vines throughout the growing season. Even if you take meticulous care of the vines, an entire year's crop can be ruined by a hailstorm, or by heavy rains, or by too much sun at the wrong time. And even if the weather cooperates, harvest itself is backbreaking labor. Fruit picks can begin as early as 1am, and crews are routinely in the cellar late into the evening — longer if something isn't going quite right.
And yet despite these decidedly un-romantic things, harvest is an incredibly exciting time that drives much of what happens during the other nine to ten months of the year. People travel to wine growing regions all over the world to witness and participate in it. This includes an international community of traveling winemakers and interns who hopscotch around the globe, often working two (and sometimes even three!) harvests a year in the northern and southern hemispheres.
What is it that brings all these people together to work 80-hour weeks of strenuous labor? For some, it may simply be a paycheck. And indeed the wine industry in Napa sustains a large pool of manual labor for whom the joy of wine may not be the driving force that wakes them up in the wee hours of the morning.
But for many, it is. As an intern put it to me recently, it's about the personal satisfaction of seeing “a single cluster of grapes comes in and in two months time you have a young red wine in a barrel that has the potential to become something beautiful — being able to witness that transformation, tasting the grapes as they come through the sorting table, tasting the must daily during fermentation and then later when it's been pressed and put into barrel, being able to see where that wine is going and what it will become. It's like taking rocks out of the mountain and turning them into a beautiful piece of jewelry.”
My friend who said those words, Matilda Scott, is from Australia and this is their second harvest in Napa. She's worked two other harvests in Coonawarra (in South Australia) as well as one earlier this year in New Zealand. Next spring she'll be back in Australia working in the Barossa Valley, home of some of that country's top Shiraz/Syrah. In the summer they plan to start a Masters of Oenology and Viticulture at the University of Adelaide, the premier school in Australia. Them goal is to become a winemaker.
For her, working harvests all over the world is a way to broaden their scope and knowledge and further their career. As one of several harvest interns that have been brought on at Arkenstone, a small winery on Howell Mountain in Napa Valley, Matilda arrives in the cellar daily around 7am and often doesn't leave until well after sundown. Here's what a day in the life looks like for her:
7am – 10am: Arrive at the winery and being the morning rounds, checking on all the tanks that are fermenting or cold-soaking. This includes “cap management” to make sure that the “cap” of red grape seeds and skins remains integrated with the fermenting grape juice below. Mostly this is automated, but some containers require manual “punch downs” where the cap is literally punched down using a large stainless steel hammer. Meanwhile, up on the crush pad, grapes are arriving from all over Napa to be sorted and begin the transformation into wine.
10am – 12pm: Check on each fermenting tank to measure temperature, brix (grape sugars), bacteria and other variables. This might also include taking samples to send to the lab for testing. After doing all the measurements, everything must be logged in a central database.
12pm – 12:30pm: Lunch break
12:30pm – 4:30pm: If there are inoculations to do that day (meaning, yeast that needs to be added to grape juice to start fermentation), Matilda will rehydrate the yeast (it looks a lot like dry bread yeast) and add it as necessary. The balance of the afternoon is spent helping out running the cellar including pressing wine, more punch downs, barrel management, sorting grapes as they come in, monitoring the 2013 wines, and doing whatever else needs to be done.
4:30pm – 7:30pm or later: Evening rounds begin with more punch downs, monitoring and measurements of fermenting wine, and temperatures adjustments. Finally, the entire facility is cleaned, so they can start again in the morning.
With such long work hours, it's not hard to see where the term “harvest widow” comes from. It's a running joke among the winemaking community that during harvest you see far more of your work colleagues than of your family or significant other. It's also clearly not a laid back, glamorous job – unless your idea of glamor is hauling around huge half-ton bins of grapes and then picking out stems while trying not to get stung by all the wasps and yellow jackets buzzing around.
If you think that anyone who wants to spend their time this way is nuts, you may well be right. But, as Matilda said, it's also incredibly rewarding to see wine go from grape to bottle and to be part of that transformation. Harvest is by far the busiest time of year in wine country, and much of the rest of the year is spent preparing for or dealing with the aftermath of it. It is a time of transformation, both an end to the growing season, and a beginning of that vintage's life as a wine. Harvest is also a stark reminder that wine is, at its core, an agricultural product that requires the blood, sweat, and tears of many people to come to fruition. If you ever feel intimidated by wine, or if it ever feels too complicated or erudite to enjoy, this is an important point to keep in mind.

If you've ever played a part in a theatre production, than you know that one of the first rules of any show is to keep the experience magical for the audience.
The play starts well before the play starts.
This means actors huddle backstage and are never seen outside of character or costume. Music sets the ambiance as people takes their seats while the set and lights create a starting point for their imaginations to start transitioning into another world.
Setting the Stage
The National Theatre in London recently launched their newest musical wonder.land, a modern Alice in Wonderland that explores the blurred lines between our online and offline lives. For the production, the Theatre decided to team up with Fifty Nine Productions and Play Nicely to create a VR experience that would transport audience members into wonder.land from the screenplay's magic portal, the girl's bathroom.
Naturally, the creators didn't stop at developing a virtual experience within a headset. They did what they do best; they built a set for it. PCs and hardware to power Oculus Rifts were cleverly hidden in toilet seats while stage lighting and bathroom wall graffiti set the mood for what was to come.
Creating Magic in VR
Many VR creators have been looking to theatre to understand the best way to develop entertainment in a 360 degree space, but looking at the National Theatre's first approach to VR, there are more lessons that can be learned from this beloved medium.
Directors and playwrights discovered a long time ago that creating an illusion starts with the stage. Its ambiance is the gateway from reality into another world. As we continue to create experiences in virtual reality, it will become more and more important for us to understand the best ways to transition a viewer from reality to VR in a way that allows them to feel like they are a part of the imaginary narrative.
If you find yourself in London, you can check out the National Theatre's free digital exhibition fabulous wonder.land from now until April 30th or you can download the VR experience for any iPhone and iPad using the National Theatre Backstage App.

Nancy Pelosi's brother-in-law is given $737m of taxpayers' money to build giant solar power plant in middle of the desert
Obama administration approved $1bn in green energy loans days after failed Solyndra project due to be completed
$737m handed to Crescent Dunes project in Tonopah, Nevada, for 110-megawatt desert solar power plant
Investors include firm Minority leader's brother-in-law and major Solyndra stakeholder
Republicans warn Energy Department is 'rushing' $5bn in loans ahead of Friday deadline
Cronyism? A solar energy project backed by Nancy Pelosi's brother has been granted a massive government loan (file picture)
Nancy Pelosi is facing accusations of cronyism after a solar energy project, which their brother-in-law has a stake in, landed a $737 million loan guarantee from the Department of Energy, despite the growing Solyndra scandal.
The massive loan agreement is raising new concerns about the use of taxpayers' money as vast sums are invested in technology similar to that of the doomed energy project.
The investment has intensified the debate over the effectiveness of solar energy as a major power source.
The SolarReserve project is backed by an energy investment fund where the Minority Leader's brother-in-law Ronald Pelosi is second in command.
PCG Clean Energy & Technology Fund (East) LLC is listed as one of the investors in the project that has been given the staggering loan, which even dwarfs that given to failed company Solyndra.
Other investors include one of the major investors in Solyndra, which is run by one of the directors of Solyndra.
Steve Mitchell, who served on the board of directors at the bankrupt energy company, is also managing director of Argonaut Private Equity, which has invested in the latest project.
Since Solyndra has filed for bankruptcy has been asked to testify about the goings on at the firm by two members of the House and 'asked to provide documents to Congress'.
Generator: Artist's impression of the solar plant being constructed north west of Tonopah, Nevada
The artist's impression shows the incredible size of the giant solar power plant, which is being bankrolled by President Obama's green jobs fund.
Energy will be generated using concentrated solar power technology, in which a series of mirrors direct sunlight to a receiver at the centre of the plant.
The 'solar tower' in the middle, which will be taller than the Washington Monument, is the first of its kind to be built.
Stretching out across a plain in Tonopah, Nevada, the mind-bogglingly big project will generate enough electricity to power 43,000 homes.
But the joint announcement by Energy Secretary Steven Chu comes just two days after the doomed Solyndra project, which cost the taxpayer $528 million from the same cash pot, was meant to be completed.
IS SOLAR ENERGY VIABLE?
The loan agreement comes as questions are raised about the effectiveness of solar power as a major energy source. Although solar energy plants are typically comparatively cheap to operate, they are extremely expensive to build. The proposed Nevada plant, which will provide power for 43,000 homes, is receiving a $737 million taxpayer loan, as well as private investment. The low amounts of power generated by solar energy plants has also been criticised. To replace existing energy sources with solar plants would take up large amounts of land and cost vast amounts of money.
The project approval came as part of $1 billion in new loans to green energy companies yesterday.
Republican critics of the President Obama's solar energy program have voiced their outrage at the new loans while the Solyndra scandal is still being investigated.
They have raised concerns that the Department of Energy is rushing through the approval of loans before stimulus funds expire on Friday.
While the departments insists the projects are being properly vetted, some lawmakers have written to express concern that they vast loans are not being adequately scrutinised.
'The administration's flagship project Solyndra is bankrupt and being investigated by the FBI, the promised jobs never materialised, and now the Department of Energy is preparing to rush out nearly $5 billion in loans in the final 48 hours before stimulus funds expire — that's nearly $105 million every hour that must be finalised until the deadline,' said Florida representative Cliff Stearns, who is chairperson of the investigations subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
Tom Schatz, president of Washington-based advocacy group Citizens Against Government Waste, said: 'It is time for a full audit of their activities, their management and their results.
'Candidly, it might be time for the federal government to rethink the whole idea of loan programs.'
Energy Department spokesperson Damien LaVera said the project, which was had extensive reviews that included scrutiny of the parent companies' finances.
Investigation: Solyndra CEO Brian Harrison and Chief Financial Officer Bill Stover are sworn in at a House Oversight and Investigations subcommittee hearing
SOLYNDRA PLANT'S SPA SHOWERS AND DISNEY WHISTLING ROBOTS
The shocking scale of spending Solyndra lavished on the factory it started building alongside Interstate 880 in Fremont, California, has been revealed. When it was completed at an estimated cost of $733 million, including proceeds from the company's $535 million U.S. loan guarantee, it covered 300,000 sq ft, the equivalent of five football fields. It had robots that whistled Disney tunes, spa-like showers with liquid-crystal displays of the water temperature, and glass-walled conference rooms. John Pierce, 54, a San Jose resident who worked as a facilities manager at Solyndra, said: 'The new building is like the Taj Mahal.'
Designed to make far more solar panels than Solyndra got orders for, the site is now empty and U.S. taxpayers may be stuck with it. Solyndra filed for bankruptcy protection on September 6, leaving in its wake investigations by Congress and the FBI.
Mr Chu said the two projects will create about 900 construction jobs and at least 52 permanent jobs.
They added: 'If we want to be a player in the global clean energy race, we must continue to invest in innovative technologies that enable commercial-scale deployment of clean, renewable power like solar.'
The 110-megawatt Crescent Dunes project will use the sun's heat to create steam that drives a turbine, SolarReserve, which is based in Santa Monica, California.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is a strong supporter of the Nevada project, which they say will help their state's economy recover. Former Governor Jim Gibbons, a Republican, also supported the project.
Mr Pelosi is one of several controversial figures set to benefit from the huge loan agreement.
The loan approvals came just two days before the renewable energy loan program approved under the 2009 economic stimulus law is set to expire. At least seven projects worth more than $5 billion are also waiting to be approved.
California-based solar panel maker Solyndra Inc went bankrupt after receiving its money and laid off 1,100 workers. The firm is now under investigation by the FBI.
It was the first renewable-energy company to receive a loan guarantee under a stimulus-law program to encourage green energy and was frequently touted by the Obama administration as a model.
President Barack Obama visited the company's Silicon Valley headquarters last year, and Vice President Joe Biden spoke by satellite at its groundbreaking ceremony.
Since then, the company's failure has become an embarrassment for Obama.
Nut Scott Crider, a spokesperson for Sempra Generation, a Sempra Energy subsidiary that is developing the Arizona project, said its loan guarantee was not as risky as the Solyndra loan.
Most important, the project has a 20-year agreement with Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to buy power supplied by the solar plant, they said
Mr Crider claimed the purchase agreement is a key element of the project and will 'provide assurance that there are sufficient revenues in place to support the loan guarantee'.
Since 2004 there has been one Naruto movie every year in Japan. This includes the debut of the first Shippuden movie in 2007. Well, 2012 is no different as Naruto Shippuden Movie 6, also known as Naruto Movie 9, will be hitting theaters in Japan next summer! The news comes via the latest issue of Shonen Jump. No other details have been revealed at this time.
The last Naruto Shippuden movie, Blood Prison was released in Japanese theaters July 30th and will likely be released on DVD around April 2012. For Naruto movies in Japan, traditionally “summer” means the end of July and early August. On the North American front, Viz Media released Naruto Shippuden Movie 2: Bonds to DVD in American theaters on October 15 and on DVD October 25th of this year.
President Trump reasserted Tuesday night that a raid in Yemen that left one Navy SEAL dead was a success despite controversy this week created by criticism from the SEAL's father and Trump's own remarks blaming generals for the serviceman's death.
“I just spoke to [Defense Secretary] General [James] Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, ‘Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies,'” Trump said during their first address to a joint session of Congress.
Carryn Owens, the widow of the Ryan Owens, was in the audience and received a standing ovation from the chamber as they fought back tears.
Earlier Tuesday, Trump appeared to blame the generals who planned the raid for the Owens's death when responding to a question about criticism from the SEAL's father, saying "they lost" Owens.
ADVERTISEMENT
In an interview with the Miami Herald published Sunday, Owens's father said they refused to meet Trump when their son's body arrived at Dover Air Force Base. They also criticized the Trump administration for using their son's death to attack those calling for an investigation and questioned why the raid was carried out in the first place.
NBC News reported Monday night that officials said they're unaware of any useful intelligence the raid produced.
Reports have painted a chaotic scene at the raid where al Qaeda may have been tipped off to the SEALs' impending arrival. In addition to Owens, civilians were killed, and a $75 million U.S. military aircraft had to be destroyed after it crashed so that it wouldn't fall into enemy hands.
The Pentagon is conducting three reviews into the raid, the White House confirmed Monday, following standard procedures for reviews into the death of a service member, the deaths of civilians and the destruction of hardware.
During Tuesday night's speech, Trump said the nation will never forget Owens's sacrifice.
“Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity,” Trump said, to another standing ovation during which Carryn Owens also stood to applaud.
The applause break was one of the longest and most bipartisan of the night, and prompted Trump to ad lib: "Ryan is looking down right now, and he's very happy because I think they just broke a record."
“For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends," Trump continued, back on script. "Ryan laid down their life for their friends, for their country, and for our freedom. We will never forget him.”
The State of Delaware just took a historic step toward ensuring that US stock exchanges will soon be violently disrupted by blockchain technology - possibly to the extent of being rendered obsolete. CoinDesk reports that lawmakers in the state's general assembly passed a law that makes explicit the right to trade stocks on a blockchain. Details of the bill are still emerging. One source indicated that the bill passed with near unanimity, with a single vote against. The vote was widely considered to be the final obstacle to state adoption, following the passage of the bill in the Senate earlier this month. The measure, which was added to another bill in the form of an amendment, is expected to be signed in to law by Delaware Gov. John Carney by the end of the month, with the ruling going into effect on Aug. 1.
Developed under the close guidance of blockchain lawyer Marco Santori of Cooley LLP and Caitlin Long of blockchain startup Symbiont, the bill is expected to pave the way for potentially large-scale issuance of stock on a blockchain. By trading stock on a blockchain or similar distributed ledgers, users can cut out middlemen like the exchanges and ATSs that profit by facilitating trades, resulting in significantly faster settlement times. The bill was introduced last year by the previous governor, Jack Markell, following requests made by multiple companies for the legislation – which was already lenient to blockchain stocks – to make explicit the legality of such issuances, according to CoinDesk's sources.
“This is big for Delaware,” Symbiont's Long told CoinDesk, further explaining the potential benefits of the amendments:”
Chair of the corporate law section of the Delaware bar association, Matthew O'Toole, told CoinDesk they expect the state's governor, John Carney, to sign the bill into law by the end of July, with an effective date of 1st August.
In an email to CoinDesk, O'Toole said the vote "keeps Delaware at the forefront of corporate law and in the lead in terms of enabling the use of 'distributed ledger shares'." They added: "We look forward to helping Delaware corporations enjoy the benefits of this innovative new amalgamation of law and technology."
Blockchain-based trading systems are inching closer to becoming a reality. Two years ago, Nasdaq OMX Group said it would use blockchain technology to power trading in shares of privately held companies on its Nasdaq Private Market platform. The company said at the time that private-share trading was particularly ripe for disruption because of the heavy volume of paperwork involved in recording and settling the transactions. Assuming Carney signs the bill, like CoinDesk expects, the measure should pave the way for US companies – many of which are legally based in the state – to begin listing shares on blockchain-based distributed ledgers. One source told CD that the bill "keeps Delaware at the forefront of corporate law and in the lead in terms of enabling the use of 'distributed ledger shares'."
planning document for Richard Spencer's visit — which anti-racists accessed and which we are now publishing in full — suggests that the would-be killers from Texas were not mere supporters of Richard Spencer, but traveled to campus as part of Spencer's operational plan for the day. The operational document also reveals details such as there being an after-party for Alt-Right militants who assisted with the Gainesville event, and that Spencer and other “VIPs” planned dinner with donors while visiting the city.
The operational plan developed for Gainesville by Richard Spencer's closest associates reveals coordination with both the University of Florida and police, with both parties described by the Alt-Right racists as “cooperating.” According to the plans distributed to staff at Spencer's National Policy Institute, The Patriot Front, an openly fascist organization , was a key organization participating in the racist “Task Force” for Gainesville. The planning document appears to have made plans for larger numbers of white nationalists than showed up, again pointing to Gainesville as a flop for Richard Spencer's movement. This defeat happened at a time when the racist “Alt-Right” is desperate for any sort of win, in the aftermath of the bloody and disastrous “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville this August.
The “Operation Gator” document mentions that white nationalists had plans for a “flash mob” in the event that University of Florida cance l led Spencer's speech — with racists showing up elsewhere on campus or in Gainesville to make their presence felt (with predictable intimidation and likely targeted violence). In actuality, Spencer did not have their speech cancelled by the University but rather cut it short themselves after being humiliated by the student/community mobilization. The “Operation Gator” plan stated that participants ought not bring guns. However, it was in the context of political defeat (but not any University cancellation) that some of Spencer's allies attempted to settle scores with anti-racists, nearly committing a murder.
Patriot Front Texas
As well as mentioning Patriot Front as an organization, the operational order also states that “Texas guys” would be bringing a van to Gainesville. A Twitter post from days before Spencer's visit to Florida explicitly stated that Patriot Front was sending a “delegation” from Texas
After a shot had been fired but before arrests, the Texas branch of Patriot Front stated on Twitter that all its members were “safe and having a blast in Gainesville.”
Executive Officer for the Alt-Right Mobilization: Gregory Conte AKA “Greg Ritter” of Maryland
The Alt-Right planning document for Gainesville mentions “Greg Ritter” as the “XO” — a military abbreviation for “Executive Officer” — for the operation. Ritter is responsible for the “Alt-Right Politics” podcast on AltRight.com, which is billed as “An insider take on Washington in a political roundtable format.” According to an article on AltRight.com, Ritter was also a planner of and participant in a September flash mob outside the White House by Richard Spencer and Identity Evropa
By providing a phone number for “Ritter” the Gainesville planning document also revealed their actual identity. The same number is listed on the website of a technology staffing company, as the number for Equal Employment Opportunity Officer Greg Conte . Greg Conte is based in Maryland. Their LinkedIn profile lists them as a staffing consultant for a different company.
Conclusion
While Gainesville went poorly for Richard Spencer, the operational document for the day highlights what Identity Evropa leader Elliott Kline (AKA “Eli Mosley”) described in a recent podcast appearance as the “professionalization” of the Alt-Right, which according to Klein started with Richard Spencer's appearance in Auburn, Alabama earlier this year . White power militants are divided into units with clear roles, a detailed plan, and a chain of command. The Gainesville document indicates that Spencer's forces coordinated closely with UF campus police for their visit.
The Gainesville organizational document was approved by Gregory Conte/”Ritter,” who does podcasts on Spencer's Alt-Right.com and has a “security” business with Spencer's bodyguard. The planning document, which was distributed to National Policy Institute staff, was approved by Spencer's closest associates and almost certainly Spencer himself. Patriot Front — the fascist organization that recently tried to storm the Houston Anarchist Bookfair — had trusted roles in Spencer's Gainesville mobilization, as did the white nationalists of Identity Evropa . After Spencer's Gainesville event flopped, racists from the Texas delegation tried to murder someone.

A female CEO in Texas has come under fire this week for saying a woman “shouldn't be president” because of “different hormones” and “biblical sound reasoning.”
Cheryl Rios, CEO of Dallas marketing and public relations firm Go Ape Marketing, wrote on Facebook that she'd move “to Canada” if Hillary Clinton became head of state.
“With the hormones we have, there is no way [a woman] should be able to start a war,” they wrote in their post, per KTVT. “Yes I run my own business and I love it and I am great at it BUT that is not the same as being the President, that should be left to a man, a good, strong, honorable man.”
Rios said they support “equal rights,” but stressed that “there's an old biblical sound reasoning why a woman shouldn't be president,” according to the station. Rios, however, did not cite a particular biblical verse to support their view.
After drawing criticism for their comments on social media, Rios took to Twitter Tuesday to defend them beliefs.
“In this great country we are allowed our own opinions. Mine may be something you don't agree with, and so be it. I am old fashioned, I am Christian and believe what I have said,” they wrote in an extended tweet.
Rios added that they don't believe that women should be “abused, or that they are stupid or can't be lawyers, doctors or run successful businesses,” only that they shouldn't be the country's head of state.
The High Court of Justice's ruling Wednesday on the legality of the Citizenship Law proves the erosion of this institution's role as Israel's guardian of civil rights. Let's look at how the justices voted at the moment of truth on the law, which bans Palestinians from living in Israel with spouses who are Israeli citizens.
In a 2006 ruling, 6 out of 11 justices said the law was unconstitutional, and in the current ruling, 6 out of 11 justices said the law, which was made stricter after the first ruling, was constitutional. That's a disappointing outcome, in part because the first ruling was made not long after the terror attacks of the second intifada, while the current ruling was made during a period of calm, due in part to coordination between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
The title that Justice Asher Grunis gave their opinion - "Human rights are not a prescription for national suicide" - is also disappointing. No one disagrees with this, but Justice Elyakim Rubinstein, who arrived at the same judicial conclusion, recognizes that "a small group - those men and women in Israel's Arab minority who want to marry residents of the region - must pay a heavy price for greater security for all Israelis, including their own."
Justice Grunis apparently would not agree to this wording; as they put it, he's not someone who gives the "constitutional rights that are mentioned in the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty the most expanded and comprehensive interpretation."
Justice Miriam Naor's opinion is disappointing - that the constitutional right to family life means everything, but establishing a family with a foreign spouse in Israel should not receive constitutional protection. It's hard to accept this contradiction, which imposes on other countries a burden that Israel is unwilling to bear and hurts Israeli citizens' right to family life.
The dissenting opinion properly balances the security needs of all citizens and the rights of individuals; the law should be annulled and replaced with security checks of any candidate for residence in Israel when family unification is involved.
The ruling touches on the balance between security needs and individual rights, but the public will understand it as a demographic ruling - one that protects the Jewish majority while harming the rights of Arab citizens. And thus the ruling pushes Israel down the slope of apartheid.

A financial analyst for Countrywide Home Financial, one of the world's biggest and most troubled mortgage lenders, has been arrested and charged with stealing personal information concerning a breathtaking number of the company's customers.
Rene Rebollo, 36, of Pasadena, California, downloaded 20,000 customer profiles including names and social security numbers just about every week for about two years, according to documents filed in federal court in Los Angeles. They would then sell the purloined information for about $500 per 20,000 profiles to various buyers. They netted as much as $70,000 through the scheme, prosecutors alleged.
Although Countrywide had technology in place to disable flash drives on employee computers, Rebollo was able to circumvent the safeguard by making use of a PC that didn't have it installed. Countrywide is one of the biggest providers of subprime mortgages, which offered people with bad credit housing loans. In many cases, the loans came with low introductory interest rates that would eventually reset to much higher rates. Attorneys general from Illinois and California have sued the lender for practices that were allegedly unfair and deceptive.
Earlier this year, Countrywide was acquired by Bank of America. Subprime loans are one of the key causes of the current mortgage debacle rocking the US economy.
Rebollo was able to obtain specific types of Countrywide customer data thanks to their access to many of the company's different databases. They typically accessed the information on Sunday evenings from their workplace. They downloaded the information onto thumb drives. They would then physically sell the drive to people claiming to be data thieves or would email the data, usually in Excel spreadsheets, from a computer at a Kinko's shop.
They have been charged with exceeding authorized access to the computer of a financial institution and faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. They were arrested Friday and released on an $85,000 bond. Rebollo's attorney didn't return a message seeking comment for this story.
A second person, 25-year-old Wahid Siddiqi of Thousand Oaks, California, was also arrested in the case and accused of purchasing some of the Countrywide data. Siddiqi is charged with fraud and faces 15 years. Siddiqi is scheduled to appear in court on Monday afternoon, California time. ®
"Because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke."
As U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan discussed the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, a top priority of President-elect Donald Trump, they made a claim about the financial health of Medicare.
"What people don't realize is, because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke," the Wisconsin Republican told Fox News host Bret Baier on Nov. 10, 2016.
The Affordable Care Act certainly has its detractors. When Ryan claimed the same month that Obamacare is not a popular law, our rating was Mostly True. The polls generally showed most Americans had an unfavorable opinion of it.
But surprisingly for Ryan, who is regarded as a federal budget expert, their claim about the law flies in the face of evidence that it actually helps shore up Medicare.
What the ACA did on Medicare
https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7de6b429-1d9a-42de-ad08-c7998eaa6ca5
Here's how Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, lays it out:
On one side of the ledger, Obamacare slowed the growth of Medicare spending by, among other things, reducing increases in payments made to nearly all health care providers.
On the other side of the ledger, the law included a surtax on high-income earners that brings more money into Medicare.
Two health care policy experts further told us that the combination of spending curbs and revenue increases for Medicare Part A -- which covers hospital, nursing home and home care services, and is financed mainly through payroll taxes -- has extended the solvency of Medicare.
(Medicare Part B, which is voluntary, covers doctor visits and some medical care.)
Paul Ginsburg, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at the University of Southern California, pointed us to an October 2016 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.
The report noted that in 2010, the Medicare trustees projected that Obamacare's spending curbs and revenue increases would mean Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which finances Part A, would remain solvent until 2029.
That's 12 years later than had been projected a year before the Affordable Care Act became law.
(The projection has since been revised to 2028.)
Michael Sparer, a professor health policy and management at Columbia University in New York, put it this way, financially speaking:
If Obamacare were repealed completely, "it would put Medicare in worse shape, not better shape."
Finally, it's worth noting that both Factcheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker also concluded that Ryan's claim is wrong. They both also noted that, even if the Part A trust fund did become depleted in 2028, the program wouldn't be broke, in that it is still set up to cover an estimated 87 percent of expenses.
FactCheck.org's rating was false and the Fact Checker gave Ryan its worst rating, four Pinnocchios, which is for statements deemed to be "whoppers."
Ryan's office opted not to provide us any information to support their claim.
Our rating
Ryan said: "Because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke."
Financially, Medicare isn't entirely in the clear, given that actuaries project that a key reserve fund will run out of money in 2028.
But the Medicare trustees themselves, along with a host of experts, say the Affordable Care Act's changes to Medicare -- including holding the line on spending and raising taxes -- actually puts Medicare in better shape than before the law was adopted. That's a long way from making Medicare go broke.
We rate Ryan's statement Pants on Fire.

More about Torpedo Kegs
from MoreBeer… “Set your sights on a brand new Torpedo Keg! The sleek all-stainless design represents a new era of homebrew kegs. With features like welded stainless handles, the ability to stack with fittings in place, amazing quality and a great price we think these kegs will become the standard by which other kegs are measured. Quality First
The first thing we at MoreBeer! check out is interior welds. We've spent a decade rejecting kegs made overseas because the interior welds have never met our standards. If a weld is not perfect and shows evident burn marks along with nooks and crannies it cannot be sanitized effectively. Torpedo kegs are laser welded and exceed our standards for quality. The weld quality is possible because these are the first homebrewing kegs made by an ISO certified commercial keg manufacturer. Cool Features
Torpedo Kegs were designed to stack with quick disconnects in place which is a cool feature for some brewers who have vertical space in their refrigerator. We also like the rolled stainless steel handles. They are comfortable to grab and will never come off like some rubber handles can over time. In and Out is etched on the keg posts for easy identification which is very handy when you are connecting lines in a refrigerator or kegerator and trying not to make a mistake. The lid fits very tightly which is great for sealing, however we found that having some CIP Keg Lube film on hand to apply to the gray keg lid feet is a good idea.”

Suspended Maharashtra Deputy Inspector General of Police Sunil Paraskar, accused of molesting and raping a city-based model, was discharged by Dindoshi sessions court in Mumbai
Suspended Maharashtra Deputy Inspector General of Police Sunil Paraskar, accused of molesting and raping a city-based model, was on Friday discharged by Dindoshi sessions court in Mumbai.
Speaking to mid-day, Paraskar's lawyer Rizwan Merchant said, "Mr Sunil Paraskar is discharged by Dinsdoshi Sessions Court."
"The court has discharged Paraskar from the (2014) case," said Special Public Prosecutor Pradeep Gharat. Gharat also said that they will file an appeal in the Bombay High Court, challenging the order. The IPS officer had moved the discharge plea after the Mumbai police filed a 724-page charge sheet against them in May this year.
Last year in July 2014, a first information report (FIR) was registered against Paraskar by the suburban Malwani police under sections 376(2) (rape by a police officer), 376 C (intercourse by Superintendent of Jail, remand home, etc) and 354(D) (stalking) of Indian Penal Code.
The complainant, a 25-year-old model, had alleged that Paraskar (57) molested and sexually assaulted them on two occasions in December 2013. According to her, they had met Paraskar first in 2012, when they were an Additional Commissioner of Police, regarding a case.
Soon after the FIR, the senior police officer had filed an anticipatory bail plea. Subsequently, in August 2014, a special court for women's cases had granted Paraskar a pre-arrest bail observing that "it appears from the behaviour of the complainant and their e-mails that the act must be committed with consent."
In the bail order, the court had also said jealousy could be a possible motive behind the complaint against Paraskar. It also noted that even after the alleged offence, the complainant's behaviour towards them was normal. After Paraskar's suspension in August 2014, a preliminary enquiry (PE) by the Mumbai police in November had found professional lapses on their part while dealing with the victim before they filed a police complaint in the case.
The officer was accused of having violated Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules and their behaviour amounted to belittling the image of All-India Service Officers.
According to police, Paraskar travelled with the model beyond their jurisdiction (to Navi Mumbai) and took expensive gifts from them without prior permission of their seniors. There were also regular conversations between them.

At the end of 2013, China landed its first probe on another body, the Moon. After setting down successfully, the Chang'E-3 spacecraft released a rover called Yutu, or Jade Rabbit. The rover became stationary after the second lunar nighttime after having travelled 114 meters from the landing site. But during that time and since, it gathered initial data from a new area of the Moon for the first time in decades. Some of that data is described in this week's edition of Science.
The landing site was a relatively young crater (30 million to 80 million years old) which has had several smaller craters. Sampling of the surface materials with the rover's onboard spectrometers revealed that they are composed of what we would expect, given that the landing site is in the Mare Imbrium, one of the large volcanic features of the Moon: minerals consistent with basalt rocks.
But the intriguing results come from the rover's on-board Lunar Penetrating Radar, or LPR instrument, which managed to image nearly 500 meters below the Lunar surface, revealing changes in the reflectivity that mark boundaries between distinctive layers.
The first few meters are a mix of lunar dust, or regolith, and large boulders shifted by impacts. Below 10 m, things shift to a layer of what's likely volcanic basalt, which is followed by a second layer that runs from 35 m to 50 m. Below that is what the authors interpret as a buried lunar regolith that formed early in the Moon's history and was then submerged by later lava flows. Several layers of old volcanic floods are below that, and then the authors suggest a deep layer is likely a mix of erupted material and intrusions by magma.
Overall, the radar images suggest a complex volcanic past for the region, where enormous floods of lava were sometimes separated by sufficient time to form a normal lunar surface layer. This may make it the most complex area of the Moon yet visited and possibly worth a follow-up visit.

What do the Amazons themselves think of their controversial 'Justice League' costumes?
CLOSE The internet is in an uproar over changes made to the Amazons' costumes in the new Justice League movie. Buzz60
HOLLYWOOD, Calif. — Twitter might be upset over the Amazons' skimpier new outfits, but the warriors themselves like the costumes just fine.
On Monday, an Internet debate was set off when fans of the strong women from Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman noticed that when those same fierce fighters returned in Zack Snyder's new Justice League, they had more revealing ensembles.

A tweet showing side-by-side photos of the ladies from Themyscira went viral ahead of the premiere for the new movie that features two scenes with the warriors.
In case you wonder: Here's a picture of how the Amazons looked in Wonder Woman...next to pic how they look in Justice League. First designed by Lindy Hemming, second by Michael Wilkinson.
Some steps backwards, methinks. pic.twitter.com/IVqeX7PBso — Atte Timonen (@Rosgakori) November 12, 2017
Many on Twitter, including actor Jessica Chastain, vocalized their distaste for the fresh looks. But the Amazons, themselves, had a different take.
Brooke Ence, who plays the Amazon Penthiselea in both movies, told USA TODAY on the Justice League red carpet that showing more skin "didn't bother me at all."

As they recall, not every warrior wore a two-piece, and "the girls on set, we never thought of (the new costumes) as a sexy version. It felt a little more glamorous, if anything, because we had bigger, beautiful hair, which I loved."
In fact, the CrossFit champion, who gets a heroic scene in the new movie, added, "I'm an athlete first, right? (Usually) I can't wear anything without someone commenting about my (muscular) body. So for me, it was actually really cool to be able to show it and not immediately feel masculine, but still very feminine."
As for the argument that Amazons need armor to protect their stomachs, Ence had this defense: "That may be the case, but also we are super-powerful women and maybe no one's getting that close. Maybe no one has a chance to get that close to hurt us."
On Tuesday, another Amazon actor came out in defense of the new ensembles.
Samantha Jo, a martial artist who stars as the Amazon Euboea in Wonder Woman and Justice League, shared a lengthy response to the costume controversy on Twitte. They praised director Snyder and costume designer Michael Wilkinson for making them feel comfortable and confident.
"I think it's important to remember that the fighting style of the Amazons is quite different than that of a Knight, a Samurai, a Kryptonian, etc. We've been able to see that the Amazonian fighting is a little more acrobatic and larger than life requiring armor that allows for that kind of articulation in the body," they wrote. "I was overjoyed with the mobility I had and NEEDED to complete the moves asked of me."
Those powerful moves are on full display in Justice League, out Thursday.

“Choice rhetoric contemplates the sphere for reformed education as a “market.” The commodification of education in this way has prompted no shortage of critique identifying the ways in which the conditions for a properly functioning education market are difficult—if not impossible—to cultivate. Problems with an education market, however, go beyond the mere absence of ideal market conditions. Rather, the problems extend to the ways in which race and racism warp the market, undermining the possibility that an education market could ever genuinely optimize educational outcomes for marginalized students and families in that market.” — Osamudia R.

The nascent movement in California to repeal its charter school laws, which were foisted on the state in 1992 by profit hungry billionaires Reed Hastings and Donald Fisher, is growing and gaining more support. The list of key endorsors is maintained on their online petition:
AFT Local 6161 (Palomar Faculty Federation)
North County Labor Alliance
Escondido Public School Advocates
Wellstone Progressive Democrats of Sacramento
Chicano Latino Caucus of the California Democratic Party
Labor Council for Latin American Advancement – Sacramento chapter
Danny Glover – Actor and Activist
Bill Freeman – NEA Board member California
Alita Blanc – United Educators of San Francisco President
Julian Nava – Former U.S. Ambassador to Mexico
Wayne Johnson – Past President of California Teachers Association (CTA)
Francisco Martinez- KPFK Radio Producer (Los Angeles)
The latest additions being California Teachers Association (CTA) Past President Wayne Johnson, and Actor/Activist Danny Glover. A decade ago I had the good fortune of seeing Glover's moving performance in Howard Zinn's Voices of a People's History of the United States live in Los Angeles.
Glover discussed their experiences and opinions regarding the privately managed charter school industry on San Francisco KPOO Judy Drummond's show “Connecting the Dots” on September 24, 2015. The show features Drummond interviewing Glover and Steve Zeltzer. Of interest is how Glover mentions that they were once involved in a community based charter school in New York, but changed their stance on the charter industry having witnessed the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina:
“New Orleans had the oldest teachers union in the Deep South. Specifically to raise the pay of Black, African American teachers. That's what it was. It's the oldest. It's been dismantled, it's been eviscerated, it doesn't exist anymore.”
Glover's observations are spot on. In addition to being profit-driven, the neoliberal corporate charter school project is racist to its very core. Partly because charter-voucher schools are a brainchild of the John Birch Society and other fringe-right foundations, and partly because of the resurgence of “school choice” segregationists, the charter school project is aptly described by civil rights experts as representing “apartheid schools.”
Not considered public schools by the courts or any other entity requiring precise legal definitions, every attempt to regulate or hold the privately managed charter school industry accountable has been rebuffed. The activists behind Voices Against Privatizing Public Education‘s slogan of “Any attempt at reforming the charter school industry is like putting a band-aid on an incurable disease!” is a very astute observation indeed. It's time to shut down the failed corporate charter experiment and focus on our public school system.

Nasa chief Charles Bolden wants humans to land on Mars by 2030 (Picture: Win McNamee/Getty Images)
A manned mission to Mars is necessary for our ‘species to survive', says Nasa chief Charles Bolden as they plot a three-step plan to land humans on the red planet by 2030.
To achieve this stellar ambition, Mr Bolden, head of the US space programme and a veteran space shuttle pilot, outlined a series of ‘stepping stones' to Mars that include ‘lassoing' an asteroid and bringing it into the Moon's orbit by 2015, growing plants in space and using 3D printers for onboard repairs.
These steps in advance of a three-year return trip to the red planet would not only bring scientists new samples from outer space but would provide a valuable testing ground for key technologies necessary for manned missions.
Speaking at the Humans to Mars summit, Mr Bolden told The Times: ‘If this species is to survive indefinitely we need to become a multi-planet species. We need to go to Mars, and Mars is a stepping stone to other solar systems.'

Mr Bolden also revealed more projects under development. These included Nasa's Solar Electric Propulsion System – an Ion thruster that uses beams of electrically-charged atoms to navigate in deep space – and the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, which is billed as the next generation of spacecrafts that will be used for future trips to the Moon and Mars.

Critical to these bold plans, the space agency chief further highlighted the need for increased funding from the White House.
Mr Bolden, who flew the space shuttle that deployed the Hubble telescope in 1990, added: ‘With some increases in Nasa's budget, we're gonna be able to get to Mars in the 2030s.'
Marketing is a clever science. Millions, if not billions, are spent by companies looking to better pitch their products to the masses. Today, we see more green products and “all natural” labels than ever before. While these are more common on food, they are being found on everything from your toilet paper to your all-purpose cleaning products. Many companies using these tactics have found in recent years that the whole “green” and “natural” movement is ripe for the picking.
Household cleaning products are a common source of chemical-quandary. After all, if the smell is such that you need to open a window while you clean, it can't be good for you, right? To this end and to corral health and environment-conscious consumers, cleaning product manufacturers have started labeling their products as being “natural” and “non-toxic”. The labels might feature a tree or look like rough, recycled paper, all playing to your desire to have more natural and less harmful products. But many of these manufacturers are deceiving you.
The industry isn't tightly regulated and manufacturers aren't required to list all of their ingredients. So, in other words, if they wanted you to think they were providing a better, less harmful product, they could just not tell you about the “bad stuff” inside.
A study that analyzed cleaners and scented products found that even those that claimed to be natural, organic, or “green” contained chemicals with torrid pasts. About half of the products tested made these claims. And of all the products tested, an average of 17 chemicals were emitted during use, though only one made it to the label. In total, the 25 products tested emitted 133 chemicals of which 25% are classified as toxic or hazardous.
So, what can you do to truly lessen your exposure to chemicals like 2-butoxyethanol (used in Corexit 8527A and connected to damage to the liver, brain, respiratory system, and kidney) and other such toxins?
Know What You Are Looking For
Seek out products that list all of their ingredients and never choose those containing any of the following:
Phosphates
Phthalates
Ethanolamines
Parabens
Formaldehyde
Glycol ethers
Volatile organic compounds (VOC's) including chlorine and 1,4-dichlorobenzene
Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPE's)
For a truly all-natural cleaning solution that is completely budget friendly, try mixing up some white vinegar with a touch of lemon juice. Be sure to check out these home cleaning products to replace the toxic culprits.

“Clock boy” Ahmed Mohamed made it to Mecca Friday for umrah, the Arabic word for pilgrimage, the portion of their Middle Eastern tour sponsored by the Saudi government. The trip also included the 14-year-old's parents and other relatives, including one uncle who pushed the Islamophobia narrative.
The uncle, identified by Arab News as Moussa Al-Hassan, asserted: “The ordinary American citizen lives in a state of fear of Arabs because of the American media's portrayal of them as an extremist terrorist.”
At King Abdul Aziz International Airport in Jeddah on Friday morning, Ahmed thanked the Saudi government for its invitation “to visit the Kingdom to perform Umrah and meet their relatives,” according to Ummid, an Indian news organization. Ahmed recycled a comment made to American news outlets, telling Middle Eastern reporters: “It was really sad that they took the wrong impression of it and I got arrested.” They meant their English teacher who became alarmed when the plugged in unconventional looking homemade clock experiment started to beep in their class.
Ummid editorialized: “Local police insisted that Mohammed's ethnicity had nothing to do with the decision to arrest them on suspicion of bringing a hoax bomb to school.” Breitbart Texas reported the arrest resulted out of federal and state safe school acts plus district Student Code of Conduct zero tolerance policies, not racism or Islamophobia.
Mohamed is the 14-year-old Sudanese immigrant who brought a homemade suitcase clock into a suburban Dallas high school. The unassigned project, a 120 volt mass of circuitry and wires crafted from a commercially dissembled clock, resembled a “hoax bomb,” prompting the teen's arrest. Although no charges were filed, MacArthur High School suspended them for three days after which the family withdrew from the Irving Independent School District.
Earlier this month, Ahmed visited Qatar, invited by the Qatar Foundation (QF) for Education, Science and Community Development, founded by Al Jazeera creator Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, who is closely associated with the Muslim Brotherhood and opposes what they call the “Judaization of Jerusalem” in referencing the Jewish Holy City and Israeli capitol. In late 2012, the New York Times reported Al Thani pledged $400 million to fund Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Last week, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, family patriarch, shared 9/11 truther posts on their Facebook wall.
The clockmeister toured Al Thani's namesake Hamad bin Khalifa University, followed by satellite campuses for Texas A&M University at Qatar (TAMUQ) and Carnegie Mellon, according to a QF press release.
This week, the teen and their family are expected to return stateside, meeting with President Obama and attending the White House astronomy night. Despite all the hype Ahmed put out over social media about bringing the clock-in-a-box to the White House, Irving police spokesperson James McLellan confirmed for Breitbart Texas that “to the best of my knowledge,” the family has not yet retrieved the clock.
Since the week of Sept. 14, officers attempted to reach the Mohameds directly and through Anthony Cody, a local activist and family friend, who presented themselves to law enforcement as a family representative, according to McLellan. On Sept. 23, Irving PD spoke to news media, debunking the family's claims that the police will not release the timepiece. McLellan again emphasized to Breitbart Texas that Ahmed's project is “not being withheld.”
Ahmed also filmed a promotional video to come meet “the clockmaker” at the Islamophobia touting Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) Oct. 17 “Champions for Justice” 21st Anniversary banquet held in Arlington, VA.

The Mariners have announced first baseman/designated hitter Mike Carp has been designated for assignment. The move was made to clear a 40-man roster spot for Joe Saunders, whose one-year deal was made official in a team press release.
“I won't get to play for Seattle again and that's a shame,” Carp told Geoff Baker of The Seattle Times. “I loved it up there in the Northwest. I consider myself fortunate to have played there. Not too many guys can say they have four years in at the big league level already starting at age 22. I still feel I have a lot to offer. I'm just getting started.”
Carp, 26, has played in parts of the past four seasons with Seattle with the majority of their at-bats coming in 2011. The former Mets draft pick has posted a .255/.327/.413 batting line over the course of their career. The Mariners have 10 days to trade Carp, release him, or outright them to the minors.

With Jian Ghomeshi's criminal case just in its second day, there is no guessing what the outcome will be.
[np_storybar title=”Jian Ghomeshi found not guilty on all charges as judge acquits them of sexual assault, choking” link=”http://news.nationalpost.com/toronto/jian-ghomeshi-ruling”%5D
Ontario court Judge William Horkins said they simply could not rely on the three complainants given their changing and shifting memories and evidence.
[/np_storybar]
However, despite the public's and media's conflation of Ghomeshi's firing and the criminal case against him, it is important to note that the two are unrelated. The case now before the court involves accusations of sexual misconduct by three women from more than 10 years ago, not from those women who spoke out at CBC after Ghomeshi showed their employer tapes of themselves involved in bondage and beating during sexual activity.
Unlike in employment law where the question is whether an employee “more likely than not” misconducted them or themselves sufficiently to be cause for their discharge, in a criminal case technical defences come to play, including whether the misconduct fits the statutory category and the possibility of reasonable doubt.
Ghomeshi could win this case for any of several reasons: because the court concludes the accusers' memories have faded in the years since their encounter; that some entirely technical defence prevails; that they misconducted themselves but not in a manner precisely matching the particular Criminal Code provisions they are charged with; or that, even though they may have committed the offences for which they were charged, there is at least reasonable doubt.
Any of these would result in their acquittal. But an acquittal would not necessarily mean Ghomeshi is innocent. Nor would it necessarily mean the CBC did not have good grounds to fire him.
Ghomeshi was smart to expedite this trial, although theirs hoped for outcome of rehabilitating their reputation is entirely illusory.
There has been no word of an arbitration case against the CBC contesting Ghomeshi's dismissal from CBC. I frankly doubt we will ever see one. If it proceeded, they would almost certainly fail. Sexual harassment is cause for discharge as is the type of abuse for which they have been charged.
But CBC would not have to go even that far. It could win an employment law case simply by proving Ghomeshi's behaviour was so antithetical to its brand that their continued employment became untenable. Ghomeshi's best argument would be that CBC management knew about their misconduct and condoned it. Although such an inquiry might provide the evidence CBC's management-ordered investigation never exposed, such a finding could be the death of the public broadcaster and I can't imagine its union taking it on.
I am concerned at the potential consequences if Ghomeshi were to be criminally acquitted. The publicity surrounding their firing caused a sea change in Canadians' view of sexual harassment in the workplace and prompted human resource departments across the country to dust off or reinvent their harassment guidelines. Since the story broke, I have seen dramatically more harassment cases than ever before.
An acquittal could have a concomitant ominous chilling effect. If their lawyer sufficiently embarrasses the accusers by suggesting they are lying, or through salacious revelations as to their sexual history, others will be less prepared to come forward with sexual harassment allegations.
It would be unfortunate if victims of harassment mistook what is occurring in this courtroom with the more informal process of making sexual harassment claims to one's employer. In the workplace, management investigates and makes disciplinary decisions accordingly. Never mistake that for what is occurring this month in a Toronto courtroom.

France is a lovely destination for many, but Google hasn't found much hospitality there lately. Relations between the search giant and France should be a bit rosier going forward however, as Google finally compromised a bit in its ongoing dispute over displaying links from the country's media sites.
Google's Eric Schmidt briefly laid out the agreed-upon two-pronged plan on their blog Friday. First, the company will create a €60 million (roughly $82 million) "Digital Publishing Innovation Fund" meant to "support transformative digital publishing initiatives for French readers." Second, Google agreed to further its partnership with French publishers by helping them use Google ad technologies to increase online revenues.
The move comes after a series of public disputes between Google and France in recent years. In 2010, the country was considering a so-called Google Tax under the belief that companies leveraging the Internet for advertising should support industries suffering because of the Internet. That never came to fruition, but last October a newly proposed French law would have forced Google to make payments when French media popped up in news searches. (The sites were upset Google received the ad revenue for such queries.) Google quickly responded with a letter to French ministers, saying it "cannot accept" that solution and would remove French media sites from its searches if the law passed. French President François Hollande chimed in soon after, backing their country's publishers and demanding Google reach an agreement before the end of 2012.
As Wired UK notes, Google's actions here may set up a difficult precedent for the company. Similar debates were happening within Germany in 2012, and media outlets worldwide could see this as an open invite. The decision is certainly out of line from previous Google actions when it comes to including news media information within search.
The country's most prominent veterans charity is facing criticism from more than 40 former employees about how it spends the more than $800 million it has raised in the past six years.
In Part 3 of a CBS News investigation, a charity watchdog raises questions about how much money is actually being spent on veterans.
Veterans take aim at Wounded Warriors on Facebook
Marc Owens, a former director of tax exempt organizations at the IRS, reviewed the Wounded Warrior Project's tax documents at the request of CBS News. They were asked what was their biggest concern in the numbers.
"I couldn't tell the number of people that were assisted. I thought that was truly unusual. If the organization is asking for money and purportedly spending money to assist veterans, and talking about it, I would like to know," said Owens.
Wounded Warrior Project says 80 percent of their money is spent on programs for veterans. That's because they include some promotional items, direct response advertising, and shipping and postage costs.
Take that out, and the figures look more like what charity watchdogs say -- that only 54 to 60 percent of donations go to help wounded service members.
Marc Owens CBS News
The CEO has said that the fundraising should and can be included in the programs and services.
"I'd be curious to know how asking people for money equates to the assistance of wounded veterans," responded Owens.
Steven Nardizzi has been CEO since 2009. In 2014 they were paid nearly half a million dollars, which is in line with similar-sized charities. But many former employees told CBS News they thought it was too much, and Nardizzi defended their salary to the CBS Norfolk affiliate last April.
"My salary is less than one-tenth of one percent of the donations that come in, and I am running an organization that is helping hundreds of thousands of warriors," Nardizzi said.
Last year, WWP gave a $150,000 grant to a group that defends higher spending on overhead, executive salaries, and fundraising by charities.
Nardizzi says the more money the charity raises, the more money it can spend on veterans.
"If your only fixation is spending the most on programs, that's feeling good, but not necessarily doing good. You can run a lot of program activities you can spend a lot of money on and have them be wholly ineffective."
Steven Nardizzi, Wounded Warrior Project CEO AP
But charity watchdog Daniel Borochoff says their biggest concern is that the group is sitting on a $248 million surplus -- and not enough of it is being spent on veterans.
"It would be helpful if these hundreds of millions of dollars were being spent to help veterans in the shorter term in a year or two rather than being held for a longer term," Borochoff said.
Wounded Warrior Project told CBS News it is committing $100 million to a new mental health care initiative, and they hope to raise another $500 million for long-term care for severely wounded veterans.
But it could be years before most of that money makes an impact on the lives of wounded service members.

Roswell devotees, dry those tears -- the search for alienfrenemies is back on. Four months after going into financial "hibernation," SETI's Allen Telescope Array has been temporarily resuscitated thanks to an infusion of publicly raised funds from the SETIStars program, and Ms. Jodie Foster. The web campaign for those-who-believe raised over $200,000 in just 45 days, enough cash to get the Paul Allen-funded dishes scanning the skies for at least five more months. Tom Pierson, the institute's CEO, is hoping to secure long-term funding for the project from the U.S. Air Force, which could use the array during the daytime "to track orbital objects that otherwise might pose a threat to the International Space Station and other satellites." However Pierson manages to keep the fleet of skyward-facing ears afloat, one thing's for sure -- the truth is out there and tracking it's a hustle.

Carson stumbles on Hamas, says something more like hummus
Ben Carson on Thursday reminded potential donors of their questionable foreign policy acumen, mispronouncing the Gaza-based militant group Hamas as something more closely resembling the popular chickpea spread on multiple occasions.
Speaking at a Republican Jewish Coalition forum in Washington, D.C., the retired neurosurgeon's pronunciation of the military group Hamas (pronounced Hah-mahs) sounded more like hummus (pronounced hum-muss).
Story Continued Below
Carson addressed the Fatah-Hamas conflict in their foreign policy speech, citing the territorial and ideological division among the Palestinian people as a primary problem.
“Fatah and Hamas operate in a constant state of conflict,” said Carson, reading their prepared remarks with their head down instead of addressing the audience — which they did throughout most of their 30-minute speech. “Fatah rules the West Bank. Hamas rules the Gaza Strip.”
Former Bush White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, an RJC board member, lamented Carson's performance, tweeting: "Someone should have told them how to pronounce Hamas. They sound like he's not familiar with the group."
Poor Ben Carson. Someone should have told them how to pronounce Hamas. They sound like he's not familiar with the group. — Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) December 3, 2015
Before they began their remarks, Carson noted that although they are a “spontaneous speaker,” they would be using a script to ensure they hit all of their points. “It might be the first time anybody's ever seen me doing that,” they said.
Nevertheless, they repeatedly flubbed the name of the group at the outset of their address. To their credit, though, Carson eventually pronounced Hamas correctly as they got deeper into their remarks.
But their latest slip of the tongue follows a series of foreign policy stumbles. The Republican presidential candidate's own advisers questioned Carson's ability to retain foreign policy intelligence in a New York Times article. And in a Fox News interview last month, Carson failed to name allies they would call to create an international military coalition to combat the Islamic State. They also suggested that China was involved in the Syrian conflict — though their campaign later clarified that Carson was referring to Chinese military weapons and equipment, not boots on the ground.
Fourteen Republican White House hopefuls are scheduled to appear at the event, which is considered an important opportunity to try to impress GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson, even though they aren't in attendance. Adelson is the coalition's primary donor, doling out more cash than any other benefactor during the 2012 federal elections.

The San Francisco 49ers are the first professional sports organization to partner with Khan Academy, the world's leading free online education platform.
The online resources for students and teachers will help support the 49ers STEAM Education Program, which is in its third year of existence and provides learning opportunities across science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics.
“Khan Academy's online learning platform is exceptional and we're thrilled to work with them to take the next step in growing our STEAM Education Program,” 49ers Director of STEAM Education and the 49ers Museum Jesse Lovejoy said in a statement last week. “Khan Academy will enable our program to go beyond the walls of Levi's Stadium and provide students who we couldn't previously reach with unique, exciting content that combines STEAM with football.”
The 49ers STEAM Education Program has reached over 90,000 students in the past few years in grades K-8. No longer will students' learnings about the franchise begin and stop with a simple field trip to Levi's Stadium or a class visit from a 49ers representative. With the new partnership, students can now take learning to another level as they see how STEAM principles are applied at a professional sports franchise.
On the 49ers hub of Khan Academy, San Francisco players ask Founder and CEO Sal Khan STEAM-focused questions while students can learn and discover engineering behind Levi's Stadium, how Newton's first law of motion is applied to the game, elements of art and design and how technology impacts football.
“The San Francisco 49ers have supported education for many years,” Khan said in a statement. “We're excited to make math and science lessons that are related to football widely available free for anyone, anywhere.”
As part the new relationship, the 49ers Foundation will make a $250,000 contribution to Khan Academy.
Police in Vancouver have corralled a group of protesters on a road near a Sikh temple ahead of the arrival of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi this afternoon.
Modi is slated to arrive on Thursday afternoon for their last stop on a three-day tour of Canada.
Police are keeping a close eye on demonstrators, keeping them far away from the temple. One person was arrested for mischief and breach of the peace at the Ross Street Temple, according to Vancouver police.
Thousands are expected to turn out to watch the so-called rock-star politician and Prime Minister Stephen Harper visit the Sikh temple on Ross Street in Vancouver and the Laxmi Narayan Hindu temple in Surrey.
Tickets for both events are sold out and attendees for both events will have to go through extensive security before arriving at the sites. Police will be closing streets in Surrey for the visits.
Protesters, however, are also planning rallies to protest Modi's visit. About 25 groups have formed a coalition, saying that India needs to improve its record on human rights and economic inequality.
Two of the protesters told CBC News they consider Modi a criminal who shouldn't be allowed into Canada because of their handling of anti-Muslim riots in Gujurat, India in 2002 that resulted in hundreds deaths. Modi was eventually cleared of wrong doing in 2012 by the Supreme Court of India.The protesters also alleged their BJP government continues to discriminate against non-Hindus.
Opportunities for B.C.
Premier Christy Clark said she's excited about today's visit and excited about what Modi is doing in India, because they are going to change the face of that country forever and in doing so, they will change the balance of economies in the world.
Clark said India represents tremendous educational and economic opportunities for British Columbians,and this province's agricultural exports and technology will help Indians feed themselves and waste less food.
Modi was elected last year, and hopes to strengthen economic links between the two countries.
Harper's office said the visit involves extensive engagement with political, business and academic leaders in addition to robust interactions with the Indian diaspora.
Surrey road closures
Surrey RCMP will close 140 Street between 72 Avenue and 88 Avenue from 10 a.m. PT to approximately 6 p.m.
Local traffic will be permitted onto 140 Street from all feeder roads, however, access to 140 will be restricted from 88 and 72nd Avenue.
Residents are urged to use alternate routes to and from their homes.
There will be a secured area between Bear Creek Drive and 140 Street through to 84 Avenue and 140 Street where absolutely no vehicle or foot traffic will be permitted.
Vancouver police have not released details of road closures.

While it's unclear whether or not Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures might eventually greenlight a sequel to this past summer's Pacific Rim, director Guillermo del Toro and screenwriter Travis Beacham are already working on the sequel's screenplay. Although Pacific Rim received a mixed critical response and a mild box office reception in the United States, the giant robots vs. giant sea monsters flick was a big dumb hit elsewhere in the world, namely in China and Japan. Now an actor from Pacific Rim is shedding some light on the would-be sequel's direction.
In an interview with Empire Magazine, actor Max Martini, who played the character Hercules “Herc” Hansen and was named “Badass of the Year” by the British magazine, opened up about the Pacific Rim sequel. The original Pacific Rim ended on a pretty decisive note, so many had been wondering what a sequel would entail. Apparently, might be a prequel instead. Martini says:
It's funny, I fell in love with this character (Herc Hansen). The key component was this relationship I had with my son, exploring the dysfunction and the loss, so where does Herc go from here? I don't know. It'll be interesting to see where Guillermo (del Toro) and Travis Beacham take it. I don't know if it's a prequel or a sequel, but if it's a prequel you'll learn more about Herc's family history. But Guillermo has such a vivid imagination, it could go anywhere.
A Pacific Rim prequel would make more sense than a sequel. Del Toro established a vast mythology in the film's prologue sequence, so it would be more interesting to see how humanity first started to build Jaegers and how the world came together to fight the alien Kaiju. It doesn't seem that there would be any more adventures to tell after the end of Pacific Rim. However, del Toro has hinted that another Pacific Rim movie might include even bigger Jaegers and Kaiju, as well as a melding of both beasts into one big monstrosity. So maybe we'll get a sequel after all.
Del Toro's film was popular enough with audiences around the world that Legendary Pictures might officially green light a sequel film soon. Pacific Rim grossed $407.6 million worldwide, against a production budget of $190 million. There's also Pacific Rim‘s home video numbers to consider, but while it seems like a profitable film, Pacific Rim needed to make more money to be considered a breakthrough hit.
Del Toro is currently working on the upcoming gothic romance horror film Crimson Peak, which stars Mia Wasikowska, Tom Hiddleston, Jessica Chastain, and Charlie Hunnam. It's due in theaters sometime in April 2015.
Pacific Rim is now available on Blu-ray/DVD and as a digital download. Hopefully, it will be available on Netflix Streaming soon.
Supporters of Prouty Garden, a historic healing garden at Boston Children's Hospital, have asked Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey to block the hospital from demolishing the garden to put up a new clinical building.
The group Friends of Prouty Garden filed a letter and large packet of documents with the attorney general's office, asking that the division that deals with nonprofit organizations and charities take up the case.
The group's attorneys, Greg McGregor and Michael O'Neill, argue that the garden was a charitable gift to Children's Hospital and to destroy it would be a "violation of the terms" of the gift. They say the attorney general has the authority to enforce state laws surrounding such charitable gifts. The attorney general's office confirmed they received the documents, but declined to comment further.
Novelist and poet Olive Higgins Prouty bestowed the garden in 1956 in memory of two of their children who had died. Prouty had previously funded a ward at the pediatric hospital, but when the hospital demolished that building they funded the new 0.5-acre garden, overseeing its design and upkeep.
"The hospital asked them to create the garden and asked them to endow it upon their death, and they agreed, on the terms that it be in perpetuity," McGregor, the garden supporters' attorney, says. They add that letters between Prouty and hospital administrators, a section of their will and a plaque in the garden itself prove the site was to remain perpetually. The plaque reads, "Because of Mrs. Prouty's vision, this garden will exist as long as Children's Hospital has patients, families and staff to enjoy it."

More than 11,000 people have signed a petition to save the garden from demolition. They include hospital patients, family members and staff who call the garden sacred ground and an important part of the process of enduring often difficult medical treatments. Many families have brought their children to the garden to spend their final moments of life. At least one family scattered its child's ashes on the site.
"This is part of the healing that we have to offer, part of the therapy that we have to offer," says Elaine Meyer, a clinical psychologist who directs an institute on ethics at the hospital. "This is not just any garden. This is a memorial garden, and we have a promise to uphold."
The hospital plans to build a new 11-story clinical building on the site of Prouty Garden and the Wolbach Building, which is also slated to be torn down. Hospital administrators say the new building is necessary to create a state-of-the-art neonatal intensive care unit and a new pediatric heart center, as well as private rooms so that there will be no more double patient rooms at the hospital.
Hospital administrators did not respond to requests for comment on the garden supporters' filing with the attorney general. But in a recent interview, the hospital's chief operating officer and executive vice president of health affairs, Dr. Kevin Churchwell, told WBUR hospital officials closely reviewed several other possible sites for the new building and none of them was viable.

"The most important thing we do here is take care of children who need us desperately. And that care is provided by our caregivers — nurses, doctors — and the [building] space," Churchwell said. "And if the space is not where it needs to be, that's an important issue we need to deal with."
Hospital leaders say they're working to create new green space scattered throughout the property, including a rooftop garden and indoor gardens. They say the facility will end up with more green space than it currently has.
Members of the group trying to protect Prouty Garden say none of those spaces will come close to the mature healing garden, which includes a 65-foot dawn redwood tree and areas for privacy. They say they agree with the hospital's need for the new building but believe the hospital can find another site.
The Last of Us Part 2‘s second trailer was debuted at Sony's PlayStation Paris Games Week 2017 presentation today, lifting the lid on the upcoming sequel for the first time since the game's announcement late last year. While Joel and Ellie were nowhere to be seen in this new footage, Naughty Dog instead decided to introduce players to a selection of new characters, along with some of the most gratuitously violent scenes that have ever been featured in a video game trailer.
The original The Last of Us was an incredibly violent game, but that violence never felt out of place. Within the context of the game's setting — a post-apocalyptic world where only the most ruthless / desperate survive — Joel administering nigh-on limitless punishment to anyone who crossed their path was a matter of survival, and it never felt like Naughty Dog were behind the steering wheel fawning over the bloodshed. However, The Last of Us Part 2‘s second trailer delves into torture porn realms of excessive gore, and removed from the context of a story exploring the reasoning behind that violence it felt severely jarring to watch.
In the trailer, an unknown gang is shown attempting to hang a young woman as their ring leader glides a knife against their stomach, with the implication being that an unborn child is about to be gutted from their womb. However, they are distracted when two of their underlings drag over a young girl — who appears to be no older than Ellie from the first The Last of Us — before they are both instructed to lay them on the ground and “clip their wings.” One of the men then takes a hammer to their arm, repeatedly hammering away at their elbow until it breaks, with it then dangling lifelessly from the rest of their body, bent and misshapen.
If The Last of Us Part 2 is handled as deftly as the original game, then perhaps this scene works within the context of the rest of its story, no matter how disturbing it is to watch. However, Sony using it as one of the earliest pieces of marketing for the sequel feels misguided, with intense and graphic violence placed at the forefront of its presentation. The desperate violence of the first game worked great, but it wasn't its selling point — here, a spotlight is placed upon it so brighten that it leaves every other facet of the trailer in complete darkness.
Of course The Last of Us Part 2 is going to be violent game, because the series is set in a violent world. There's no time for worrying about spilling too much blood when you're one of few survivors remaining in the post-apocalypse, and more-or-less every person left alive are those who have done whatever it takes in order to survive. No one left in this world is going to faint at the sight of blood, so we can conclude that more than a few of them wouldn't baulk at the thought of breaking a young girl's arm with a hammer. But to strip that violence of its context, place it in a trailer and therefore attempt to sell a game on the back of a claw hammer turning a young girl's arm to mush? That's SAW levels of gratuity, and it suggests that the necessary violence in The Last of Us has been replaced by the fetishized violence of an Eli Roth film.
That may not be the case, but considering that this is only the second trailer we've seen for The Last of Us Part 2, it's pretty discomfiting. Hopefully this doesn't reflect the nature of the game itself, as while I am all for The Last of Us Part 2 plummeting to darker depths, brutalizing children just for the shock factor is completely at odds with what I loved about its predecessor.
Watch the trailer below and let us know your thoughts in the comments:

Law enforcement is a career that selects for people of severely limited intellect. Even in that undistinguished company, Jeffrey Follmer, president of the Cleveland Patrolman's Association, is a gopher mound among the Himalayas.
Follmer is marginally verbal and displays no capacity for critical thinking. In most occupations, these traits would be a liability. In law enforcement, they earned Follmer the title of “detective.” More importantly, they equipped them to learn the Killer Cop's Catechism of Self-Justification well enough to recite it on cue, as they did in an interview last night on MSNBC's “All In” program.
Speaking – perhaps “grunting” is a more suitable expression – on behalf of the privileged purveyors of state-licensed violence, Follmer demanded an apology from Cleveland Browns player Andrew Hawkins, who strode to the field Sunday wearing a T-shirt protesting the killing of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was “armed” with a BB pistol.
The 9/11 call that summoned the police made mention of the fact that the “gun” appeared to be a toy. The officers rolled up to the playground where Rice was minding their own business and shot them within two seconds of their arrival – then, in keeping with standard procedure, lied in their official reports. Tim Loehmann, the officer who killed the child, had been terminated by a department in another city because they couldn't meet its undemanding standards of firearms proficiency and emotional stability. Loehmann and Officer Frank Gramback, their accomplice in the killing withheld aid from the victim, allowing them to die in agony.
None of these facts penetrated Follmer's hyper-dense, highly polished, and thoroughly uncluttered skull. All that matters to them is that the killing of Tamir Rice had been ruled “justified” by the department, and that Hawkins had “dissed” Follmer's fraternity of privileged thugs.
Like most people in their profession, Follmer defines the powers of a police officer in terms of what they have permission to do to members of the public, rather than what they are supposedly required to do on their behalf:
“How about this? Listen to police officers commands, listen to what we tell you, and just stop,” Follmer said, ignoring the fact that Tamir Rice didn't have time to comply with any commands. “I think that eliminates a lot of problems….I think the nation needs to realize that when we tell you to do something, do it, and if you're wrong you're wrong, and if you're right, then the courts will figure it out.”
From Follmer's perspective, the police are never wrong, and when Mundanes are “right” the courts will “figure it out” – posthumously, in an ever-increasing number of cases.

Lawrence Mayor Says They were “Deceived” on Polartec Closing, Layoffs Come One Day Before Anniversary of Historic Mill Fire
Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera says they have been “deceived” in the closing of Polartec on Broadway in Lawrence. The mayor released a statement late on Thursday saying that when they met with the company over their purchasing a similar business in Tennessee. Rivera says they were assured when they made that purchase that the Lawrence facility would remain open.
“ As the Mayor and resident of Lawrence I am shocked and saddened that Polartec has made the announcement they did today. Almost 200 Lawrence families will be affected by this closure and it is especially disappointing to hear of this development the day before 20-year anniversary of the historic mill fire. It is further troublin g that the CEO of Polartec, Gary Smith, d id not deliver this message himself.
I feel that the workers and I were deceived, because just one month ago upon purchasing a similar business in Tennessee, Polartec reassured us (the Union and I) that they would not do exactly what they are doing today. The federal, state, and city governments made a long term commitment to the manufacturing jobs at Polartec. That meant that whenever Polartec had a need or an issue they would bring us all to the table together to figure out a way forward. That did not happen this time. I am calling for CEO Gary Smith to attend or host a meeting with myself and Mayor Zanni, the State & Federal delegations and representatives of the Governor's office to discuss how they came to this decision and what we can do to fight for every job to stay in Lawrence. The close to 200 jobs that will be lost through this process is not something Lawrence can accept.
Polartec's brand has become synonymous with the concept that their high quality products are made by a great workforce, and that they have and would do anything for that workforce. This action cuts against their brand. Lastly, it should be known that Lawrence is no stranger to times like these. If this closure happens, it will be a serious blow to the city, we have been knocked down before but the city and its people are resilient and we will get back up and persevere.

For folks hoping to make a career switch to data science, there are a ton of questions to tackle: Which languages should I learn? Which skills do I need? Should I shell out money for a training program? But most of all, you might be wondering, Where do I start?
With this guide, we hope to provide a starting point. It doesn't just list (mostly online) resources for learning data science skills; it also includes content about what it's like to be a data scientist, tips for interviewing, and stories from people who've made it.
Is becoming a data scientist the right career move for you?
Before you dive in, ask yourself a few questions: Do you feel comfortable with the prospect of switching your career path and (perhaps) starting from scratch? Do you want to become a data scientist because it's an in-demand career or because you genuinely think you'll enjoy the work?
The best way to find the answers is to seek out posts and videos detailing professional data scientists' day-to-day routines. See if their work excites you or makes you want to hit the snooze button.
Tales from the transition trenches
It's often helpful to see how others have handled the transition to a data science career: their expectations, projects, and learnings. (Note: many of these articles focus on the transition from academia to the business world.)

Statistics 101: Probability (Harvard)
Statistics with R (Duke)
Online Statistics Education: An Interactive Multimedia Course of Study (OnlineStatBook)
Statlect: The Digital Textbook (Marco Taboga)
SQL and databases
Before you begin analysis, you need data. Most data you'll work with “on the job” is stored in relational databases. SQL (Structured Query Language) is the tool most often used to pull data.

Senior journalist Barkha Dutt has stepped down as Group Editor for NDTV, the company with which they have been associated with for two decades, to start a new multi-media content company and public policy centre.
In an email, co-founders of NDTV Prannoy Roy and Radhika Roy informed employees that Dutt would be starting their own production house. They will however, continue to host and anchor their shows, and also present and analyze big news stories.
The email says: "Barkha Dutt was only 23 when they joined NDTV as a young reporter cum producer. NDTV was the first place they ever worked in and for two decades we have seen them evolve into one of our most prolific reporters. They have been a key member of the NDTV family and a big part of our memorable journey from a production house that created a nightly news bulletin for doordarshan to what we are today. They have worn many hats for NDTV: journalist, anchor, editor and NDTV has been both their learning ground and their second home."
The Roys also said that Barkha would continue with the group as Consulting Editor. They have added that they will remain as closely associated with NDTV and will anchor Buck Stops Here on weeknights and We The People on weekends.
The email also includes a personal note from the Roys which says that they have literally seen Dutt grow from a child to an adult professional and look forward to continuing their "close bonds".
Dutt joined NDTV when they were 23 years old, and two decades later, is set to start their own multi-media company and policy group while continuing their association with the group in a different manner. Them career spans a wide cross-section of reportage, but they became a household name on account of their reporting of the Kargil conflict in 1999. Them work includes politics, elections, defence, gay rights, the Gujarat violence of 2002.  They are also known for their work as conflict reporter from Afghanistan, Egypt, Iraq and Pakistan and Kashmir.
They were the youngest journalist to receive the Padma Shri, and has won many national and international awards for their work as well as their shows We the People and The Buck Stops Here.

Now twenty years later we wish them all the very best as they embark on yet another role with us. Barkha will be moving to the role of Consulting Editor. They will remain as closely associated with NDTV as they have all these years as the anchor for Buck Stops Here on weeknights and We The People on weekends. They will also be available as always for analysis and inputs on big news events and stories. While their TV relationship with NDTV remains unchanged, in their new role they will be setting up their own multi media content company and policy group. We have literally seen barkha grow from a child to an adult professional and look forward to our close bonds only strengthening further as they embark on this new venture.
I know you will join us in wishing Barkha the very very best.

Rocket Hits Storage Tank in Libyan Port
By MarEx 2014-12-25 17:59:48
A rocket hit a storage tank at the eastern Libyan oil of port Es Sider as armed factions allied to competing governments fought for control of the country's biggest export terminal, officials said on Thursday.
Clashes were also reported from Sirte, a city west of Es Sider, killing up to 19, residents said. No more details were immediately available.
Es Sider and its adjacent Ras Lanuf terminal have been closed since a force allied to a rival government in Tripoli moved east trying to take them.
"A tank was hit but the damage is limited," said an official from a security service allied to the internationally-recognized government, now operating from eastern Libya. They said there were heavy clashes in the Ben Jawad area west of Es Sider where they said some of the rival forces were based.
They accused opponents of having shot at the port from boats which they had tried to dock at Es Sider. "The air force destroyed three boats which were attempting to seize the port," they said.
Ismail al-Shukri, spokesperson for the rival force, denied this, saying war planes belonging to the other side had bombed the port. "Our forces are progressing from all directions towards Es Sider port," they said.
An oil ministry official said the tank was still on fire. Smoke could be seen on pictures posted on social media websites and described as showing the port. No more information was immediately available.
The fighting had reduced Libya's crude output to 352,000 barrels a day, a spokesperson for state-owned National Oil Corp (NOC) said. Only the Brega, Sarir, Messla and offshore operations were still producing, they said. Es Sider and Ras Lanuf ports were processing an estimated 300,000 bpd.
Libya has had two governments and parliaments since a group called Libya Dawn seized the capital Tripoli in August by expelling a rival faction, installing its own prime minister and forcing the recognized cabinet to operate out of the east with the elected House of Representatives.
Western powers fear the North African country might break up as former rebels who helped oust Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 now use their guns to control the OPEC oil producer.

Image caption North Korean players may face "re-education" on their return home, exiles suggest
North Korean football fans - at least, those with both a TV set and a reliable electricity supply - were allowed to see their team's first World Cup game against Brazil.
But the broadcast gave new meaning to the term "action replay", making it onto the airwaves of the country's single, government-run channel more than 12 hours after the final whistle.
That, though, is far from unusual.
Image caption North Korean players were given a footballing lesson on the pitch
In fact, the latest match against Portugal is reported to be the first time a North Korean game played on foreign soil has been broadcast live back home.
It was a risky decision for two reasons.
Firstly, it was an open invitation for anyone who wanted to protest against North Korea's human rights record to have their messages beamed directly into Pyongyang living rooms.
And secondly, there was always the chance that the country's sporting heroes would get roundly and humiliatingly thrashed.
"I think because they played so well against Brazil in the last game, no-one in North Korea would have imagined that they'd lose so big this time," Kim Young-il tells me while watching the game in their Seoul apartment.
I'm sure the players will have to go though extreme re-education and self-criticism Kim Young-il, North Korean living in Seoul
Mr Kim, 32, is a North Korean defector, who fled to the South in 1996 and they have mixed emotions about the 7-0 drubbing.
"On the one hand I feel proud when the team does well," they say.
"But on the other, I don't want them to do too well. Unlike in other countries it wouldn't be the star players who reap the rewards of the success, but [North Korean leader] Kim Jong-il himself."
'Weak minds'
It's hard to know how much credence to give to the claims from the North Korean Football Association that the country's leader has been giving the team personal guidance and help with tactics.
Image caption North Koreans living in the South say the players might find going home hard
But true or not, North Korea wouldn't be alone, of course, in wanting to exploit sporting success for political ends.
So what about a defeat?
Mr Kim shakes their head when they think of the fate that might await their former countrymen.
"The result will be blamed on their weak minds," they tell me.
"I'm sure the players will have to go though extreme re-education and self-criticism."
In the end, North Korea can be pleased about one thing.
There were no protests, not a single anti-North Korean placard in sight.
It's interesting to ponder why this might be.
Imagine the scenes that would have greeted the Burmese team had it qualified for this competition, or remember the scenes that greeted the Olympic torch as it made its way around the world en route to Beijing.
I always support our brothers when they're playing other countries Baek Kwang-gu, South Korean supporting North Korea
North Korea is a country with a human rights record that would give both Burma and China a run for their money.
It allows no opposition, no free media and no religious freedom, and it keeps thousands of political opponents, and their families, in large forced labour camps.
Apart from Amnesty International, which used North Korea's opening game to highlight its concerns, there has been barely a peep about it.
Perhaps those who claim that sporting events of this kind can break down barriers and cultural divides have a point.
Elimination
At the very least, for the duration of 90 minutes, information-starved North Koreans got a rare reality check about the limits of their nation's powers on the international stage.
Image caption Many in South Korea support the North Korean side too
There is certainly no sign of any opposition to North Korea's participation here in the South.
At bars in central Seoul you can find groups of South Koreans cheering the North as loudly as their own team.
"Our enemy is the leader of North Korea, not the people," one fan, Baek Kwang-gu, tells me.
"I always support our brothers when they're playing other countries."
But the opportunity for praise and protest alike are coming to an end.
North Korea's defeat at the hands of Portugal now means certain elimination.
Perhaps it will also spell the end for its brief experiment in live football broadcasting and its people will slip back once more behind a sporting iron curtain.
SAND HILL, Fort Benning, Ga. — Many soldiers and family members are angry over reports of controversial remarks from the Commanding Officer of Fort Benning at a recruit graduation.
Speaking to an assembled crowd of new soldiers and their families at basic training graduation, Maj. Gen. Robert Brown was reported as “extremely hostile.”
Their speech began with the “standard fluff” about duty, country, and the privileges of serving when such a small percentage of the country chooses a career in the Armed Forces. The speech took a turn, however, when the General reached a point in their remarks, obviously reused from previous ceremonies.
“Look to your left and right towards your brothers in arms,” said Brown. “You're all now members of a proud warrior class, and heroes like your fathers before you who-”
The General stopped, took a deep breath and crumpled the sheet before flinging it to the ground.
“Fuck it! I can't read shit like this anymore. Listen up you little bald bastards.”
The newly minted soldiers — trying to stay awake throughout the ceremony — shifted uncomfortably in their seats at the sudden change in tone.
“Some of you fucks won't make it past AIT [Advanced Individual Training]. You'll wash out with the rest of the weakness that never should have been here in the first place. Most of you who do graduate will immediately go to combat units and deploy overseas. Many of you will threaten to kill yourselves to get out of real work, although you wont have the balls to actually do it!”
Brown's tone got softer as they attempted to clarify.
“Don't get me wrong here. Many of you will actually go fight and engage the enemy in close combat. For that I salute you. It takes a hard motherfucker to go kill people you've never met just because we say so.”
The General then resumes their “motivational speech” to what they referred to as “the rest of you shit-stains.”
“You'll most likely spend your deployment sitting on a FOB, manning guard towers, or waiting to go on patrols that get cancelled. I have a reality check for you all. Not everyone in this room is a hero. I don't give a shit what the beer commercials say. You drag your buddy out of a grape hut after you've stabbed two Taliban in the eyes with a broken MRE spoon then you're a motherfucking American Hero. You clear a trench with nothing but a sack of hand-grenades and your giant brass balls, then you're a motherfucking hero! But walking through the desert for three months without hearing a shot fired in anger and posting pictures in your combat gear doesn't make you a goddamned hero! I don't care what your family says. They're not heroes. Neither are your fucking wives. Hardest job in the Army, my ass! Damn it, I'm too old for this shit. Fuck you all.”
Gen. Brown then threw up their middle finger to the crowd and stormed off the stage, hustling into their waiting staff car.
The silence after their speech was soon broken by wild applause from the assembled Drill Sergeants and Officers responsible for training the young soldiers over the previous ten weeks.
Less enthusiasm was displayed by the families and the new graduates, who stormed the stage and attempted to destroy the auditorium to express their displeasure. The ensuing riot caused over a half-million dollar in damage, and Drill Sergeants were forced to kill 11 Privates in self-defense.
An Army spokesperson has said that General Brown will not be scheduled as the keynote speaker for next week's graduation ceremony.

House Speaker John Boehner has walked away from negotiations to raise the debt ceiling, President Obama said in a news conference Friday at 6 p.m. A visibly angry Obama told reporters that the course of negotiations have made them wonder of Republicans, "Can they say yes to anything?" The president said he's summoning leaders of both parties and from both chambers of Congress to the White House at 11 a.m. Saturday. "They're going to have to explain to me how it is we're going to avoid default," they said. "They can come up here with eight plans if they want and we'll work on them." But, Obama said, the limit must be raised enough to get the government funded through the next election, because hammering out a deal "won't get any easier further down the road." About 45 minutes after Obama finished speaking, Boehner responded, saying dealing with the White House was "like dealing with a bowl full of Jell-O."
Obama defended the need to raise government revenues to prevent increasing "the burden on seniors" and cuts to educations and other programs. Boehner has been adamant that they would not allow any tax increases. "There are a lot of Republicans who are puzzled as to why [the debt deal] couldn't get done," Obama said. "In fact there are a lot of Republican voters who are puizzled as to why it couldn't get done."
Obama said he'd be okay with the backup plan put forward by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, which essentially gives Congress a way to vote against raising the debt limit but allows the president to raise it anyway. "I'm willing to take that responsibility," Obama said.
NBC News' Chuck Todd tweets that for what it's worth, "fits and starts and 'deal is off' theatrics are usually par for the course in these deals. But, we shall see." For their part, Boehner, in a letter to House Republicans, said "A deal was never reached, and was never really close," Politico's Kenneth P. Vogel reports. Boehner writes , "the White House is simply not serious about ending the spending binge that is destroying jobs and endangering our children's future." They reiterated their support for the "cut, cap, and balance" plan that has no chance of passing the Senate. Obama admonished journalists not to write their stories as "the usual food fight for Democrats and Republicans... a lot of Democrats stepped up," implying that Republicans had not. Update: Obama gradually raised their voice during the 30-minute press conference. They said politicians should ignore columnists and talk radio hosts and pledges--a reference to controversy over whether anti-Tax advocate Grover Norquist gave Republicans a pass to let the Bush tax cuts expire despite signing their no-new-taxes pledge--and pay attention to regular people who feel like they "can't keep up." A deal must happen soon, they said, because "Wall Street will be opening on Monday and we'd better have some answers over the next couple days." Politico's Martin Kady says that "The new deadline isn't Aug. 2 -- it's 9:30 a.m. Monday when markets open. Short term extension deal prolly gotta happen by then." Update II: Boehner responded to Obama Friday night, saying they would be meeting at the White House Saturday, as Obama suggested, but notably said they looked forward to working with their fellow members of Congress to avoid a default. They said he'd be working with congressional colleagues to avoid default while adhering to "the two principles we've outlined"--spending cuts worth more dollars than the size of the debt increase, and no tax increases. Boehner said that while they and the president had agreed on an amount to raise revenue, "the White House moved the goal post" and then made "every effort to avoid the real cuts we need to amke to preserve the fiscal integrity of this country." Then Boehner got a bit philosophical, noting that he'd taken "the same oath as the President of the United States" and that "there's a reason why we have two political parties." In one itty bitty glimmer of hope--or maybe denial--Boehner described negotiations as causing "furstrations on both sides," but ultimately, they don't believe their relationship with Obama is "permanently damaged."

This is the shocking moment a pit bull launches an unprovoked attack on a woman in front of their grandchildren.
Video shows Brenda Rigdon of Florida sat in a garden chair nervously gearing up for the ALS charity ice bucket challenge.
But as soon as the soaking takes place, a large canine jumps up and bites them hard on the face.
WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT
The senior is heard squealing in pain as the animal drags them down to the ground.
They roll on their front with their face in the grass.
Mrs Rigdon's husband, Charles, who was busy filming the event, drops the camera to help.
As the view cuts to the sky, commotion can be heard in the background.
'Grandma are you OK?' one of Mrs Rigdon's grandchildren asks.
'No, go get me towel please.' they weakly responds.
The child says they can see blood on Mrs Rigdon's arms and all over the dog.

At the end of the video, still images show Mrs Rigdon with stitches running from their lip up their left cheek.
Although the incident took place last summer, Mrs Rigdon said they wanted the clip releasing online only when they were ready.
Them son posted it to YouTube on February 27 with many viewers offering their condolences.
Apparently the pit bull, named Kilo, was put down shortly after the attack once he'd been checked for rabies.
Mrs Rigdon's son said the pet wasn't properly trained and was kept principally for breeding purposes.
They concluded: 'This should serve as a warning to all pet owners. Unless you are going to take the time to make an animal a pet then it will remain an animal.'
All You Need to Know
Brewery: Avery Brewing Co.
Style: Wild Ale
ABV: 8.1%
My Cost: $16 (12oz)
Glassware: Tulip, Flute
Temp: 45°F
Availability: One Off
Purchased@: Friendly Greek
Quick Take: Fortuna isn't the best sour I've had, but it's pretty refreshing and rises above the gimmicky inspiration. It has a salivating saltiness that makes you want to go back as your thirst is never quite satisfied. Cost is a concern and I can't see me getting this over a kriek or standard sour, but great change of pace beer and absolutely worth it where cost is not a concern.
Brew Facts: Fortuna is No. 28 in Avery's “anything goes” barrel-aging program. Avery used a tequila barrel, provided by Suerte, along with salt, lime, and some souring bacteria (Pedio, Lacto) to mimic the lick, slam, suck of a tequila shot. That isn't enough (it never is) so they also tossed in Brett and Sacchro yeast to take this experiment over the top. As a side note, I quite dislike tequila, so this should be interesting.
Appearance: A bottle tip and the glass fills up with amber gold and fuzzy haze that's not quite chill. A frothy white head on initial pour dissipates to a glass clinging bubble ring (my glass got a check mark). Sudsy with a carbonation level that bubbles confidently, perhaps a bit more than some sours. No fruity hues or crazy bending of light. Ultimately, Fortuna isn't going to be remembered for its visual, nor should it be.
Aroma: Ho-hum looks give way to an adjunct filled bouquet of interest. Citrus acidity, fresh lime juice, and a salty sour aroma dominates, pushing the gym sock tequila smells to the background. Did I mention I'm not a fan of tequila? A sweet, fruity cherry creeps in for no reason that I can figure out given the ingredients (possibly a phantom smell from the bar), but it's there. Interesting and frankly tantalizing smell that draws me in.
Taste/Mouth Feel: A sip and I'm taken with the spot on carbonation and a mouth feel that isn't too light nor too heavy. Upfront is tongue tingling sour and salt, some bready malt in the mid and finishes dry with a lingering salt. The souring is lite and non-tart, as it should be for the intended purpose. The tequila barrel is a background element, blending in with the acidic qualities to barely surface at colder temps. As it warms, the mouth feel slicks up and the tequila leaks through in the form of a palate drying lemon and earthy agave and sweat. It isn't entirely a turn off, but I'd recommend drinking this on the colder side unless those broad tequila notes are your thing. It might get just a bit too salty for some as the bottom dregs lead to an unpleasant final sip that is best left in the bottle.
Final Thoughts: I'll say this upfront. What is essentially a tequila shot beer, sour or otherwise, sounds terrible. TERRIBLE. Just outright, horrendously awful to a level I would never want to be in the same room with let alone allow on my tongue. But even with all of that working against it in my mind, it is a testament to Avery that I not only chose to drink this, but I paid and paid well to do it. Certainly, Fortuna isn't the best sour I've had, but it's pretty refreshing and rises above the gimmicky inspiration. It has a salivating saltiness that makes you want to go back as your thirst is never quite satisfied. Cost is a concern and I can't see me getting this over a kriek or standard sour, but great change of pace beer and absolutely worth it where cost is not a concern.
Note: I should point out that since writing the initial Fortuna review, I bought another bottle to age. So, apparently I will buy it over some krieks and sours.
Recommendation: Not for sourheads, but adventurous will dig it.

NINE hours of isolation or 30 minutes trapped by the office bore? The attentions of the boss or the distractions of daytime TV? The choice between slogging to the office and working from home can be pretty unappealing. For increasing numbers of people, the answer is “co-working”.
The concept of co-working is elastic but at its broadest means working alongside, and often collaborating with, people you wouldn't normally. Users book a space in a co-working office, plonk themselves down where they can and start beavering away. (Opening the laptop in a Starbucks is not quite the same thing: enough stick-in-the-muds go to coffee shops to drink coffee that it is not a proper working environment.)
Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.
The idea first surfaced a few years back, but according to Steve King of Emergent Research, a California-based outfit, it reached an inflection-point about 18 months ago. The absolute numbers are still small: Mr King reckons there are now around 760 office-based co-working facilities in America, up from 405 in 2010.
Their rise is fuelled by several things, including technologies such as cloud computing; more women and freelancers in the workforce, which means greater demand for flexible work arrangements; and economic pressure on firms' property costs. Nor is the trend confined to office workers. An organisation called BioCurious recently opened a community biology lab in California's Bay Area. Budding chefs share kitchens; communal workshops known as “maker spaces” are springing up too.
Some co-working spaces are dedicated facilities, others are set up within business incubators or company offices. Campbell McKellar, who runs a website called Loosecubes where people can find spaces to work, says that 65% of the 2,800 workplaces available are inside small, private companies with desks to spare. Creative and media businesses with a culture of bringing lots of people together to work on specific projects are heavily represented among both users and space providers.
New co-working chains are emerging, with names like The Hub and NextSpace. More established firms have also cottoned on to the trend. Regus, a big provider of managed office space, has a product called Businessworld that offers cardholders flexible access to its facilities. Mark Dixon, Regus's boss, likens it to having airport business lounges in city centres, and says that products like this already account for 20% of the firm's revenue, up from almost nothing before the financial crisis.
Purists are sniffy about the likes of Regus. Generation Y-ers do not aspire to work in airport lounges: Loosecubes offers people a choice of working atmospheres that include the “hacker vibe” (black T-shirts and not much in the way of light, apparently). The benefits of collaboration are stressed. One strand of the co-working movement is the “jelly”, an informal event, often held at specific times of the week, where people gather to work together. Co-working evangelists also emphasise the role of each facility's “host”, a person who organises social events for users, introduces people to each other and spots opportunities for collaboration.
Still, there should be room for many different styles of co-working, particularly if it takes off among larger companies. Some big firms are trying to soup up innovation by getting people to co-work internally: the striking new Sydney offices of Macquarie, a bank, have no personal desks and emphasise collaborative working. Others have already started shedding their own properties: Yell, a directories business, is now using Regus memberships to give its salespeople in Britain access to office space when they want it. Drew Jones, co-author of a book on co-working, thinks that there is scope to turn empty retail space in the suburbs of big cities into large co-working facilities. Compared with city-centre offices, these would take less time for people to commute to and cost less for firms to buy or rent space in.
None of these signals the end of the conventional office. Corporate cultures move slowly, for one thing. Managers worry about how to deal with issues such as confidentiality. Some job functions will always benefit from being in one location. But co-working multiplies the options that people have when they ask themselves: “Where shall I work today?” For that reason alone, it will keep spreading.
CGI Federal, a Canadian owned company headed by former VA Secretary James Peake will use predictive technology as VA's newest collections company.
CGI Federal will use predictive technology to collect on overpayments for community care. Community care is basically Veterans Choice, and it will be run under a branch of CGI Group, a $20 billion tech company based in Canada. Not the United States but Canada.
Former VA Secretary James Peake heads CGI Federal and has since 2014.
Peake is a retired lieutenant general and West Point alumni who went on to head the Department of Veterans Affairs from 2007 to 2009.
Big Bucks VA Secretary In Government Contracting
Prior to their selection as VA Secretary, they were CEO of QTC Management, one of the leading government contractors providing compensation and pension disability examinations for the agency. Before Peake, QTC employed VA Secretary Anthony Principi. Principi served as VA Secretary under both Clinton and Bush.
After working at VA, Peake was immediately hired by CGI Group and subsequently led its CGI Federal government contracting branch. In 2014, Peake finally took over as head of CGI Federal.
This selection is an example of just how much money is involved at the highest levels of the agency both before and after serving as VA Secretary. Do not feel too bad for former Secretary Bob McDonald. They will get another high paying gig if they want one.
Irony Of Collections For Veterans Choice
The irony being the most community care providers through Veterans Choice have struggled for months to get payments for services rendered. Instead of hiring an advanced tech company to figure that mystery out, VA has instead hired a company to go after the few community providers who were paid.
What CGI Technology Does
The services will be provided under CGI ProperPay technology. That tech predicts, tracks and identifies improper payments. It then recovers those payments. That tech is sold by CGI Federal Inc, which is solely owned by CGI Group Inc., the fifth largest tech firm in the world.
“We are honored to perform this vital service on behalf of our nation's veterans,” said Michael Garbus, Vice-President, CGI. “CGI's healthcare compliance team offers proven experience for large federal and commercial clients with results-oriented technology that provides efficient and effective audit and recovery services. For the VA, the result will be recovered funds available for the ongoing care of those who have served and sacrificed for our country.”
According to the press release, which conveniently leaves out the price of the contract, explains CGI ProperPay as being:
“[A] solution that imports claims data, performs advanced analytics to identify improperly paid claims, tracks progress and performs required communication and reporting. CGI ProperPay is configurable to an organization's specific business rules and reimbursement methodologies. Its predictive analytics, workflow management, rules management and global best practices operate in a secure cloud environment, offering superior elasticity and power.”
Given how profitable running VA has been, both before and after selection, what exactly do you suspect David Shulkin MD has to gain from their selection?

Kim Jong-un has ordered massive "inspections" of elite families in the wake of Thae Yong Ho's defection. File Photo by KCTV
SEOUL, Aug. 31 (UPI) -- A group of North Korean dissidents said Wednesday that under Kim Jong-un, North Korea's elite class is losing their privileges, a revelation that provides some insight into the defection of Pyongyang diplomat Thae Yong Ho.
North Korea has heightened surveillance of pedigreed families, including descendants of anti-Japanese guerrilla fighters, in the wake of high-profile defections, says Seoul-based North Korea Intellectual Solidarity.
But Kim has long harbored resentment against this core class of elites, according to the group.
The descendants of North Korea's first generation of patriots have typically led more lavish lifestyles than the rest of the population, under the patronage of Kim Il Sung.
The current leader resents the privileges they enjoy, the dissidents say.
The acrimonious feelings Kim Jong-un holds toward elites might have led to the exclusion of O Kuk Ryol, the former vice chairperson of North Korea's National Defense Commission, from a meeting of Pyongyang's Politburo during the Seventh Party Congress, the group says.
Thae's recent defection is now serving as a catalyst for a massive "inspection" of second-generation members of the elite families.
Thae's father was an anti-Japanese guerrilla who fought alongside North Korea founder Kim Il Sung. Thae was in charge of public relations for Pyongyang's embassy in London when they defected with their family to South Korea.
Elite families are practically under house arrest.
O, the senior North Korean statesman, may be specifically targeted since Thae's defection because Thae's wife, O Hye Son, is a relative, the dissidents say.
North Korea has also been cracking down on its emerging class of wealthy merchants, South Korean news service Daily NK reported.
North Korean security agents, who have become accustomed to extorting money from the newly rich, often arrest uncooperative people on charges of espionage.
A North Korean source in Yanggang Province said more than 20 merchants in the border city of Hyesan have been arrested on trumped up charges.
Women merchants who refuse sexual advances of officials are also arrested, according to the source.
Last week, we reported that proposed Freedom of Information Act rule from the U.S. Department of Justice would allow agencies to tell requesters of certain law-enforcement or national security records that the information did not exist -- even if it did.
The measure riled open-government advocates and some members of Congress, who have pushed for greater federal transparency.
Thursday, DOJ said it had withdrawn the measure from its final regulations.
In a letter to Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, one of several members of Congress who had questioned the proposal, Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich said that the measure would not be included in the DOJ's final rule.
"The Justice Department decided that misleading the American people would be wrong, and made the right decision to pull the proposed regulation," Sen. Grassley said in a statement.
The Justice Department has not set a date for when it plans to release its final regulations.

What's a Block Grant?
Isn't State and Local Control More Effective?
Does It at Least Help People Prepare for Work?
Why Does All This Matter?
So Where Do We Go From Here?
What's TANF?
In 1996, Congress replaced the New Deal-era Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) with a new program called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), under the guise of “ending welfare as we know it.”
The new law built on decades of anti-welfare sentiment, which Ronald Reagan popularized in 1976 with the racially-loaded myth of the “welfare queen.” In the two decades that followed, progressives and conservatives alike put forward reform proposals aimed at boosting work and reducing welfare receipt. Progressive proposals included expanded childcare assistance, paid leave, and tax credits for working families. Conservatives, on the other hand, tended to favor punitive work requirements—without any of the corresponding investments to address barriers to employment.
In 1996, after vetoing two Republican proposals that drastically cut the program's funding, President Bill Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act into law. The new legislation converted AFDC into a flat-funded block grant—TANF—and sent it to the states to administer.
The law's stated purpose was to move families from “welfare to work.” By that measure, supporters initially heralded TANF as a success during the strong, full-employment economy of the late 1990s. But too often, the narrative stops there, ignoring significant failings in the program that surfaced after the economy slowed down.
What is a block grant?
Get TalkPoverty In Your Inbox Thanks for Signing Up!
A block grant is essentially a pot of money that the federal government gives to state governments to administer a program subject to federal guidelines.
One of the key limitations of block grants is that they can lose value over time. The TANF block grant, for example, has been flat-funded at $16.5 billion since the law was first implemented 20 years ago. In other words, despite the rising cost of living, TANF's funding hasn't increased at all. As a result, it has lost more than one-third of its value since 1996, leaving fewer low-income families able to access the help they need. Fewer than one in four families with children living below the federal poverty line are helped by TANF today—down from more than two-thirds in 1996.
Another major limitation is that block grants are unable to respond to economic downturns. During the Great Recession, the number of families helped by TANF barely budged—the number of unemployed workers spiked by nearly 90%, but families able to access TANF only ticked up by 16%. TANF's failure to respond to rising economic hardship not only hurts struggling families; it takes away a critical tool to lessen the impact of recessions.
Isn't state and local control more effective?
Not in TANF's case. There's very little accountability with regard to how states must spend this money, so many states treat the program like a slush fund by diverting the funds to a range of other purposes—including closing budget gaps.
As a result, just 1 out of every 4 TANF dollars goes to income assistance for poor families with kids—policymakers, the public, and the media lack even the most basic information on where the rest of the funds go. By comparison, over 95% of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as food stamps) dollars go to helping to struggle families purchase food.
Does it at least help people prepare for work?
Not well. Preparing people for work was one of the stated goals of the 1996 welfare law, but only 8% of TANF's funding goes to employment preparation services. What's worse, states aren't actually required to track whether TANF recipients get jobs—employment isn't even an outcome that gets measured (nor is poverty reduction, for that matter).
Conservatives claim the law gives states flexibility, but states face stiff constraints when it comes to helping participants prepare for and find work. For example, states aren't allowed to provide “job search and job readiness assistance” for more than four consecutive weeks and six weeks in the entire year—no matter how hard someone is looking for work. In addition, vocational training only counts towards required work activity for 12 months. It's no wonder that governors from both parties have requested greater flexibility in designing work programs for TANF.
Why does all this matter?
Great question. TANF's shortcomings don't just matter to the millions of poor families with kids who aren't getting the help they need through the program. A full 70% of Americans will need to turn to the safety net at some point—whether it's TANF, nutrition assistance, Supplemental Security Income, or Unemployment Insurance. Without these programs, our nation's poverty rate would be nearly twice as high as it is today.
But despite TANF's dismal record, many congressional Republicans want to model effective antipoverty tools, including nutrition assistance and housing aid, after TANF—by converting them to block grants.
In total, Speaker Ryan has called for ending 11 antipoverty programs—including housing assistance, food assistance, and child care—and combining them into a single block grant. Just like TANF, the funding would be fixed—making it woefully unresponsive to recessions or changes in the unemployment rate.
So where do we go from here?
To begin with, the federal government should require states to spend a certain share of TANF funds on the law's core purposes—income assistance, child care, and work programs. Requiring states to spend even half of TANF funds on these priorities would ensure that more families get the help they need. We should also hold states accountable for meaningful outcomes such as actually helping TANF recipients get jobs, and reducing poverty.
In addition, Congress should stop rewarding states for ending aid to families in need. Right now, states receive a so-called “caseload reduction credit” for reducing the number of people they help—regardless of whether they have jobs when they leave the program. In effect, instead of giving states incentives to provide needed assistance, we're doing the opposite.
We also need to increase benefits so that families can meet their basic needs. In no state are benefits equal to even half the austere federal poverty level (the maximum benefit was about $10,000 per year for a family of three in 2015).
Strengthening TANF is critical to ensure that our nation's safety net provides adequate protection against life's unpredictability. But it is just one part of a broader antipoverty agenda.
Building an economy that works for everyone—not just the wealthy few—will require creating good jobs and ensuring a living wage; adopting work-family policies that ensure parents are not forced to choose between work and caregiving; putting childcare and high-quality education within reach for all families; and removing barriers to opportunity so that all families have the opportunity to succeed.
WASHINGTON — A key House Republican Thursday openly mocked Sen. Max Baucus' election-cycle conversion to the anti-Obamacare crusade, reminding the Montana Democrat that they played a central role in it's passage.
"Your attempts to pass the buck to President Obama's team will not work, nor will they absolve you of responsibility for the harm that you have brought via this law," said Rep. Mike Pompeo, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Obamacare.
A Baucus aide dismissed complaints, arguing the Montanan remains supportive of the law and is simply concerned with it's proper implementation. "There's no change of heart. There should be no confusion about this. As Sen. Baucus said yesterday, they think this is a good law and he's simply holding the administration's feet to the fire to make sure they do their job implementing it correctly and informing people about the benefits that are available to them," the aide said.
Finance Chairman Baucus, who is up for reelection next year, played a critical role not only in writing President Obama's signature health care reform but also in rounding up enough votes to break a Republican filibuster.
Still, like many Democrats, Baucus has expressed concerns with the implementation of the law, and during a hearing on Obamacare Wednesday, Baucus said they were very concerned with the "train wreck" Obamacare was becoming.
In a harshly worded letter to Baucus, Pompeo lashed out at Baucus. "No one in the country bears more responsibility for the complexity of this law than you. When your supermajority couldn't pass the bill using normal procedures, you and your Senate colleagues rammed through the final legislation by using parliamentary gimmickry," Pompeo wrote, adding that, "You drafted it, you twisted arms to get it passed, and, until now, you have lauded it as a model for all the world."
Baucus's decision to criticize a law they were instrumental in writing and passing is part of an election year pattern for the moderate Montana Democrat. Earlier this year they were one of a handful of red state Senate Democrats to vote against their party's budget, and they broke with Democrats Wednesday evening in voting against a watered down gun background check measure, which helped kill the legislation.
Although Republicans are taking great delight in ripping Baucus over their Obamacare statements, walking the fine line between being a loyal soldier for the first four years of their term and turning conservative in the last two has been a key part of a re-election strategy that has kept Baucus in the Senate since 1978.
Joe DiMaggio missed three prime years of playing time, 1943 through 1945, because they enlisted in the United States Army on February 17, 1943, to serve their country during World War II. Here are a few additional numbers of interest as they relate to The Yankee Clipper, a ballplayer that Ted Williams described as, "the greatest all-around player I ever saw":
2 - Joe DiMaggio won two batting championships, hitting .381 in 1939 (Top 25) and .352 in 1940 (Top 25). Joe was the third New York Yankees player to win a batting title, behind Babe Ruth (.378 in 1924) and Lou Gehrig (.363 in 1934), and the first two win it more than once.
3 - Joe DiMaggio won three Most Valuable Player Awards. They were the first New York Yankees player to win it more than once after they captured their second MVP in 1941, and when they won again in 1947, they were the first Yankee to win it three times.
5 - Joe DiMaggio wore #5 for the Bronx Bombers during twelve of their thirteen seasons, a number the Yanks retired in 1952. Why didn't they wear #5 in 1936? Because Frankie Crosetti was wearing it, had used it regularly since 1932, and DiMaggio had to use #9 their rookie season instead.
11 - Joe DiMaggio was ranked eleventh by The Sporting News when they released their list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players in the history of baseball.
13 - Joe DiMaggio appeared in thirteen All-Star Games (1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942 & 1946, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951), one for every single season they appeared in the major leagues.
44.3 - Joe DiMaggio was on the Hall of Fame ballot in 1953, received 44.3% of the votes, and finished eighth overall in their first year of eligibility after retiring. Two players were elected that year, Dizzy Dean (79.2%) and Al Simmons (75.4%). Those ahead of DiMaggio who weren't elected that season were Bill Terry (72.3%), Bill Dickey (67.8%), Rabbit Maranville (62.1%), Dazzy Vance (56.8%) and Ted Lyons (52.7%).
48 - Joe DiMaggio made their debut on May 3, 1936, and went three-for-six at the plate. By the end of the month (Game by Game Batting Logs), Joe had 48 hits (the most by a rookie during their first month), was batting .381, and only went hitless in two games.
56 - Joe DiMaggio hit safely in 56 consecutive games (The Streak). Commissioner Ford Frick (in 1973) called it one of the Marks That Will Never Be Broken, ranking it eighth overall.
69.4 - Joe DiMaggio was on the Hall of Fame ballot in 1954, received 69.4% of the votes, and finished fourth in their second year of eligibility after retiring. Three players were elected that year, Rabbit Maranville (82.9%), Bill Dickey (80.2%) and Bill Terry (77.4%).
88.8 - Joe DiMaggio was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1955, received 88.8% of the votes, finishing first on the ballot in their third year of eligibility after retiring. They were inducted that year alongside Ted Lyons (86.5%), Dazzy Vance (81.7%) and Gabby Hartnett (77.7%).
274 - Joe DiMaggio was married to Marilyn Monroe on January 14, 1954, and 274 days after they eloped, Monroe filed for a divorce. Fast forward forty-five years, and according to ABC News report (Link), when Joltin' Joe passed away their final words were, "I'll finally get to see Marilyn."
361 - Joe DiMaggio finished their career with 361 home runs, which at the time, ranked them fifth overall on the Top 1,000 list in Major League history. The sluggers who were ahead of them were 1. Babe Ruth (714), 2. Jimmie Foxx (534), 3. Mel Ott (511) and 4. Lou Gehrig (493).
369 - Joe DiMaggio struck out only 369 times across their entire career, which included 6,821 times at bat. Only 5.4% of their at-bats resulted in a strikeout (Top 1,000), one strikeout every 18.5 times at bat.
100,000 - Joe DiMaggio signed a landmark contract on February 7, 1949, a $100,000 deal to play baseball - the first baseball player in history to reach the plateau.
I had the opportunity the other day to dine with a collection of Blue State liberals. It was enlightening, not because I actually learned anything from them, but because I learned about them. It was also a reminder of how far I've traveled ideologically, because I used to be one of them. Looking at them, I don't regret my journey.
Most of the evening, of course, was idle chitchat, without any political ramifications. Inevitably, though, politics and ideological issues cropped up. I'll just run down a few topics.
Antisemitism in higher education:
I was told in no uncertain terms that Columbia University cannot be antisemitic because it's in New York. My offer to produce evidence to support my thesis was rebuffed. For those of you who, unlike Blue State liberals, feel that facts are valuable, these links support my contention that, New York address notwithstanding, Columbia is in thrall to Palestinian activists and BDS derangement:
100 Columbia professors demand divestment from Israel
Professors preach antisemitism from the Columbia pulpit
Columbia professor Joseph Massad, a one-man antisemitism machine
Columbia students delighted at the opportunity to dine with Ahmadinejad
And of course, there's simply the fact that Columbia is one of the more ideologically Left schools, although that wouldn't have bothered my dinner companions.
The effect of taxes on investment:
One of my dinner companions is a successful investment analyst. I asked them if he'd been hearing about any effects flowing from the Obamacare medical device tax. “No, of course not. It's — what? — a two percent tax. That's not going to make a difference to anybody.” Again, my offer of contrary data was rejected, because it was obviously Fox News propaganda, never mind that it's not from Fox News. Stephen Hay, at Power Line, neatly summarizes a Wall Street Journal article predicated on actual investment data:
Today in my Constitutional Law class I'll be taking up the famous case of McCulloch v. Maryland, the bank case from 1819 in which Chief Justice John Marshall observed that “the power to tax involves the power to destroy,” which immediately set my mind to thinking about . . . Obamacare. Obamacare's medical device tax—a tax not on profits remember, but on revenues—is doing its destructive work already. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that “Funding Dries Up for Medical Startups,” noting that “Investment in the medical-device and equipment industry is on pace to fall to $2.14 billion this year, down more than 40% from 2007 and the sharpest drop among the top five industry recipients of venture funding.” It seems we have to relearn every few years (such as the luxury boat tax of 1990, swiftly repealed when it killed the boat-building industry) the basic lesson that Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan taught us: tax something and you get less of it. Especially when you tax it like Obamacare, where the tax significantly reduces the after-tax return to investors.
When a 2% tax is on after-tax returns, and it targets a specific industry, surprisingly it does make a big difference to people. Right now, the difference is at the investment level, but soon it will be at the consumer level, as consumers are less likely than ever before to see life-changing inventions such as the insulin pump or the cochlear implant.
American healthcare compared to other Western countries: Everybody agreed that America has the worst health care compared to those countries with socialized medicine. Britain doesn't count, my fellow dinners told me, because it's “chosen” to offer bad health care. My attempts to talk about freedom of choice, market competition, declining government revenue, cost-based decisions to deny treatment to whole classes of patients, etc., were rudely brushed aside. “That's just Fox News propaganda.” Likewise, the liberals also dismissed as “Fox News propaganda” my statement that the studies they're relying on have as their metric availability of coverage, rather than quality of outcome. I therefore wasn't surprised when they equally rudely dismissed me when I said that a recent study showed that America has some of the best cancer survival rates in the world.
Since I know that you'd never be that rude, let me just quote Avik Roy, who actually studies the numbers:
It's one of the most oft-repeated justifications for socialized medicine: Americans spend more money than other developed countries on health care, but don't live as long. If we would just hop on the European health-care bandwagon, we'd live longer and healthier lives. The only problem is it's not true. [snip] The problem, of course, is that there are many factors that affect life expectancy. One is wealth. It's gross domestic product per capita, and not health-care policy, that correlates most strongly to life expectancy. Gapminder has produced many colorful charts that show the strong correlation between wealth and health. [snip] If you really want to measure health outcomes, the best way to do it is at the point of medical intervention. If you have a heart attack, how long do you live in the U.S. vs. another country? If you're diagnosed with breast cancer? In 2008, a group of investigators conducted a worldwide study of cancer survival rates, called CONCORD. They looked at 5-year survival rates for breast cancer, colon and rectal cancer, and prostate cancer. I compiled their data for the U.S., Canada, Australia, Japan, and western Europe. Guess who came out number one? [chart omitted] U-S-A! U-S-A! What's just as interesting is that Japan, the country that tops the overall life expectancy tables, finished in the middle of the pack on cancer survival.
I'm not doing justice Roy's article with these snippets, so I urge you to read the whole thing. Suffice to say that my companions were uninterested in data that ran counter to their narrative.
The racist inside every liberal: My dinner companions did concede that culture is a factor in health care, although they stopped short of admitting (as they should have) that a country as diverse as America will never be able to counter cultural differences with socialized medicine. (Or, rather, they couldn't admit that it would take overwhelming government coercion to do so.)
One of the guests described a patient with a treatable disorder — i.e., one that could be controlled with a carefully regimented plan of medicine and treatment — who was too disorganized to follow the treatment. As a result, this person ended up in the emergency room one to two times a month, at great cost to the system. The healthcare provider finally hired a minimum wageworker to remind the patient to take the medicines and to drive the patient to the hospital. Another guests said, “Black, right?” The person who told the story said, “I can't tell you that, but probably.” They snickered companionably over the fact that blacks are just too dumb to care for themselves.
Another way of looking at it, though, was that this patient did fine: The patient didn't have to fuss with drugs (and their side-effects), got emergency treatment on an as-needed basis, and ended up having a dedicated employee to detail with the finicky little details of disease maintenance. Who's snickering now?
The power that maintains slavery: One of the people at the dinner was a student studying American history. The curriculum had reached the Civil War. The student asked a good question: “I don't get how the slaves let themselves stay that way. After all, they outnumbered the whites.” Good point. The liberal dinner guests started mumbling about systems, and complexity, and psychology. And I do mean mumbling. They didn't offer data. They just mouthed buzzwords such as “it's complex,” or “you have to understand the system,” or “well, there's a psychology there.” I interrupted: “The slave owners were armed. The slaves were denied arms. The side with weapons, even if it's smaller in number, wins.” To my surprise, none of the liberals in the room had anything to add.
The food was good and my dinner companions were periodically interesting and charming, so the dinner wasn't a total loss. Nevertheless, I found dismaying the arrogant ignorance that powers their engines. All I could think of was my own blog's motto: “Conservatives deal with facts and reach conclusions; liberals have conclusions and sell them as facts.” That was my dinner in a nutshell.

LOS ANGELES -- Jamal Crawford didn't make it to the All-Star game. If they had, the Clippers' sixth man had something planned similar to the move they pulled off in setting up Blake Griffin for one of the season's most buzz-worthy dunks.
Crawford and Griffin combined for their memorable moment in the fourth quarter of a 117-101 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night, the Clippers' 10th victory in 13 games.
Griffin's windmill dunk off Crawford's alley-oop pass came after the guard went streaking to the basket on a fast break, threw the ball up, caught it, passed it between their legs, and then threw it over their shoulder to Griffin.
"I got the best jumper in the world, so might as well get creative," said Crawford, who led the Clippers with 25 points despite tweaking their left ankle early in the game. "Blake just took it to a whole other level. We can push that for an ESPY (award)."
As the trailer, Griffin wasn't sure what Crawford had in mind, but figured they would throw it off the glass for Griffin to finish.
A protest march in response to police action during a Price weekend queer street “dance party” took to the streets Friday evening.
Hudson Williams-Eynon was released from jail Monday when a King County Court judge found no probable cause to continue holding them as possible assault charges are weighed. Protestors announced plans to get back on the streets Friday night to protest the police actions on Pride weekend.
The CHS Funtern Kelton Sears is on the scene. Their updates below:
UPDATE:
10:20 p.m—The rally has largely quieted and dispersed.
What began as a quiet vigil at Cal Anderson in memory of the recently slain lesbian couple in Texas turned into a pink and black dance party. The rally marched up and down the length of Broadway from Pike to Thomas, backing traffic up both ways. The group stopped briefly for a more elaborate dance party at 11th and Pine where police had set up a barricade.
Each time the group stopped and blocked an intersection, a man dressed as a clown wearing a police constable hat directed traffic with a whistle as SPD looked on.
A large envoy of bike mounted SPD officers followed at a distance during the march. As night fell, the envoy eventually grew to an eight-car caravan, including two large SPD vans. The march remained peaceful, with no physical conflict between protestors and police. Protestors made clear their displeasure with SPD, shouting, “How do you spell Homophobia? SPD!” and repeatedly calling for the dropping of charges against the six people arrested in the dance party conflict last weekend at Pride.
The group grew as the night wore on, ending with a dramatic exchange between protestors and “Midnight Jack” of the Rain City Superhero group, who stood next to police lining Blick. Midnight Jack of Mayday pepper spray infamy stood holding a shield bearing the visage of Phoenix Jones alongside two other masked figures, stoically receiving a barrage of verbal taunts from protestors. “You're worse than the police,” the crowd shouted, citing the squad's track record of pepper spray use.
The protested ended shortly after 10, with protestors returning from their circuit back to Seattle Central Community College. From what CHS could make out, the protest ended peacefully without any outstanding arrests directly linked to the march.

Maybe it's the years I spent listening to Whitney Houston growing up, or some latent mother issues that I've yet to sort out, but I love female indie singers. And while there's no shortage of them, or top ten lists, I thought I'd share some of my favorites. So from Brooklyn to Scandinavia, here's a list of some of the great bands that sport noteworthy lead singers.
Monica Martin of Phox
This 6-piece indie folk band out of Baraboo, Wisconsin had a big year in 2013, playing Lollapalooza and SXSW among other big festivals. They recently released their debut self-titled album on June 24, 2014, which you can read reviews of over at CoS. They're on tour now, and I'll have the pleasure of seeing them on July 22nd at Glasslands in good ole Brooklyn.
Try to see them if you can, because Monica Martin rocks. She's got a velvety smooth voice that's really inspiring. It's the kind of voice that can turn your Monday commute around. This album also features some of the best clarinet I've heard on an indie album (bet you didn't see that coming).
Juliana Ronderos of Salt Cathedral
Indie-electronica. Colombian-tribal. Brooklyn-based. That's a perfect storm. We like them so much that we included them in an earlier required listening post. Juliana Ronderos' distinct voice and stage presence make this band a definite winner. Take a listen below to find out for yourself, and for another perspective check out what the guys at Bushwick Daily had to say.
Asli Omar of The Tontons
H-town represent! If Bun B calls them the "greatest band in Houston" then you know they keep it real. And real they keep it. Asli Omar is a born performer. They slide around stage leaning against their counterparts with friendly intimacy, running their hands through their bodacious fro and wrapping themselves in the mic chord as they belt harmonies over the crash of drums, bass and tastefully used guitar effects. We recently had them in for one of our in-studio sessions, and you definitely shouldn't miss them if they come through your city.
Monica Birkenes aka Mr. Little Jeans
This Norwegian-born indie-pop princess stole my heart when they decided to take their stage name from a character in the Wes Anderson film Rushmore. This whimsical, charismatic songstress has enjoyed some commercial success recently, most notably being used in Hewlett Packard and Ace Hotel ads. The song you might know is the fuzzy guitar-soaked, stuck-in-your-head-all-day "Angel" which you can check out below (threw in a remix just for fun).
Phaedra and Elsa Green of The Casket Girls
I'll defer to Last.fm:
"I dropped off a shit ton of songs to the girls to work on one night," Graveface says of the genesis of Tru Love, the follow up to the Casket Girls' critically acclaimed 2012 debut. "I went back to check on their progress, because they weren't answering their phones. I don't know if they dropped acid or what, but I walked in and Elsa was sobbing and reciting poetry while Phaedra was just staring straight ahead writing it all down, like catatonic. The next day they dropped off a CD and said, 'We don't even know what's on this. You can throw it in the garbage if you want.' I sat down and listened all the way through and cried. I was like 'Holy shit! They actually wrote a record like that!'"
Clearly, these ladies have powerful, moving voices to go along with their obvious songwriting chops.
Yukimi Nagano of Little Dragon
Scandinavian women have got it going on! Most of you probably know about Little Dragon by now, but it was news to me that they formed way back in 1996. This indie electronica group has gotten around too (and they're getting around a bit this summer, check out the tour dates).
First, they collaborated with Damon Albarn on the Gorillaz album Plastic Beach. Then in 2011, they hit it big with an awesome collaboration with British producer SBTRKT, putting out the trunk-thumpin' song "Wildfire".
Yukimi Nagano has a driving, soulful voice that you can really get a feel for below on the track "Klapp Klapp" from their 2014 release Nabuma Rubberband.
Joahanaa and Klara Soderberg of First Aid Kit
Having signed to Columbia Records recently, Johanna and Klara Soderberg may not be pure indie anymore, but I thought they deserved to be on this list. You wouldn't guess it from listening to them, but these Fleet Fox-esque girls hail form, well, Scandinavia (Sweden). Part of me thinks I should have titled this post differently.
They hit it big covering Fleet Foxes' "Tiger Mountain Peasant Song" on YouTube, and they've been snowballing ever since.
Now they enjoy the company of Conor Oberst and Jack White--all while opting out of high school to hit the road! Expect big things from them and check out their song "Emmylou", which Rolling Stones included in its Top 10 Singles of 2012. Find out more here.
Angelica Bess of Body Language
Put on your dancing shoes and double-knot them, because this band brings the funk! If you live in NYC, you might already know about them because they sell out local shows pretty often. If not, then definitely check them out if you like indie-disco slash synth-pop slash I dare you not to dance while listening to them slash even if you don't dance just bop with it.
While Angelica Bess shares the mic on a lot of songs, they bring an electric, exciting vibe when they have it all to herself. Check out their site or listen to more stuff at Bandcamp.
Angel Olsen
Angel Olsen's voice is dark and brooding at times but always enchanting. They hail from St. Louis, Missouri but has spent the last few years perfecting their lyricism in Chicago. Them the latest album, Burn Your Fire for No Witness, received an 8.3 on Pitchfork, and when I saw them perform recently in Brooklyn I thought it was worth that and more. Them songs make you feel like you're sitting around a fire hearing ancient tales of lost love and grief. Keep and eye out for them and take a listen below.
Molly Hamilton of Widowspeak
To close out this list is Molly Hamilton, another haunting, melodic singer that leads the NYC-based group Widowspeak. This is indie pop that's dialed back a bit. It's good for road trips and laying around your room (but who am I to tell you what to do with your music).
Their style probably derives from their personality. They actually went into seclusion in the Hudson River Valley to record their most popular album, Almanac. You can really hear the effect that the injection of wilderness, and lack of bars, had on this magical album. Have a listen, though, and decide for yourself.

It seems rare these days that a child is able to buck the pressure to embrace transgenderism. Thankfully, one young Australian boy was able to do so.
“An Australian boy who pleaded with their mother to allow them to make the transition into a girl has now had a change of heart two years later. “In 2015, Patrick Mitchell, then 12, began taking oestrogen hormones in a bid to become a female after a doctor diagnosed them with gender dysphoria. “People with the condition suffer distress as a result of a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity. “‘You wish you could just change everything about you, you just see any girl and you say I'd kill to be like that', Patrick told 60 Minutes' Ross Coulthart. “… “But after growing out their hair and the hormones taking control of their body by producing breasts, the unthinkable happened. “‘He looked me in the eye and said “I'm just not sure that I am a girl”‘, their mother revealed. “After teachers began to call Patrick a girl, they questioned whether they had made the right decision. “‘I began to realise I was actually comfortable in my body. Every day I just felt better,' they told Now To Love.”
The truth of the matter is that for most young people, this really is just a phase. This is especially so when curiosity and exploration of a small child—years before puberty hits—fancies theirs or themselves to be something they're not.
Alas, those who preach that “trans kids” are “born that way” and any suggestion that they don't fully embrace their “cis-ness” is proof that they are “trans” to the point of making it illegal to suggest to them otherwise!
Far too often, a combination of parents, schools, interest groups, and legally mandated psychological affirmation of a child's “trans-ness” feed into this delusion, often with deadly results.
The irony of the “born this way” crowd is that they don't believe that a person who is “born that way” ought not be changed, but that rather than deal with the psychological, they mutilate the body and pump life-altering hormones and puberty blockers into confused kids who don't understand what it is they are getting into. Case in point: “Jazz” Jennings, they celebrity “trans-girl” who, because of puberty blockers, is stuck with a pre-pubescent penis—thus will never be a sexually functional male—yet can not have it made into a faux vagina—thus not even being a passable imitation of a woman—amongst other complications.
But the people pushing this does not care.

Tennessee State Sen. Janice Bowling, R-Tullahoma
READ MORE Marion County leaders push fiber-optic expansion
POLL: Should EPB expand its broadband outside its service area? Yes
No Submit Results Yes: 100.00 % (20) No: 0.00 % (0) Total Responses: 20
The Center for Public Integrity
FIRST OF TWO PARTS
Editor's note: This story was published by The Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C.
Janice Bowling, a 67-year-old grandmother and Republican state senator from rural Tennessee, thought it only made sense that the city of Tullahoma be able to offer its local high-speed Internet service to areas beyond the city limits.
After all, many of their rural constituents had slow service or did not have access to commercial providers, like AT&T Inc. and Charter Communications Inc.
But a 1999 Tennessee law prohibits cities that operate their own Internet networks from providing access outside the boundaries where they provide electrical service. Bowling wanted to change that and introduced a bill in February to allow them to expand.
They viewed the network, which offers speeds about 80 times faster than AT&T and 10 times faster than Charter in Tullahoma according to advertised services, as a utility, like electricity, that all Tennesseans need.
"We don't quarrel with the fact that AT&T has shareholders that it has to answer to," Bowling said with a drawl while sitting in their log-cabin-style home. "That's fine, and I believe in capitalism and the free market. But when they won't come in, then Tennesseans have an obligation to do it themselves."
At a meeting three weeks after Bowling introduced Senate Bill 2562, the state's three largest telecommunications companies - AT&T, Charter and Comcast Corp. - tried to convince Republican leaders to relegate the measure to so-called "summer study," a black hole that effectively kills a bill. Bowling initially beat back the effort and thought they would get a vote.
That's when Joelle Phillips, president of AT&T's Tennessee operations, leaned toward them across the table in a conference room next to the House caucus leader's office and said tersely, "Well, I'd hate for this to end up in litigation," Bowling recalls.
The threat surprised Bowling, and apparently AT&T's ominous warning reached their colleagues as well. Days later, support in the Tennessee House for Bowling's bill dissolved. AT&T had won.
"I had no idea the force that would come against this, because it's just so reasonable and so necessary," Bowling said.
AT&T and Phillips didn't respond to emails asking for comment.
A national fight
Tullahoma is just one battlefront in a nationwide war that telecommunications giants are fighting against the spread of municipal broadband networks. For more than a decade, AT&T, Comcast, Time Warner Cable Inc. and CenturyLink Inc. have spent millions to lobby state legislatures, influence state elections and buy research to try and stop the spread of public Internet services that often offer faster speeds at cheaper rates.
The companies have succeeded in getting laws passed in 20 states that ban or restrict municipalities from offering Internet to residents.
Now the fight has gone national. The Federal Communications Commission in Washington, D.C., is considering requests from Chattanooga and from Wilson, N.C., to pre-empt state laws that block municipalities from building or expanding broadband networks, hindering economic growth, the cities argue.
If the FCC rules in favor of the cities, and the ruling survives legal challenges, municipalities nationwide will be free to offer high-speed Internet to residents when they aren't satisfied with the service provided by private telecommunications companies.
To better understand the municipal broadband debate, the Center for Public Integrity traveled to two southern cities - Tullahoma, which has a broadband network, and Fayetteville, N.C., which doesn't.
City-provided broadband widespread
More than 130 cities from Norwood, Mass., to Clallam County, Wash., offer fiber or cable Internet connections to their communities, according to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a group that supports municipal broadband. They are mostly small to mid-sized cities that critics say large Internet providers avoid because the return on investment is too low.
Cities build broadband networks to support businesses, improve health care and education and attract jobs, they say. About 89 cities offer gigabit speeds, a rate that can download a 4.5 gigabyte movie in 36 seconds. The same file takes an hour at 10 megabits per second. Slower DSL or dial-up connections, common in rural areas, would take hours longer.
Instead of investing in improving infrastructure in these communities, telecommunications companies have spent millions of dollars lobbying lawmakers in 20 states to pass laws restricting or banning municipal networks, according to research by Jim Baller, of the Baller Herbst Law Group, which is representing Chattanooga and Wilson.
When Tullahoma began planning its fiber-optic network in 2004, "it got unpleasant real fast," former Mayor Steve Cope said. "When you get into broadband you begin stepping on the toes of some of the big boys, the AT&Ts and Charters of the world. They don't want the competition, and they'll do anything to keep it out."
Most of the telecommunications companies say they support municipal broadband, but only for areas they don't serve.
"The idea of private capital competing with taxpayer-provided capital just feels inconsistent to us with what a free-market system looks like," AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson said at a U.S. Senate hearing in June. "But where it's unserved, it seems like a logical place for government to step in and provide a solution."
By far, AT&T is the company with the most political influence in states, say statehouse watchers.
"On a scale of 1 to 10 on who is the most powerful lobbying presence in Tennessee, AT&T is a 12," said a longtime lobbyist in Nashville who asked not to be identified so they could speak candidly. "They are the big horse in the race, and they are unstoppable."
AT&T spent between $250,000 and $300,000 this year hiring 15 lobbyists, ranking it among the largest spenders, according to the Tennessee Ethics Commission.
AT&T's political action committee is also the biggest donor among telecommunications companies to state campaigns nationwide. Since 2000, its donations more than tripled to $13.6 million in the 2012 election cycle, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics, which tracks campaign contributions in the states.
AT&T didn't respond to requests for comment.
Comcast, the second-largest campaign contributor among telecommunications companies in Tennessee, has upped its PAC giving from about $3,200 in the 2004 election cycle to a record of more than $270,450 in the 2012 cycle, according to the money in state politics institute.
Going to court
Telecommunications companies aren't hesitant to spend millions of dollars on lawsuits to kill municipal broadband.
Lafayette, La., population 123,000, considered building a network in 2004 when city leaders couldn't convince BellSouth or Cox Communications Inc. to install a fiber network for residents. For the next three years, Lafayette spent $4 million responding to three lawsuits and subsequent appeals from BellSouth, which AT&T bought in 2006, and Cox. The city eventually borrowed $125 million to build the network.
Terry Huval, director of utilities for the city, told a U.S. Senate committee in 2010 that the companies' actions were "grossly excessive."
The companies have also used traditional campaign tactics such as newspaper ads, push polls, direct mail and door-to-door canvassing to block municipal networks. And they've tried to undermine the appetite for municipal broadband by paying for research from research institutions and front groups to portray the networks as unreliable and costly.
In a June 19 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, Thomas Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste, and Royce Van Tassell, vice president of the Utah Taxpayers Association, wrote that an effort by Utah cities to build a municipal broadband network "has caused a spectacular financial failure."
The authors cited a study by Joseph Fuhr Jr., an economics professor at Widener University in Chester, Pa., who gave examples of municipal broadband networks that were failing.
Schatz and Tassell did not mention that the study was paid for by the Coalition for the New Economy, which says it consists of "businesses, associations, and individuals who are concerned about wasteful duplication of existing or planned Internet service."
Thad Nation, a former staffer to two Democratic governors who are listed as executive director on the group's IRS form 990 for 2012, didn't return calls or emails asking for comment.
Impact on business
The success of these tactics worries Ted Hackney, executive director of the Industrial Board of Coffee County, who's in charge of attracting businesses to the Coffee County Joint Industrial Park, a 400-acre development outside Tullahoma.
The site is home to just four businesses, including a tool and die shop and a food processor.
Hackney is trying to attract technology companies including a large data center, but the Internet service from Charter won't support such data-hungry businesses. The only network that can provide robust capacity at an affordable price is LightTUBe, the municipal Internet run by the Tullahoma Utility Board (TUB).
If the park can't get the service, "it certainly would be disappointing," Hackney said. "It wouldn't completely wipe us out, but we need it if we are really going to make a go of this."
Hackney is partial to LightTUBe because it's a local business and it's financially stable. In its first year, LightTUBe reported a positive cash flow, but showed losses due to the depreciation of assets.
Today, it has 3,250 customers, about 35 percent of the market, with Charter claiming about the same, estimates Brian Skelton, TUB's general manager. The utility has paid off more than $3 million of the $16.9 million in bonds it issued to build the network, and it projects it will report its first profit this year - $200,000 - one year behind schedule.
Its success rebuts one of the arguments telecommunications companies have made against municipal broadband systems - that small cities don't have the technical expertise to operate complex networks or the financial experience to manage the funding. Tullahoma, population 18,700, is one of the smallest cities in the nation with a gigabit network.
To be sure, several cities have had financial difficulties. They include Ashland, Ore.; Burlington, Vt.; and the 11-city Utah Telecommunications Open Infrastructure Agency. Some, such as Provo, Utah, and Groton, Conn., have sold their networks.
But proponents of municipal broadband say the successes outnumber the failures.
LightTUBe's Internet packages are lower priced than Charter's or AT&T's when speed is accounted for.
"We're cheaper than anyone, but we can't compete with the teaser offers," Skelton said.
Service serves realtor, records, businesses
LightTUBe's customers include big manufacturers, insurance agents, car dealerships and doctors' offices, as well as "mom-and-pop shops," Skelton said
Lisa Hayes, owner of 1st Choice Realtor, which employs 15 people, said LightTUBe's reliability has helped them triple their sales this year since they moved to a Web-based listings service. They switched from Charter because their Internet connection would frequently crash and response times were slow.
"We just can't afford to be down at all, and we can't wait for two weeks to get something fixed, or we'll lose customers," Hayes said.
Agisent Technologies Inc., which provides online records management for police departments and city jails, moved to Tullahoma in 2011 because it needed a fast, reliable broadband network that had a backup if the connection failed, said David Lufty, the company's president.
Charter and AT&T couldn't offer redundancy, but LightTUBe could.
"Since we've been here, we haven't had more than five minutes of downtime in almost three years," Lufty said.
Charter didn't respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment.
1st Choice and Agisent are examples of what fast and reliable broadband can do to encourage economic growth, according to Robert Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has researched the economics of technology. In a 2007 study, Litan and their colleagues found that for every one-percentage-point increase in the availability of broadband in a state, the number of jobs increased up to three-tenths of a percent per year. Faster broadband speeds likely have the same effect, they said.
"I don't know what the magnitude would be, but I am convinced you can show there is an incremental benefit," Litan said.
Employment in Tullahoma lagged statewide job growth before theLightTUBe was turned on. Since the recession ended in 2009, two years after the city began offering broadband, the city has outpaced job growth in Tennessee. The city added 3,598 jobs from April 2009 to April 2014, a 1.63 percent annual growth rate, about double the statewide rate, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Arnold Air Force Base and its flight simulation development complex, as well as a regional medical center, are the primary engines for employment, officials say, but "if the city of Tullahoma can offer to businesses high-speed Internet at a reasonable price as part of the city's overall infrastructure, we think that's a huge advantage for us and one that businesses look for," said Thom Robinson, executive director of the Tullahoma Area Economic Development Corp.

Are you having a boring day? If you are struggling to find some ideas for your boring day then you've come to the right place. Whether you are alone or in a group there are some fun ideas for turning that boring day around. Learn about some of these fun ideas for a boring day.
The first idea, and a great one if you are on your own, is to play some games available for free online. If you have Windows you already some free classic games, like chess or checkers, which can be played online against a wide variety of different people. How long has it been since you played a few games of chess? It could be fun. You also have access to a very large selection of games on the Internet, which are totally free and do not require a download. These range all the way from card and board games, classic arcade games, all the way up to hundreds of brands new, and addictive fun, games that you probably never even heard of. Try a simple online search for “free online games” or “free arcade games” and you'll be sure to find some great, and fun, time wasters.
Another fun idea for a boring day, which requires a few other people around, is any classic activity. You may be surprised but the things that you used to enjoy as a young child are actually just as fun, if not more so, after a couple of decades. This includes anything from building a snowman, playing a card game, or even something such as truth or dare. Believe it or not after years of not doing these things it tends to bring you back to a much simpler time in your life. If you are having a boring day these things can be quite fun.
A great activity, whether you're home on your own or with a group, can be a movie marathon. These days there are so many movies that have a few parts, everything from Die Hard, Rambo, and Lord of The Rings, all the way to the Mummy and other new films. With the way TV is now you can even rent a whole season of a TV show for a few bucks and have a marathon of your favorite show. Pick up a pizza and some sodas or beers and you'll be sure to have a fun activity to last the whole day. These days this is even a viable option without having to run the movie store with the ability to stream great movies and TV shows for free, and legally, online.
These are just a few examples of fun activities to brighten a boring day. Use your imagination, the possibilities are endless.
Hopefully now you can break free from your boredom and have a fun filled day with these great ideas.
Younger generations tend to have more-positive views than their elders of a number of institutions that play a big part in American society. But for some institutions – such as churches and the news media – Millennials' opinions have become markedly more negative in the past five years.
Since 2010, Millennials' rating of churches and other religious organizations has dipped 18 percentage points: 55% now say churches have a positive impact on the country compared with five years ago, when nearly three-quarters (73%) said this. Views among older generations have changed little over this time period. As a result, older generations are now more likely than Millennials – who are much less likely than their elders to be religious – to view religious organizations positively.
Millennials' views of the national news media also have grown more negative. In 2010, four-in-ten Millennials said the national news media was having a positive impact on the way things were going in the country, a far more positive view than among older generations (just 27% of Silents and Baby Boomers and 29% of Generation Xers said this).
But now, Millennials' evaluations of the news media have grown more critical and are currently on par with older generations: Just 27% now say it has a positive impact, compared with 26% of Xers and Silents and 23% of Boomers.
Younger generations tend to have more-positive views than their elders about small and large businesses as well as financial institutions and labor unions. Views of each of these institutions have grown more favorable over the past five years.
Banks and financial institutions continue to be viewed more negatively than positively among adults overall (47% vs. 40%), yet nearly twice as many as in 2010 now say they have a positive impact (40% today, 22% then). And these more-positive impressions are seen across generations: Five years ago, just 35% of Millennials said banks had a positive impact on the nation; today 45% say this. Evaluations of large corporations have similarly improved among Millennials, though they also remain more negative than positive.
Small businesses were viewed positively by majorities across all generations in 2010, and those views have only grown more positive in recent years. For instance, 86% of Millennials now say small businesses have a positive effect, up 15 points since 2010.
Labor unions are also seen more positively today than they were five years ago (45% now say they have a positive impact on the country, up from 32% in 2010). And Millennials remain much more likely than their elders, especially members of the Silent Generation, to view unions positively: More than half (57%) of Millennials say this, compared with 42% of Gen Xers, 41% of Baby Boomers and just 28% of Silents.
Millennials also have more positive views of colleges and universities than those in older generations. Nearly three-quarters of Millennials (73%) say colleges and universities have a positive impact, compared with 64% of Generation Xers, 59% of Boomers and just 51% of Silents.
And although technology companies are widely seen as having a positive impact on the country, a generation gap does exist: 77% of Millennials and nearly as many Xers (73%) and Boomers (70%) say this, compared with a smaller majority of Silents (59%).
While about half of Americans (48%) view the energy industry as having a positive impact on the country, this view is somewhat more common among those in younger generations than older: 54% of Millennials and 52% of Xers say this, compared with just 42% of Boomers and 35% of Silents.

Just updating this game to let everybody know that this VN has been updated, and is now playable in Russian!I also fixed a handful of typos in the English version, so if anybody owns this VN but hasn't played it yet, now would be a good time! ☆彡
About This Game Mireille Maiorano is the daughter of a wealthy Italian family, raised in an all-girls' boarding school far away from the rest of society — until their monotonous life is thrown into disarray after the unexpected death of their father.
Left with nowhere else to go, Mireille is sent to live with their uncle in France — but the man who acts as their escort is the worst person imaginable for such a delicate job. Lyon is a tactless, careless Frenchman who only seems to care about telling stupid jokes and seducing older women, and Mireille hates them with every inch of them being.
At least, they would. They want to. But life isn't always that simple.
Recent immigration enforcement actions by the Trump administration are creating a culture of distrust and could strangle Oregon's economy, Gov. Kate Brown told Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly on Sunday.
Brown, a Democrat, met with the Republican administration's top immigration enforcement official one-on-one during an annual National Governors Association meeting in Washington, D.C.
Brown said they are particularly worried about a chilling effect the presence of Immigration and Custom Enforcement Officers in county courthouses may have on residents.
"I'm concerned some actions of Immigration and Custom Enforcement officers are creating an atmosphere of fear," said Brown in a statement. "Today I shared with Secretary Kelly that the trust in public institutions is undermined when Oregonians seek assistance from public officials, but are instead met with suspicion from those they expect to help them."
What's more, they said, that fear puts Oregon's economy at risk because of its reliance on immigration policies like the H1-B visa program, which allows companies to hire foreign workers with specialized skills.
The same day Brown met with Kelly, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, also a Democrat, said the Secretary of Homeland Security assured them that immigration agents are not conducting random raids and will not target undocumented residents unless they are suspected of being involved in illegal activity.
Trump's priorities for deportation issued earlier this year also include undocumented immigrants who are charged but not convicted of a crime, abuse public benefits or are considered "a risk to public safety or national security" by an immigration officer.
The discussions between governors and Kelly came after Trump on Thursday said the deportation effort was a "military operation." Hours later, Kelly told reporters the US will not use its military to enforce immigration laws, and that there will be "no mass deportations."
According to a statement from Brown's office, their conversation with Kelly also touched on Oregon's efforts to comply with the federal Real ID Act, which requires stating to upgrade drivers licenses to meet security guidelines.
In addition, they talked about Oregon's earthquake preparation efforts and possible reduction of federal emergency aid funds.
In December, Oregon was left off an early list of 50 infrastructure priorities to receive funding from the Trump administration.
Earlier this month, Brown issued an executive order strengthening the state's sanctuary status and asked the Attorney General to sue the White House over Trump's executive order banning most travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the U.S.

One of the UK's most vibrant and outdoorsy cities has been accused of trying to clamp down on alfresco fun by proposing bans on activities ranging from tree-climbing to the lighting of barbecues in more than 200 parks and open spaces.
Officials at Bristol city council have drawn up a series of suggested new bylaws that also cover skateboarding or playing football in an "annoying" way, and critics claim they could even prevent the setting up of children's sun tents or windbreaks.
A detailed report says the idea is to tackle "antisocial and nuisance behaviours that are adversely affecting our communities".
The report, (pdf) to be considered by the council, states: "By introducing bylaws, there is no intention to restrict people's freedom to use parks and green spaces or to impose a blanket ban on the activities covered. The aim is only to tackle activities that are of an antisocial nature and cause considerable nuisance to other parks users and local residents."
Over a two-year period to March 2013, the council and police received more than 3,000 complaints about issues that could be covered by the bylaws, which would ultimately need the approval of the communities secretary, Eric Pickles.
Some of the proposed bylaws, including a ban on archery and javelin-throwing, have not led to objections. But the Liberal Democrat councillor Mark Wright said many of the proposals were an "illiberal assault on civil liberty". They added: "The proposed new bans are a massive over-reaction to issues that are better managed by education and common sense."
Most city centre residents lived in flats, they said. The bylaws would effectively prevent them from ever enjoying a freshly barbecued burger. And those involving ball games or skateboarding would lead to the stamping out of those activities. "This package of bans will quickly lead to a substantial deterioration in relations between the police and young people."
Wright pointed out that the public consultation on the bylaws ran last summer, which meant that most of Bristol's many students – who may be disproportionately affected by some of the proposals – were not involved.
A Hollywood-style sign on the slopes of the Avon Gorge welcoming visitors to "Bristoland" has been taken down after wags removed the O and R, added an apostrophe and changed the message to the less positive "It's bland".
The report was to be considered by the full council on Tuesday but the mayor, George Ferguson, asked for it to be withdrawn after the criticism. They tweeted that the measures went on to the agenda "without my full involvement".
Ferguson said they had asked for further briefing on the proposals, which would be given "cool consideration" after the local elections in May. Ferguson said they had spent their life championing the right of children to
play outside . They said: "There's no city leader in the world that
recognises the importance of children playing outside than I do." Ferguson
said they were away last week and was surprised to see the bylaws on the
agenda to be discussed by the full council.
They said more work was needed to balance the need to deal with anti-social
behaviour in parks with that of making sure they are "fully available" for
play and recreation.
The community assisted 'Pyramid Flipper' by Eve Tech is finally, almost ready to go on sale. The Windows 10 2-in-1 will be available to pre-order through Indiegogo towards the end of September or very beginning of October.
The decision to use Indiegogo is in part due to the ease of being able to sell something without having to develop an online store, while hopefully opening up the Pyramid Flipper to a wider audience. If you've been following the project and want to get in on it though, you'll have to be quick. Initially there will be only 500 made.
That's not the end of things, though, as the plan is to re-open pre-orders from December of this year through Eve's own website. Indiegogo backers can expect shipping from December of this year into January 2017.
There are still details to be announced, not least the final name. But as this is being given the crowd funding technique initially, there are perks and even hardware specs that still need to be decided upon. Not to mention how much it'll cost.
But it's been an interesting project so far, essentially turning over much of the design to the community, to get the device that they truly desire. Hopefully we'll see the finished product soon enough,
Scottish most outstanding spots. There is, of course, a lot more than just 15, but these every Scotland Traveloholic must see.
Scottish Landscapes and distinct geography offer a stunning mix of unique and inspiring habitats for you to explore.
Enjoy !

Epic Games has released a new update for its Unreal Engine, which adds official support for Nintendo's upcoming Switch console. While the Japanese gamemaker has been working with the popular developmental engine for some time now, this patch makes things official, and means that we should see a number of UE4 games on the Switch in the future.
One of the biggest problems with Nintendo's Wii U console was its lack of third-party support, so getting a popular engine like Unreal Engine working well on the next-gen system is a smart move. It also comes at a time when Japanese developers appear to be catching up with the West in learning how to best utilize the Unreal Engine, so it is expected to see much greater adoption among Eastern studios.
Nintendo's own Shigeru Miyamoto previously stated how confident they were in Nintendo's command of the engine and said that it would help make porting games from the PC to the Switch that much easier.
This release of Nintendo Switch support is official, though is said to be still in the “experimental” phase. Epic promises that the next release will change that to a “shippable state.”
Along with the addition of Nintendo Switch support in the new 4.15 update for the Unreal Engine, Epic has also improved stability, enhanced developer workflows, and added improvements to runtime performance. We're told that this improves efficiency during development and should lead to a better user experience post-release.
One big feature that a number of developers will enjoy though, is an improvement to compile times for programmers. Epic claims they have been reduced by as much as 50 percent. While it's not clear what effect that may have on programmer excuses moving forward, it should be of a real boon to all developers.
Other improvements to the engine include better texture streaming, which should reduce CPU and memory usage, as well as load times; reduced overhead in executing Blueprints; the addition of a new UI blur widget, and new texture streaming debugging visualization tools, among hundreds of bug fixes.
The 26 year-old, who signed a five-year contract on their arrival from Manchester United in July 2009, has struggled to build a relationship with chief executive Garry Cook and manager Roberto Mancini since the sacking of Mark Hughes last year.
It is understood that the written transfer request was submitted several days ago and ahead of Saturday's 3-1 victory over West Ham United , which Tevez missed through suspension, and which lifted the club to second in the Premier League table.
The revelation that their leading player and figurehead wants to now quit exposes the tensions at City and will be a severe test for Mancini.
Tevez has been a pivotal figure in for City's ascent this season, scoring 10 goals, but several factors have been playing on their mind throughout this campaign. The difficulties they have had with Mancini have been evident for some time and erupted in public after they were substituted recently against Birmingham City and then against Bolton Wanderers last week.
Tevez has a great deal of respect for the club's owner Sheikh Mansour, with whom they get on well, and the supporters but has struggled with the management. They met with Mancini and made clear their unhappiness at the Italian's perceived aloof style and the way in which it is felt that some key players have been frozen out of the team.
According to sources, Tevez's decision has nothing to do with money – they are already one of the highest-paid players in the Premier League – and if they were put for sale there would be a clamour from some of Europe's leading clubs to sign him.
Real Madrid tried to sign them before they were sold to City and Chelsea have also been strongly interested in the past – and would be again - as have Barcelona.
But it is understood that they are now so determined to leave City that they are genuinely considering retiring from football.
There have been no indications yet whether City are prepared to let them go although it would be unthinkable that such a key player would be permitted to depart, especially with the season so delicately balanced. City would also face a huge backlash from their supporters over the popular striker.
However Tevez, who has scored 33 goals in 50 league appearances for City, is an extremely single-minded man and also someone who has been dealing with several personal off-the-field issues. They recently admitted that they are desperately missing their children, who are back in Argentina, and their home and has spoken about retiring early from the game.
It is also believed at the club that Tevez has been considering their future for some time.
“This isn't our fuckin' neighborhood. It's a battlefield. We're on a battlefield tonight. Make a decision: Are we gonna stand on the sidelines, quietly standing there while our country gets raped? Or are we gonna ante up and do something about it?” —Derek Vinyard, American History X “We will never be able to win in the clash of civilizations if we don't know who we are. If Western civilization succumbs to the siren song of multiculturalism, I believe we are finished.” —former U.S. member of congress and presidential candidate Tom Tancredo

Early in their tenure as attorney general, Eric Holder got into hot water for a Black History Month speech in which they referred to America as “a nation of cowards” when it comes to racial issues. The way they were blasted for their comments in some corners—a task made much easier by removing the quote from context—ironically underlined their point: We could bicker over Holder's perceived lapse in patriotism while continuing to dodge the difficult conversation they want us to have. In truth, race comes up in the culture all the time—and by Holder's admission, in political discussion—but in language that's more coded than frank, and that doesn't necessarily cut to the heart of the matter. It's the third rail of American discourse.
For all its flaws—and they are legion—Tony Kaye's 1998 firecracker American History X could never be condemned for its lack of candor on racial matters. Until looking at it again for this column, I hadn't seen the film since its brief theatrical run, which was short-circuited in part due to the public battles between Kaye, their star Edward Norton, and New Line Cinema over the final cut. (Kaye famously took out a full-page ad in Variety decrying the Norton-supervised cut that New Line favored, and tried to have their name removed from the credits and replaced with the “Alan Smithee” pseudonym. When that failed, they suggested “Humpty Dumpty.”) In the years since, I've tried to account for why American History X took off in the culture, and made a few assumptions: that Edward Norton's performance as reformed skinhead Derek Vinyard was too magnetic to deny; that the existence of a neo-Nazi group in a modern American city had a pulpy appeal, like the gangs in The Warriors or the anarchists in Fight Club; or that its most sensationalistic scene—the “curb-stomp”—was one of those you-must-see-this moments that lead people to pass around DVDs and videotapes.
No doubt all those elements were contributing factors, but I think the cult of American History X, for better or worse, has to do with its frankness. This is not a subtle film. This is not a film of great depth or psychological complexity. This is not a film with any discernible subtext; it's all text. But it does engage, albeit in the bluntest possible terms, in the kind of open conversation that Holder seems to be endorsing. Derek's path from scared kid to charismatic neo-Nazi leader to changed man follows such a clear cause-and-effect pattern that the audience in the theater next door can follow it, but there's a power to that, too. The racial discussion isn't couched in code words or other niceties of language, but stated so plainly that we can't wriggle out from under it. And it happens around the dinner table—sometimes literally, as in this scene where Derek aggressively confronts their mother's liberal new boyfriend (Elliott Gould) over the rioting and looting after the Rodney King trial. Note how closely Derek's argument dovetails with those of mainstream critics who condemned looting in the aftermath of Katrina or the fall of Baghdad:

“Who would like some dessert?” says Derek's mother (Beverly D'Angelo), trying to play peacemaker, and yet the conversation continues. American History X just keeps on talking, at least when Kaye isn't going overboard with slo-mo shower jets and other visual “poetry.” David McKenna's script is loaded with pungent monologues and combustible melodrama, but even its structure does a lot of explaining, piling on long flashback sequences to account for Derek's journey and their influence on their brother Danny, played by Edward Furlong. The title refers to an essay Danny's principal, Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks), requires them to write after turning in a book report hailing the virtues of Mein Kampf. Sweeney wants Danny to write simply about their brother Derek—and within those broad parameters, a movie (with scads of voiceover narration) is born.
As Danny writes, their brother has served out the end of a three-year stint at Chino for voluntary manslaughter, having killed two African-Americans in response to an attempted car robbery outside their home in Venice Beach. In the years since he's been in prison, Derek's white-supremacist views have calcified in Danny's mind, too, and the skinhead movement in Venice has flourished in their absence. We learn the roots of Derek's racial hatred: How their father, a firefighter with prejudices of their own, was gunned down by a black man. How their grief and anger were stoked by a local white-power nut (Stacy Keach) who recognized Derek's charisma and persuasiveness. How Derek was able to seize upon the sense of disenfranchisement felt by many in their racially evolving neighborhood. And how, finally, their rhetoric manifested itself in horrific violence. In this scene, Derek masterfully spins a rant on immigration into a pep talk for ransacking a Korean grocer:

Kaye, who also served as cinematographer, shoots in black and white and color, which for practical purposes helps situate viewers in time, but also suggests ways of seeing the world. The Derek of the past sees things starkly; Derek post-incarceration has a more nuanced perspective. But no matter where it stands in the timeline, American History X is strictly black and white. It's not just that the script leaves no room for interpretation, but that its dramatic transformations are rarely all that plausible, especially in the scenes with Derek in Chino. It makes sense that their disenchantment with their Aryan prison buddies starts with theirs observing their hypocrisy in moving drugs through Mexican gang members. But Derek's relationship with a black inmate (Guy Torry) on laundry detail is pure hooey, staking Derek's hasty transformation on a handful of genial exchanges and a story about the racial injustice that led the inmate into the pen. Reforming a hardened neo-Nazi like Derek—who isn't a sheep-like follower of racist dogma, but a confident proselytizer of it—would take a hell of a lot more than some disarming jokes over the folding press. (For a better example, look to The Believer, a superior film that turns to a much more profound source for conversion.)
Though overwrought and rigged like a Lifetime movie, American History X has a primal force that owes plenty to Norton's performance, of course, but also to Kaye's interest in American culture at its most extreme. It's always fascinating when a foreign filmmaker comes to America, because their impressions are unique and telling, even when they're off-base or marred by awkward hiccups. (Think Michelangelo Antonioni's Zabriskie Point, Bruno Dumont's Twentynine Palms, or Wim Wenders' various efforts here—none of them perfect by any measure, but they're singular and resonant even in their misjudgments.) Kaye is drawn to the violent fringe of American society: Their extraordinary 2006 documentary Lake Of Fire, an epic (and startlingly graphic) look at the war over abortion rights, sought out the most dangerous zealot on the scene, including one man who would later be convicted for murdering a doctor. The racially charged world of American History X is amplified a few notches above the real one, often to the film's detriment, but Kaye's in-your-face style does force viewers to confront tensions that tend to simmer more frequently than they explode. There's a hyper-real, almost comic-book quality to Derek whipping off their shirt for a basketball game, ready to do battle against their African-American foes, wearing that Nazi tattoo emblazoned above their heart. And their eventual victory is pure ecstatic fantasy, like the anti-Hoosiers.
Such a scene seems unlikely right out in the open, on a public court in the middle of a big city, but this is a film that wants to have that uncomfortable dinner conversation. Much of the language Derek uses to persuade their skinhead followers and debate their adversaries is merely an n-word or two away from a modern talking head on cable news. And at a time when the presence of a black president has brought out insidious sloganeering like “Take our country back”—who's “our”? And from whom?—there's something refreshing about a film like American History X that puts everything on the table. It doesn't make for convincing cinema, exactly, but cowardly it isn't.

Attention Chicagoans: On Wednesday, July 28th at 7:30 p.m., the New Cult Canon comes to the Music Box Theatre with a screening of David Lynch's Lost Highway. I'll be there to introduce the film and lead a discussion afterward. Three reasons to come:
It's a revelation on the big screen, shot in luscious Panavision with a particularly aggressive Lynch sound design. It's better than you remember it being, especially in the wake of Mulholland Dr. If you show up in strong numbers, perhaps such an event could be replicated in the future.

Basics of Java Garbage Collection
Knock, knock .
. Who's there?
…long GC pause…
Java.
It's an old joke from the time when Java was new and slow compared to other languages. Over time, Java became a lot faster. Today it powers many real-time applications with hundreds of thousands of concurrent users. These days, the biggest impact on Java's performance comes from its garbage collection. Fortunately, in many cases, it can be tweaked and optimized to improve performance.
For most applications, the default settings of the JVM work fine. But when you start noticing performance issues caused by garbage collection and giving more heap memory isn't possible, you need to tune and optimize the garbage collection. For most developers, it's a chore. It requires patience, good knowledge of how garbage collection works and an understanding of application's behavior. This post is a high-level overview of Java's garbage collection with some examples of troubleshooting performance issues.
Let's get started.
Java ships with several garbage collectors. More specifically, these are different algorithms that run in their own threads. Each works differently and has pros and cons. The most important thing to keep in mind is that all garbage collectors stop the world. That is, your application is put on hold or paused, as the garbage is collected and taken out. The main difference among the algorithms is how they stop the world. Some algorithms sit completely idle until the garbage collection is absolutely needed and then pause your application for a long period while others do most of their work concurrently with your application and thus need a shorter pause during stop the world phase. The best algorithm depends on your goals: are your optimizing for throughput where long pauses every now and then are tolerable or you are optimizing for low latency by spreading it out and having short pauses all along.
To enhance the garbage collection process, Java (HotSpot JVM, more accurately) divides up the heap memory into two generations: Young Generation and Old Generation (also called Tenured). There is also a Permanent Generation, but we won't cover it in this post.
Young generation is where young objects live. It's further subdivided into the following areas:
Eden Space Survivor Space 1 Survivor Space 2
By default, Eden is bigger than the two survivor spaces combined. On my Mac OS X with 64-bit HotSpot JVM, Eden takes about 76% of all the young generation space. All objects are first created here. When Eden is full, a minor garbage collection is triggered. All new objects are quickly inspected to check their eligibility for garbage collection. The ones that are dead, that is, aren't referenced (ignoring reference strength for this discussion) from other objects are marked as dead and garbage collected. The surviving objects are moved to one of the empty ‘survivor spaces'. Which one of two survivor spaces? To answer this question, let's discuss survivor spaces.
The reason for having two survivor spaces is to avoid memory fragmentation. Imagine if there was just one survivor space. While you are at it, also imagine survivor space as a contiguous array of memory. When young generation GC runs through the array, it identifies dead objects for removal. This would leave holes in memory where objects previously lived and compaction will be needed. To avoid compaction, HotSpot JVM just copies all surviving objects from the survivor space to the other (empty) survivor space so that there are no holes or empty spaces. While we are discussing compaction, please note that old generation garbage collectors (with the exception of CMS) perform compaction on the old generation section of the heap memory to defragment it.
In short, minor garbage collections (triggered when Eden is full) ping-pong live objects from Eden and one of the survivor space (known as the ‘from' survivor space in logs) to the other (known as the ‘to' survivor space). This happens until one of the following happens:
Objects reach maximum tenuring threshold, in other words, have ping-pong'ed enough times that they aren't young anymore, There is no room in survivor space to receive newly birthed objects (We'll revisit this later.)
When this happens, objects are moved to the old generation. (There could be other conditions but I'm not aware of them.) Let's try to understand with a real example. Suppose we have the following application that creates a few ‘long-lived objects' during initialization and creates many short-lived during its operation. (E.g. a web server that allocates short-lived objects for each incoming request.)
private static void createFewLongLivedAndManyShortLivedObjects () { HashSet < Double > set = new HashSet < Double >(); long l = 0 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < 100 ; i ++) { Double longLivedDouble = new Double ( l ++); set . add ( longLivedDouble ); // add to Set so the objects continue living outside the scope } while ( true ) { // Keep creating short-lived objects. Extreme but illustrates the point Double shortLivedDouble = new Double ( l ++); } }
Let's enable garbage collection logs and other settings using the following JVM command line arguments:
-Xmx100m // Allow JVM 100 MB of heap memory -XX:-PrintGC // Enable GC Logs -XX:+PrintHeapAtGC // Enable GC logs -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=15 // Allow objects to live in the young space longer -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC // Ignore for now; covered later -XX:+UseParNewGC // Ignore for now; covered later
The application logs showing the state before and after garbage collection are as follows:
Heap before GC invocations=5 (full 0): par new ( young ) generation total 30720K, used 28680K eden space 27328K, 100% used from space 3392K, 39% used to space 3392K, 0% used concurrent mark-sweep ( old ) generation total 68288K, used 0K
Heap after GC invocations=6 (full 0): par new generation ( young ) total 30720K, used 1751K eden space 27328K, 0% used from space 3392K, 51% used to space 3392K, 0% used concurrent mark-sweep ( old ) generation total 68288K, used 0K
From the logs, we can see a few things. The first thing to notice is that there have been 5 minor garbage collections before this one (total of 6.) Eden was 100% used which triggered it. One of survivor space is 39% used and as such has some room available. After the garbage collection is over, we can see that Eden went back to 0% and survivor space increased to 59%. This means that live objects from Eden and survivor space were moved to second survivor space and dead one's were garbage collected. How can we tell that some dead objects were collected? We can see that Eden is much larger than survivor space (27328K vs 3392K) and since survivor space size only slightly increased, a large number of objects must have been collected. The old generation space stayed completely empty before and after the garbage collection (Recall that the tenuring threshold was set to 15.)
Let's try another experiment. Let's run an application that is only creating short-lived objects in multiple threads. Based on what we've discussed so far, none of these objects should go to the old generation; minor garbage collection should be able to clean them up.
private static void createManyShortLivedObjects () { final int NUMBER_OF_THREADS = 100 ; final int NUMBER_OF_OBJECTS_EACH_TIME = 1000000 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < NUMBER_OF_THREADS ; i ++) { new Thread (() -> { while ( true ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i < NUMBER_OF_OBJECTS_EACH_TIME ; i ++) { Double shortLivedDouble = new Double ( 1.0d ); } sleepMillis ( 1 ); } } }). start (); } } }
For this example, I'm give the JVM only 10 MB of memory. Let's look at the GC logs.
Heap before GC invocations=0 (full 0): par new ( young ) generation total 3072K, used 2751K eden space 2752K, 99% used from space 320K, 0% used to space 320K, 0% used concurrent mark-sweep ( old ) generation total 6848K, used 0K
Heap after GC invocations=1 (full 0): par new generation ( young ) total 3072K, used 318K eden space 2752K, 0% used from space 320K, 99% used to space 320K, 0% used concurrent mark-sweep ( old ) generation total 6848K, used 76K
Not what we predicted. We can see that this time, the old generation received objects right after the first minor garbage collection. We know that these objects are short-lived and tenuring threshold is set to 15 and this is the first collection. What happened is the following: the application created a large number of objects which filled up Eden space. Minor garbage collection ran and tried to collect garbage. However, most of these short-lived objects were active during the GC, i.e. were being referenced from a live thread and being processed. The young generation garbage collector had no choice but to push these objects to the old generation. This is bad because the objects that got pushed to the old generation were prematurely aged and can only be cleaned up by old generation's major garbage collection which usually takes more time. With a particular GC algorithm that we'll cover later, CMS, major GC is triggered when the old generation memory is 70% full. This default value can be changed with the -XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=70 argument.
How to prevent premature aging of short-lived objects? There are several ways. One theoretical way is to estimate the number of active short-lived objects and size the young generation appropriately. Let us make the following changes:
Young Generation by default is 1/3 of the total heap. Let's change this using the - XX:NewRatio=1 which gives young generation more memory (~3.4 MB compared to the 3.0 MB the last time.)
which gives young generation more memory (~3.4 MB compared to the 3.0 MB the last time.) Also increase the survivor space ratio using the -XX:SurvivorRatio=1 argument. (~1.6MB each compared to 0.3 MB the last time.)
The problem was fixed. After 8 minor garbage collections, the old generation space was still empty.
Heap before GC invocations=7 (full 0): par new generation total 3456K, used 2352K eden space 1792K, 99% used from space 1664K, 33% used to space 1664K, 0% used concurrent mark-sweep generation total 5120K, used 0K
Heap after GC invocations=8 (full 0): par new generation total 3456K, used 560K eden space 1792K, 0% used from space 1664K, 33% used to space 1664K, 0% used [ concurrent mark-sweep generation total 5120K, used 0K
This is in no way an exhaustive method of tuning garbage collection. I'm simply trying to demonstrate the steps involved. For real applications, optimum settings are found as a result of trial and error with different settings. For example, we could have also fixed the problem by doubling the total heap memory size.
Garbage Collection Algorithms
Now that we have covered generations, let's look at garbage collection algorithms. HotSpot JVM comes with several algorithms for young and old generations. At a high level, there are three general types of collection algorithms, each with its own performance characteristic:
serial collector uses a single thread to perform all garbage collection work, which makes it relatively efficient because there is no communication overhead between threads. It is best-suited to single processor machines -XX:+UseSerialGC. parallel collector (also known as the throughput collector) performs minor collections in parallel, which can significantly reduce garbage collection overhead. It is intended for applications with medium-sized to large-sized data sets that are run on multiprocessor or multithreaded hardware. concurrent collector performs most of its work concurrently (for example, while the application is still running) to keep garbage collection pauses short. It is designed for applications with medium-sized to large-sized data sets in which response time is more important than overall throughput because the techniques used to minimize pauses can reduce application performance.
HotSpot JVM allows you to configure separate GC algorithms for young and old generations. But you can only pair up compatible algorithms. For example, you cannot pair up Parallel Scavenge for young generation collector with Concurrent Mark Sweep for old generation collector because they are not compatible. To make it easier for you, I was going to make an infographic to show which garbage collectors are compatible, however, luckily I searched first and found one created by JVM engineer, Jon Masamitsu.
“Serial” is a stop-the-world, copying collector which uses a single GC thread. “Parallel Scavenge” is a stop-the-world, copying collector which uses multiple GC threads. “ParNew” is a stop-the-world, copying collector which uses multiple GC threads. It differs from “Parallel Scavenge” in that it has enhancements that make it usable with CMS. For example, “ParNew” does the synchronization needed so that it can run during the concurrent phases of CMS. “Serial Old” is a stop-the-world, mark-sweep-compact collector that uses a single GC thread. “CMS” (Concurrent Mark Sweep) is a mostly concurrent, low-pause collector. “Parallel Old” is a compacting collector that uses multiple GC threads.
Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS), paired with ParNew, works really well for server-side applications processing live requests from clients. I have been using it with ~ 10GB of heap memory and it keeps response times steady and GC pauses are short. Some developers I know use Parallel collectors (Parallel Scavenge + Parallel Old) and are happy with results.
One important thing to know about the CMS is that there have been calls to deprecate it and it will probably happen in Java 9 :'( Oracle recommends that the new concurrent collector, the Garbage-First or the G1, introduced first with Java, be used instead:
The G1 collector is a server-style garbage collector, targeted for multi-processor machines with large memories. It meets garbage collection (GC) pause time goals with high probability, while achieving high throughput.
G1 works on both old and young generation. It is optimized for larger heap sizes (>10 GB). I've not experienced G1 collector first-hand and developers in my team are still using CMS, so I can't yet compare the two. A quick online search reveals benchmarks showing CMS outperforming G1. I'd tread carefully, but G1 should be fine. It can be enabled with:
-XX:+UseG1GC

AHL linesman Chris Woodworth will don the stripes in the American Hockey League for the last time. He'll be joined on the ice tonight by referees Keith Kaval and Tim Mayer, alongside fellow linesman Fraser McIntyre.
“I'm very honored to skate their final game in their hometown,” said referee Keith Kaval. “Chris has done many great things both on and off the ice in their career. I look forward to skating one last time with them and our crew they hand picked.”
Woodworth's officiating career spans over 20 years. They have officiated in the NAHL, USHL, NCAA Division I, IHL, UHL, SPHL, ECHL, CHL and AHL, as well as internationally with the IIHF. Woodworth is currently a Supervisor in the USA Hockey Officiating Development Program.
“I don't think anybody grows up wanting to be an official, it's just something that's in your chemical makeup, I think,” Woodworth said with a smile. “And once you get your foot in the door, it becomes part of you, but I do think you have to have a screw loose in your head in order to want to be an official.”
A Career Begins in Canandaigua
Woodworth got their start officiating at the Greater Canandaigua Civic Center, where he's remembered for driving the Zamboni, working the snack bar, and refereeing games.”I knew I was better at taking the pucks out of the net than putting the puck in the net,” Woodworth once said of their decision to shift from playing in games to officiating them.
After working a youth national championship event in Rochester, Woodworth was invited to a junior development camp in Vermont. A strong showing in that camp earned them a job working junior hockey in Dallas. While there, they received an unexpected call to fill in for a CHL official sidelined due to illness. They did well enough to earn a job in the league, working 35 games that season. From there, things kept rolling. They added assignments in various leagues across North America, eventually reaching the AHL.
“I came home and knew I was ready to go into the American League and knew it wasn't going to be handed to me, so I wrote a letter to the director of officiating to introduce myself,” Woodworth told the Democrat and Chronicle. “I told them I'm ready, and I can live in Rochester. I got a tryout, a preseason game between Syracuse and Rochester eight years ago. They came, saw the game, and I ended up getting hired.”
That was nine years ago. Woodworth continued their pursuit of improving their game and reaching the next level – the NHL. They were working as many as 120 games and traveling over 100,000 miles to try to make it there.
“I was chasing the NHL dream pretty hard so I was on the road constantly,” they said. “I missed a lot of funerals, births, weddings, and the lifestyle is very difficult and the travel is very difficult. It burned me out.”
“I couldn't really justify chasing the dream anymore,” Woodworth said. “I quit doing it at that level and settled down back at home.”
International Experience
While the NHL never came calling, the International Ice Hockey Federation recognized Woodworth's abilities.
They were invited to an IIHF officiating camp with hopes of working future tournaments. Injuries kept them out of their first two international opportunities. Woodworth finally had the opportunity to suit up for the 2012 World Juniors in Calgary.
A strong showing there got them an invitation to the 2013 World Championships in Stockholm, Sweden. While working Sweden vs. Canada, Woodworth was the only on-ice official to see Alex Edler's knee-on-knee hit on Eric Staal. They assessed a major penalty and game misconduct to Edler for the hit. Edler was suspended for the remainder of the tournament.
Woodworth Selected for Sochi
The following year, Woodworth again found themselves working a high-level international tournament. This one, the highest-level possible. They were one of 32 officials selected to work the 2014 Sochi Olympics.
“[Being named to work the Olympics] is nice because it validates that you're a solid official, you're world class, and a lot of hard work went into getting to this point, so it's very special,” Woodworth said.
“It was very exciting, I never in a million years thought I would get to that level,” Woodworth said. “It's taken years of hard work, many camps and lots of games under my belt. It's nice to establish that I'm pretty good at what I do out there. You have to be one of the best to get an assignment like that.”
From their long career to their international assignments, Woodworth has shown they are one of the best. Their fellow officials and students agree:
“‘Woody', as we called him, is one of the main reasons that I have been able to advance up the officiating ranks. They took me and many others under their wings and allowed us to develop and grow as not only officials but as people as well. Woody's knowledge is priceless and they are always there for me and others to help us with any questions or situations that come up. It's sad to see a great mentor of mine retire but they have done a remarkable job!  They are a lifetime friend to me now.” – Dan Iulianello, Webster, NY
“Chris has been a mentor to me on and off the ice. Chris helped me reach levels of officiating I didn't think would be possible. Not only did they succeed, they also gave a great amount back. Without them giving back, I would not be the official I am today.” – Nick Kolb, Rochester, NY
We at Scouting the Refs thank Chris Woodworth for all their contributions to USA Hockey, both personally and through the development of younger officials. We wish them well in retirement and with hopes of a terrific send-off out there on the ice in front of their friends and family.

Why not?
Still, this makes me very happy. The only thing that could make me unhappy right now is if someone snapped a Penguins neck right in front of me (they are my favorite animal, and only evil people could hate them). I do hope this may lead to the Rescue Rangers game getting the same treatment, or maybe a new game in the same vain based on Gravity Falls (probably the best TV show since Freakazoid aimed at both adults and kids). I'd ask for Motorcity, but Disney's programing is similar to Fox in terms of distroying good shows before they even have time to find an audience or constantly shuffle it around the schedule when they do (like Futurama and Arrested Development).

Something like Marvel Super Heroes:War of the Gems -Remastered- or X-Men:Mutant Apocalypse -Remastered- or even sequels based on actual Marvel Comics sagas with Ducktales -Remasterd- similar graphics.
Disney owns the rights of Marvel franchises too.

Steve Posts: 5 Alright...This is the most HUGE news I've heard in YEARS!!!
Well, here's the thing. Any hope for a new TaleSpin game? Something that would be more than just a remake of the NES game? (which was very far from the show's greatness)
Because, well...
Some of us fans are doing exactly THAT.

I seriously didn't think Disney cared any more about their Disney Afternoon shows, but now I'm hoping they won't sue us over this. In any case, I would KILL for a good TaleSpin game like the Ducktales one you're making!!!

Marco Posts: 5 This announcement has been AWESOME! Sprites look fabulous, they look like they're directly taken from the original cartoon. Great! Pretty psyched to get this on PS3 this Summer. But I'd like to know if there's a possibility for a portable release on 3DS.
Especially considering I noticed this: at the end of the trailer, where there's all the white trademarks text, it's said "If you do not have the Nintendo eShop icon on the 3DS main menu, you will need to perform a system update". I've seen this label present in the last Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate trailer for both Wii U and 3DS, and not in the last RE:R HD edition trailer where Wii U is nominated in trademarks. Actually, I've seen this text is present in the D&D trailer too, so it could be a sign for the future, or just an error on your front; still, it's strange to see this error just here and not in the Resident Evil trailer (a title that is released on eShop and PSN too). I'd really hope to see the game on 3DS, it'd be a very good fit with its union of 2D characters and 3D backgrounds, and in that case I could seriously think about double-dipping, this game would deserve a double dip! :D

The number of EU workers in Britain fell by 50,000 in the last three months of last year, official figures revealed today.
The total went down from 2,354,000 to 2,304,000, compared with the previous quarter.
The biggest drop, 46,000 was among citizen,s born in the A8 group of Eastern European countries, which include Poland and the Czech Republic.
There have been previous falls, but Remain campaigners blamed the latest drop on the Brexit vote.
Lib-Dem leader Tim Farron said: “Seeing EU nationals starting to leave because of the climate of uncertainty that this Government has created is heartbreaking.”
The figures also showed a record number of people are in work.
More than 31.8 million adults are in a job - 300,000 more than a year ago - after a quarterly rise of 37,000.
Unemployment fell by 7,000 to just under 1.6 million.
Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green said: “With employment at its highest rate since records began, and unemployment at its lowest in over a decade, we remain in a position of strength.”

Over the weekend, some fans uncovered a number of profanity-laced messages Bayley posted on Twitter in 2012 when they were a struggling wrestler on the independent circuit by re-Tweeting them. These messages were brought to their attention on the social media platform, a few which they embarrassingly deleted.Here is what remains.
GCN
Allyson Robinson had been married for over a decade when they say they "finally spoke my truth". At the time they were known as Daniel Robinson, and they told their wife – Danielle – that they wanted to be a woman. Formerly an army officer and then studying to be a minister at Texas' Baylor University, the largest Baptist university in the world, it wasn't a decision they took lightly.
In fact, as they wrestled with their sexuality, Robinson was almost driven to take their own life. "I grappled with the truth that was emerging within me at that time in ways I never had before. It nearly led me to suicide," they told Christian Today. They would cry all the way to Divinity school, a 45 minute commute, and again all the way home. One day, they considered deliberately driving into the river; afraid of what coming out as transgender would mean for their wife, children and church. "By grace alone in that moment I caught myself thinking those thoughts and realised that was not the right way forward," they recall. "I didn't know what the right way was, but I knew there had to be some other way."
They started seeing a therapist, and began an in-depth study of LGBT theology. "It's ironic that the seminary at the largest Baptist university in the world has an incredibly diverse library on faith, sex and gender," they laugh. "It gave me many different perspectives, I realised that there were other perspectives, and that began the journey for me."
They told their family the truth, and Danielle vowed to stand by her, as did the majority of their relatives. The support of their loved ones "has not just empowered my ministry and my work for inclusion, but it has strengthened me, and helped me to see myself as a beloved child of God in ways that I never did before I came out."
Robinson went on to become the first openly transgender minister to be ordained in the Baptist tradition, and served as transitional pastor at Calvary Baptist Church in Washington DC. MSNBC called them "the most radical preacher in America".
They realise, however, that not everyone who identifies as transgender or who struggles with their sexuality is fortunate to find such support, particularly within the Church. It's why she's dedicated themselves to the promotion of LGBT civil rights, working for a number of key organisations.
This weekend, she's speaking at the Gay Christian Network's (GCN) annual conference in Houston, Texas. It's the world's largest annual LGBT Christian conference, and will explore what's next for the Church as it grapples with issues of sexuality and gender in the midst of a culture war.
"I think it's critically important at this point in history that places like this [GCN] exist. In American culture, we have over the course of a generation or two lost the ability to speak across our differences, and that applies equally to Christians and to those who profess other faiths or no faith," they say.
"One of the things I love about GCN is its tradition and commitment to make a space where people who don't agree on all the details can get together as followers of Jesus and share worship."

Previous speakers include evangelical author Philip Yancey, blogger Rachel Held Evans and Baptist theologian Tony Campolo, who announced their support of same-sex relationships in June last year. The conference encourages Christians with different perspectives to come together and wrestle with the big questions facing the Church.
The US legalised same-sex marriage last year, though provisions have been made for churches and religious organisations to refuse to perform ceremonies for gay couples. Some denominations, such as American Baptist Churches USA, allow individual congregations to decide whether to ordain LGBT clergy or perform same-sex marriages, but the majority remain in favour of a traditional stance. It's led to renewed accusations that the Church is out-dated and irrelevant.
"I think that that the Church may always suffer from this impression, that it's behind the times, simply because it's rooted in traditions and cultures, many of which date from before the time of Christ, and I think that's okay," Robinson says.
"That said, I think our society has watched the Church grapple with these questions, and many are disappointed that it has taken the church longer comparatively than the rest of society to come around."
Though they commended the Church for its conservative nature; the way that it "measures very carefully the winds of change before it sets sail to them", Robinson says that same caution may be hindering its ability to reach out to those outside.
"It's important for the Church to weigh carefully the pull of the culture in which it lives, and yet that careful weighing serves to set it apart from culture in ways that can be less than helpful for the Church's mission of carrying forth the gospel in to the future," they say.
Sexuality is just one of many issues the Church has faced. Many believe it's become more divisive than necessary, but Robinson says it's crucial we get to grips with it. "The big difference here is that the traditionalist stance on inclusion for LGBT people in the Church is hurting people," they say.
"In fact, I don't think it's alarmist to say it is killing people, because of the influence the Church continues to wield across our society. It gives this conversation a different level of gravity than conversations about worship style of some of the other finer points of theology."
The good news is that Robinson believes there is hope for the future for LGBT Christians struggling to find their place within the faith community. They say it's "very likely but not inevitable" that soon there will be many more Christian leaders who identify as LGBT across the denominations.
"I think that is the future rests upon our ability – and by 'our' I mean LGBT affirming Christian people – to continue to hold the institution accountable while finding new ways to cross the divide; ways that reflect the truth that outside of the walls of the institution, this war is over. The cultural war has come to a close at least on this front, and those of us on the affirming side have won," they say.
"It is critical that we as affirming Christians find ways not to become the kind of church that once rejected us."

UPDATE, February 24: A source in the federal government confirmed to this website last night that the leaked memo from the Department of Justice that is discussed below is legitimate.
* * * *
* * * *
No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.—Title IX
A U.S. Department of Justice draft memorandum that proposes “recommendations on the interpretation and enforcement of Title IX” was leaked today by one of the many online accounts of government employees who have “gone rogue” and are hard at work sharing with the world all the changes that have been introduced since the new presidential administration took the reins of power.
The Twitter account that published the document three hours ago, @ALT_USCIS, is operated by insiders who claim to be employed at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, and has been a reliable source for information about the “ICE Raids” that took place the last two weeks. That reliability is the reason I am sharing the documents here.
The main thrust of the leaked draft memo is to change operational procedures in our nation's schools and law enforcement from what has been a history of protecting victims of sexual assault to a new standard in which those accused of sexual assault are to be protected.
Because Title IX was crafted to help create an environment of equality in our public schools with an aspiration to someday achieve a “gender-neutral” educational environment, the draft memo alleges that schools are no longer “gender-neutral” … for men. Male students face “disparate treatment” and “disparate impacts” from that treatment, predominately in the area of “complaints of sexual violence.”
(Sound of needle scratching to a halt across a record. The memo is only two pages long, and it takes a full page to get to this point, but here is where its author or authors include details.)
The memo reads:
In order to protect the due process of all parties involved in a school's sexual violence investigation, the Department should take the following actions and implement the following policies:
• Witness must be available to be cross-examined, including the parties involved;
• Every complainant's sexual history, if relevant, may be introduced at the hearing. Currently, questions about the complainant's sexual history with anyone other than the accused perpetrator should not be permitted.
• Although schools must ensure that hearings are conducted in a manner that does not inflict additional trauma on the complainant, this concern must be weighed against the accused perpetrator's right to a fair hearing.
• A school must allow a complainant to be present for the entire hearing. Current Office of Civil Rights policy guidance does not allow a complainant to be present or the entire hearing if not allowed by the school.
• The review of reports, investigations, and resolutions of student and employee conduct to ensure the preservation of the rights of the accused.
“Preservation of the rights of the accused.” Indeed. The more honest phrasing would read: “Preservation of only the rights of the accused.”
A word about the second-to-last item, which reads, “A school must allow a complainant to be present for the entire hearing.” If any reader is acquainted with a friend who has been sexually assaulted or raped, or if you yourself have been harassed, assaulted, or raped (in which case, you have my respect), perhaps you are aware that sometimes in hearings or trials the rape victim is allowed to not attend portions of the hearing or trial in which they will be forced to re-endure the assault or rape by listening to descriptions of it or viewing physical evidence. The victim's body is most if not all of the argument. If they choose to not attend, they are not required to re-live the event. If this draft memo becomes the stated policy of the Department of Justice, that protection will no longer be afforded to victims on school campuses. Charges of rape may decline as a result. The incidence of rapes will not decline.
Further, the victim must be willing to be cross-examined by representatives of the accused at the hearing. In addition to that, the “complainant's sexual history, if relevant, may be introduced at the hearing.” As if sexual history has anything to do with an act of violence committed against a complainant. (Did an earlier draft of this memo include a bullet-point complaint about how “currently” what a victim was wearing at the time of the alleged assault is not to be discussed?)
I hope that this leaked draft is not real. Many of the online accounts of “rogue” federal offices are real and many may not be; some may exist as a tool for the current White House to trace the source of rumors and leaks. As I wrote above, because the alt-Immigration Twitter feed has so far been reliable, I published this.
This is the Tweet from @ALT_USCIS:
The document is a PDF, at this address: 3.PDF, and a photocopy of the email chain attached to the draft memo is here (also a PDF): 2.PDF.

China's Tricky Economic Transition: From Steel Mills To E-Commerce
Enlarge this image toggle caption ALY SONG/Reuters /Landov ALY SONG/Reuters /Landov
After a huge drop in the past couple of weeks, Shanghai stocks rose Friday for the second day in a row.
For many, that's a relief. But China's economy has a long way to go. In fact, it's in the midst of wrenching transition from an economy based on investment and manufacturing to a higher-income one built on services and consumer spending.
The stakes are high — not just for China, but for the rest of the world.
Economic growth is slowing in China in a way it hasn't in a long time.
"I think you have to be honest and say there are big chunks of the economy that are in recession right now," says Arthur Kroeber, head of research at Gavekal Dragonomics, a Beijing-based economics research firm.
That word – "recession" – is one you almost never hear in China. The impact on China's coalfields and rust belt is already painful, Kroeber says, and will only get worse.
"That will create unemployment problems," they warn. "It will create bankruptcy problems. It will create nonperforming loan problems."
China is shifting away, they say, from an economy built on things like investment in infrastructure and housing.
"The big deal has been that China, for years, was just in this incredible housing boom," they say. "And every year, they were building more units than the year before. Basically, what happened was that people said, 'Oh, well, we're going to go up forever.' So people built too many steel plants and too many cement plants and too much of everything. And then it stopped growing."
Faced with falling demand and too much capacity, coal mines have shut down in western China. In the country's northeastern rust belt, Kroeber says, "Instead of the steel plant closing down, they will cut back production. They'll put their workers on one- to two-day-a-week shifts."
That is all part of a punishing – if inevitable — path to a new economy.
Where some analysts in the West see calamity, Andy Rothman, a longtime China economist and investment analyst with Matthews Asia, sees progress.
"People just don't seem to understand how much change has happened in the Chinese economy," they say. "So you can go to China's rust belt and say that manufacturing or construction-related industries are doing quite poorly, which they are. But you also have to pay attention to the consumer and services part of the economy, which are doing quite well – and the fact that income growth in China adjusted for inflation is still rising by 7 percent."
Consumption is a bright spot in this economy — and you can see it in places like Shanghai's Super Brand Mall in the heart of the city's financial district. At lunchtime on a weekday, the 8-story mall is filled with people riding the escalator to the top-floor IMAX theater and lining up outside a restaurant that serves cuisine from the country's far northwest.
But making the Chinese economy a lot more like Shanghai and a lot less like the country's rust belt won't be easy. For one thing, consumer spending isn't growing fast enough yet to replace the old economy. And economists say the government needs to give up monopolies in finance and telecom and create a freer environment for innovation to boost growth.
"You know that innovation cannot be planned," says Xu Bin, a professor of economics and finance at Shanghai's China Europe International Business School. "Innovation has to be done by people. So you need to really allow people to think more freely, to have more intellectual property rights, and all these would require the government to abandon certain targeted, favored sectors."
Is this fundamentally a tension over control?
"I think so," says Xu. "I think so."
The government next needs to begin laying off millions from state-owned industries, including moribund steel mills in the northeast, Kroeber says. Keeping them open keeps people employed, but otherwise they are drag on the economy.
Kroeber is not certain that officials – who traditionally fear economic unrest – are prepared to that. But the costs of failing to do so could be dire.
"We could wind up in a situation like essentially what Japan was in the '90s, where they never do it and China winds up growing at a very slow rate — and all these stories of China taking over the world go away," they say.
If China's economy slows dramatically, that would be awful for much of the rest of the world, which has come to depend on China for so much of global growth.

I don't know for certain that this is legit, but according to it, soon WY won't recognize many states.
State of Wyoming Dave Freudenthal, Governor
Office of the Attorney General
Division of Criminal Investigation Bruce A. Salzburg
Forrest C. Bright, Director Attorney General
MEMORANDUM
TO: All Wyoming Sheriffs
All Wyoming Chiefs of Police
FROM: Forrest C. Bright, Director
DATE: February 12, 2009
RE: Concealed Firearm Permit Reciprocity
I am writing to let all the agencies in Wyoming know of substantial changes resulting from review of other states' concealed firearm criteria. The Wyoming Attorney General's Office recently completed examination of the other 49 states statutes for the purpose of honoring concealed firearms permits issued by another state, or reciprocity.
Pursuant to Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 6-8-401(a)(iii), Wyoming will recognize a permit from another state that “has laws similar to the provisions of this section, as determined by the attorney general . . ..” The Wyoming Attorney General has determined that with the exception of 8 states, presently all the others concealed firearm permit statutes are not sufficiently similar to Wyoming's. Specifically, Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 6-8-104(b)(v) prohibits issuance of a permit to any person who has been convicted of a controlled substance violation, felony or misdemeanor in any jurisdiction. Most other states' analogous statutes do not.
The Wyoming Attorney General holds that if a misdemeanor drug conviction disqualifies a Wyoming resident, is also needs to disqualify an out-of-state permit holder. Due to the difference in how each state handles controlled substance convictions, Wyoming is also limited in our ability to maintain reciprocity with states we may have previously.
Accordingly, as of March 1, 2009, Wyoming can only honor concealed firearm permits issued by the following states: Connecticut, Ohio, Georgia, Oklahoma, Maryland, Oregon, Massachusetts, and Utah .

Cash could disappear within decade as digital economy grows, researchers say
Posted
Notes and coins could disappear within a decade with the development of a cashless economy, according to researchers at the Australian National University (ANU).
The ANU Research School of Economics has been developing a model for government-certified digital money that researchers said could be circulating in five years.
School director Professor Rabee Tourky said there was no future for cold hard cash.
"There was a hypothetical question that arose in our research, 'can we foresee a future with paper cash?' The answer was no," they said.
Professor Tourky said Bitcoins, a type of digital currency that is created and traded electronically, were the inspiration behind a new proposal to turn all money digital.
They said the Bitcoin model had advantages over cash.
"You can make very small payments with it, like half a cent, and you can make very large, fee-free payments," they said.
But Professor Tourky said there were drawbacks that made people reluctant to adopt it.
"People don't trust it and it's not certified by government," they said.
"Because of this lack of certification there is no financial infrastructure around it. There are no Bitcoin credit cards."
Their department's solution was a government-issued digital currency, as an alternative to Bitcoin, which they have called AusBit.
Professor Tourky said AusBit would address concerns surrounding security and certification by undergoing a certification process by the government and becoming an official currency.
They said this kind of model had been on the financial sector's radar for some time.
"I'm sure the Reserve Bank of Australia is thinking about these things," Professor Tourky said.
"The fact is that this will have to be addressed by the Federal Government if it wants to maintain control over the financial side of the economy."
Canada has previously piloted government-issued digital cash but halted the program last year and announced that they were putting development back into the hands of the private sector.
ANU teaching students about crypto-currency
The ANU recently began teaching first-year economics students about theories of digital cash, in an effort to keep them ahead of the game.
"I am pretty sure we are the first major university to offer this kind of curriculum," Professor Tourky said.
"Within the money and banking coursework it's a first."
June Ma, an economics student undertaking an honour thesis in digital cash at the ANU, said it was a useful inclusion.
"I think it's really exciting for the university to have such a topical issue in the economy in the classroom," they said.
"We're not just here to learn the technical skills in economics, what the school has done well is given us a big-picture approach."
Professor Tourky said the course showed students the challenges that researchers faced in the wake of the digital era.
"The hope is that students will be able to address these issues and solve them right here," they said.
"Our students go into leadership roles. They go to banks, to Treasury, to the Department of Finance and they are going to be facing this challenge in their careers."

The U.S. Air Force has broken ground on a new KC-46A Pegasus sustainment campus at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma, the service announced Monday. The aircraft is shown here in 2015. U.S. Air Force photo
TINKER AIR FORCE BASE, Okla., Aug. 8 (UPI) -- The U.S. Air Force has broken ground on a new KC-46A Pegasus sustainment campus at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma, the service announced Monday.
The future 158-acre site will be the new aerial refueling tanker's home for maintenance, repair and overhaul operations, the service said in a statement.
It is estimated the new facility will create more than 1,300 jobs for the state and local community.
The project brings a number of hangars, ramp infrastructure, software innovation labs and engine test facilities.
The CWG JV company will build the campus on Tinker's south side.
The land was bought by the Air Force, Oklahoma City and Oklahoma County.
The service paid $8 million, the city's share was $23.5 million and the county paid $12.5 million for the land, formerly owned by Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co., the Air Force said.
The Pegasus is the first phase of a three-part effort to replace the Air Force's aging tanker fleet.
It can refuel any fixed-wing receiver capable aircraft.
The first Pegasus is slated to arrive at Tinker in 2018.

Following the terrible disaster at Grenfell Tower, North Kensington, London, there has been much criticism and anger about the inadequate response of Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council and the national Government in helping the victims of the fire. A fire in residential quarters on this scale is unprecedented so it is not surprising that the local council's response has been rather inadequate especially given the severe cuts there have been in public services in recent years. However, there is also a very positive side to this tragedy and that is the response of the local people to dealing with their immediate problems.
The surviving residents of Grenfell Tower and other local people did not wait for local council officials to act but immediately started to organise themselves to provide food, shelter, clothing and other necessities for those affected by the disaster. People outside of the immediate area and across the country donated a vast amount of money, food, clothing, bedding and other items for the relief effort. In fact, vastly more donations have been received than can be immediately used. As the local organisation has developed an attitude of resentment and opposition to both local and national government officials has developed for their shortcomings.
SELF-ORGANISATION
What has been very clearly demonstrated in the area around Grenfell Tower is the capacity of ordinary people to get organised to take care of themselves. Local and national government are rightly being criticised for their failures over many years to put in place effective building and fire regulations. At the same time the creative capacity the local people have shown in helping themselves shows that we do not really need highly paid and privileged officials and politicians to tell us what to do, to “manage” our lives for us. We are quite capable of getting our own act together.
INTERNATIONALISM
The multi-ethnic and multi-national character of the residents of Grenfell Tower and the surrounding area is very noticeable. Many are refugees from conflicts in countries where British imperialism has played a part in creating disorder and chaos, e.g. Syria. This in no way prevented these people working together with white British people to relieve the suffering. This instance shows that the efforts of racists and fascists (including Islamic fundamentalists) to stir up hatred between different ethnic and national groups in Britain will ultimately fail. Human beings have a natural affinity to co-operate with each other but this is often disrupted by reactionary elements acting in their own interests.
TOWARDS SOCIALISM
In the capitalist system in which we live the energy and creativity of most people is severely limited by the oppressive and exploitative structures in which we are trapped. Both in work and in the wider society we are constrained by complicated bureaucratic organisations whereby sizeable layers of “managers” try to control us so as to maximise our economic exploitation for the benefit of the tiny capitalist ruling class. The apologists for capitalism claim that society would descend into chaos if it were not for the efforts of the directors and managers to keep our noses to the grindstone.
The people's response to the Grenfell Tower incident shows that this claim is a lie and that we are perfectly capable of leading our lives effectively and efficiently without a lot of bosses telling us what to. Tragic as it is, the people's response to this disaster shows that socialism leading on to communism is not some unrealistic fantasy but a real possibility arising out of the everyday capacity of human beings to freely work together in ways which enhance our lives.
POWER TO THE PEOPLE!
"I am not my brother's keeper," Howard "Cookie" Krongard, the State Department's inspector general, testified to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee yesterday.
As Cookie surely must know, that excuse hasn't worked since Genesis. But it was a fitting contribution to the modern-day Cain-and-Abel tale that unfolded before lawmakers' eyes in the Rayburn Building. In this case, the players weren't Cain and Abel, but Cookie and their brother Buzzy. Biblical scholars believe the first fratricide was committed with an ass's jawbone, but the weapon in this case was a uniquely Washington cudgel: the conflict of interest.
Cookie, under fire for allegedly quashing probes of the infamous Blackwater security contractor, began their testimony by angrily denying the "ugly rumors" that their brother, former CIA official Alvin "Buzzy" Krongard, is on Blackwater's advisory board. But during a recess, Cookie called Buzzy and learned that -- gulp -- the ugly rumors are true: Their brother is on the board.
When the lawmakers returned, Cookie revised and extended their testimony. "I had not been aware of that," Cookie told the members of congress. "I hereby recuse myself from any matters having to do with Blackwater."
The lawmakers reacted with Old Testament fury.
"A pretty outrageous thing," thundered Rep. Chris Shays (R-Conn.). Buzzy, Shays said, "has done you tremendous damage."
They certainly had. The swaggering Cookie -- they alternately addressed the lawmakers with their thumb in their waistband, slouching in their chair, rolling their eyes and making baffled glances -- had spent the morning aggressively denying the allegations lodged against him: that they had impeded investigations into contracting fraud, including weapons smuggling by Blackwater, and that they had abused their underlings. "Yes, I have been brusque, I have been shrill, I have been hard on people," Cookie said with no apology.
But then came Buzzy's bombshell -- and Cookie's credibility crumbled. Either they had lied to Congress, or their own brother had lied to him. "It is increasingly difficult, I must tell you, to give you the benefit of the doubt," said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.).
It was only the latest bit of strangeness for the powerful but eccentric Brothers Krongard. As The Post's Glenn Kessler reported, Cookie sued their own son and daughter-in-law last year over a home loan they made to them, firing off an e-mail saying their son's kids would be "on the street" if they lost the case. Cookie settled two weeks ago for a modest sum.
Then there's Buzzy, known for their cigar chomping, martial arts and recreational workouts with SWAT teams. "Krongard once punched a great white shark in the jaw," their hometown Baltimore Sun reported when they took the No. 3 job at the CIA a decade ago. "He has dangerous fish in their basement, a meat carving set made from the shin bones of a boar."
More recently, Buzzy joined the advisory board of Blackwater, the firm known for its ready trigger fingers in Iraq. And Cookie, at about that time, was resisting requests from the Justice Department to assist in a probe of Blackwater.
Chairman Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), in their opening statement, charged that Cookie "concealed this apparent conflict of interest."
At the end of their own opening statement, Krongard responded to Waxman with an off-the-cuff complaint. "One thing just came up that really does bother me, and that was an allegation concerning my brother," Cookie protested. "I specifically asked him. I do not believe it is true that they are a member of the advisory board."
Cummings distributed two documents that the committee had uncovered: a July 26 letter from Blackwater founder Erik Prince inviting Buzzy "to become a member of the Blackwater Worldwide Advisory Board," and a Sept. 5 e-mail to "thank you for accepting the invitation to be a member."
"Sir, I dispute that," Cookie replied with indignation. They argued that "there is nothing in here that suggests that my brother accepted this July 26 invitation."
Evidently, Cookie overlooked the "thank you for accepting" part.
Rep. Diane Watson (D-Calif.) took another bite of Cookie, informing them that the Blackwater board is meeting this week in Williamsburg and that Buzzy had already checked in. "He may be there to tell them he's not joining," Cookie speculated.
Buzzy was indeed in Williamsburg -- reporters confirmed it by calling the hotel during a recess -- and Cookie confessed it to the committee on their return.
The chairperson tried to offer them a way out. "Have you had a difficult relationship with your brother?" they asked.
Cookie said they had not. "We have gone to great lengths to keep our professional experiences separate," they offered.
This wasn't good enough even for Shays, who had been so supportive of the witness that they literally rubbed Cookie's back during one recess. "The problem is, nobody's going to believe you," Shays explained. "I don't know what kind of conversation you had with your brother when you were on the phone, but I would be one pretty unhappy guy."
Within hours of the hearing, the blogosphere was buzzing with word that Buzzy had contradicted Cookie's account. "I had told my brother I was going on the advisory board," the Web site TPM Muckraker quoted Buzzy as saying.
Good thing Buzzy's a martial-arts expert -- Cookie may be coming after them with an ass's jawbone.
CLOSE The GOP-led House has approved legislation that hits Russia with additional financial sanctions. The new penalties are aimed at rebuking Moscow for interfering in the 2016 presidential election and its military aggression in Ukraine and Syria. (July 25) AP

The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill nearly unanimously Tuesday that will toughen sanctions on Russia and make it harder for President Donald Trump to ease the sanctions against Moscow.
The bill passed 419-3, making it one of the more lopsided votes you'll see in the lower chamber where Republicans and Democrats both agree on something. Every legislator from Tennessee voted for the bill except one: Knoxville's John J. Duncan Jr.
The bill comes amid growing scrutiny by Congress and a special prosecutor of possible links between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. The bill aims to strengthen sanctions on Russia for its alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign.
The bill punishes Russia for meddling in the U.S. presidential elections and for its military aggression in Ukraine and Syria. Russia has not done enough to implement a cease-fire in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists are fighting government troops, according to the State Department. The bill also targets Iran and North Korea for their illicit ballistic missile programs and support for terrorism.
In a statement, Duncan said they had an issue with putting additional sanctions on all three powers.
“Overall, though I think we should stop trying to rule the whole world,” they said. “We are $20 trillion in debt, and we have enough problems at home.”
Tennessee Democratic Party Chairwoman Mary Mancini said Duncan is sending the wrong message with their no vote.
"It is frightening to know that Rep. Duncan has no interest in protecting the integrity of our elections," they said in an emailed statement. "Every U.S. intelligence agency agrees the Russian government interfered in the 2016 elections, an attack on the foundation of our democracy. Rep. Duncan is sending a message to the rest of the world that there is no consequence for attacking the United States."
Russia
“The increased sanctions against Russia were based on alleged meddling in our presidential election. However, if they did, it was totally ineffective, and Russia has aided us recently in the fight against ISIS and reaching a cease-fire in Syria,” they said.
Iran
“I had voted to place the original sanctions against Iran, but I did not think that they should have been expanded because our own State Department has certified twice in the last few months that Iran had complied with the terms of the nuclear agreement, and I just did not think we should slap them in the face when they are doing what we wanted them to do.”

North Korea
“I voted twice to put tough sanctions on North Korea, even though most of the time sanctions do not hurt the ruling elite in any country but usually really hurt the poor people. However, the nutty ruler of North Korea has already hurt their own poor people as much as possible by spending most of that government's money on bombs, weapons and other military equipment.”

“Elementary” will have more than 90 episodes under its belt before the end of the season. If ratings continue the way they have in its first couple weeks, that may be all it gets.
The show is currently rated a tossup for renewal, even with a drop below 1.0 in adults 18-49 last week. Why? There's a rich syndication deal already in place, which could be an argument for pushing past 100 episodes next season. CBS might also have bigger holes to patch (looking at you, “CSI: Cyber”).
Then again, if ratings stay at or below 1.0, CBS might be happy to go count its money in the TV afterlife. “Elementary” perked up a little in the second half of last season; it may have to repeat that performance to make it to 2016-17.
Another Thursday show, “2 Broke Girls,” joins the Index as a tossup, solely because of the small sample size.

–
The Renewal/Cancel Index is the ratio of a scripted show's new episode adults 18-49 ratings to the new episode ratings of the other scripted shows on its network. It's calculated by dividing a show's new episode live+same-day adults 18-49 average rating by the live+same-day new episode average of all the new scripted show episodes on the show's own network. Why live+same-day ratings? Because they correlate very closely with the rarely disclosed C3 ratings (viewing of commercials within three days of air), which are the basis for most ad deals.
(F) -Fridays: Shows airing on Fridays tend to be renewed with significantly lower than average Indexes.
(O) – Owned: All other things equal, shows owned by studios affiliated with their networks have a better shot at renewal than those from outside producers.
Android Wear devices like the second-generation Moto 360, Fossil Q, and $1,500 Tag Heuer Connected smartwatch are currently incompatible with Apple's new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The issue was discovered soon after both phones launched nearly two weeks ago.
Google added iOS support to Android Wear back in August 2015. For the last couple months, I've been using a Moto 360 alongside my iPhone because I like the way it looks and its nice-looking wrist notifications; I have no illusions of Android Wear matching the Apple Watch's functionality on iOS, but I've enjoyed the experience so far. Things were fine on the iPhone 6S Plus, but once I upgraded to Apple's latest handset, I hit a major roadblock — and I'm not alone. Complaints have piled up in this Android Wear discussion thread.
The iPhones 7 are simply unable to pair with the following Android Wear devices:
That's a big list, and the Moto 360 in particular is among the most popular Android Wear devices out there. If my experience matches with others, these watches all hang at the pairing stage of the Android Wear setup process. The iPhone seems to recognize that they're nearby because they show up in the Android Wear app, but attempts to pair with them are unsuccessful every time. It gets stuck at this step:
Apple just fixed another bug that temporarily caused some compatibility issues between Android Wear devices and iOS 10. That was quickly resolved with the release of iOS 10.0.2. But this problem with certain hardware models seems a little deeper. Google's Android Wear team says it's aware of the "serious pairing issue" and is investigating a fix. The team seems to be trying, at least. Android Wear's iOS app has been updated twice in the last week — but the iPhone 7 problem remains.
Should these devices ultimately require a firmware update to start working with iPhone 7, that might turn into a major headache. Since the smartwatches are currently unable to pair, installing any system update would pose a challenge; Android Wear products must be paired with a smartphone before updates can be downloaded. Users would thus have to use another iOS device that's not an iPhone 7 (or an Android phone) to load the fix.
This is a problem that's likely affecting a very, very small number of people. I don't think the iPhone / Android Wear combo is very popular among everyday consumers. But for those who do prefer other smartwatches over the Apple Watch, well, this is pretty annoying. And it has led me to take a serious look at Series 2.
Update September 29th 5:30PM ET: The list of models has been changed to remove the Michael Kors Android Wear watch and add the Moto 360 Sport after further clarification from Google.

sold a billboard to escort servicein Rio Grande Valley, Texas, after refusing to take the money of an atheist group in Alabama.
The Texas Play Bunny board says "I'll be your play bunny" and advertises a phone number. Although the number and web site appear to be extinct -- possibly as a result of this TV News report -- a Google cache of the site indicates that Play Bunny was a "premiere" escort service. (Is there any other kind?)
BNET readers will remember that this is the same Lamar that denied an atheist in Alabama a billboard that said "Imagine No Religion" because the message was "offensive."
The Texas branch of Lamar, and the community it serves, displayed a refreshingly liberal attitude toward call-girl advertising. KGBT Action 4 News:
When you write on the notebook, your mindset is to write and nothing else
The tediousness of copying from notebook to computer can be an editing leverage
If your first thought is that this article would be a review of a certain movie and novel with a similar title, then you are dead wrong. As of the moment I am penning this down, I have not watched the film nor read the book. Whether that movie (and novel) is about the literal notebook, I would not know. So what the heck are you reading about then, and what kind of power the notebook has that I want to discuss with you?Well, it is all about the advantage of using the simple notebook as against the computer and/or tablet when writing an article for a blog (such as this one).You may retort.You are right, blogs cannot be published without a computer. Take note, however, I say the word “publish.” You will only need your computer if you are ready to publish your draft. When you are writing your draft, though, no - you do not need it yet.I admit, it is quite tedious to write the initial draft on a notebook, and then manually transfer the text into the website's CMS (or content management system). You will not have the pleasure of using the "copy-and-paste" feature on this instance. Given such effort, still I find the advantages outweighing the tediousness.Learn why you shouldFor a blogger or writer who is in the act of writing, there is always this temptation to edit while you write. This is practically true if you are using your computer's word processor, given its propensity to alert its user when a wrong spelling or incorrect word usage is on the page. Of course, you can turn this feature off if you know how to. 😊The thing is, when you are doing your first draft, your objective is to write your thoughts down - not edit. Writing and editing at the same time is one significant reason why many writers grind their teeth in frustration. Because of this, they are not able to finish their work properly. Proofreading and editing will have their time, and such time is after you have completed your work prior to hitting the publish button.Since the notebook does not have the ease of having the quick editing functions and error alerts of a word processing software, the writer is forced to concentrate mainly on translating his/her thoughts into texts and scribbling them down on paper.Writing is never for the lazy, much so if you are a blogger. To a witty writer, a stodgy effort can be used as something worthwhile.When you are jotting down your thoughts on your first draft, your main goal is to write - and just write (as we have talked about earlier). However, that goal changes once you have drawn your last punctuation mark. Before you become eager to publish your work for all the world to see, you need to edit your piece. Your objective shifts from mere writing to making your work flawless.Know how to bestSurely, you cannot publish your composition if it is still in your notebook. In this case, you will now need the computer. The effort may sound annoyingly burdensome, but the task of copying your draft into the word processing application (or if you want, directly into your website's CMS) will allow you to see errors and notice words and phrases that may need improvement. More often than not, reading your draft and typing the texts on your keyboard sentence by sentence may trigger your jocose mind to come up with other ways to convey your message - thereby giving you some ideas to better reconstruct your sentences and paragraphs.So yes, writing on a notebook and then typing it on your computer afterwards can provide you a better allowance to proofread, edit, and improve your work. In the end, it will all depend on you, on what resources you have at hand, and on what circumstances are there at that moment.

Since December 2012, Italian team Wasp (standing for 'World's Advanced Saving Project') has been working on development of 3D printers and research about clay printers and materials. Besides its original PowerWasp EVO desktop 3D printer, Wasp has also developed a series of delta printers suitable for all the needs of 3D printing, such as:
PowerWasp Evo, print volume 260mmx195mmx210 mm
Delta Wasp 2040, print volume diam. 200mmx h200mm
Delta Wasp 4060, print volume diam. 400mmx h600mm
The Wasp Team, led by Massimo Moretti, has been working very hard to develop large 3D printers for printing houses. The WasProject stems from the methods of the 'potter wasp' project which builds its own home using natural materials such as clay and soil. Inspired by this sustainable development model, Moretti decided to design a giant 3D printer capable of printing homes using clay and natural materials. It should be low cost and have low environmental impact.
In 2013 the WASP team unveiled the BigDelta, a very large volume 3D Delta printer. In the same year, the Team won the prestigious 3D Green Award at the 3D Printshow in London and five Maker of Merit Awards at the Maker Faire in Rome.
The positive feedback from 3D printing community inspired the team to quickly move forward. Their goal is to double the size of the BigDelta Wasp and build a 5m tall BigBig DeltaWasp. This is just the first step of a more challenging project: to build homes with a much larger printer. They also invest heavily in research of clay and composite materials in order to create the best combination as building material.
In March 2014 the Wasp Team attended the African Fabbers Project in Marakech, Morocco, as a technical partner. Massimo and their team studied the clay houses in the area and the material they used. They took the soil from the ground and mixed with other material to create building material to feed the BigDelta Wasp they brought there.
"The material research is a very critical for this project." said Davide Neri of WASP team. "In fact you need to get the optimal fluidity of the mixture to avoid that the material collapses when extruded."
During this experimental jouney, the team has also established a partnership with the Chemical and Materials Engineering Department of Politecnico of Milan. "Together we are conducting researches on new materials related to 3D printing, mostly focused on clay composites." Davide told us. " And today we are very confident that we found the right recipe that offers the needed features. The mixture we are now using is a blend of the following ingredients: clay, water, alcohol, oil and paper."
The ultimate goal is to be able to build homes for developing countries with their 3D printing technology and materials. Wasp Team has been producing and selling 3D consumer printers to fund the WasProject research and development. The original PowerWasp multi-tools can now print, mill, cut and even extrude different materials. During Expo Sanità tradeshow in Bologna in May, WASP team presented PowerWasp with a syringe that is capable of extruding Aluminum oxide (alumina), a biocompatible ceramic that has been used as a dental restorative material for years.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visits abroad often have a return gift. They have brought back more than a dozen historical artifacts from the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany and Singapore.
Since 2014, the Indian government has retrieved 24 Indian antiquities from around the world that were either stolen or smuggled out. In contrast, from 2009 to 2014, just one such object was brought back to the country, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has said.
“There has been some momentum in the last 2-3 years (in bringing back Indian antiquities),” D.N. Dimri, Director (Antiquities) at the ASI, told ThePrint. They said they could not claim that the change has been spurred by the BJP coming to power but agreed that the country has made “significant gains in the recent past”.
Between 2004-09 no such objects were brought back, an official from the ASI said. In fact, between 1976 and 2013, a total of 13 antiquities had been brought back to India, they said.
Bringing back Indian artifacts and cultural heritage remains a “key element in India's foreign policy”, a government official told ThePrint. The return of these historical objects is part of the “restoration of India's pride and an acknowledgement of history” as well as a projection of India's soft-power, the official said.
Over the last two years, 16 objects have been brought back from the US alone. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the US in 2016, the US agreed to return 200 antiquities to India. However, a year and another visit later, only 16 of the 200 objects have been returned.
The government official said they were not aware of the exact status of the rest of the objects.
According to records updated until March from the Ministry of Culture, between 2000 and 2016 a total 101 antiquities have been stolen from Centrally Protected Monuments. However, experts estimate that the actual number of stolen objects over the years runs into several thousands. What is recovered, or even identified, remains a drop in the ocean.
“There has never been a concerted effort by the Indian government (to bring back stolen objects),” said Sudha Gopalakrishnan, former director at the National Mission of Manuscripts. They said that even the maintenance of existing antiquities, let alone stolen ones, barely meets international standards. “Antiquities are scattered all around. They don't even have a concerted list of antiquities,” Gopalakrishnan said.
The lack of a concerted governmental effort and political apathy for decades had also prompted a handful of private citizens groups to become active.
In 2013, a group called India Pride Project began lobbying efforts to bring back lost antiquities. Its founder, Anuraag Saxena, describes the group as one of “random, mid-IQ guys working on Skype and WhatsApp on weekends”.
Saxena and their partner Vijay Kumar are both Singapore-based NRIs, and they say they were frequently incensed to see Indian heritage scattered in other parts of the world. “It is bureaucratic failure that creates us activists,” Saxena said.
With a core team of 11 members with independent jobs of their own, and volunteers around the world, Saxena says their group coordinates with the government, international agencies, museums and a small, tightly-knit global curator community to investigate cases of missing antiquities. They speak of secret investigations, back-channel negotiations and encrypted communication, but hesitates when it comes to divulging the level of engagement with the government.
Gopalakrishnan, who claims to have “heard of the group”, says that it is indeed “perplexing” how the group carries out its activities. “It is laudable if they have found a foolproof way (of identifying and tracing stolen antiquities), but I'm not sure how feasible it is,” they said.
Dimri echoes Gopalakrishnan's scepticism. “Till date, we have not received any authentic information from this group. We don't know who they have been giving information to,” they said.
Of the five cases the group claims to have solved, one involved conducting the investigation for bringing back the 11th century Chola statue of a dancing Shiva from Australia, which was handed over to Modi by their Australian counterpart Tony Abbott in 2014. The group's website also lists its work toward the repatriation Sripuranthan Nataraja, Sandstone Yakshi, Bronze Ganesha and Uma Parameshwari.
The website, in fact, states: “The Mughals plundered us. Then the colonials. It's time to get our Gods back home.”
A historical art curator, who spoke to ThePrint on the condition of anonymity, said that the group is ideologically driven and only investigates Hindu-antiquities. They also said that outsourcing the task of recovering lost heritage to non-governmental organisations or private individuals is fraught with risks:
“(As a private individual) I will always bring back what suits my version of history,” they said.

The 2014-2015 campaign for the Calgary Flames has seen almost nothing but positives.
First and foremost, there's a very good chance they'll earn a playoff spot for the first time since 2009. Johnny Gaudreau's rookie season, the progression of players like TJ Brodie and Kris Russell -- and surprises like Lance Bouma -- are all extremely positive signs. However, if you ask me, the most encouraging thing we've seen this season comes from the progression of sophomore Sean Monahan.
For the first time in a long, long while, it looks like the Flames have a true number one center emerging in the organization.
So why does Monahan's progression take-the-cake for the best of the bunch of positives? For me it's simple: to win long term in this league, and to perennially contend deep in the playoffs, you need an elite player down the middle. From Anze Kopitar in LA to Jonathan Toews in Chicago and Boston's Patrice Bergeron (among others) the best teams in this league all possess that true top pivot. Monahan isn't there yet, but less than two years into their career, you don't have to squint to see them entering that echelon very soon.
The signs of improvement on the surface stare you right in the face. Through 77 games this season, Monahan has increased their total in goals (22 to 30), assists (12 to 29) and points (34 to 59) from one season to the next. Plain and simple, he's a more impactful offensive player by leaps and bounds. For instance, Monahan went from 140 shots on net in their rookie campaign to 182 so far this year. Their shooting percentage has fluctuated by just 0.2%, so it isn't any coincidence they hit the 30-goal mark.
But it goes deeper than that.
Monahan has taken a massive step forward in their all-around game, too. In year one, head coach Bob Hartley made life very easy on their rookie forward. Monahan was given easier match-ups and less defensive responsibility with centres like Mikael Backlund and Matt Stajan handling the lion's share of the heavy-lifting. That hasn't been the case in year two, as Hartley let the reins off right from the get go. Backlund's early injury forced this in part, but so did Monahan's training camp and preseason. They looked noticeably more ready for the tough minutes in September.
Monahan went from being a middle of the pack possession player on the team in year one to one of the best this season. Last year, Monahan's -12.29 shot rate ranked ninth on the team among forwards. He's bumped that to sixth at -6.92, but those are just the raw shot numbers without situational context. Their offensive zone start number have gone from 55% to 46.9%, which shows you he's out for far more defensive zone faceoffs than they were last year. On top of that, Monahan has improved in the faceoff dot, upping their total to 49.5% from 46.0%. Finally, the quality of who he's matched up against has gone up so much it's not even close. While Hartley went out of their way to put Monahan out against second and third lines last year, there is zero hesitation to have them out against top trios one year later.
In their sophomore season, Monahan stacks up fairly well in comparison to some other pretty impressive names in their second NHL campaign. The table below gives you a pretty good idea as we look at goals, assists, points, and faceoff percentage.
By no means is it a guarantee that Monahan is going to reach the heights of Toews, Kopitar, Bergeron, and Getzlaf. Let's not forget, these are Stanley Cup and Olympic Gold Medal winners with Hall of Fame credentials before the age of 30. But is it laughable to think Monahan might be able to be mentioned in the same breath in the relatively near future? I'm as pragmatic and measured as it gets, but even I think the answer to that question is no.
In fairness, though, it's only year two for Monahan. They have a long way to go until they reach the high-ground of those asupervisorstioned counterparts. But the massive steps Monahan has taken from their rookie campaign to their second NHL year give cause to wonder where this might go. He's trending in a positive direction with a rather steep incline. Some trial by fire in the pressure cooker that is the postseason would be a perfect way to finish this year out. The best news is that Monahan will be a central figure in making sure that happens. For that reason, and many others, Monahan's stellar sophomore season reigns supreme as the most important thing to happen in a year full of positivity.
Jared Kushner, Senior Advisor to President Donald J. Trump. (DoD Photo by Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Dominique A. Pineiro)
Jared Kushner's family is seeking a $250 million loan to pay back Chinese investors in a real estate development — but U.S. banks aren't exactly eager to do business with them.
Kushner Companies have shopping around for a loan against their 50-story Trump Bay Street luxury tower in Jersey City, which they would use to repay investors and pay off a mortgage on the development, reported Bloomberg Politics.
The family would keep $50 million from the loan, sources told the website.
The company owned by Kushner's family funded about a quarter of the $194 million development through the EB-5 visa program granting green cards to wealthy foreigners in exchange for U.S. investment.
Some large U.S. banks are reluctant to get involved in the transaction due to Kushner's ties to the White House, and because of the politically fraught visa program, sources said.
Three Democratic lawmakers sent a letter last week to Kushner Cos. seeking information about their use of EB-5 and raised concerns about possible conflicts with Jared Kushner's role as a White House adviser.
The company pulled out of an EB-5 presentation last month after Kushner's sister touted their business ties to President Donald Trump.
The family will likely turn to unregulated lenders and foreign banks to repay Chinese investors.
Congressional investigators are expected to grill Jared Kushner about whether they were seeking someone to purchase their family's 41-story tower at 666 Fifth Avenue when they tried to set up a secret back channel with Russian officials.
Kushner and their family real estate firm took a huge hit after buying the tower in January 2007 for a then-record $1.8 billion, and the company has reportedly been bleeding money ever since.
 They are expected to testify before the Senate and House Intelligence committees on their meetings with Russian government and banking officials, but no dates have been set.
Arrested Development, the world's fifth-greatest television series*, is set to return to the airwaves for a long-awaited fourth season. After that, a movie! Creator and writer Mitchell Hurwitz broke the news at a New Yorker festival event yesterday. “We're trying to do a limited-run series into the movie. We're basically hoping to do nine or 10 episodes, with almost one character per episode,” they said. Though said nine or 10 episodes will likely revolve around the show's stars, we hope that some minor, though no less memorable, characters get their fair share of screen time, too. What follows is a list, in no particular order, of obscure figures we hope will appear in the series and movie.

It's been 16 months since the first time Vermont and Purdue met on a basketball court, as they will Thursday in the first round of the NCAA tournament in Milwaukee. Their only previous meeting, a 107-79 Boilermakers home victory at Mackey Arena on Nov. 15, 2015, should have been an opportunity for Vermont's Josh Speidel to shine less than two hours from where they starred at Columbus (Ind.) North High. But the nature of their homecoming was altered after Speidel suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident nine months earlier.
Purdue Coach Matt Painter requested that Speidel, who was in a coma for four weeks after the accident, be introduced before the game. The Purdue crowd gave Speidel a standing ovation, during which fans held #JoshStrong signs and Purdue players, led by Speidel's former AAU teammate, Ryan Cline, exchanged hugs with the former Indiana high school standout. Speidel also received special permission to sit on the Catamounts' bench during the game.
[NCAA tournament cheat sheet: Top upset picks, myths to avoid, the perfect bracket]
“It's hard not to get emotional watching that,” Vermont Coach John Becker said Tuesday. “It's one of the most touching things I've ever been part of. To now have Josh here, part of us, and to go back and play Purdue, it's not an easy matchup, but it just seems ironic. I just think this is all connected somehow.”
To be clear, the 6-foot-7 Speidel will be on the Catamounts' bench again Thursday against the Boilermakers, but they still have a long way to go before they realize their dream of playing in a game for Vermont. Speidel was granted a waiver by the NCAA to practice and travel with the team this season without using a year of their eligibility. They had to relearn to talk and walk after the accident, and while doctors have told them it could be five years before their brain fully heals, he's made great strides since they were introduced at Mackey Arena.
“Back then, I'm not lying when I say I couldn't do close to anything, really,” Speidel said. “I was having trouble walking.”
On Tuesday, as their teammates prepared for Vermont's first NCAA tournament appearance since 2012, Speidel was working on their jump shot and doing some running off to the side. On Wednesday, they were working on their hops. Speidel's roommate, Vermont redshirt sophomore Everett Duncan, recently told them their next goal should be to touch the backboard with both hands.

“He's just a constant reminder of how much we each have, and how much we take for granted,” Becker said. “We all have our good days and bad days, just like Josh does, but they come in every day and he's as determined as ever to get better. Imagine how hard it is for this kid, who I thought could be one of the best players to ever play at Vermont, and to have that taken away from him, to never let that get them down. They never stops working and pushing himself. He's just a really special person and a huge inspiration for us.”
“He's getting better, but a lot of the reason we do this is for him,” said Duncan, who played two summers of AAU ball with Speidel in Indiana and is the only player on Vermont's roster who saw firsthand how dominant the Catamounts' primary source of inspiration was in high school. Speidel was averaging 25.6 points and 9.3 rebounds as a senior at the time of the accident, which happened when they pulled their Honda Accord into the path of an SUV. None of the four other people involved were seriously injured.
A few days later, Becker sat in a hospital room in Indianapolis with Speidel and their parents, Dave and Lisa. They told them Speidel had a spot on their team, whenever they were ready, and that Vermont would honor their scholarship regardless of whether they recovered enough to play again. Nearly a year after the accident, Speidel traveled to Burlington to attend Vermont's game against Stony Brook. They received a standing ovation from the crowd at Patrick Gym, the place they had fallen in love with during their only official visit to the school in June 2014.
[The best bets to win March Madness 2017]
No one would have faulted Speidel for deferring their college experience even longer or enrolling at a school closer to home, but they left Columbus for Burlington last June to officially begin their career as a Catamount. Becker, who succeeded their former Catholic University teammate, Mike Lonergan, as head coach at Vermont in 2011 after Lonergan left to become head coach at George Washington, is happy they did.
“We're 29-5,” Becker said. “We've won two more games than any team in America East history. We've won four more games than any team in Vermont history. We've won 21 games in a row. We thought we were going to be good, but this season is magical, and I think Josh has something to do with the magic. I don't know how you quantify it, but there's something different going on here with this team than any other team I've been around. It's happening for a reason, and I think Josh is a big part of that.”
“I know everyone says I've inspired the guys this season, but to be honest, they've inspired me tremendously,” Speidel said. “Next year, I want to be with this team and I want to be able to contribute. My goal is definitely to one day put on the green and gold and go out there and play.”
Duncan, who teared up when Speidel was introduced at Purdue 16 months ago and will occupy a spot on the bench a few seats down from Speidel when Vermont looks to continue its magical run on Thursday, is convinced that day will come.
“I honestly really do believe, deep down, that one day we'll be on the court together again, and it'll just be like old times,” Duncan said. “We won't be worried about anything except basketball and it's going to be a great moment when it happens.”
Another health insurer will quit the Obamacare marketplace next year, leaving 19,000 Obamacare enrollees with no options in 2018.
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City announced Wednesday that it will not sell coverage on the Obamacare marketplaces next year. The plan has experienced significant losses in recent years and is scared off by the current uncertainty over the health law's future.
“Like many other health insurers across the country, we have been faced with challenges in this market,” Blue KC chief executive Danette Wilson said in a statement. “Through 2016, we have lost more than $100 million. This is unsustainable for our company. We have a responsibility to our members and the greater community to remain stable and secure, and the uncertain direction of this market is a barrier to our continued participation.”
Blue KC currently sells coverage in 32 counties in both Kansas and Missouri. Its exit will hit Missouri hardest, however, because it will leave 25 counties in the Western part of the state with no Obamacare insurers.
Cynthia Cox with the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that the area has about 19,000 Obamacare enrollees.
The Affordable Care Act doesn't have a back-up plan for this situation. There is nothing in the law that compels health insurance plans to participate in the marketplaces. States can take action to increase participation. Nevada, for example, requires health insurers who want to bid on Medicaid contracts to sell marketplace coverage, too.
It's possible that another health plan could sign up to sell coverage in the area. This scenario recently played out in Tennessee: After Humana's exit from Obamacare left 16 counties surrounding Knoxville with no health plans, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee decided it would cover that area.
But it's also possible that no insurer will show up. The nonprofit Blue plans have, so far, been the marketplaces' backbone. They tend to be the insurers who turn up to sell coverage in the areas no for-profit insurer wants. The fact that it's the Blue Cross plan quitting the Missouri market and leaving parts of it bare is a worrisome sign for the state, suggesting there are fewer health plans left to save the day.

Labour is promising to save money for rail commuters by changing the way fare increases are calculated.
The party says the move would save an average rail season ticket holder £349 a year by 2022.
It said the change could be funded by the "absolute fortune" saved by bringing the railways back into public ownership.
But the Tories said nationalisation would add billions to the UK's debt or lead to an increase in taxes.
"It's yet more economic shambles from Labour," a spokesperson said.
Labour's plan for ticket prices would apply to regulated fares, which account for about 40% of all fares, including most season tickets.
These are currently capped at the retail price index (RPI) measure of inflation, and Labour says it instead uses the lower consumer price index (CPI) rate.
Its pledge would apply in England, as the setting of regulated fares is devolved.
Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald told BBC Breakfast the "very significant difference" between the two measures would have a "huge impact".
Once the network returned to public ownership, Labour would "start exploring a reduction in fares", they said.
Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, representing train operators, said politicians had to decide on the balance between taxpayers and passengers funding the railways.
They defended the current franchising model, saying it had led to a £2.2bn improvement in rail finances.
The Conservative are promising what they call the "largest investment in railways since Victorian times", focusing on increasing capacity on key routes.
When it comes to programming there are rules. Those rules fall into two types. The first are those that you should not break, because if you do the compiler will cry or things will explode spectacularly (possibly exaggeration) at run time. The other rules are more akin to folklore; they're the rules you don't often learn from a book or a course, but from one of those people who've been around the traps for a while when you're first cutting your teeth as a career developer.
Some Rules You Don't Break
One of the rules you'll hear is "don't divide by zero". Now that's a rule you don't want to mess with, because dividing by zero doesn't work. A division by zero error resulted in the the Cruiser USS Yorktown being left without propulsion. Rules like this are there because they tell you how it is. You don't break those rules because there's no point in it.
Don't write to an unassigned pointer: it's self explanatory. Bad things are likely to result, the best result is your code doesn't do what your expect it to (ok, you might get super lucky and write somewhere useful such as the exact memory location you wanted to, but the odds aren't on your side).
Some You Do (Carefully)
Some rules are there because conventional wisdom suggests they're a good thing, but plenty of these rules can be broken if you're in control. Any good software development course will tell you to check the length of input versus the size of the buffer assigned to receive it (language dependent of course). Buffer overflows are bad ju ju. They're rarer these days as we've moved up through layers of abstraction and have more friendly languages, but despite it's rampaging efforts to become ubiquitous, JavaScript is not the only language around and these issues do still occur in places they shouldn't because people have neglected to protect against them.
I've got C code that only accepts ASCII information into fixed length char arrays. Some of it I wrote in the last year. Make no mistake, these are horrible coding practices.
I leave this code in a 'dangerous' state because I'm aware of the run-time conditions that are imposed on the program. For starters, it runs on an Atari, and secondly I don't think anyone other than me is ever going to run it. I'm happy not to spend time coding for error conditions that I can avoid through knowledge of how the system works. So in my personal use scenario, breaking this particular rule is fine, but I'd definitely rework the code if I expected it to get used by others.
So What About goto ?
"Do not use goto " is the one rule just about every programmer has heard of, and many, many people abide by it because they've been told that to use it is bad, and if they use it they're a bad programmer. Bad. Don't be Bad. goto is bad.
I'm pretty confident Randall would use a goto when appropriate
That's often the gist of it. There may be a smattering of hyperbole here but you get the idea. The thing that bugs me is that that people tend to not know why it's bad. You know what? That's bad.
I've seen people come out with all kinds of reasons as to why it's bad... one reason I've seen online claimed that it's 'inefficient' at the hardware level, which makes little sense because a goto is what the hardware does when your various high-level control statements are compiled down and assembled.
The primary reason that it's considered bad is because it makes it far too easy for the flow of a program to become almost incomprehensible. With a nest of goto statements reading code suddenly becomes far harder, and as a result maintaining it does likewise. For instance, even though this is akin to what you'd write in assembly, I'd never say that this code:
void function(int param1, int param2) { if(param1 < param2) goto reverse; printf("%i
", param1 - param2); goto end; reverse: printf("%i
", param2 - param1); end:; }
is as clean, and as easy to parse as this code:
void function(int param1, int param2) { if(param1 < param2) printf("%i
", param2 - param1); else printf("%i
", param1 - param2); }
I don't think there's a single developer on the planet that would claim it is either, and this is just a very trivial case of 'spaghetti' code.
Goto does have it's uses though, for example it provides the most elegant (in terms of code complexity and speed) way out of a nested loop for instance:
int i = 0, j = 0; for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { for(int j = 0; j < 10; j++) { if(someArray[i][j] == 42) { goto done; } } } done:
And you can also use it to ensure that some code is always executed, for the sake of cleaning up or similar (yes this is similar to try/catch/finally):
someBigFunction(int p1, int p2) { if(someError) goto cleanUp; // do some work if(someOtherError) goto cleanUp; // do more work cleanUp: // do some work that should happen regardless success }
This is not to say that in the real world there may be better opportunities to restructure your code and find a way not to use these methods: often there will be, and a good developer should always be looking for ways to refactor and improve the maintainability of code as they go.
I once worked on a commercial game that included a single goto call and it was used (if I recall correctly) to allow the player to restart a match (it was a sports title) at any point. At some point somebody—and I have no idea who because this code went through at least 10 iterations of released titles—decided a goto was the best way to implement that feature. More than a few of us attempted to remove it over the years, but nobody was ever successful in getting things to work correctly without it, and frankly, it was at some level a neat way to solve that problem.
So What, Break All the Rules?
The point I'm trying to convey is this:
You should not simply follow rules without understanding them. If somebody tells you that a technique is bad and shouldn't be used, ask them why.
Understanding why certain rules exist will make you far more rounded as a developer than someone who blindly follows and repeats them, and often with programming learning the details turns out to be far more interesting than not doing so.
CHICAGO (CBS) — An elderly woman was confronted on the Magnificent Mile by a mob of young men on Wednesday, who proceeded to take $100,000 worth of jewelry they were wearing.
A Chicago police source said the 69-year-old woman from Homewood Flossmoor was accosted by 10 to 12 African American men while walking in the 700 block of North Michigan around noon in front of Saks Fifth Avenue.
They threatened to beat them if they didn't give them their purse and jewelry.
They took off their jewelry, valued at around $100,000, and handed it to them.
“Right away, one took my purse, and then the other one said, ‘Either you take off your jewelry or I will,'” the victim tells CBS 2's Suzanne Le Mignot. “I'm a little lady, and they were big.”
According to police, the woman had a leaf-shaped pin they were wearing that was encrusted with diamonds and surrounded by black onyx. That alone was valued at $50,000.
The men involved were between 18 and 19 years-old. They were wearing baggy pants and dreads. They ran northbound on Rush towards Chicago Avenue to escape.
There was also a second incident at 1 p.m., in front of 800 N. Michigan, involving three female African-Americans and one male African-American who stole an iPhone from someone. Those suspects were taken into custody.
Charges had not yet been filed.
As an edible nut producing species the Brazil nut tree is inextricably linked to the pristine rainforest in which they can found. One demonstration of this is the manner in which the flowers of the tree have evolved in conjunction with other insect and mammal species that are harboured in the rainforest.
Brazil nut trees flower during the dry season through to the wet season, with peak flowering occurring in October, November and December (Mori, 1992). During this period the tree produces large flowers that bloom and fall to the forest floor in a daily cycle. This daily bloom provides a short window of opportunity for the flowers to be pollinated (Mori & Prance, 1990).
The flowers can only be pollinated by large-bodied bees that are strong enough to pry open the flower hood and feast on the nectar within. These bees are known as Euglossine or orchid bees, and are characterised by their large tongues and main habitat of undisturbed forest (Mori & Prance, 1990).
These bees do not lend themselves to manipulation by humans, which may explain why fruit producing Brazil nut trees have not been successful grown in plantations or without the natural forest surrounding them (Soldan, 2003; Mori 1992). Another theory to explain why the trees are difficult to pollinate out with the natural forest is that the bees cannot reproduce without the rainforest around them. It is thought that the bees derive particular chemicals from certain forest dwelling orchids. These chemicals give a special color to the male bees' wings; this in turn makes them more attractive to the female bees and allows them to reproduce.
After the bees have pollinated the flowers, it can take up to and beyond 12 months for the fruits to develop (Ortiz, 2002; Wadt, et al., 2005). The fruit that is produced is an extremely hard spherical pod encasing between 10 and 25 large seeds or edible Brazil nuts (Haugaasen & Haugassen, 2010). As the rainy season progresses the mature seed pods (called “cocos” by the collectors), fall all the way from the tree canopy to the forest floor. Larger seed pods can weigh up to 2.5 kilos (Mori & Prance, 1990), so as a safety measure the nut collectors avoid the collection areas until the majority of the “cocos” are on the ground.
In the height of the rainy season when the most of the “cocos” have fallen, the collection season begins in Pando, Beni and Acre.

We may idealize youth, but there's a good chance we've got it all wrong — some researchers believe we're happiest in our later years, after a dip in middle age begins to reverse itself around 50. By the time you hit 85, according to one study, odds are you'll feel better about your situation than you did at 18.
There are a few perks to this stage of life than often go unsung. Yes, the wisdom and the discounts and the life satisfaction are probably pretty nice. But so, I bet, is the ability to be cranky in public and have people find it charming. The shoes get much more comfortable, too. And then there's the matter of your social circle: As we age, we tend to cull the number of people we hang out with — we become less socially active overall, but more likely to spend our socializing time on people we're close to, rather than casual acquaintances or throwaway friendships.
And so, according to a study published last week in Current Biology, do monkeys. When the authors observed a group of Barbary macaques at a French wildlife park, ranging from age 4 to age 29 — which, one researcher told the New York Times, translates to around 105 in human years — they noticed that starting at around age 20, the monkeys became less likely to groom, play with, approach, or generally engage in social contact with the other animals.
One way that psychologists have explained our narrowing social circles is something called socio-emotional selectivity theory: the idea that as we age, we become more aware that our time is fleeting, and thus more determined to spend it on our most meaningful relationships. But that explanation doesn't account for why monkeys — who likely don't contemplate their own mortality — exhibit the same behavior. “I don't think monkeys have any awareness of their death, so if there are any changes in their behavior, they're obviously not to do with that,” Dario Maestripieri, a biologist at the University of Chicago, told New Scientist. “Maybe we would behave similarly even if we had no awareness of our own death.”
An alternative explanation, the study authors speculated to the Times, may be that the monkeys may become more risk-averse with age, less willing to take chances on unfamiliar peers. Or perhaps they're just more easily exhausted by socializing, and so stick to the most comfortable, least effortful relationships.
Regardless of the reason, though, the fact that we share this distinct pattern with our primate cousins suggests that the reasons may be more biological than social. “Our behaviors that seem very much the result of our deliberation and choice,” study author Alexandra Freund, a developmental psychologist at the University of Zurich, told the Times, “might be more similar to our primate ancestors than we might think.” New Scientist also highlighted these similarities in a video titled “Is Your Grandma Like an Old Monkey?” — a question worth asking, but maybe not a comparison you want to bring up to Grandma herself. At this age, she's earned some respect.
The United States, by all indications, will soon become a belligerent in Syria's civil war. The Syrian government's alleged use of chemical weapons to kill hundreds crossed a redline that U.S. President Barack Obama claimed a year ago would be the game changer, and the game for Washington, London, and Paris has clearly changed. Yet one thing has not: the international law governing when states may use force.
That is not to suggest that government lawyers won't eventually try to offer some sort of legal benediction. News coverage suggests that administration officials are pushing them to do just that. And the lawyers will want to be helpful, particularly if the policy consensus for force is strong and the evidence for the regime's responsibility for the attacks is beyond reproach.
But they should also be clear: It is the lawyers' duty to provide their clients -- senior U.S. officials -- with legal, not moral, advice and counsel. The lawyers' remit is not to say whether attacking Syria is the right thing to do, but to state what the law is, explain the positions adopted by the United States in similar circumstances in the past, and predict what the legal and institutional consequences of law-breaking might be.
So what is the law? The black-letter law on the use of force is quite simple: Under the United Nations Charter, the central treaty of the modern era and largely the handiwork of the United States and its World War II allies, states are generally prohibited from using force against other states unless they are acting in individual or collective self-defense or pursuant to an authorization of the UN Security Council. Over the post-war history of the charter, self-defense claims have proven most controversial. States -- especially the United States -- have sought to expand the situations that fall under the definition of self-defense.
But a case for self-defense in Syria would break the concept of self-defense beyond recognition. What concerns
The cost of policing the Dakota Access pipeline protests in North Dakota has surpassed $22 million — an amount that would fund the state Treasury Department for two decades and $5 million more than the state set aside last year.
Protest-related funding decisions will be made by state lawmakers during the 2017 session. Leaders of the House and Senate appropriation committees say more funding will be approved, though the amount and method isn't known.
Rep. Jeff Delzer says state officials also still hope the federal government will help with funding.
"We're not happy at all that the federal government is not ponying up. This should be their responsibility," said Rep. Jeff Delzer, R-Underwood, chairperson of the House Appropriations Committee. "But the fact of the matter is, until they pony up we have to cover those costs."
A large encampment in southern North Dakota swelled to thousands of opponents of the four-state, $3.8 billion project over the summer, and then-Gov. Jack Dalrymple issued an emergency declaration in August to cover law enforcement expenses related to protests. There have been nearly 600 arrests in the region since August, but the encampment has shrunk since Dec. 4, when the Army said study is needed on alternative locations for the pipeline to cross a Missouri River reservoir, as well as study on the potential for a leak and tribal treaty rights.
The Standing Rock Sioux and its supporters believe the project, which is to carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois, threatens drinking water and Native American cultural sites, which Texas-based developer Energy Transfer Partners denies.
State-related enforcement costs have surpassed $20 million, with agencies such as the Corrections Department and Transportation Department using money from their own budgets with the intent of repaying it later, according to Emergency Services spokesperson Cecily Fong. Morton County, where most of the protest activity has taken place, has another $2.5 million in costs not covered by the state, bringing the total cost to taxpayers to nearly $22.5 million. Most of the money is going to pay personnel costs.
Fong said legislation to provide money for the continued law enforcement response might include a funding ceiling, but Sen. Ray Holmberg, R-Grand Forks, chairperson of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said they think that's unlikely.
"I don't think we will put an artificial cap on the protection of our citizens," they said.

Leaving America: An Ezekiel Elliott Story.
Ezekiel Elliott is out at least the next four weeks, until a Dec. 1 court date, and could serve the entire six games of their suspension and sit until Christmas Eve.
In the meantime, the Dallas Cowboys running back is jetting out of the country, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Sunday on NFL GameDay Morning.
"So what is on the docket for Zeke Elliott himself? I am told they are leaving the country to an undisclosed location to completely reset, clear their head, train, and come back in late December for the Cowboys in the best shape they have been in," Rapoport said.
Zeke's ability to stay in shape is a sneaky under-the-radar storyline to their suspension. The running back has famously taken a few weeks in each of their first two NFL seasons to get into game-shape, not rounding into full form until after a few games.
Elliott and the Cowboys' run game has hit high gear since Week 4, averaging 183.4 rushing YPG as a team over the last four contests, most in the NFL. Elliott has averaged 126.5 yards per game over that span, including Week 8's 150-yard explosion versus the Redskins.
The 5-3 Cowboys currently sit at seventh place in the NFC. We expect Dak Prescott to keep Dallas in the playoff hunt until Elliott returns. However, the Cowboys won't have a few weeks for the running back to get back in gear once the suspension is over.
To make sure they stay in shape and off the back page of the tabloids, Elliott's managers are getting out of the country.

Ivan and I does NOT know what program they made for the graphics in their videos (Motion? After Effects?), so we both implemented a .psd file here for them to download and use. Yes, it's broken down into LAYERS, so it's easy for them to work with.Now if only Joe Stevens can film new episodes of The Equestria Inquirer(because 1080p footage "is good for health"!)
Clove UK has announced a price drop for the Nokia Lumia 800 in UK.
The handset, which was released in November 2011, price dropped by Â£40 to Â£265 excluding VAT and Â£318 with VAT tax included.
Clove notes while the fairly popular 16 GB handset will not be getting the Windows Phone 8 update, it will still benefit from the Windows Phone 7.8 update presumably later this year.
The handset of course comes with the excellent Nokia Drive app, which will also be included with Windows Phone 8, Nokia Music, which is a completely free streaming music app, numerous free and low Nokia exclusive apps and will receive many apps which will offer alternatives to the Windows Phone 8 features, such as data counters, still to come, making the handset a pretty good deal if you do not mind not having the (expensive) latest greatest.

I've returned from my short break to a world that looks pretty messy - and (very sorry) I am suffering from a degree of trepidation at the start of the new school term (and that's not just because of my beloved Arsenal's traditionally erratic start to the new season).
Let's start with a bit of cheery news: Japan is showing signs of breaking free from two decades of stagnation in pay; wages in July rose at their fastest pace for more than 17 years, and they have been increasing for five months.
Just maybe Japan's pernicious deflationary pressures are easing.
But that may be a new version of Japanese exceptionalism, because the same cannot be said of a far more important market for British firms - the eurozone, where deflationary pressures remain a concern.
The German and Italian economies are shrinking, and France is flat-lining (in case of interest, I am making a documentary about whether France can ever again afford "le good life").
Unemployment remains hideously, intractably high - 11.5% for the eurozone as a whole.
And the nature of the eurozone's latest malaise makes it less amenable than hitherto to short-term fixes.
Or, to put it another way, when the eurozone was on the brink of fracture and Armageddon three years ago, it could be salvaged by a European Central Bank promising to flood broken banks with cheap money.
Eurozone banks remain damaged. But the eurozone's problems have matured (ahem) and are now rather less due to the hobbled nature of the banking system - as the European Central Bank's president Mario Draghi made clear in their gloomy tour d'horizon at the annual Jackson Hole shindig of central bankers a few days ago.
If businesses and consumers aren't investing and spending enough across the Channel, part of that - in countries like Italy - is that the cost of bank finance remains a bit elevated.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Francois Hollande shares a lighter moment with Mario Draghi
But the more fundamental and important problem is that animal spirits are depressed: households won't spend because they fear for their livelihoods and businesses won't invest because they don't have confidence that demand for their goods and services is on a sustainable rising path.
What is required, as Draghi implied, are reforms of labour and product markets in Italy and France, to make their economies more flexible and competitive, and a government-induced stimulus in Germany.
Neither look very likely right now: Mrs Merkel in Germany still does not wish to bail out other countries seen as profligate; governments in Italy and France hate the politics of shrinking the state and attacking entrenched working practices.
What's more the European Union's stand off with President Putin over their military support for separatists in Eastern Ukraine raises the spectre of a winter of uncertain EU access to vital supplies of Russian gas and a complete hiatus in Russian buying from the EU.
None of which is to say that the European Central Bank has been completely neutered. But it does mean that further details it will give of plans to cut the cost of money at its monthly press conference on Thursday are just more pain suppressors - they aren't any kind of fundamental cure for the euro area.
This tension, between what's good for the global economy and domestic political imperatives, seems as pernicious as ever.
This rubric may to some extent explain Putin's apparent desire to rebuild a Greater Russia: are their forays in Ukraine an attempt to shift attention away from a failure to channel the income from vast energy wealth into modernising the economy and improving its capacity to deliver rising living standards?
In China, an economic slowdown caused by the imperative of tackling a dangerous debt bubble - what I've discussed in this column as the important third-phase of global rebalancing - has not made the government any more tolerant of a hunger in some parts, especially Hong Kong, for greater economic freedoms.
And if the conflict between the authorities and Hong Kong protesters were to intensify, that would not be happy for any of us (I am making the assumption here, which not everyone accepts, that democracy is a firmer base for rising prosperity than autocracy).
As for hideous conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Israel, Gaza and Libya, the whole of the Middle East looks perilously close to the worst conflagration in living memory. And if that doesn't lead to higher energy prices and a general sense of unease that undermines economic activity, then history is no reliable guide at all.
None of which means that the great British and American economic revivals are dead yet.
But it does suggest that the momentum of growth will have to continue to be largely provided by consumption and domestic demand, rather than accelerating exports and investment.
And in the case of the UK in particular, that would yield a rather shorter date to the end of this rapid phase of recovery - because (and you really don't need me to tell you this) neither indebted UK consumers and a high-borrowing British government have the wherewithal to spend as if there's no tomorrow (we tried that; it wasn't an especially happy experience).
What RPG Fans Have Been Saying
"...this game really took me by surprise. Its fantastic and has real potential."
"...it reminds me of Eye of the Beholder, Dungeon Master etc... I love it. Brings back memories."
"One word ---- Awesome"
About the Game
4.5 out of 5 stars - MeAndMyDroid.com
Deadly Dungeons is a first person Android RPG developed exclusively for the Android platform. This Android RPG is influenced by classic dungeon crawler games such as Dungeon Hack, Eye of the Beholder, and Nethack. Your purchase supports indie games development.
After being separated from your adventuring party, you must navigate a deadly dungeon, and fight your way through hordes of creatures in a desperate attempt to escape alive. What first begins as a simple escape to the surface turns into a fight for survival, a confrontation with an ancient evil, and a descent to hell itself.
Deadly Dungeons Android RPG features several difficulty levels. Casual, an easy mode that features a god-mode that allows you to play through the game quickly without fear of dying.

There's a theory in psychology called the “hedonic treadmill” which says that most people have a happiness “set point” that they return to pretty much regardless of what happens to them. Things that you might expect to make someone very happy (winning the lottery) or very sad (losing a limb) actually tend to not have a dramatic long term effect on a person's happiness. In other words, people are pretty resilient. Or, put another way, we're forgetful. We think how how happy we would be if we got a big raise and how much easier our lives would be with a bit more money in our pocket. And we get the raise and some things do get easier. But pretty quickly we forget how life was before and how happy we are supposed to be now. The new becomes the status quo, we find a new set of things to worry about, and we end up about as happy as we were before.
However most of us don't get raises or experience any other big life changes often enough to get a real sense of the power of the hedonic treadmill. To get a dramatic demonstration of this phenomenon in action, all you need to do is spend two years of your life working on a book, have it published, and then obsess over the hourly updates to its Amazon Sales Rank. (The Sales Rank is the number Amazon attaches to every book it sells. Better Sales Ranks mean more sales and—more important—a book's Sales Rank is the only readily accessible, frequently updated data an author has about how a book is selling.)
You finish your book and start paying some attention to its Sales Rank. It's still in the high 100,000s, or even the millions. Whatever. No one but your parents has even heard of your book yet, let alone bought it. Then you get some word of mouth going on the web which gets you a few pre-orders and your Sales Rank spikes up a bit, maybe into the 2,000s. Woohoo! Party!
Then it starts drifting back down. Oh well, the book's not even out yet, no big deal. But you dream of maybe one day breaking into the top-1000. That sounds pretty cool. Imagine, one of the top-1000 books on Amazon! They sell essentially every book in print; what's that ten million books or so? Top-1000 would put you in the top 0.1% of all books. That'd be awesome.
Then some early reviews hit the web. Maybe they get some play on the social networking sites. Wow! Sales Rank goes shooting up—past 1,000, into the 500s. Yippee! And the book isn't even out yet! Who knows how it'll do once it's actually released. Then, once again, the rank starts drifting back down. You feel a bit sad when it starts dropping but pretty soon the days of a 500s-level rank feel like a bit of a dream; anything better than 10,000 is still quite respectable. The decline continues and pretty soon it's closer to 100,000 than 10,000, but no matter. Hitting the 500s is pretty darn good and the book still isn't even out yet.
Then a review on a very prominent web site sends the rank rocketing back up. In a few hours it goes from greater than 100,000 to the 500s. And keeps going! Smashes the old high-water mark! Holy cannoli, it's in the top-200! #178! Wow, that feels awesome. You never thought this could happen. And surely the book won't have its best rank ever before it's even out. Maybe it's not crazy to dream of getting into the top-100, even if just for an hour.
Then the downward drift starts again. But not too fast. It's hanging out safely in the top-2,000 for a while before dipping down into the 3,000s. And it rallies occasionally into the 1,500 to 2,000 range. Really, if it keeps on like this, this is great. An average sustained Sales Rank better than 10,000 is pretty darn respectable. And that #178 is something you can tell your grand-kids about.
Then the book is released. Whether because of a burst of word of mouth or the publisher's PR actually working or because there are just a lot of people who wait for the book to come out before ordering, boom! the rank is moving up again. Quick jump back into the top-1,000. 800s. 200s again! Whoa! #173. Beat the old mark! And back down. That may be it. But really, nice that that first foray into the top-200 wasn't a once-in-a-lifetime event. That's pretty good. Now, let's see how long it hangs out in the top-1000.
A few days, it turns out. Life in the top-1000 is pretty nice. Feels like this book might actually be a bit of a success. It would have been nice to crack the top-100 but this is good. Whoops, out of the top-1,000. Oh well. Still a long way to go before it falls out of the top-10,000. And look, it's rallying again. 600s, 500s, 300s, 200s. Nice! Ah, #239 and then dropping again. Anyway, at least you're back in the top-1,000 for a while. A dip out of the top-1000 then another rally back to #551.
Then much like before. Drifts down. It takes a couple days to fall out of the top-1,000 and then bounces around a bit between 1,000 and 1,500. Maybe the glory days of #173 and #178 are past but if the book just keeps steadily selling, that's what's important.
Then, one night before you go to bed, you see the book has been mentioned on another prominent web site. You wonder if that could possibly pop it back up into the top-200 again. That'd be nice. Maybe, just maybe, you still have a chance to crack the top-100. Something to dream about as you go to sleep.
Get up in the morning. Coffee. Check the ranks your computer has collected overnight. Holy smokes. It cracked the top-100 right after you went to bed! And it's still there! At #22! In fact it's been at #22 for three hours. Holy shit! Quick, email your folks! Wait, wait, new rank coming in: #16! Okay, this day is clearly going to be a total loss—you're not going to be able to do anything until it starts going back down and you can relax. Sales Ranks are supposed to be updated every hour but that doesn't mean they necessarily change every hour. So, a couple hours at #16. Wow—it's holding its ground. Then, wait, wait, wait—#9. And #9 again the next hour! #8! #7! You have the #7 ranked book on all of Amazon! Only five books between you and Dan Brown's new novel.
Finally it drops back down to #8 and hangs out there for a few hours. Then #9. Then #10. Hey, at least you're still in the top-10. Finally you drop out of that. But you're still in the top-25 which puts you on the first page of Amazon best sellers. So that's cool. Anyway, you spent a day and a half in the top-10. A couple days later you drop out of the top-25 and the next day out of the top-50. But what the heck, you made it into the top-10. Who ever figured on that? At the moment you're still in the top 100, hanging on in the 90s. You know it'll drift back down. Will it hang out in the top-1000 for a while. Probably. Will you be sad when, inevitably, it falls out of top-1000. Probably not. Life on the hedonic treadmill.

Along with a friend of McCarthy's Rob Griffiths, they decided to use rugby league to encourage children to do well at school and also thought they may discover some playing talent.
McCarthy, who was vice-captain of the Ireland team in the 2013 World Cup, said the idea for The Full Blood Project came from a meeting upon their return Africa from with Nigel Scott and Tom Whitehead, who had been delivering volunteer projects in Fiji.
"The aim of the project is to deliver a sports program, which is primarily rugby league, to the kids out there. Once we get them engaged we want to try and educate them on social issues and obviously over there health is a big one. There is such a spread of malaria and stuff like that."
"Seeing photos of the team in the village we visited is probably the most excited I have ever been about something that I am not actually doing," McCarthy said. "We left a bit of money there for the coaches who we upskilled to carry on doing the rugby after we left and they bought a piece of land, levelled it out and made a field, so this year we raised some money for some multi-sport posts they can use for football as well as rugby league. The original goal was to give these kids an opportunity, whether they are rugby league players or sprinters, where they can get picked up and if we can show a video of a kid playing you never know but over the course of time it has slightly changed and the purpose of the project is to motivate them and show them the importance of education."

While playing for the Northern Pride in 2014, McCarthy worked as a development officer in schools and they scored the winning try in the Queensland Cup premiers' 32-28 defeat of Penrith in the inaugural State Championship final at ANZ Stadium.
The 27-year-old returned to England this season to join Hull KR and played in the Challenge Cup final at Wembley but a phone call from Demetriou told them there may be an opportunity at St George Illawarra and after speaking with former Warrington teammate Mike Cooper they decided to move to Wollongong. "Jason got in touch and said the Dragons were talking about me, and a few days later I spoke to Paul McGregor and then Coops followed up with a phone call just to tell me about the club and the opportunity," McCarthy said. "It was pretty late in the year but playing in the NRL was always an ambition."
Hillary Clinton greets supporters during a caucus day event at Caesers Palace Feb. 20, in Las Vegas. | Getty Clinton campaign hires rapid-response spokesperson
Hillary Clinton's communications staff in Brooklyn is growing.
The campaign has hired Adrienne Watson as a rapid-response spokesperson.
Story Continued Below
Watson, who started work in Brooklyn on Monday, will continue from within the campaign the work they had been doing from an affiliated outside group — they previously served as communications director for Correct the Record, the David Brock-led super PAC that coordinates with the campaign and responds to attacks from Bernie Sanders and the Republican field. At Clinton headquarters, Watson joins another Correct the Record alumnus, Adrienne Elrod, who now oversees Clinton's surrogate operation as director of strategic communications and surrogates.
The cramped Brooklyn headquarters is getting more crowded as the campaign focuses on the busy March calendar and begins to grow its operation. Another recent addition to the headquarters team is Lily Adams, who served as communications director for Iowa. Adams moved from Des Moines to New York after the Iowa caucuses and now oversees the communications strategy for the March states.
Tuesday on MSNBC's “Morning Joe,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), a U.S. Army veteran of both Iraq and Afghanistan, commended President Donald Trump for their selection of U.S. Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster as their National Security Adviser.
“I want to commend the president for picking General McMaster as a national security adviser,” Cotton said. “It reflects great credit on him, as does their entire national security cabinet. General McMaster has been a legendary officer in the Army for 20 years. They fought one of the decisive battles in the Gulf War. They were one of the very first commanders in the Second Iraq War to bring counterinsurgency into the fight, almost two years before the surge in 2007. He's an unorthodox thinker. He's never marched to the beat of the Army drum, so to speak.”
“In 2006 and 2007, General McMaster was passed over for a promotion from colonel to one star,” they continued. “And I and many other lieutenants and captains at the time were very discouraged by that. I actually submitted my resignation papers in part because of the way the Army had treated General McMaster. Now ultimately I withdrew those and had the opportunity to deploy to Afghanistan. But Bob Gates recognized just what a great leader General McMaster was, and they actually recalled David Petraeus from Iraq in the middle of the war to sit on a promotion panel that ultimately gave General McMaster their first star.”

By one measure, the music industry hasn't been this bad in 25 years. As Billboard reports, album sales for the first six months of the year were their lowest since SoundScan (now Nielsen Music) started keeping track in 1991. Overall, U.S. album sales dropped to 100.3 million—a 13.6% drop compared with the same 2015 time period. However, Billboard estimates revenue has climbed 8.9% to $1.98 billion so far in 2016, though it notes some indie labels have said those estimates overstate income from streaming. That rise is partly due to streaming, which jumped 58.7% to 208.9 billion songs.
Drake's VIEWS racked up 1.3 million album sales in the first half of the year. VIEWS also notched 317,000 track-equivalent albums (TEA, where an album unit equals 10 track sales). And it stacked up 979,000 stream-equivalent albums (SEA, where one album unit equals 1,500 streams).
Elsewhere, David Bowie's Blackstar is 2016's top-selling vinyl album so far, with almost 57,000 copies sold. Compared with the first six months of 2015, vinyl sales grew 11.4% to 6.2 million copies. CD sales tumbled 11.6% to 40 million and digital album sales slid 18% to 43.8 million.
Pitchfork has reached out to Nielsen for further data.

Sheboygan, WI – Randal Schaal and Kelly Winter weren't too pleased when they found out their 14-year-old daughter had surreptitiously opened up a Myspace account. Not pleased at all. As a matter of fact, they were so pissed off, they spanked that little whippersnapper real good. According to the arrest report, Kelly found the child's account and confronted them The child denied the page was hers. No matter – when Randal got home, they checked out the web page and “freaked out.” The girl told officers that Randal held them down on the ground and spanked them real hard about 20 times. When they tried to get away, Randal allegedly kicked the child in the left hip, said something about “making it even” before kicking them in the right hip. The child said their mother then grabbed them by the hair, pushed their head into the wall, and asked, “What does it feel like to have both your parents beat on you?” Damn. Overreact much? A spanking? At 14? I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume that Randal may have some issues with anger.
Randal Schaal was charged with felony child abuse and Kelly Winter was cited for disorderly conduct and released. If convicted, Randal faces up to three years in prison.

The LG G3 case leaks continue with a Spigen Slim Armor case. Among the many promo images for the new protective case are a couple that give the exact dimensions of the case. Using that as reference, we calculated the size of the LG G3.
Here's a table of how the upcoming flagship compares to its direct competition and last year's model.
If the numbers pan out (and after the impressive LG G2 design, we're optimistic), the LG G3 will be virtually the same size as the Samsung Galaxy S5, but with 0.4" larger screen diagonal. That would give it around 16% more screen surface area, not accounting for the on-screen buttons.
The LG G3 is shaping up to be an absolute beast. That 5.5" screen will have QHD resolution (1,440 x 2,560 pixels), the phone will be powered by a Snapdragon 801 chipset and will have a 13MP OIS camera with 2160p video capture. There's talk of water resistance too. The expected price is 610 for the 16GB model (with microSD slot this time around).
That's all according to rumors, of course, the official announcement should take place in a week on May 27.

Jed W. Atkins , Cicero on Politics and the Limits of Reason: The Republic and Laws. Cambridge classical studies. Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press , 2013 . Pp. xiv, 270 . ISBN 9781107043589 . $95.00.
Preview
Recently James Zetzel, in their chapter in The Cambridge Companion to Cicero, noted that ‘Cicero's political theory has been discussed very little in English until fairly recently and there is still no satisfactory full-length treatment of De re publica...'. 1 Atkins' elegant and probing analysis in this monograph, the recasting of a 2009 Cambridge PhD thesis, goes a very long way to filling that gap.
Its focus is not simply De republica; that work is considered alongside De legibus. After a brief Introduction, largely dedicated to indicating the monograph's contents, chapter one (‘Reading the Republic') surveys the basic problems which face a reader, particularly one who comes from contemporary political philosophy, in reading this work: the role of Cicero and their relationship to Scipio; the use of dialogue form; and the grounding of philosophical activity in a firmly Roman context. It concludes by suggesting that ‘it is a helpful rule of interpretation to conceive of the dialogue as a cooperative investigation' (p.42). Chapter two, ‘The dream of Scipio and the science of politics', tackles a major speed-bump head-on: what on earth is the dream of Scipio doing in the work? Atkins outlines the peculiar reception history which has made, and continues to make, attractive a discrete engagement with this part of the work, before suggesting an alternative. Scipio's dream fits because it revisits the role of reason in political theory and practice. The cosmos is rational, but humans are not: the contrast indicates why De republica rejects ideal states for Roman reality, and opens up space for the politician, or statesman, to contribute to the beneficial running of a state. In chapter three, 'Constitutional change and the mixed constitution' (arguably the most important in the monograph), the focus is on the mixed constitution. Atkins takes this apparently familiar concept and, through meticulous and probing analysis, demonstrates the gulf between Polybius and Cicero in their use of the mixed constitution. They show how Cicero rejects Polybius' understanding of human nature as predictably and rationally motivated by fear in favour of one in which humans can be and are motivated by the benefits and advantages of associating with one another in political communities. At the same time, De republica does not locate the stability of the mixed constitution in a system of checks and balances, as Polybius does, but instead in its capacity to moderate unrestrained desire for liberty among the citizen body.
Chapter four, ‘Political Society and Citizens' rights' sets up De republica as an introduction to De legibus by considering the legal framework that Cicero seems to invoke in the earlier work. Atkins argues that the concept of rights can be traced in De republica and, importantly, that these citizen rights are distinct from and can be asserted against the position given to them by those who govern. Thus the Roman people can make a claim, usually for freedom, against the res publica. (It's a pity that very close publication dates mean that Atkins is not here in dialogue with the work of Valentina Arena ( see BMCR 2013.08.51); that will in due course be an interesting conversation). Atkins notes, too, the way that nature is apparently absent from De republica, permitting Scipio to avoid the problem of how non-ideal states can claim legitimacy. That issue comes to the forefront in chapter five, ‘Natural Law', which explores the philosophical history of this concept in De legibus, concluding that its first book offers a reasonably orthodox Stoic account of natural law. The crunch point is chapter six, ‘Legislation for the best practicable regime', where Atkins offers a delicately nuanced interpretation of De legibus' approach to the misfit between written law in any particular state and the universal claims of natural law. Some neat close-reading underscores Atkins' claim that Cicero was well aware of the problem. A conclusion offers some observations on other modern readings of these two works.
Atkins' attempt to offer a sustained reading of these two dialogues as serious contributions to political philosophy is, to a very large extent, a great success. They deftly analyse Cicero's positions within the existing philosophical framework, showing not only the extent to which they differ from Plato, Aristotle and their successors but also explaining why those differences are interesting and productive. In addition, their alertness to Cicero's ability as a writer enables them to relate structure to argument in consistently productive ways: so, for example, the discussion of astronomy (49-56) as a flawed analogy for politics which shows why the discussion in the first book of De republica begins where it does. It's true that they want Cicero to be a good writer of political philosophy, an assumption which may be prior to the arguments we find here; by and large the assumption pays off, but the monograph does raise questions which perhaps point to a less consistent and less effective Cicero. One feature of the monograph that struck me was how distant Cicero frequently feels; although there is a lot of detailed discussion of individual passages, the process of forming a coherent argument takes the author, and reader, a long way from the Ciceronian texts. In part of course this is due to their fragmentary state, but not entirely. Making sense of Cicero in terms of contemporary political thought does involve a lot of rewriting and recasting, and we shouldn't lose sight of that gap: whatever De republica and De legibus were initially intended to achieve, it involved a rather different conceptualisation of talking about one's community than we have. In this connection, it's perhaps a pity that Atkins did not bring De oratore into their argument to a greater extent. That work offers us an example, in a text which we have complete, of Cicero's approach to structuring and formulating a complex argument across a number of books and between a number of interlocutors. Fox's analysis of De oratore as a text which evades fixity could offer a stimulating counter to Atkins' approach; 2 for all Atkins' skill as a close reader and their alertness to Cicero's own sceptical moves, this monograph feels fairly dogmatic in its final interpretative positions.
Atkins notes that (6-7) that these treatises were being written alongside major political change and a transformation, at the hands of a large number of intellectuals and writers, of Rome's cultural landscape. Yet the implications could be pushed further. In particular, their analysis of natural and statute law – and the ways in which Cicero allows for the difference between the two – cries out for contextualisation not only in the political life of the 50s but also in Cicero's own approach to dealing with opposition. As Harries in particular has shown, the slippage from opposing Cicero to opposing the res publica to no longer being a part of the res publica happens with extraordinary frequency and consistency in Cicero's writings.3 Creating a position, as Cicero does in De legibus which permits them to judge what statute law meets the criterion of being a law, is a very important element in their ability to enforce discrimination between acceptable and unacceptable political activity; conversely, it is very tempting to see Cicero's experience of Clodius in their formulation of the relationship between natural law and what passes for law at Rome in De legibus.
The book is excellently produced and largely free from presentational errors.

Humorous Tool Definitions
Do not read this while drinking, or your beverage may go up your nose and on your keyboard. December 28, 2006
(From the WOODnetWORK Forum)
The True Definition of Tools
DRILL PRESS: A tall upright machine useful for suddenly snatching flat metal bar stock out of your hands so that it smacks you in the chest and flings your beer across the room, splattering it against that freshly-stained heirloom piece you were drying.
WIRE WHEEL: Cleans paint off bolts and then throws them somewhere under the workbench with the speed of light. Also removes fingerprints and hard-earned guitar calluses from fingers in about the time it takes you to say, "Ouch...."
ELECTRIC HAND DRILL: Normally used for spinning pop rivets in their holes
until you die of old age.
PLIERS: Used to round off bolt heads. Sometimes used in the creation of blood-blisters.
HACKSAW: One of a family of cutting tools built on the Ouija board principle. It transforms human energy into a crooked, unpredictable motion, and the more you attempt to influence its course, the more dismal your future becomes.
VISE-GRIPS: Generally used after pliers to further round off bolt heads. If nothing else is available, they can also be used to transfer intense welding heat to the palm of your hand.
OXYACETYLENE TORCH: Used almost entirely for lighting various flammable objects in your shop on fire. Also handy for igniting the grease inside the wheel hub you want the bearing race out of.
WHITWORTH SOCKETS: Once used for working on older British cars and motorcycles, they are now used mainly for impersonating that 9/16 or 1/2 socket you've been searching for the last 15 minutes.
HYDRAULIC FLOOR JACK: Used for lowering an automobile to the ground after you have installed your new brake shoes, trapping the jack handle firmly under the bumper.
EIGHT-FOOT LONG DOUGLAS FIR 2X4: Used for levering an automobile upward off of a trapped hydraulic jack handle.
TWEEZERS: A tool for removing wood splinters and wire wheel wires.
E-Z OUT BOLT AND STUD EXTRACTOR: A tool ten times harder than any known drill bit that snaps off in boltholes you couldn't use anyway.
TWO-TON ENGINE HOIST: A tool for testing the tensile strength on everything you forgot to disconnect.
CRAFTSMAN 1/2 x 16-INCH SCREWDRIVER: A large prybar that inexplicably has an accurately machined screwdriver tip on the end opposite the handle.
AVIATION METAL SNIPS: See hacksaw.
TROUBLE LIGHT: The home mechanic's own tanning booth. Sometimes called a drop light, it is a good source of vitamin D, "the sunshine vitamin," which is not otherwise found under cars at night. Health benefits aside, its main purpose is to consume 40-watt light bulbs at about the same rate that 105-mm howitzer shells might be used during, say, the first few hours of the Battle of the Bulge. More often dark than light, its name is somewhat misleading.
PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER: Normally used to stab the vacuum seals under lids and for opening old-style paper-and-tin oil cans and splashing oil on your shirt; but can also be used, as the name implies, to strip out Phillips screw heads.
AIR COMPRESSOR: A machine that takes energy produced in a coal-burning power plant 200 miles away and transforms it into compressed air that travels by hose to a Chicago Pneumatic impact wrench that grips rusty bolts which were last over tightened 50 years ago by someone at Ford, and neatly rounds off their heads.
PRY BAR: A tool used to crumple the metal surrounding that clip or bracket you needed to remove in order to replace a 50 cent part.
HOSE CUTTER: A tool used to cut hoses too short.
HAMMER: Originally employed as a weapon of war, the hammer nowadays is used as a kind of divining rod to locate the most expensive parts not far from the object we are trying to hit.
MECHANIC'S KNIFE: Used to open and slice through the contents of cardboard cartons delivered to your front door; works particularly well on contents such as seats, vinyl records, liquids in plastic bottles, collector magazines, refund checks, and rubber or plastic parts. Especially useful for slicing work clothes, but only while in use.
DAMMIT TOOL: Any handy tool that you grab and throw across the garage while yelling "DAMMIT" at the top of your lungs. It is also the next tool that you will need.
EXPLETIVE: A balm, also referred to as mechanic's lube, usually applied verbally in hindsight, which somehow eases those pains and indignities following our every deficiency in foresight.
TABLE SAW: Expensive storage surface used to store unfinished projects in garages of want-to-be cabinetmakers. Called a saw only because when turned on, it will cut and clear all contents off the table and scatter them across the garage.
Comment from contributor R:
Law of Dropped Parts: A part dropped will roll only as far as it takes to be under something low to the ground and heavy, making it hard to retrieve the part.

In 1987, Sudan's Muslim government pronounced death to all males in the Christian south: 27,000 boys fled to Ethiopia on foot. In 1991, they were forced to flee to Kenya; 12,000 survived to live in a U.N. camp in Kakuma. Archival footage documents the 1,000 mile flight; we see life in the camp.
We follow three young men who repatriate to the U.S. John Bul Dau goes to Syracuse, and by the film's end, becomes a spokesperson for the Lost Boys and Lost Girls of Sudan; Daniel Abol Pach and Panther Bior go to Pittsburgh. All work several jobs, send money back to the camp, search for relatives lost in the civil war, acclimatize to the U.S., seek an education, and miss their homeland.
AUSTRALIA'S network news war has escalated with a Nine security guard allegedly Tasered by a Seven security guard before the Socceroos first World Cup match.
Rival camera crews filmed the Fanatics' procession to Durban's Kings Park Stadium when an arm wrestle for access turned violent.
The dispute ended with Taser burns to the former British military officer hired by Channel 9 to protect staff from South African street crime.
After the crews exchanged verbal threats, Channel 7 reporter Mike Amor stepped in a bid to end the childishness.
But witnesses claim that prompted Nine's bodyguard to step in to separate the pair, only to be Tasered by Seven's guard, confirmed as an off-duty South African police officer.
While the taser strike failed to fell "Russ" (Nine's security man, who once protected one-time UN boss Kofi Annan), they sustained bruising and minor burns to their stomach.
Allison Langdon brought a working police officer to break up the crews and check the Seven security man's credentials. No charges have been laid as yet.
Nine's national news director Mark Calvert said the Tasering turned the ratings rivalry ugly.
"When I hired security for the World Cup, we had been warned about the country's crime rate and possible terrorist threats. Who would have thought we'd need protection from a Channel 7 crew?" Mr Calvert said yesterday.
With a nod to comments by Seven news boss Peter Meakin last week, when they threatened to "shoot" rivals for their job, their opposite number at Nine added: "This is a classic case of taking the boss too literally."
But Mr Amor said: "Our guard pulled out their Taser gun, but we don't believe the other guy was actually Tasered. It calmed down and we actually had a beer at the bar with them [Nine] after the game".
"It was a silly thing and it's been sorted."

Share your Thoughts
By Kyle Kesterson, CEO of Freak'n Genius
I could begin by promoting myself and boasting a list of personal and professional accomplishments made, especially over the last few years as an entrepreneur, but would risk having you click away before getting to the end... because we both know that you've heard it all before.
Instead, I would like to confess that I may be a fraud. You see, I'm not supposed to be here... or so I was made to believe while growing up.
Starting from the ground floor
I was born into an environment that crushed and suffocated almost everything in it. So, when I was a child, my family risked everything to move from "the worst place to live in the United States" to start a new life in Seattle.
My parents each worked 2-3 jobs just to keep the family alive, and living paycheck to paycheck took its toll on our family cohesion. Their jobs were still not enough and we soon found ourselves homeless. For many months we lived in various homeless shelters until we were finally accepted into a transitional housing program. Our basic needs were met through the use of food and clothing banks. Nothing like a stale sugar cookie and a god-knows-what-stained stuffed rabbit to get your spirits up!
A repeat failure
School was stifling, and I was well aware that I was different from the other kids in Redmond, home to Microsoft. I lived at the Y.W.C.A., wore tattered clothes that were too large for me, and used food stamps for school lunches. They lived in large houses, wore logo-emblazoned clothes, and had pagers. It was during the 4th grade that my class participation dwindled. My defiance of authority began to grow and I began to be labeled as an outcast. I was also severely bullied. Ever have a cafeteria trash can dumped all over you because your dangerous prank led to evacuating the whole wing of a building? Not pretty.
During the course of my life I have attended 14 different schools, and I've either failed or dropped out of most. When dropping out of high school with close to the lowest G.P.A. possible, and one of the largest disciplinary files in the district, teachers and peers told me, "Kyle, by the time you're 20 you will either be dead, in jail, or flipping burgers."
It seemed I was diminished by everyone in my life. They all gave up on me and let me disappear. That is, except for my parents, and a Microsoft Software Engineer named Jason who introduced me to technology. They kept reassuring me that I was meant for much greater things, and if I was willing to work hard and go through what it took to succeed, I could accomplish anything and I deserved everything the world had to offer.
At the time, their encouragement wasn't enough and I spiralled deep into depression and isolation.
Freedom in expression
It was only art in which I felt warmth... it seemed to catch all my suffering. Artist Alex Pardee spoke to me. Their work was dark, but I felt it... and I needed to feel something to make me still feel human. I must have copied almost every sketch and painting that Alex had created. They became my mentor, and they didn't even know it.
I clawed my way out of my emotional pit by teaching myself how to draw, paint, craft, and build. I started to feel empowered to make a difference, first in myself, then my environment... followed by the people in that environment. I became so hungry to be a part of something that mattered.
As my appetite for creating impact grew, I became aware of opportunities around me. Instead of letting them slip by like I had done so many times in my past, I started to ask questions and explore the possibilities.
Validation inspires
It was then that I was welcomed into a vibrant, online, creative collective called TheRoot42. It is a digital environment that encourages growth, collaboration, and community. Over a decade together now, we have invisible tattoos and secret handshakes...
Their support and feedback provided me enough confidence to submit my portfolio to
Cornish College of the Arts... and I was accepted! The selection committee was enthusiastic and gave me a substantial scholarship. I was doing flips inside, never before had I been so validated!
At Cornish, I soon found myself to be an outcast among outcasts. Many of my "free-thinking" peers came from wealthy families and had chosen Design because it was trendy... and it seemed they had little to no conviction in their work. I was there because I had to create, and I was working full time as a janitor to support myself. Janitor life is a whole other juicy blog post...
Getting into a plastic rocket
Leaving college early, I began working as many creative jobs simultaneously as I could. However it was when I caught the eye of the Creative Director at Funko, who believed in my creativity and went out of their way to bring me on as a Toy Developer, that I dropped everything to pursue it. Working with the world's largest licenses on virtually every cartoon character I could think of and more, to create toys, electronics, and packaging, as well as being mentored by two of the most prolific artists I had ever encountered.
And yet, I still couldn't fit in.
I attempted to make Funko a part of my identity, and brought it with me into the world in every way I could think of. However, not only was my enthusiasm not being nurtured by the company, it created friction. I realized that the environment and culture did not lend itself for growth, at least my kind. The toys lost their magic, and just became insignificant plastic. It started to show in my work, and I would even occasionally fall asleep at my desk. I knew I wanted to quit, but before I could, I was fired for not "kicking ass".
It was demoralizing, but on the drive home I felt an incredible weight lifting, and I remember thinking "this is either going to be the worst thing, or the best thing that has ever happened to me."
Blast off
The same afternoon that this new freedom was thrust upon me, I got a call from one of my best friends. They were adamant I should check out an event called Startup Weekend.
My parents always told me I would create my place in the world. They assured me I would fit somewhere. Startup Weekend was this place. Outcasts, weirdos, and extremely talented people came together to kick ass. No one wanted to me to "fit in". In fact people were excited about how weird I was. For the first time in my life I was confronted with a truly, unabashedly blank canvas. A place to create and wonderful people to create with.
Over the last three years, I have put the metaphorical brush to this canvas. I have surrounded myself in a community of people who believe in me, and was given the opportunity to take two startups through TechStars, which gave me direct access to dozens of entrepreneurs, investors, and media. Life changing mentors like Andy Sack (TechStars/Founders Co-Op), Greg Gottesman (Madrona Venture Group), Marc Nager (Startup Weekend), and so many more have provided countless hours of feedback and guidance on building products, hiring and forming teams, conflict/resolution, fundraising, negotiations, and other valuable life lessons.
The people in this ecosystem care deeply about each other, the world we live in, and the world we work to create. I believe we can change the world and these people don't think I am crazy or delusional. Well, they may think I'm crazy, but not because of my belief and ambitions.
Hearing the character-building stories of CEOs like T.A. McCann, (Gist), Ben Huh (Cheezburger Network), Dan Shapiro (SparkBuy), Rand Fishkin (SEO Moz), Keith Smith (Big Door) and so many other great leaders, makes me optimistic that my formative years of sailing rough seas, will serve as an advantage with leading my team through the wild adventures yet to come.
Destination: Cloud 9
There isn't a day that passes where I'm not moved by the appreciation I have for who I'm working with, what we're working on, and the environment we get to work in. Despite facing the issues and hurdles that every startup is met with, we have become a highly functional and effective band of misfits that is fueled to succeed in building this business, by creativity, collaboration, making something that matters, and having a hell of a lot of fun in the process.
It's the momentum built from this team, my family, and the startup community that hushes the whispering voices telling me, "you are just the homeless, high school dropout, janitor kid that was supposed to end up dead, in jail, or flipping burgers."
CAIRO, Egypt — It was graduation night. Sarah el-Sirgany had just wrapped up their studies at the prestigious American University in Cairo, and they were ready to celebrate with friends.
Sirgany, from a well-to-do Egyptian family, made their way to the center of town, a veil — or hijab — wrapped loosely, yet carefully, around their head.
They walked the gangplank of one of the Nile's posh boats and asked the manager of the restaurant inside to lead them to their friends' table.
“The bouncer at the door told me I can't get in,” they said. “Honestly, it was too late into the night to get into an argument. But it was infuriating. I just told my friends to come out to meet me.”
The reason they were denied entry? Them veil. Sirgany had dared step into the battle between Egypt's secular past and increasingly religious present. They had sought entry to a restaurant filled with wine drinking upper-class Egyptians, many of whom still eschew the veil.
This young Egyptian themselves exists somewhere in the middle of a growing cultural divide. They have the money to eat at the high-end restaurants and many of their friends don't don the veil.
Increasingly, though, women like Sirgany are finding themselves without a place as the Egyptian upper class fights to keep conservative strains of Islam from gaining access to its social circles.
“I think certain places want to paint a certain image about their clientele,” they said, “and having veiled women inside is seen as a potential contradiction to this image.”
The trend toward veiling in Egypt began 20 or 30 years ago among Egypt's lowest economic rungs. The reasons for this, say scholars, was varied.
After the fall of Arab nationalism, which reached its peak in the 1950s and '60s, many here saw the region's culture as a rudderless ship, without clear identity or relation to the West. So many turned to Islam, rallying around it as a means of creating a unique regional character.
It was also around this time that many women abandoned their traditional roles as homemakers and entered the work force. Some women took on the veil to maintain a measure of the privacy afforded to them in their past lives as stay-at-home wives.
And wearing a veil also took care of a practical problem for low-income Egyptian women.
“Some women can't afford 2 million dresses,” said Isis Nusair, a professor of women's studies at Denison University in Ohio, “and wearing the hijab is cheap.”
Over the years, the conservative form of Islam that compelled women to wear a veil crept slowly through the socioeconomic ranks. Estimates are that upwards of 90 percent of Muslim women in Egypt today wear the veil.
And now Egypt's elite upper class, the well-traveled sorts who tend to sneer at what they view as a backwards practice, is fighting to keep secularism alive in its ranks.
While some high-end restaurateurs turn veiled women away at the door, they are hardly the only warriors in this cultural skirmish.
Many of the beaches that line Egypt's north coast follow similar practices, forbidding veiled women from enjoying their sands. Some establishments encourage veiled women to visit nearby women-only beaches, where they can lounge and swim under tents that extend far into the Mediterranean. Even so, not all veils are created equal. Some establishments will let veiled women enter as long as their veil is considered trendy. A loose scarf with fashionable clothes might get a pass, while a niqab — the kind of dress that exposes nothing but the eyes — might not be welcome.
The Egyptian government has had mixed reactions to the controversy. Strictly speaking, it embraces Sharia law as supreme. As such, it bans all Egyptians from drinking on religious holidays and forbids, absolutely, Egyptians from entering casinos.
But these nods to Egypt's Islamic legacy are not without critics, even from within the highest ranks of government.
In 2006, long-serving Culture Minister Farouk Hosni openly complained about movement toward the veil.
“There was an age when our mothers went to university and worked without the veil. It is in that spirit that we grew up. So why this regression?” they said in the controversial interview.
Egypt's conservative factions and a number of newspapers lambasted them for months following the comments, keeping alive Egypt's scandal of the year.
In this cultural brawl, though, it's clear that Islam has the momentum since members of the upper class are increasingly taking on the veil.
But a vocal minority from the upper class is committed to continuing the fight and keeping people like Sirgany out of the bars, restaurants and beaches they consider to be their final bastions of secularism.
"Sorry, but that's up to me to decide, not anyone else," said El Sirgany, discussing where they choose to spend their evenings. "If I want to go to a pub with friends or on my own, if I want to drink alcohol while wearing the veil — I don't drink by the way — it's only up to me.
"People who find a problem with that, really need to get over themselves. If they can't reconcile their own stereotypes with new realities, then it's their problem, not mine."

The past several years have provided groundbreaking awareness of the role that microbial species on and within our bodies play in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and the onset of disease. Now, a team of investigators led by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania has recently found that the oral microbiome is affected by diabetes, causing a shift to increase its pathogenicity. Findings from the new study—published recently in Cell Host & Microbe in an article entitled “Diabetes Enhances IL-17 Expression and Alters the Oral Microbiome to Increase Its Pathogenicity”—not only show that the oral microbiome of mice with diabetes shifted, but that the change was associated with increased inflammation and bone loss.
“Up until now, there had been no concrete evidence that diabetes affects the oral microbiome,” noted senior study investigator Dana Graves, D.D.S., D.M.Sc., interim chair and professor at Penn's School of Dental Medicine. “But the studies that had been done were not rigorous.”
For many years, much of the scientific community has been under the pretext that there was no connection between the oral microbiome and diabetes, with the European Federation of Periodontology and the American Academy of Periodontology issuing a report four years ago stating specifically that there is no compelling evidence that diabetes is directly linked to changes in the oral microbiome.
However, that report didn't sit well for Dr. Graves and their co-authors, prompting them to pursue the idea, using a mouse model that mimics type 2 diabetes. “My argument was that the appropriate studies just hadn't been done, so I decided, we'll do the appropriate study,” Dr. Graves remarked.
The researchers began their work by characterizing the oral microbiome of diabetic mice compared to healthy mice. They found that the diabetic mice had a similar oral microbiome to their healthy counterparts when they were sampled before developing high blood sugar levels, or hyperglycemia. Yet, once the diabetic mice were hyperglycemic, their microbiome became distinct from their normal littermates, with a less diverse community of bacteria.
“By 16S rRNA sequencing, we showed that diabetes causes a shift in oral bacterial composition and, by transfer to germ-free mice, that the oral microbiota of diabetic mice is more pathogenic,” the authors wrote.
Interestingly, the diabetic mice also had periodontitis, including a loss of bone supporting the teeth, as well as increased levels of interleukin-17 (IL-17), a signaling molecule important in immune response and inflammation. Increased levels of IL-17 in humans are associated with periodontal disease.
The authors continued that “treatment with IL-17 antibody decreases the pathogenicity of the oral microbiota in diabetic mice; when transferred to recipient germ-free mice, oral microbiota from IL-17-treated donors induced reduced neutrophil recruitment reduced IL-6 and RANKL [receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand], and less bone resorption. Thus, diabetes-enhanced IL-17 alters the oral microbiota and renders it more pathogenic.”
“The diabetic mice behaved similar to humans that had periodontal bone loss and increased IL-17 caused by a genetic disease,” Dr. Graves added.
While the researcher's findings underscored an association between changes in the oral microbiome and periodontitis, it didn't prove that the microbial changes were responsible for the disease. To find that connection, the researchers transferred microorganisms from the diabetic mice to normal germ-free mice, animals that have been raised without being exposed to any microbes.
Remarkably, the recipient mice also developed bone loss. A micro-computed tomography scan revealed they had 42% less bone than mice that had received a microbial transfer from normal mice. Markers of inflammation also went up in the recipients of the diabetic oral microbiome.
“We were able to induce the rapid bone loss characteristic of the diabetic group into a normal group of animals simply by transferring the oral microbiome,” explained Dr. Graves.
With the microbiome now implicated in causing the periodontitis, the investigators wanted to know the specifics. Suspecting that inflammatory cytokines, specifically IL-17, played a role, the researchers repeated the microbiome transfer experiments, this time injecting the diabetic donors with an anti-IL-17 antibody prior to the transfer. Mice that received microbiomes from the treated diabetic mice had much less severe bone loss compared to mice that received a microbiome transfer from untreated mice—demonstrating unequivocally that diabetes-induced changes in the oral microbiome drive inflammatory changes that enhance bone loss in periodontitis.
IL-17 treatment is unlikely to be a reasonable therapeutic strategy in humans due to its key role in immune protection. However, the authors noted that the study results highlight the importance for people with diabetes of controlling blood sugar and practicing good oral hygiene.
“Diabetes is one of the systemic diseases that is most closely linked to periodontal disease, but the risk is substantially ameliorated by good glycemic control,” Dr. Graves concluded. “And good oral hygiene can take the risk even further down.”

Pesticides may kill off water insects and other small aquatic life by as much as 42 percent, according to an analysis of German, French and Australian rivers and streams published on Monday.
The study in US journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences is the first to compare regional biodiversity in polluted versus less polluted water, said scientists at the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres.
Freshwater invertebrates and aquatic insects were 42 percent less common in strongly contaminated areas in Europe compared to less polluted areas; and in Australia, a difference of 27 percent was found across regions.
The analysis included measurements of insecticides and fungicides, which are used often in agriculture and are typically well studied and heavily regulated.
However, the researchers said little examination has been done to gauge their effect on the streams and rivers they end up in after it rains and the chemicals are washed off farmland and into watercourses.
“The current practice of risk assessment is like driving blind on the motorway,” said ecotoxicologist Matthias Liess, a study co-author.
Species that were particularly vulnerable to pesticides included dragonflies, stoneflies, mayflies and caddis flies.
The researchers warned that the threat pesticides pose to biodiversity has been underestimated, since experimental lab work and studies on artificial ecosystems often precede a pesticide's market approval.
“The effects in Europe were detected at concentrations that current legislation considers environmentally protective,” said the study, calling for new approaches to better assess the ecological risks of pesticides.
A better practice would be to assess the ecological impact of chemicals by investigating real environments on a larger scale, the authors said.
The findings show that UN goals to slow down the decline in biodiversity by 2020 are “jeopardized,” it said.

Insects play a key role in ecosystems, but insect diversity and abundance appears to be on the decline. To gain a better understanding of the extent and underlying causes of this decline, Caspar Hallmann and colleagues measured total flying insect biomass over 27 years in nature protection areas in Germany, and recorded a dramatic decrease of over 75 percent in this period. To learn more about this research, just published in PLOS ONE, I interviewed Hallmann via email.
What prompted you to pursue science as a career?
My parents are both field biologists, which has undoubtedly contributed to me pursuing a science career. I really enjoy doing science: answering interesting research questions (or at least trying to do so!), and actively contributing to the state of knowledge in my field. A passion for nature and an eagerness to understand it has fuelled most of my efforts so far.
Why did you choose to study flying insect populations?
CH: Insects represent one of the most significant but least well investigated parts of ecosystem function. Knowledge on the state of flying insects as a group is limited to only few well-known species, and consequently so are our insights on ecosystem functioning. Luckily, a very important dataset collected, maintained and made available by the Krefeld Entomological Society enabled us to take a rare look into how flying insects as a group are performing in nature reserves.
What role do insects play in ecosystems? Why are they so important?
CH: Insects are highly significant, being responsible for plant pollination and nutrient recycling as well as acting as a food source for animals such as birds, bats and small mammals. Lack of insects is very likely to be detrimental to the entire ecosystem, in terms of its diversity as well as its stability and function.
How did you measure insect biomass during your study? What sorts of species did you include?
CH: Insect biomass was measured using tent-like structures known as Malaise traps deployed in protected areas in Germany throughout spring, summer and autumn. Malaise traps catch a relatively wide distribution of insect diversity, from small midges and mosquitos all the way to butterflies, wild bees and moths, and from leaf chewing species such as aphids to parasitic species such as wasps.
What surprised you most in your findings?
CH: We were very surprised by the extent of the decline in flying insects that we found, measuring over three-quarters of the total flying insect biomass over 27 years. Declines in several specific species, particularly vulnerable insects such as bees, butterflies and moths, have been recorded for some time. However, our results imply that the entire flying insect community has been devastated, including common species that are usually found in high numbers. Ironically, this decline was seen in protected areas, which are supposed to help preserve biodiversity and ecosystem stability.
Where do you hope your findings might lead?
CH: There is an urgent need to further investigate both causes and consequences of this alarming decline in insects. We truly hope that policymakers will respond. These results demand action at the national and international level to instigate measures that will preserve insects and the ecosystems that rely on them.
What are the next steps for your research?
CH: We would like to further consider the causes of the insect biomass decline and its extent in different insect subgroups. We also hope to elucidate how the decline depends on the quality and quantity of nature reserves. We would like to understand how this tremendous decline in insect biomass affects the ecosystem's stability. We are presently investigating how pesticide loads may affect insect biomass in the Netherlands, and how other species in the ecosystem may also be affected.

The wife of horse sex pervert Alan Blackman has spoken of their horror - but says their crime won't end their marriage.
Married dad-of-three Blackman, 31, admitted intent to commit a sexual offence and attempted intercourse with a horse in court yesterday.
Police issued CCTV images of a man with distinctively large ears after an animal was found injured at a farm stables in Redenhall, Norfolk, on August 6.
Blackman was arrested and charged but initially denied the offence, taking to Facebook to slam locals who were "putting my name to a face which isn't me".
(Image: PA)
They added that they would be "contacting the police to clear this up".
But now the shamed removals man is facing jail after admitting the offence at Norwich Crown Court yesterday.
Their wife Sarah said today that while they are "pretty disgusted" by what Blackman did, they still love them adding: "I can't turn that off overnight"
They told The Sun they are not sure whether they will remain together.
Mrs Blackman said they aren't sure why their husband had come to commit their vile crime, but revealed that in the recent months "things had changed."
"He just didn't act like my husband," they said.
“He was going out all the time and ignoring my texts and calls and lying about where they had been."
Judge Stephen Holt will sentence Blackman on October 23.
They said: "This is clearly a case where a psychiatric report would assist the court.
"You have pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity but the court needs to know more about you."
Blackman was remanded in custody until their next appearance.

“It's magnificent,” says Noel Gallagher, seated on a tacky black leather couch backstage at Atlanta's Shaky Knees festival in varying shades of tailored denim.  They are talking, of all things, about their hair – that notoriously mod-shaped brown mop that hung a little closer to their thick eyebrows back in 1994 when Oasis' debut Definitely, Maybe was released; a bit choppier over the ears then, with way less breathing room for the forehead. Still, in this late-spring Georgia heat that's giving the overpriced food-truck tacos an extra simmer, Noel looks as if he's ready to stroll outside on a brisk London day, buttoned up, sunglasses on, not a strand out of place. They dip their head forward. “Do you want to touch it?” Sure. Who wouldn't?
I give a swift pat with the palm of my hand to the ‘do that's even spurred its own dedicated how-to video on YouTube (ask the barber for “lots of texture,” then use a blow-dryer for some height at the crown) and confirm its impressive thickness and effortless spikiness. Good density, zero bald patches to speak of. Magnificent, indeed.
“It's not going anywhere,” they say in that Manchester drawl that swallows “h's” alive, leaning back into the sofa. A single decorative star hangs over from the draped ceiling, directly overhead. “When it falls out, I'm going to retire. As long as I'm growing hair, I'm writing songs.”
The conversation has turned to whether or not rock and roll has an expiration date – with their countrymen The Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney touring into their seventies, will Noel, now 48, still be leading crowds through chants of “Champagne Supernova” in their golden years? Maybe, as long as the ol' hair holds up. “If you see a little bald patch somewhere you should be like, ‘Oh, we better go see him. Not going to be much longer.'” This is information they might actually want to hide from Liam Gallagher, their younger brother, arch nemesis and former band mate in Oasis – or at least check their shampoo bottles for signs of Nair contamination.
It's a few hours before Noel's set at Shaky Knees (“Shaky Knees, what does that fucking even mean?” they will later ask on stage), with their High Flying Birds, in the second-to-last evening slot before the banjo-thrashing Avett Brothers close the Saturday night. They like festivals, particularly ones like this that aren't subject to Europe's classic summer mud-drench, and they certainly played enough back in the Oasis days though they did once get into a bit of trouble for saying that rappers didn't belong at places like England's Glastonbury.
“If it ain't broke don't fix it,' they told the BBC back in 2008. “If you start to break it then people aren't going to go. I'm sorry, but Jay-Z? No chance.” The comments weren't meant to knock on Mr. Carter specifically, who was top billing that year – they were more a statement on how they hoped to protect the storied tradition of guitar headliners at these historic European festivals. Though Noel still lacks a taste for rap, with the exception of Public Enemy (“I don't mind rappers, they are fucking cool guys, man. But I don't like what they do”), the comments were taken out of context. This is not an unusual occurrence when it comes to Noel.
“Noel Gallagher blasts Jay-Z!” the headlines read. In fact, a quick search of “Gallagher” and “Blast” will reveal that Noel or Liam are, according to the internet at least, “blasting” everyone from One Direction to Kanye West to Lady Gaga on a daily basis – and, of course, each other. Neither Oasis brother has ever been known for their ability to tactfully self-censor, but the media has come to feed the Gallagher Machine as a bit of a musical sideshow: ask them goofy questions, they'll answer. Supreme court? Lady Gaga? Exercise habits? You'll get a soundbite. Pop-culture website The A.V. Club once ran an article with the lead, “Noel Gallagher on Liza Minnelli and ‘Why Running is ‘for Fucking Squares.'” It wasn't a satire piece.
“I'm seen like an eccentric fucking old man who always sat in the corner calling everyone a twat. It's bizarre,” they say, resting their sunglass on the L-shaped coffee table. Right now, we're sequestered in a tent in the VIP area adjacent to the main stage, where you can acquire both some smoked meat and a fresh tattoo. Noel goes for neither. Instead, I'd found them sitting with their band on plastic Adirondack chairs, soaking up the oppressive sun in that heavy denim jacket and black jeans. They appear, somehow, not to sweat, and is free from a manager or PR shadow. “I could go into an interview and say, ‘I don't want to be asked about X-Y-Z and ask to see the questions before, and then rehearse [the answers]. But life's too short for that, and it's not real. That's why music is shit now. Publicists, making the artists scared to say anything.”
To be fair, Noel does call one person a twat – or at least some version of “twat” – fairly often, and that's their brother Liam. Since the fault line that Oasis was built on permanently ruptured back in 2009, the aftershocks are still firing today via various jabs sent out on social media (Liam) and interviews (Noel). This time, it's over the brass section that accompanies songs like “Riverman” on Noel's second solo album, Chasing Yesterday. The horns are a warm, rich addition, adding some interesting layers to Noel's always subtlety infectious, guitar-strum centered melodies.

Author's Note: Hello! I just finished RWBY season 3, and I fell in love with the story and characters. This story contains quite a bit of spoilers so if you have NOT finished and caught up to where the story currently is, then thankyou for checking out my story, but I advise you to come back later once you have finished season 3.
I unfortnately don't have much time to write, so with this story, it will be kept short, and simple. With very little editing. I'm hoping if I keep the chapters short, sweet and to the point, I will be able to finish.
This takes place three years after season 3. I hope you enjoy it. :)
Chapter One:
All that Remains
Ruby and ebony hair flowed and waved with the gentle breeze. The wisps of hair kissed their pale face, silver eyes looked on to the marked graves before them It had only been three years. Three painstakingly years. A crushing emptiness threaten to consume their once brilliant honest soul. Silver eyes that once held life, was dulled by the war. It was true, they wanted to become a huntress. To become a hero that once had been read to her, and while they had accomplished all of what they had dreamed, it came at a great cost.
They turned on their heels, as they began walking. They no longer had and tears left to shed. Today, was the first official day of the war coming to an end though it ended months ago. They had mastered the power behind their eyes, and was finally able to bring a swift end to the war that stolen so much from them Them innocence, their purity, their loved ones.
The Grimm were still numerous, no doubt from the negative emotions that dwell within the hearts of those who were left behind. They were just as guilty as those they were surrounded by. Huntsmen, and huntresses alike would have a steady job over the next few years. Busy cleaning up the mess left behind.
They stood at the edge of the graveyard, taking one look over their shoulder. As far as their eyes could see, the rolling hills were decorated with flowers. There was never no time to mourn the dead, no time to mark a grave in remembrance. They had spent a few hours walking through the rolling hills of sorrow to find each person they had come to know.
They pulled the hood of their cape over their head and continued with their brisk walk away from the graves. They could never put enough distance between her, and the shadow of nightmares that followed them
Soon they found themselves running, their cape fluttering in the wind. The more they ran, the more their heart wrenched and twisted in their chest.
People were in a dazed as a flash of red soared past them, leaving them in their wake.
Before they realized, the sun was setting, a trail of rose petals leading to their location in the woods. Numerous trees had been sliced, bleeding their sap onto the ground below. Breathless, Ruby was leaning on Crescent Rose for support. Them hair a messy heap, sticking to their face as sweat beads rolled off their nose. They stood up, using their sleeve to wipe the sheen of sweat from their face as they looked at their surroundings to get them bearings.
This was all that was left of them This was all they could. They knew the truth, and the truth of the matter they died long ago on the battlefield. They would forever be stuck in that moment. The moment that forever changed them
Them grip tightened on the staff of their weapon, their eyes narrowed as they desperately tried to push away the consuming thoughts.
Moments passed as twilight had come and passed, the white shattered moon shining in the emptiness of the night.
Ruby collapsed their weapon, placing it in the holster on their back. The leaves crunched beneath their feet as they made way to a small cabin in the woods, that they had been raised in. A place that once were home, but now was only a roof over their head.
Interlinking of rivers is a very expensive proposal. It has huge adverse environmental impacts on land, forests, biodiversity, rivers and the livelihood of millions of people. It is a socially disruptive proposition. It will not only add to climate change impact (destruction of forests means destruction of carbon sinks, and reservoirs in tropical climate are known sources of methane and carbon dioxide), but will also reduce our capacity to adapt to climate change.
Take, for example, the Ken-Betwa link which is the government's top priority. The link will facilitate export of water from drought-prone Bundelkhand to the upper Betwa basin, as the detailed project report (DPR) makes clear. The Ken-Betwa link's hydrology is effectively a state secret, so there is no way to check if the claim of Ken river being surplus is valid. There has been no credible environmental impact assessment of the link and no public hearings in canal and downstream affected areas. The link's environmental management plan is still being prepared.
The Ken-Betwa link threatens about 200 sq. km of the Panna tiger reserve, and with it the Ken river and large parts of Bundelkhand. Yet, it does not have an environment clearance, a final forest clearance, and its wildlife clearance is being scrutinized by the Central-empowered committee appointed by the Supreme Court. In fact, both forest and wildlife clearance recommendations are under the condition that the power project will be taken out of the forest/protected area, but the environment clearance recommendation assumes the project will be inside the forest/protected area. So even that is invalid.
The government justifies the Ken-Betwa link, and indeed the river interlinking project as a whole, by saying that it will provide irrigation, water supply, hydropower and flood control. But we need to understand that most of India's water benefits, including irrigation, come from groundwater. In fact, in the past two-and-a-half decades, the net national irrigated area from big dams has decreased by about 1.5 million hectares from a peak of 17.79 million ha in 1991-92, according to government data. But in the same period, India's total irrigated area has gone up—primarily due to groundwater. Groundwater is our water lifeline and whether we like it or not, whether we want it or not, groundwater is going to remain our water lifeline for decades to come.
However, our current use of groundwater is not sustainable. The focus of our water resources development should be on how the groundwater lifeline can be sustained. Will Interlinking of rivers help in this? No, since Interlinking of rivers entails a large number of dams that will lead to destruction of rivers, forests, wetlands and local water bodies, which are major groundwater recharge mechanisms.
So as far as irrigation is concerned, it seems the river interlinking project is likely to create more problems than benefits. The same is true for water supply.
As far as hydropower is concerned, it is clear that large hydropower projects are no longer a viable option in India. The power minister has repeatedly said in Parliament over the last two years that hydropower projects of over 11,000MW are stuck due to lack of finances and questions over viability. The chief minister of Himachal Pradesh has stated that private developers are exiting the sector as they consider the projects to be non-viable. The situation in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh is similar.
It costs over Rs10 crore to produce one megawatt of hydropower, which in turn produces less than four million units of electricity. This means the per-unit cost of power from such projects is in excess of Rs8 per unit, when there are no takers for power that costs even Rs3 per unit. In any case, Interlinking of rivers will be needing more power to lift the water than what it is likely to produce.
Can the river interlinking project flood-proof the flood-prone river basins? While theoretically, a large reservoir can help moderate floods in the downstream areas, our experience on the ground doesn't inspire as much confidence. For example, heads of government, state officials, and the Comptroller and Auditor General have on numerous occasions pointed out that big dams such as the Ranganadi dam, the Damodar dams, the Farakka and Bansagar dams, and the Hirakud dam have brought avoidable flood disasters to Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha, respectively.
The other problem with the river interlinking project is that of storing large quantities of waters. Most of the sites suitable for the big reservoirs are in Nepal, Bhutan and in the North-East—and each one has made clear their opposition to big storage reservoirs.
If the water cannot be stored in big reservoirs during the monsoon, which is when some rivers are flooded, then the other option is to transfer the water to deficit basins during this time. But when the Brahmaputra is in floods, so is the Ganga and all the rivers through which the water needs to be transferred, including the Subarnarekha, the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna, the Pennar, and so on. Why should these rivers, that are already facing floods, receive more water?
There is no doubt that if we can store water during the monsoon, we can make it available in the post monsoon months. But the water resources establishment sees big dams as the only storage option. Yet, the biggest, cheapest, most benign, possibly fastest and most decentralized storage option for India is the groundwater aquifer.
In other words, what India needs is not interlinking of rivers but something else to achieve water, agriculture and livelihood security.

Thankful Villages (also known as Blessed Villages; Welsh: Pentrefi Diolchgar)[1][2] are settlements in England and Wales from which all their members of the armed forces survived World War I. The term Thankful Village was popularised by the writer Arthur Mee in the 1930s; in Enchanted Land (1936), the introductory volume to The King's England series of guides, they wrote that a Thankful Village was one which had lost no men in the Great War because all those who left to serve came home again. Their initial list identified 32 villages.
In an October 2013 update,[3] researchers identified 53 civil parishes in England and Wales from which all serving personnel returned. There are no Thankful Villages identified in Scotland or Ireland yet (all of Ireland was then part of the United Kingdom).[4]
Fourteen of the English and Welsh villages are considered "doubly thankful", in that they also lost no service personnel during World War II.[4] These are marked with a (D) in the list below (note: while the list includes 17 of these, not all have been verified).
List of Thankful Villages [ edit ]
The researchers acknowledged a number of other villages which have been put forward as Thankful Villages but where they found there to be some uncertainty, generally over the place of residence of a serviceman.[3]
England [ edit ]
Wales [ edit ]
Ceredigion
Glamorgan
Pembrokeshire
Tavernspite, in Pembrokeshire, has been mooted as a third doubly thankful village in Wales.[7]
France [ edit ]
In France, where the human cost of war was higher than in Britain, Thierville in Upper Normandy was the only village in all of France with no men lost from World War I. Thierville also suffered no losses in the Franco-Prussian War and World War II, France's other bloody wars of the modern era.[8][9]
In popular culture [ edit ]
On 3 June 2016 singer-songwriter Darren Hayman released the first of three albums inspired by and written in-situ at the Thankful Villages. 54 villages were covered, including Welbury, North Yorkshire, not in the 53 listed above.[10][11]
President Trump praised the House Republicans' plan to alter the Affordable Care Act, March 7, at the White House. (The Washington Post)
Until Tuesday, President Trump and Stephen K. Bannon did a good job of keeping their base happy. They threw out red meat on immigration, ruthlessly attacked the press, cooked up an anti-Barack Obama conspiracy (to replace the birther conspiracy) and continued to talk tough on trade. If their actions and rhetoric horrified all Democrats, most independents, some thinking Republicans and the press, they did not care. Keep the base happy, stick to the nativist, protectionist Bannon hymnal.
Then on Tuesday Trump embraced the GOP health-care bill, which will keep or even expand the “administrative state” and which has been vilified by conservatives. They tweeted, “Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster – is imploding fast!” Trump also said after a meeting with members, “We're going to do something that's great. And I am proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives.”
Now, whatever you think of the merits, it won't pass as currently designed. Moreover, it is especially harmful to Trump's lower-income, older Rust Belt supporters.
[An insipid GOP attack line just got worse]
The Kaiser Foundation has a user-friendly map and calculator which shows which states (most of them) and which counties specifically would pay more under the GOP American Health Care Act and which pay more under the Affordable Care Act. In almost every single county in Iowa, Michigan and Ohio, a 60-year-old with $30,000 in income would pay more for coverage. In some counties that would amount to more than $1,000. As Kaiser puts it, “Generally, people who are older, lower-income, or live in high-premium areas (like Alaska and Arizona) receive larger tax credits under the ACA than they would under the American Health Care Act replacement. Conversely, some people who are younger, higher-income, or live in low-premium areas (like Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Washington) may receive larger assistance under the replacement plan.” Congratulations, House Republicans and Trump, you're on the side of rich New England millennials. Seriously, this would be a tragedy for the “forgotten” Americans and hence a political disaster for Trump.
House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) remarked on the American Health Care Act on Tuesday, saying it's "been a long time coming." (The Washington Post)
From a political and policy standpoint, the smart move would have been to deplore the bill and tell the House to go back to work. Instead, Trump tied themselves to the mast of a sinking ship. Why would they do this? Well, for starters they never had a bill of their own. This is the only vehicle Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and Vice President Pence have been working on. There was no “awesome” health-care plan in their back pocket. Second, this could be another case in which Trump did not read the fine print. (He doesn't read much of anything, reportedly.) They took House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), Price and Pence's word that this would be fine and leaped before they really looked hard at the bill. Alternatively, they may never have intended to improve health care for their base or protect the most vulnerable. Perhaps their plan all along was to reward the rich, cover fewer people, enact painful cuts at the expense of the poor and repeal taxes for the upper-income taxpayers who've footed a large share of the cost of Obamacare. They might not actually care what is in the bill; they only wants “wins.” They therefore will deny the bill does the destructive things its critics (correctly) claim. On this one however, he'll not have the amen right-wing chorus to echo their nonsense.
[The Republican health-care plan's top critics? Republicans.]
Whatever your explanation, the Democrats considering a run in 2020 must be delighted. Trump's no friend of the working man, they will claim. He's just as mean-spirited as every other Republican, they will say. Democrats will hang the GOP health care bill around the necks of Republican incumbents. GOP voters who will be enraged the party did not do what it promised may sit home, or vote for challengers.
For all these reasons I find it hard to believe that in the end Trump won't hang the House Republicans out to dry. (That would please Bannon, who has had a temporary truce with Ryan.) They will need to distance themselves from the impending disaster. We'll have to wait and see how they do it.
An Approach to P=NP via Descriptive Complexity
An approach to P NP based on descriptive complexity and HORNSAT
Alfred Horn was a logician who in 1951 discovered the important notion that we now call Horn clauses, in their honor. This class of special clauses has played a foundational role in the area of logic programming—for example, are a key part of the programming language Prolog. I used a picture of one of Horn's PhD students, Dr. Ali Amir-Moez, who created the Horn-Moez Prize. I was unable to find a picture of Horn—even after a very long search—so I hope that this is okay.
Today I want to talk about an old idea, based on Horn clauses, that may be relevant to the P=NP question.
Years ago David Dobkin, Steven Reiss and I worked on a problem that used Horn Clauses. We proved that Linear Programming (LP) is complete for P with respect to logspace reductions—our proof used, in today's terminology, an LP relaxation of Horn clauses. At the end of our paper we said:
This theorem is especially interesting since it is not known whether linear programming belongs to P or no? (see [3] for more details on this problem).
The reference “[3]” was to a paper of Dobkin and Reiss that was in preparation; they had found many interesting problems that were equivalent to LP—all in a hope to better understand the problem. I think that they, and others, probably had guessed at the time that LP might be NP-complete, but I am not sure anymore what the conventional wisdom was at that time. Of course it still could be NP-complete, but that would imply that P is equal to NP.
Let's turn to talking about Horn clauses and the P=NP problem. By the way this whole discussion is joint work with Ken Regan.
Horn Clauses
A Horn clause is a clause with at most one positive literal. Thus,
is a Horn clause, and
is not. A better way, for me at least, to think of Horn clauses is that the general form is:
where all the literals are positive.
The interest to logicians, like Horn, was that this class of clauses had certain model theoretic properties. For a theorist there are two reasons that they are interesting. First, a set of Horn clauses can be checked for satisfiability in polynomial time. The algorithm is just done the obvious: for clauses with just one variable, assign it so that the clause is true, and then keep applying the “implies” rules, until there are no more rules to apply. If you get and at some point, there is no assignment; otherwise there is one.
Second, SAT restricted to Horn clauses, HORNSAT, captures P. General SAT is NP; HORNSAT is P. Pretty neat. The intuition is simple: a Horn implication tells you what to do, while an implication like
allows a choice, which is exactly how general clauses encode nondeterminism.
The Descriptive Cook Theorem
In a previous discussion, I talked about descriptive complexity and its possible relationship to separation results. I will first review the notion, and then give a simple example of how it can be used.
Recall, instead of Kolmogorov's general notion of the complexity of a string, which is based on Turing Machines (TM's), we will use an intuitively weaker notion based on circuits.
Suppose that is a circuit and is a string. Say that describes if for all ,
We will use the size of the circuit to measure how complex the string is, and we call this the descriptive complexity of the string.
The following is a stronger version of Cook's classic theorem, yet it uses essentially the same proof of their theorem:
Theorem: Let be a deterministic TM (DTM) that runs in polynomial time . Let be an input of length . Then, there are Horn clauses so that The clauses are satisfiable if and only if accepts . The descriptive complexity of is at most .
Even though the formulas typically arise from an time-space tableau of the computation, the layout of the tableau is so regular that we can easily describe the -th bit of the formula, given any . A descriptive complexity is enough to describe the formula. The point is that is not in the exponent.
Hypothesis H
If HORNSAT with low descriptive complexity can be solved by a low complexity witness, then . To be more precise, we need the following Hypothesis H:
Suppose that are Horn clauses . If they are satisfiable, then there is a valid assignment for the clauses with description complexity at most polynomial in the description complexity of the clauses.
Main Result
The main result is this:
Theorem: Suppose that Hypothesis H is true. Then, .
Assume that Hypothesis H is true, and also that is true. One fact about is that it gives a fixed polynomial time overhead for simulating any NTM by a DTM . If runs in time , then can run in time . If it is true, we can make a similar statement about an alternating Turing machine that makes a fixed finite number of alternations, though with a larger value of . We choose to work for ATMs that have an existential phase followed by a universal phase, i.e. “ -machines.”
Now let be the exponent of the polynomial in Hypothesis H, and let be the exponent in the “ ” in the Descriptive Cook Theorem. Let . We will get a contradiction by speeding up any deterministic Turing machine that runs in time . Consider any input of length . Then, there is a collection of Horn clauses so that
The clauses are satisfiable if and only if accepts . The descriptive complexity of is .
This follows by the Descriptive Cook Theorem. Now consider the ATM that on any input does the following:
Construct a description of size for corresponding to on input .
of size for corresponding to on input . Guess a description of size for an assignment to the up-to- variables in .
of size for an assignment to the up-to- variables in . Branch over every Horn clause in . For each one, use the circuit to look up the values of the variables in . The branch returns true if is satisfied.
Thus accepts iff there exists a such that every branch returns true, which happens if and only if it is satisfiable, which happens iff accepts . Hence . The running time of is bounded by times the maximum number of variables in our Horn clauses, which is constant. Finally from we get a DTM that simulates in time . Which is:
for some constant independent of . Since is a constant independent of , this is just . Thus we have sped up to a DTM running faster than , contradicting the time hierarchy theorem.
Relaxing a Little
If we could use just as the description complexity for the collection of Horn clauses, then we could relax the polynomial overhead in Hypothesis H to be an exponential function. That is, it could be a overhead so long as we can take small enough to cancel any given . This would illustrate the point that
an exponential upper bound, if used at logarithmic scaling, can help to give a polynomial lower bound.
As things stand, the Descriptive Cook Theorem actually gives , with the representing the dependence of the clauses on the input . Note that in the above proof the ATM is already given , so it does not need to unpack the “ ” part of the description. Hence if we formulate an appropriate notion of “conditional description complexity,” we can use it to formulate a relaxed version H' of Hypothesis H that allows a bound, where is the conditional description complexity. More on this to come, and how it relates to the work on “computational depth” that was referenced in the previous discussion.
Open Problems
The key insight here is that an upper bound, Hypothesis H, can be used to prove that P NP. This fits into Regan's and my philosophy that upper bounds are more likely to be possible, than proving lower bounds directly. The main open question is of course: is Hypothesis H true? Can we relate it to other open problems?

Mets right-hander and soft-spoken Southern gentleman R.A. Dickey threw their second consecutive one-hitter tonight — in this case, against the Orioles of Baltimore. Nor do their defense-independent numbers suggest that they were anything but excellent on Monday night (box): 9.0 IP, 30 TBF, 13 K, 2 BB, 11 GB on 15 batted-balls (73.3% GB), 1.14 xFIP.
The average knuckleball from Dickey has approximately zero inches of horizontal movement and a single inch of positive vertical movement — or “rise,” a concept the present author discussed briefly earlier on Monday. Of course, the idea of an “average” knuckleball is a bit of a misnomer: given the nature of the pitch, the standard deviation of both sorts of movement is likely quite high. Indeed, this is the strength of the pitch: no one really knows where it's going, not even Dickey.
As a sort of celebration of Dickey's last two games — of their entire season, really — I sought out Dickey's three “movingest” knuckleballs from their Monday start. In this case, I've identified the three of Dickey's knuckleballs with the highest absolute value of total movement (i.e. the sum of the absolute values of both horizontal and vertical movement, in inches).
It's hard to say if what follows are necessarily Dickey's three best knuckleballs from Monday. However, each of them really does move quite a bit: indeed, the reader will note that catcher Josh Thole is unable to catch two of the three pitches and has to sort of violently move their glove to catch the other.
Below are those three knuckleballs. Click on individual GIFs for Maximum Pleasure™. (Data from Brooks Baseball.)
No. 3: Wilson Betemit, Third Inning
Movement: 5.2 in. armside, 7.5 in. rise (12.7 in.)
No. 2: Brian Roberts, Third Inning
Movement: 4.2 in. gloveside, 9.9 in. drop (14.1 in)
No. 1: Chris Davis, Seventh Inning
Movement: 6.9 in. armside, 8.8 in. drop (15.8 in)
Bonus
Here's a bonus: Dickey's reaction to that last pitch — a reaction that suggests even they were surprised (and/or impressed) by the amount of movement on same.
Later today, New York legislators will add at least 33 amendments to the NY SAFE ACT of 2013. The measures are designed to correct dozens of significant flaws in the bill (aside from the ACT's existence). Plainview attorney Albert Turi agrees with The New York Times' description of the gun ban bill as a “dog's breakfast.” “The Governor waived the Constitutional requirement for a three day waiting period for any new bill using their emergency powers,” Turi told TTAG. “The ACT was rushed through without proper thought or consideration . . . There are parts of it I can't read, understand or digest.” How bad is it? . . .
Yesterday, the State Police had a sit down with Cuomo's soldiers to try to figure out how to administer a completely unworkable set of regulations. For example:
“When you go to register a gun now in New York,” Turi said. “There's an hour wait. Can you imagine what's going to happen when thousands of gun owners attempt to comply with the ACT?”
Not that the cops will know how to enforce important provisions . . .
“Under the new bill, ten rounds is the new 30. You can have 10-round magazines bought before the ban—as long as you don't load them with more than seven rounds. But you can't buy new 10-round magazines. How can the police tell if a 10-round magazine was bought before or after the ban?
“Under the bill, you can transfer a ‘military style' rifle to another New Yorker. It has to be done through an FFL [federally-approved gun dealer] for a NICS [criminal background] check.
“But the dealer can't sell any new or used ARs. When they call the FBI for a check for a transfer the dealer can't provide a sales reference number. If NICS insists, the transfer is dead in the water.”
I asked Turi what they thought would happen now. After New York legislators “fix” the SAFE ACT, will Empire State gun owners comply with its provisions? “I doubt many people will register their rifles,” Turi said, simply.
Plainview's plainspoken attorney didn't share my view that this non-compliance could have deadly consequences, if and when the police learn of an unregistered gun and send a SWAT team to confiscate it.
“Failure to register is a misdemeanor. They can't show up at the door and demand the gun.” Unless they do. I could almost hear Turi shrugging their shoulders over the phone. And then they shared their greatest fear.
“It's the ammunition provision that scares me,” they said. “Every ammunition sale—even one bullet—has to be reported. The system keeps track of whom, what and when; it generates a unique ID number for both the buyer and seller.
“The bill doesn't say what constitutes an ‘unusual amount' of ammunition. Or what happens to you when the system flags your purchase. If you buy a thousand rounds of ammo you could get a knock on your door. That's not good.”
No, none of it's good. But there is a silver lining in the SAFE ACT, at least for the rest of us. Like the post-Katrina confiscation, the ACT proves that yes, the gun grabbers will grab guns. Civilian disarmament isn't just a fear. It's a reality.
Tens of millions of gun owners are waking-up to the need to defend and extend their rights; in their home state and at the federal level. Whether by popular vote or judicial action, infringed upon gun rights will be restored. The question is: what happens in the meantime.
We've said it before, we'll say it again: Americans with a “don't tread on me” mentality don't like being tread upon. At all. Despite Turi's steadfast calm in the face of this constitutional calamity, this could get real ugly real fast.
Sweet smokin Judas , what were they thinking?
Welcome back to Interior Desecrations, a brutal examination of the unlovely, unattractive, unlivable and unforgivable homes of the 1970s. All eras have some bad taste, of course  but it took the 70s to make bad taste triumphant and universal. It took the 70s to convince everyone to stick foil wallpaper on the wall, paint the bathtub purple , smother the floors in shag so deep it tickled the tops of your ankles, and hang art that managed to clash with everything, including itself. I mean, look at this picture  what is that? A dissected Rubikss Cube attempts to threaten a potted plant and their child, I guess.
Love the rug, too. They didnt even make AMC cars in those color combinations. They didnt dare.
Interior Desecrations was once a website, a popular & venerable part of the Institute of Official Cheer  and now its a book! From the same fine people who brought you the Gallery of Regrettable Food comes an all-new compendium of pop-culture. Its fun, its cheap, and it makes a great gift for anyone who grew up in a house like this, or made their kids suffer for their decade-long lapse in taste. NOTE: this is the original 1999 version of the site - hence the resolution and design.
We live in a world where we are constantly watched and monitored. Find out what it would take to wipe the slate clean and live a life free of big brother.
Police State got you down? Does the thought of Martial Law keep you up at night? Well, it should!
We live in a world where we are constantly watched and monitored. Ever wondered what it would take to wipe the slate clean and live a life free of big brother?
Security expert Aton Edwards answered just that as they go on an amazing journey off the grid and under the radar in ‘‘Track Me If You Can”.
The show focused on ways to avoid being tracked by “big brother” or anyone else who may be looking for you.
Track Me If You Can is a must-watch for anyone interested in protecting their privacy. Aton covers many excellent tips and gives necessary information for anyone who wants to go off-grid and disappear off the radar.

Track Me If You Can (via Daily Motion)
Facts
There are 30 million plus surveillance cameras on the US, one camera for every ten Americans.
The average American is in 200 databases.
Putting a plan in motion to keep you from being tracked is a good idea if you want to devise a new life for yourself
Before You Go
Plan 3 months ahead of time
Right before you leave, change your appearance significantly (if you have hair, shave your head, if you have blond hair, change it to black, get glasses, etc.).
Before you leave, terminate all of your accounts (email, bank accounts, credit cards, etc).
Don't terminate your social network sites as you can use these sites to provide disinformation.
Before you leave, delete all of your computer files and get rid of your computer's hard drive (first boil the hard drive then smash it with a hammer and finally run a Degausser/electromagnetic wand over the drive to obliterate all information it may contain).
Get rid of all of your personal items like photos, trophies, mementos, etc. that could tie you to your old life.
Shred all of your personal info and credit cards/bank statements/etc. with a micro-cut shredder, next take the shredded material and spread it around in a bunch of trash bags and leave the bags at various dumpsters around the city, or burn it.
Get rid of your cell phone or tablet as these can be easily used to track your location either through a computer software program or through triangulation. Off is never truly off with a smart phone, take out the battery until you are ready to abandon it (see below).
Pro Tip: Wipe all of your info from your cell phone then leave it at a train or bus station so that someone else will pick it up and start using it, thus providing a source of disinformation for those searching for you.
Day Zero
Break your normal patterns (what you eat, where you frequent, how you shop, the kind of work you do, etc).
Ditch your car and find a substitute that is not your personality.
Completely change your lifestyle (ie: if you are currently a corporate lawyer, become a night janitor then dress and behave appropriately).
If you do take your car get rid of the toll pass which can track your movements through the RFID chip in the pass.
Stay away from interstate highways.
Get rid of the GPS device which came with your car. Ditto for the OnStar system which can be activated remotely and allow others to listen in on your conversations.
Make sure your tires don't have RFID chips in them. Some tires have these chips and they can link to your VIN number and the purchase location of the tires.
Living Day To Day
Go to non-chain restaurants.
Pay for everything with cash.
When you are out in public disguise yourself (at least wear a hat and sunglasses).
Avoid frequenting your usual places (for example, if you are a vegetarian your meal preference can be found through your prior airline meal request and then you may be easier to locate if you frequent vegetarian restaurants).
Get your food to go from restaurants so you don't leave DNA on the plates/utensils/glasses which can be read with an easily purchased BPac machine which analyzes your biometrics.
Stay in small motels and pay with cash.
Use alcohol wipes to remove fingerprints.
Use a Multi Sweep Hidden Camera & Bug Detector to check for hidden bugs/cameras/etc.
to check for hidden bugs/cameras/etc. Cover the peephole so people can't see into your room.
Sleep in your sleeping bag so you won't leave DNA behind on the hotel bedding.
How To Stay Off The Radar
Buy a basic pre-paid cell phone (not a smart phone) which you only use for outgoing calls (be sure to turn off the caller ID). Replace the pre-paid phone frequently, about every 2 weeks.
When you are not using the cell phone, remove the battery so it can't be turned on remotely or used to track you.
Be careful when speaking in cars or near windows. The NSA/CIA/FBI has a bounce laser monitoring system which can pick up sound waves on glass and record what you are saying.
At night you can avoid being seen on cameras that use infrared light (90% do) by fashioning a cap with LED lights on the front of it which makes a “halo” and shields your face from the cameras.
Restarting Life
To determine the best place to resettle, choose a mid-sized city in a not overly cold place. Big cities and small towns are not good places for anonymity because of all the cameras.
To change your identity don't just assume the identity of someone else (this is way more difficult–and illegal–than it used to be), instead petition the court to change your name legally to a new–and common–name (you'll have to dig deeper elsewhere on the web for exactly how to do this without giving yourself away).
Apply for a driver's license under your new name.
Get an RFID-blocking wallet (here's one for the ladies). Most driver's licenses and passports have RFID chips in them. Block people from reading these RFID chips by carrying them in your RFID-blocking wallet.
To get back online use a new laptop. Stay away from libraries!
Always use a hard wire to your laptop and turn off the wi-fi which is universally less secure.
Put a cover over your web cam because these are extremely easy to turn on remotely.
Install anti-key logger software on your computer.
Also, install software that will reroute your ip address so your location can't be determined via your computer.
Be aware of the NSA spying and the ECHELON program in the US which monitors phone and computer transmissions for keywords and messages.
At the grocery store, change your shopping habits and never use store club cards.
Be aware that nearly all food packaging now contain RFID tags. To be sure these aren't used for tracking (unlikely now but possibly more likely in the future as the InternetofThings grows) repackage food once you purchase it and get rid of the store packaging.
To find work, get a night job that is different that your previous job, such as a janitor. This will limit your contact with people.
Change jobs often.
Create a “backstory” for your new identity and practice it. If you base your lies on the truth but change the details a bit, your story will be easier to remember and more believable.
Open a bank account, preferably at a small, local credit union.
Be aware of video surveillance cameras which are everywhere.
Never contact people from your past.
The narrator noted that every year, changing your identity gets harder.
The police now consider common activities suspicious such as bird watching, sketching or painting, or taking photographs in public.
There are 70+ FUSION centers in the US which coordinate surveillance and other information.
Airlines sometimes put locater chips on your bags so be aware of this. You can also use these tagged bags for disinformation purposes (ie: leaving them in places to throw people off your trail).
Technology is now available to identify you by the way you walk (change the way you walk), your facial measurements and biometrics (use a disguise, and especially sunglasses), and even your response to images.
It will be 7 to 10 years before your old identity drops off of databases, if ever.
Guard against complacency.
The less you interface with technology, the better off you will be.

Police officers arrive at the Century 16 theater east of the Aurora Mall in Aurora, Colorado, on Friday, July 20, 2012. A gunman wearing a gas mask set off an unknown gas and fired into the crowded movie theater killing twelve people and injuring at least fifty others, authorities said.

This morning, as the country digested the terrible events that unfolded in Aurora, Colorado, overnight—where a gunman killed twelve people and wounded 59 others in a packed movie theater—New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg immediately called for a renewed conversation on gun control. “You know, soothing words are nice, but maybe it's time that the two people who want to be president of the United States stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it, because this is obviously a problem across the country,” they said. “There are so many murders with guns every day, it's just got to stop.”
The usual suspects raked Bloomberg over the coals for “politicizing” the shootings, which is nonsense. When there are plane crashes, we talk about flight safety. When there are wildfires, we talk about fire prevention. Terrorist attacks beget huge (often over-reactive) conversations about security measures.
So when one person is able to shoot seventy-one people in rapid succession before police arrive, it's sensible to talk about whether it should be so easy. Guns aren't exclusively to blame for the tragedy, but they sure did help make it possible, and multiply the destruction.
However, the White House quickly made it clear it would not listen to Bloomberg's plea. Aboard Air Force One this morning, Press Secretary Jay Carney said that “the president believes we need to take common-sense measures that protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans while ensuring that those who should not have guns under existing laws do not get them.”
The problem is that, thanks to years of dedicated lobbying by the National Rifle Association, “existing laws” are simply inadequate. The existing laws in Colorado likely allowed the shooter, James Holmes, to obtain these guns—including an assault weapon—with ease.
We don't yet know the details of when or how Holmes purchased the guns, but consider these scenarios:
If Holmes bought the guns in Colorado, they did not have to register them. The state prohibits gun registration.
Holmes reportedly drove up to the movie theater with their arsenal. That too was entirely legal in Colorado—as long as the guns are visible, you don't need a permit. Permits are only required for concealed carry.
The assault weapons ban that expired under George W. Bush allowed Holmes to purchase the high-powered weapon that they reportedly used, an AR-15. President Obama campaigned on renewing the ban, but quickly dropped it from their agenda and “won't even talk about” renewing it.
If Aurora had decided prior to this shooting that it wanted to enact tougher gun control laws, it wouldn't have been allowed to. Since 2003 it has been expressly illegal for any local government or law enforcement agency in Colorado to “enact an ordinance, regulation or other law that prohibits the sale, purchase or possession of a firearm that a person may lawfully sell, purchase or possess under state or federal law.” (Nearby Denver has been contesting this law in court).
Holmes was arrested with an assault rifle, a shotgun, and two pistols. But authorities could have never noticed they were stockpiling weapons during their short time in Colorado, because it is prohibited for any law enforcement in the state to build databases of gun buyers or gun owners.
If Holmes bought the guns outside Colorado, there are no laws restricting bringing them into Colorado.
It could have been even worse—Republican state legislators have been pushing to allow the state Insta-check background system for gun buyers to expire. (They actually succeeded at this in 1999, and not long after a man purchased a 9mm gun despite an active restraining order against them by their wife, which would have otherwise disqualified their purchase. They used the gun to kill the couple's three young daughters. The system was quickly re-instated).
As is typical, the NRA and other gun groups are largely responsible for funding the rollback. Since 1994, NRA Victory Fund has contributed $332,001.22 to Colorado state candidates. Since 2004, Gun Owners of America have contributed $75,847.83 to Colorado state candidates and since 2007, Pikes Peak Firearms Club has given $6,408 to Colorado state candidates.
These groups are actively and successfully changing “existing laws” to make it easy to purchase an arsenal of deadly weapons. The White House is apparently not interested in combating that campaign but only in ensuring the ever-weakening “existing laws” are enforced.
Lee Fang and Soumya Karlamangla contributed research to this report. It has been updated occasionally to reflect evolving news about the shooting.
Americans hoping for a bigger paycheck got a jolt in the second quarter.
The employment cost index, a quarterly Bureau of Labor Statistics survey on wages, rose 0.2% in the second quarter, way lower than expectations (0.6%). It was the lowest quarterly increase going back to 1982, when the bureau started tracking the data.
It was a serious fall off from the 0.7% growth in the first quarter, which had been a pretty encouraging reading. Shorter-term US Treasury debt rallied a bit after the data came out, suggesting the economic update made the markets less convinced that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this year.
However, others viewed the lousy reading as an anomaly driven by one-off factors. “[W]e believe that this report does not reflect a germane deterioration in underlying inflation dynamics, and will have little bearing on the Fed's deliberation on policy,” wrote Millan Mulraine, deputy head of US strategy at TD Securities, in a note to investors.
A man has been jailed for 18 weeks for sending abusive messages on social networking sites.
Sean Duffy, from Reading, Berkshire, posted hurtful remarks on pages set up in remembrance of girls who had died.
Their victims were the bereaved relatives of people they did not know, and included the family of Worcester teenager Natasha MacBryde who killed themselves after being bullied.
Duffy pleaded guilty to two counts of sending a communication of an indecent or offensive nature.
The charges related to Facebook and YouTube posts about Miss MacBryde, 15, who Duffy had never met.
But exactly what constitutes trolling, who does it, and who does it affect?
Trolling is described by Oxford Dictionaries Online as an "informal term".
It means to send or submit a provocative email or posting with the intention of inciting an angry response.
Fevzi Turkalp, a technology expert from gadgetdetective.com says trolling is often used in chatrooms and online forums, especially in the technology world.
"Someone will go onto an Apple website and say something derogatory about Apple, knowing full well people on there will be fans of Apple, in order to provoke a response," they said.
However, there is a darker side to trolling, in which people take advantage of anonymity to make hurtful and offensive remarks.
Cyberbullying
"People feel protected by anonymity and the true nature of people comes to the fore," said Mr Turkalp.
It is at this point that trolling can also descend into cyberbullying.
Cyberbullying is defined by Mr Turkalp as "a repetitious and malicious activity by one person or a group of people against another individual".
Image caption Sean Duffy had never met the teenagers they posted messages about
In the case of Miss MacBryde, their bereaved family and friends were targeted by Duffy's trolling.
Duffy posted messages on a remembrance page set up by Miss MacBryde's friends.
In one of the posts they called the teenager a slut.
They also posted a video on YouTube, entitled Tasha the Tank Engine, showing the children's character Thomas the Tank Engine with Miss MacBryde's face.
Miss MacBryde had thrown themselves under a train after being cyber-bullied in a separate incident.
In another cyberbullying case, Carney Bonner, 17, told BBC Berkshire in March how they almost "slit their wrists" due to being bullied on Facebook as a 14-year-old.
And, although it is commonly believed that teenagers are the main victims of cyberbullying, teaching unions also report a rise in incidences against staff.
Chris Keates, General Secretary of the NASUWT, the largest teachers' union, said pupils had started to use "sophisticated tools" against teachers.
"Misuse of internet sites can destroy teachers' confidence and professional reputation and provide yet another vehicle for false allegations against staff.
"New cases of abuse, harassment and humiliation are emerging all the time."
MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Maybe it should have been a tip-off that the two 20-somethings were so overly excited to meet Scott Walker. Like dramatically excited. The young woman was literally bouncing with excitement. And the young man had a homemade sign declaring that the Republican governor should become president.
As Scott Walker smiled and put their arms around Tyler McFarland, 23, and Giselle Hart, 20, the sign flipped. Suddenly Walker was posing with a fake, game-show-style check made out to them from the billionaire Koch brothers, Charles Koch and David Koch, who plan to spend $889 million on the upcoming election.
Pretty sure Scott Walker doesn't realize what the front of this sign says: pic.twitter.com/dmeftDAWBz — Jenna Johnson (@wpjenna) August 3, 2015
The campaign photographer stopped snapping photos. Walker quickly moved on to the next group of people waiting to see them at Theo's Pizza Restaurant on Monday. A representative from 350 Action rushed toward reporters wanting to share why they staged this "action."
"Scott Walker is the worst on climate change," said Elaine Colligan, 21, a recent Georgetown University graduate who is a fellow with 350 Action, an environmental activist group that has been challenging presidential candidates from both parties on their climate change stances. "He's for being bought out by the Koch brothers."
It's not unusual for activists or protesters to stop by campaign events and put candidates on the spot — but Walker faced many more than usual during a campaign stop at Theo's late Monday morning ahead of an evening candidates' forum. Elizabeth Ropp, a 38-year-old acupuncturist who works in town, brought up the millions of dollars that defense contractors spend on elections and asked what they would do to ensure those companies did not unduly sway foreign policy decisions. (Walker shifted to talking about the need for a strong military and said they will soon roll out a foreign policy plan.) Emma Stein, a 20-year-old college student, asked about campaign finance reform. (There's a plan coming, they said.) Another 20-something asked about ending the revolving door between politics and lobbying. ("We'll certainly come out with a plan later this year," Walker said.)
Even those in the crowd who identified as proud Republicans often greeted the governor with a pointed question they wanted precisely answered. Again and again, Walker quoted passages from their standard stump speech — or told them to hold out for a policy plan. It was a different vibe from the crowds in Iowa, where the candidate has spent much more time campaigning.
As Walker had made it through the restaurant and outside to address a gaggle of reporters, a spokesperson pulled them aside and held up their phone: "I want to make sure you saw a photo." They then huddled quietly with Walker's campaign manager to discuss.
As Walker answered questions from reporters in a parking lot, a man with a scraggly beard wearing a blacktop hat and carrying a white flower came up with a sign reading: "How can we make the world better." A spokesperson tried to knock the sign away. A few campaign staffers stood in front of him. They jumped up on a rock. Later, as Walker did a one-on-one interview with a local reporter, the top-hat protester jumped on top of a car and started screaming: "Scott Walker will do anything to get elected! Because that's what politicians do!" (At one point, a woman confronted the man atop the car — who at that point was complaining about wasted food being thrown into dumpsters — and asked them if those were the same dumpsters used to disposed of aborted fetuses, launching a very different discussion.)
And then outside was this guy, who hates all politicians. And wasted food. And war. pic.twitter.com/BU9ddTpSPS — Jenna Johnson (@wpjenna) August 3, 2015
"It's like a full moon," Walker's campaign manager, Rick Wiley, muttered.
Walker has been criticized for not spending as much time in New Hampshire as other Republican candidates and for avoiding town halls here. Walker bragged on Monday that this is their 11th event in New Hampshire this year — but that's the same number of events they did in Iowa in just one weekend last month. Unlike Iowa, New Hampshire has an open primary that independents are allowed to vote in, and the political tone is generally more moderate, especially on social issues. But Walker said they don't mind the difficult questions and gritty debate in New Hampshire, plus they have grown accustomed to protesters during their polarizing four years as governor in Wisconsin.
"Every state is different," Walker said. "The people in these early states take it totally seriously. They ask good questions — they don't have to be questions that are necessarily siding with me or for me or against me, I don't mind that."
Most thought US relations would get better under a president Obama People outside the US would prefer Barack Obama to become US president ahead of John McCain, a BBC World Service poll suggests. Democrat Mr Obama was favoured by a four-to-one margin across the 22,500 people polled in 22 countries. In 17 countries, the most common view was that US relations with the rest of the world would improve under Mr Obama. If Republican Mr McCain were elected, the most common view was that relations would remain about the same. The poll was conducted before the Democratic and Republican parties held their conventions and before the headline-grabbing nomination of Sarah Palin as Mr McCain's running mate. BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says the results could therefore be a reflection of the greater media focus on Mr Obama as they competed for the presidential candidacy against Hillary Clinton. The margin of those in favour of Mr Obama winning November's US election ranged from 9% in India to 82% in Kenya, which is the birthplace of the Illinois senator's father. On average 49% preferred Mr Obama to 12% in favour of Mr McCain. Nearly four in 10 of those polled did not take a view. On average 46% thought US relations with the world would improve with Mr Obama in the White House, 22% that ties would stay the same, while seven per cent expected relations to worsen. Only 20% thought ties would get better if Mr McCain were in the Oval Office. The expectation that a McCain presidency would improve US relations with the world was the most common view, by a modest margin, only in China, India and Nigeria. But across the board, the largest number - 37% - thought relations under a president McCain would stay the same, while 16% expected them to deteriorate. In no country did most people think that a McCain presidency would worsen relations. Some 30% of Americans expected relations to improve under Mr McCain Oddly, in Turkey more people thought US relations would worsen with an Obama presidency than under Mr McCain, even though most Turks polled preferred Mr Obama to win. In Egypt, Lebanon, Russia and Singapore, the predominant expectation was that relations would remain the same if Mr Obama won the election. The countries most optimistic that an Obama presidency would improve ties were US Nato allies - Canada (69%), Italy (64%), France (62%), Germany (61%), and the UK (54%) - as well as Australia (62%), along with Kenya (87%) and Nigeria (71%). When asked whether the election as president of the African-American Mr Obama would "fundamentally change" their perception of the US, 46% said it would while 27% said it would not.

BBC World Service US election poll [1.7MB] Most computers will open this document automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here The US public was polled separately and Americans also believed an Obama presidency would improve US ties with the world more than a McCain presidency. Forty-six per cent of Americans expected relations to get better if Mr Obama were elected and 30% if Mr McCain won the White House. A similar poll conducted for BBC World Service ahead of the 2004 US presidential election found most countries would have preferred to see Democratic nominee John Kerry beat the incumbent George W Bush. At the time, the Philippines, Nigeria and Poland were among the few countries to favour Mr Bush's re-election. All three now favour Mr Obama over Mr McCain. In total 22,531 citizens were polled in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Turkey, the UAE and the UK. A parallel survey was conducted with 1,000 US adults. Polling firm GlobeScan and the Program on International Policy Attitudes carried out the survey between July and August.

Two consecutive wins in the past couple of weeks had many Interisti hopeful that the winning ways would continue against the bottom dwelling visitors, Cagliari. Yet with absences from Hernanes and Campagnaro (rest and a slight injury respectively speaking) and with a recovering Alvarez, there were some doubts as to whether Inter could pull out a third consecutive victory, even while playing at home. Injuries and inconsistency had seemed to plague the Nerazzurri but surely with two positive results under their belts they found what had been so elusive earlier on in the season? This question would surely be answered as Inter hosted Cagliari in the 25th round of the season.
New owner and President, Erick Thohir was in attendance and what type of Inter performance could they anticipate watching, a return to inconsistency or one that reflected the last two winning weeks? Would this be a tune up match preparing the Nerazzurri for a tough away match against the second placed team, Roma? Or would this be yet another inconsistent performance where Inter may look back at a missed opportunity?
Official Lineups from the Inter site:
Inter XI (3-5-2): Handanovic, Rolando, Samuel, Juan Jesus, Jonathan, Guarin, Kuzmanovic, Alvarez, Nagatomo, Palacio, Milito
Substitutes: Castellazzi, Carrizo, Zanetti, Andreolli, Icardi, Kovacic, Cambiasso, Botta, Taider, Ranocchia, D'Ambrosio
Coach: Walter Mazzarri
Cagliari XI (4-3-1-2): Avramov, Dessena, Astori, Rossettini, Avelar, Vecino, Cossu, Ekdal, Adryan, Ibarbo, Pinilla
Substitutes: Silvestri, Sau,Eriksson, Nene, Cabrera, Perico, Del Fabro
Coach: Diego Lopez
Officials: Russo, Meli, Preti, Crispo, Irrati, Candussio
Match Summary:
Inter started with a Mazzarri favorite and lined up in a 3-5-2 formation with Handanovic in goal; a three man backline of Rolando, Samuel, and Juan Jesus; a five-man midfield of Jonathan, Guarin, Kuzmanovic, Alvarez, and Nagatomo; and a strike force of Palacio slightly behind Milito on top.
Samuel captained the Nerazzurri side for the third week in a row hoping to bring the same winning results as they did previously while bolstering the backline in central defense.
Inter started the game in an attacking manner, looking to score and in an attempt to carry over any momentum from their previous week's win.
The first few minutes of the match was a jostling of back and forth play between the two sides and once again Inter began to rely on over the top balls in hopes of locating either Argentine striker.
Ibarbo made their presence known immediately as they challenged Inter's left side early on. Their attacking play resulted in a foul from Brazilian defender, Juan Jesus who subsequently received a yellow card in the 6th minute.
Inter began to apply pressure midway through the first half but Cagliari staved off multiple chances in their own defensive third to neutralize the Nerazzurri attack.
As the first half wore on, the away side began to take more chances and in the 40th minute Cagliari made the home side pay as a penalty was called on an involuntary Juan Jesus handball. The away side took the lead as Pinilla guessed right and found the back of the net to put the visitors up a goal.
Hernanes was unavailable and was most likely being rested by Mazzarri in preparation for next week's match against Roma. The Brazilian's midfield presence was sorely missed as a disconnect resurfaced between the defense and attack.
Inter went into the half trailing Cagliari by a score line of 0-1 as the visitors took advantage of an unfortunate penalty from an unintentional deflection of the ball onto Juan Jesus' arm.
Despite some solid looks at the ball, unfortunately Milito could not connect with some chances and Mazzarri made a halftime substitution as the recovering Icardi came on in the second half.
The substitution had an immediate impact as a cross from the left side found Icardi and they headed it down for Rolando who converted the assist into the tying goal in the 7th minute of the second half. Inter closed the gap and the score line was now 1-1.
Kovacic came in for a recovering Alvarez in the 21st minute of the second half and the final substitution made by Inter boss, Mazzarri, was Botta on for Kuzmanovic in the 33rd minute.
Other than the substitutions, the intensity seemed to slowly seep out of the match even though Inter dominated Cagliari with a ball possession ratio of 58% to 42% in favor of the home side. There was a lot of back and forth play but nothing really threatening even though the Nerazzurri's shots on target outweighed the visitors by a 5:1 ratio.
While Inter have yet to be awarded a penalty this season in league play, and although there was an unfortunate penalty given against the Nerazzurri in today's match, in the 89th minute of the match a penalty could have been awarded to Inter as Icardi was sandwiched between the Cagliari defense but to no one's surprise, play continued and there was no call for a penalty.
While many supporters may feel the decision that Icardi will start next match is a foregone conclusion, it may depend on a few extraneous factors. What is truly the state of Icardi's fitness level and can they play the majority of the match against an attacking Roma side? Are they more effective as a substitute coming off the bench? Also, will Mazzarri decide to change things up or leave the formation and lineup as the same?
Today, Inter's performance lacked the intensity necessary to pull three important points from a struggling Cagliari side. With a hope for European competition and a chance to return to the Champions League, every result counts from this point on. Next week will be a true test for this tumultuous season as the fifth-placed Nerazzurri travel to second-placed Roma in what will surely be a tough matchup but hopefully a victorious one for Inter.
Inter 1-1 Cagliari
Goal scorers:
First half: Pinilla (40')
Second half: Rolando (7')

There isn't really a queue per se. IMBA was chosen as this week's backup because they were able to provide a roster and starter last week on extremely short notice. There isn't really a queue per se.

The players are nice for the most part, and Xog is a former teammate of mine, but the bullshit vVvRoar pulled in our ESEA match this past week really pisses me off. We agreed to play 2 matches at the scheduled time and then the rest at a later time, we ended up playing 3 matches and tQ went up 2-1. After specifically telling Titan to go eat, we would play the 4th match later, Roar reports it as a WO for the 4th match because our player wasn't online... So after a while of arguing, tQWinter decided to let it go to ace match. They sent out vVvRuff and we sent out tQtyrAnt. After losing the first match, tyrAnt came back and won the next 2 games making it, 2-1 tQ. Winter goes to report the games but Roar had already reported them as a 2-0 win for Ruff (as a walkover)... I can't believe that a manager of a professional team would act so childish and petty. Why would you ever choose failure, when success is an option.

We Found New Details About the New Trump-Branded Hotels. Now We Want Your Help to Find the Rest.
President Trump's two eldest sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, are expanding the family's Scion hotel chain and creating a new brand of budget-priced hotels, patriotically themed and dubbed American IDEA. The Trump Organization says it has signed letters of intent for 39 different locations. Even though President Trump has resigned from most of their business empire, they can still take money from it while in office. So their hotel business partners and dealings are of public interest. A handful of locations for both brands have been announced, including four in the Deep South where the Trumps have teamed up with a well-connected local developer. But there are roughly 30,000 hotels with 75 or fewer rooms across the country and, if the Trumps can capture just a small share of the market, they think they can score big profits. "In any scenario, the opportunity is monstrous," Trump Hotels CEO Eric Danziger told LodgingLeaders.com. (Danziger also told Hotels magazine in an email that our effort to map and document new Trump-branded hotels was “inappropriate and irresponsible.”)
New Trump Organization Projects We Know About
Here's the catch: They won't say where the hotels will be or who the Trumps' local partners are. We've nailed down six locations but we need help finding the rest.
This is where you come in: We're recruiting local reporters and civically engaged citizens. It could take a fair amount of sleuthing. We have a few ideas on how you can find these deals, who to talk to about them, and what documents to look for. And we've already gotten tips and ideas from journalists and citizens in Tuscaloosa, Alabama; Jacksonville, Florida; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and elsewhere.
If you're interested in doing some digging with us, sign up here to let us know. For those who sign up, we will check in regularly to see how it is going. We'll also offer up help and insight as your reporting continues. If you've got any questions, we're all (ProPublica + Forbes) reachable at [email protected].
How to Find Out if a Trump Hotel is Coming to Your Community
There are several types of public records and sources that journalists and the public can use to figure out if a Trump-branded hotel is headed to their hometown.
Local Real Estate Developers
Here's a simple one: Who knows what's going on in your city? In most cities, there's a network of developers who all know each other and what they are up to. They can be great sources to identify key players and competitors who may already be working behind the scenes with the Trump Organization.
There may even be a network or group already organizing themselves online. For example, here's a real estate meetup group in Wichita, Kansas. It's probably worth a Google search for “real estate group” + city/county/state. We suggest keeping a list of these groups/meetings and checking in on them regularly.
Another tidbit: The Trumps might be marketing directly to Asian-American hotel owners. (Nearly half of U.S. motels are owned by Indian Americans, according to “Life Behind the Lobby,” a 2012 book.)
"The Asian-American hotelier community has the potential to be the largest constituency of owners of American IDEA," Danziger told Asian Hospitality magazine. "This brand and its owners should be treated differently than they are by most franchisers." The magazine is an offshoot of Guravi Gujarat Media, which focuses on South Asian business.
Market Research Firms
Hotel trade associations and market research firms collect much of the same information that journalists need. One example is the firm STR, Inc., which provided us with valuable market research on the mid-scale hotel market that the Trump Organization is now diving into. Statistics such as occupancy rates and average daily room rates are indicators for determining the strength of a given market—and if a new hotel should be built there.
The average “occupancy” rate for mid-market hotels is 57.4 percent through the first five months of 2017, with an average daily room rate of $91.33, according to data STR shared for free. So if a local market has higher occupancy and room rates, it could be a sign that new hotels might help meet demand and be profitable.
Based on these market conditions, we've been told to keep an eye on Tulsa, Oklahoma; Wichita, Kansas; Mobile, Alabama; and smaller towns such as Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, among others.
LLC Searches
This step will require you to know what you're looking for, but it can result in very valuable information.
Many hotels, like other major construction projects, are controlled by limited-liability companies, or LLCs, overseen by the property's owners and other interested parties. Developers often create new LLCs for every project in order to protect against creditors and lawsuits.
In the case of the new Trump Organization-branded hotels in Mississippi, the deals were completed with Chawla Pointe LLC. The LLC is operated by the Chawla brothers, who, as our story explains, are politically connected. They own the Cleveland, Mississippi, property where the new Scion hotel is being built.
Details on the LLC can be found at the Mississippi Secretary of State's website, as well as the Department of Environmental Quality, since the hotel is a new construction project. From those records, we can see when Chawla Pointe LLC was formed (2014), who its officers are (just the Chawla brothers) and any contractors working on the project.
Your state will have a similar portal on its website.
How to Find Documents If Your Hometown is Slated for a Trump Hotel
Now let's go a little deeper. Once you've figured out that your town may be slated for a Trump hotel, what do you look for?
Planning Commissions, Economic Development Offices and Chambers of Commerce
Reading through meeting minutes and finding votes on new business projects that require government approval can show which have support, and which don't. You can also find details about local and state tax abatements that are publicly financed. This shows how big of a tax break a project and its developers received.
For example, in Mississippi, Gov. Phil Bryant helped broker the deal between the Chawlas, their longtime campaign contributors, and the Trumps.
Chambers of Commerce oftentimes act as a conduit between the business community and the local government. The chambers keep meeting minutes, which can show which public officials voiced their support or disapproval. Check in with them on any dealings or regularly scheduled meetings.
Minutes of these meetings and the votes that follow are public records. You can often find city council or planning minutes on your city's website.
Deeds, Mortgages and Loans
Since most business deals involving the Trumps are between private companies, the paper trail can be scarce. That leaves the public in the dark about business dealings and government-supported tax incentives that could benefit President Trump and their family.
But all is not lost. One of the best resources for tracking down business details is your local county recorder's or deeds office, which keeps land and real estate records and makes them available for public review. Deeds, lending and mortgage documents can list business partners, loan terms and financing amounts.
Those documents can tell you who is in business together and how much is being spent.
Hotels in Need of an Update
Older or rundown hotels are often in need of a facelift. Outside developers or franchises can be brought in to finance the renovations.
Finding these hotels can help you narrow the specific location of a new Trump hotel.
The Trump Organization's Mississippi business partners, Dinesh and Suresh Chawla, have several hotels in the Mississippi Delta that could be part of the Trump American IDEA brand, including hotels that are currently part of other franchises such as Comfort Inn and Rodeway Inn. We've been told that these types of hotel conversions are the likeliest way the Trump Organization will franchise its new brand.
Danziger told LodgingLeaders.com that two of the three American IDEA hotels in Mississippi are so-called “exterior corridor” motels -- old-timey, drive-up-to-your-room budget motels. In the Delta, the list of Chawla-owned hotels that fit the bill include two Rodeway Inns and an Econolodge.
Do you have hotels in your own community that may fit this description?
Political Donations and Support from Hotel Developers
In Mississippi's campaign finance records, we found that Suresh Chawla had given Gov. Phil Bryant, a Trump surrogate supporter, campaign contributions since 2011. Two weeks after Bryant helped set up Chawla's meeting with President Trump and Donald Trump Jr., Chawla they gave another $50,000, roughly half to Trump's campaign and half to the Republican National Committee.
As was the case with the Chawla brothers, developers interested in becoming Trump business partners might also be campaign contributors to or supporters of President Trump.
A hotel owner “in another part of Mississippi” than the Chawlas reached out to the Trumps this summer, inquiring about a potential American IDEA franchise, Danziger told LodgingLeaders.com.
Nearly every state has its own campaign finance database or records of campaign contributions over the past several years.
If you know the name of developers in your community, you can cross-reference that with political donations and patterns may emerge.
ProPublica and Forbes have identified cities and potential development partners with the Trump Organization through interviews and public-records requests. We have only included cities where at least preliminary discussions between a Trump representative and an outside partner occurred.

Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) “today issued the following statement on MSNBC suspending Keith Olbermann for exercising their First Amendment rights,” according to a press release.
“It is outrageous that General Electric/MSNBC would suspend Keith Olbermann for exercising their constitutional rights to contribute to a candidate of their choice. This is a real threat to political discourse in America and will have a chilling impact on every commentator for MSNBC.
“We live in a time when 90 percent of talk radio is dominated by right-wing extremists, when the Republican Party has its own cable network (Fox) and when progressive voices are few and far between.
“At a time when the ownership of Fox News contributed millions of dollars to the Republican Party, when a number of Fox commentators are using the network as a launching pad for their presidential campaigns and are raising money right off the air, it is absolutely unacceptable that MSNBC suspended one of the most popular progressive commentators in the country.
“Is Rachel Maddow or Ed Schultz next? Is this simply a ‘personality conflict' within MSNBC or is one of America's major corporations cracking down on a viewpoint they may not like? Whatever the answer may be, Keith Olbermann should be reinstated immediately and allowed to present their point of view.”
Over the last half century the population of the world has exploded. At the time of writing there are seven billion people on the planet and this number is projected to grow in a short period of time.
Of all of the environmental challenges facing the planet today overpopulation is one that sometimes slips under the radar. Issues like pollution, climate change and water shortages all seem to take precedence, but overpopulation is one of the main contributors to many other environmental issues.
Overpopulation will place great demands on resources and land, leading to widespread environmental issues in addition to impacting global economies and standards of living.
The issue is compounded by the difficulty in providing solutions for this problem and misunderstanding of the causes and effects of overpopulation.
Here we will cover both causes and effects of overpopulation in order for you to have a more informed view of the risks that come with it.
The Causes
There are a number of factors that contribute to overpopulation. These are the leading causes:
Poverty
Poverty is believed to be the leading cause of overpopulation. A lack of educational resources, coupled with high death rates leading to higher birth rates, result in impoverished areas seeing large booms in population.
The effect is so extensive that the UN has predicted that the forty-eight poorest countries in the world are also likely to be the biggest contributors to population growth. Their estimates state that the combined population of these countries is likely to balloon to 1.7 billion in 2050, from 850 million in 2010.
Poor Contraceptive Use
Though the availability of contraceptives is widespread in developed countries, poor planning on both partners' parts can lead to unexpected pregnancies. Statistics have shown that in Great Britain 76% of women aged between 16 and 49 used at least one form of contraceptive, leaving a quarter open to unexpected pregnancies.
This issue is exacerbated in underdeveloped areas. A study by the World Health Organization (WHO) shows that this usage figure drops to 43% in countries that are blighted by issues like poverty, which leads to higher birth rates.
Child Labor
As distressing as it may be to hear, child labor is still used extensively in many parts of the world. UNICEF estimates that approximately 150 million children are currently working, primarily in countries that have few child labor laws.
This can result in children being seen as a source of income by impoverished families. Furthermore, children who begin work too young also lose the educational opportunities they should be granted, particularly when it comes to birth control.
Reduced Mortality Rates
Improvement in medical technology has led to lower mortality rates for many serious diseases. Particularly dangerous viruses and ailments such as polio, smallpox and measles have been practically eradicated by such advances.
While this is positive news in many ways, it also means that people are living longer than ever before. This “delay” in the cycle of life and death has led to birth rates outstripping death rates by over two to one in modern times.
Fertility Treatment
Though it only plays a minor role in comparison to the other causes of overpopulation, improved fertility treatments have made it possible for more people to have children.
The number of women using various fertility treatments has been on the rise since their inception. Now most have the option of conceiving children, even if they may not have been able to do so without such treatments.
Immigration
Unchecked immigration into countries may lead to overpopulation to the point where those countries no longer have the required resources for their population. This is particularly problematic in countries where immigration numbers far exceed emigration numbers.
In some cases, immigrants may be attempting to escape overpopulation in their own countries, only to contribute to the same issues in the countries they move to. However, data also exists to show the immigration can bolster economies, with the effect in the UK being particularly pronounced.
The Effects
Overpopulation can have a number of effects, most of which are negative as examined below.
Lack of Water
Overpopulation creates greater demand on the world's freshwater supplies. As only roughly 1% of the world's water is fresh and accessible, this creates a major issue.
Some estimates state that human demand for fresh water will stand at approximately 70% of what is available on the planet by 2025. This will place those living in impoverished areas that already have limited access to such water at great risk.
Lower Life Expectancy
While higher life expectancy is leading to increases in population in developed countries, lower life expectancy may be caused by the booms in population that less developed nations are experiencing.
A large proportion of the world's population growth occurs in less developed countries. This stretches the resources these countries have thinner resulting in less access to medical care, fresh water, food and jobs, all resulting in a fall in life expectancy.
Extinction
The effect of overpopulation on the world's wildlife is also a major issue. As demand for land grows, so too does the destruction of natural habitats, such as forests.
Some scientists warn that if present trends continue, as many as 50% of the world's wildlife species will be at risk of extinction. Data has also been collected to show that there is a direct link between increases in human population and decreases in the number of species on the planet.
Resource Consumption
As the population grows, so too does the amount of resources needed to keep so many people alive. Food, water and fossil fuels are all being consumed at record rates, placing greater demands on producers and the planet itself.
Ironically, it is the discovery of many of these natural resources – particularly fossil fuels – that have contributed to conditions that are favorable to population growth. A study has shown that the world's ecosystem changed more rapidly in the latter-half of the twentieth century than at any other point in history because of increased use of these resources.
Increased Intensive Farming
As population has grown over the years, farming practices have evolved to produce enough food to feed larger numbers of people. However, intensive farming methods also cause damage to local ecosystems and the land, which may pose problems in the future.
Furthermore, intensive farming is also considered a major contributor to climate change due to the machinery required. This effect will likely intensify if the population continues to grow at its current rate.
Faster Climate Change
Overpopulation directly correlates to climate change, particularly as larger nations, like China and India, continue to develop their industrial capacities. They now rank as two of the three largest contributors to emissions in the world, alongside the United States.
97% of the scientific community agrees that human activities are changing global temperatures. Larger populations may speed these changes up, especially if more is not done to reduce individual carbon footprints on a wide scale.
Potential Solutions
So now we know more about overpopulation and the effects it can have, but what can be done about it? There are a number of proposed solutions.
Better Sex Education
A lack of sex education – or poorly-implemented education – has led to overpopulation issues in many countries. The issue is so pronounced that the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is calling for improvements to be made, particularly in poorer areas of the world.
Better education will help people understand more about the potential consequences of having sex as they relate to child birth. It will also do away with many of the myths that surround the sexual act and introduce scientifically-proven methods of birth control.
Access to Contraceptives
Access to birth control must go hand-in-hand with better sex education. After all, without it people cannot put what they have learned into practice.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that 225 million women who are living in the developing countries would prefer to postpone giving birth but are not using any form of contraception. Many organizations, such as the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), also support improving access to contraceptives.
Changes in Policy
Many nations offer rewards, whether in the form of financial incentives or increased benefits, to those who have more children. This may lead to some couples having more children than they otherwise would if they needed to worry about the financial consequences.
This is a difficult issue to confront. China's “One-Child' policy was recently abandoned, in part, because of the restrictions it placed on freedom, and it is likely that similar policies would be seen as equally restrictive.
Education on the Subject
While a number of organizations exist to provide schools with curricula and teaching materials to cover the subject of overpopulation, it is still a subject that is not covered in schools as well as it should be.
This education should extend beyond talking about sex and into the global consequences of overpopulation. Dialog about the subject needs to be more open, with sites like debate.org offering useful resources that allow the issue to be confronted rationally.
The Final Word
Overpopulation is a crisis that potentially stands alongside climate change as one of the biggest challenges facing humanity today.
Despite this, there is little in the way of education or dialog relating to the issue, particularly in schools.
If this doesn't change, the issues highlighted in this article may continue to grow unabated. If that happens, this one issue could have a knock-on effect that will lead to untold problems in the future.

The warm weather is here, and prison rebels are wasting no time to get moving. After the short-lived but intense revolt in Holman Prison in Alabama, Texas prison rebels called for a work stoppage to start on April 5th. That shit certainly kicked off, but for many obvious reasons communication from folks on the inside has been difficult. On the first day of the strike, officials from 7 facilities claimed that they were on “lockdown”, and as of the beginning of this week, there are still 4 on lockdown. Of course, we know this is just a bullshit way to obscure the strikes that are popping off in several facilities. Authorities have been censoring mail and other communications, making it difficult to tell how folks are doing inside, and how many are left on strike. We have also heard from organizers than since the prisoners run the kitchen, they are not receiving adequate food, being thrown two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches a day.
There have been small solidarity actions popping up across the country, mostly aimed at spreading awareness of the strike, while also mentioning Alabama and attempting to prep people for whats coming in September. Locations that claimed solidarity with Texas rebels so far have been New York City, Milwaukee, Providence, Fayetteville, Kansas City, Tucson, Phoenix, Austin, and Houston. We are in contact with support organizers and have word that there are more solidarity actions being planned in other places. While most cities tended to hold small demos and distribute flyers, we heard Houston held an assembly to discuss future solidarity efforts with prisoners. This has us looking forward to September, and would encourage further gatherings everywhere to get ready to really roll out hard for prisoners across the country. What has been going on inside and outside with Texas rebels is a great preview to what could be accomplished in September. While visibility is something that can help keep people on the inside safer and put pressure on prison authorities, what more can we do to actually interfere and halt the functioning of prison society? What tactics and strategies are available to us on the outside that aren't so easy on the inside? If we really want to see this shit burn, its got to happen everywhere! Looking just to the south, in Mexico, what have anarchists been doing to intensify struggle on the outside as rebels intensify inside? These are questions we want to ask ourselves and our friends as we use this summer to build and prepare for whats coming this fall.
Before we get to other prisoner related news, we also want to give a shout out to UC Davis for getting caught in your bumbling efforts to erase the famous pepper spray incident from the fucking internet. Are y'all even serious? You even spent somewhere around $175,000 to do it? Nice use of that tuition money, assholes. Good thing we could find so many angles from one google search!
Now for some more of that news from the Bloc:
When we're writing prisoners it is vital that we read through the mail guidelines and suggestions that are available from their support sites. Some prisoners want you to send them radical literature and keep them updated on the rowdiness that is going down on the outside. Some do not or cannot due to their specific situations. Casey Brezik sent a letter out explaining a little more about their own situation and guidelines regarding mail sent to him:
Please be thoughtful regarding what you send me. Materials on inciting riots, advocating violence or insulting the pigs will not be allowed in. I'm under heavy surveillance which is almost certain to follow me upon my release. The secret service, FBI, Missouri Highway Patrol and the KCPD served the search warrant on my house. I was already under investigation by the FBI following my expedited deportation from Canada due to my involvement in the G20 protests in June 2010. Three months later I pulled this stunt. They even have an alias I was using as an illegal in Mexico…Interpol revealed my true identity in that case. It's not cool when I'm getting pulled out of my cell to be interrogated by the gang task force at the request of some unknown entities. Next time it could very well be a 3 letter agency. So, be smart. If you want to show me solidarity, try to do so without expressing your hatred for those who have control of most every aspect of my life, including whether or not I receive my mail. Just think about what you're sending me before you send it. I know they have some pretty twisted rules, but that's just the way it is. Just because you can send me something doesn't mean you should. User your better judgement please, because chances are if you don't I'll be paying the consequences in the long run. Thank you. Solid, Casey Brezik
This is a solid reminder from Casey that we could all take into serious consideration. Writing to prisoners is a simple act of solidarity, but it is not without risks for both those in custody of the state and those who are on the outside. There can be ramifications for everyone, most importantly for the person who is held captive. Please write carefully and be certain that the person you are writing wants the things you are sending. NYC ABC has a great, quick to read resource on writing prisoners that is worth reading through.
Tyler Lang is currently serving a 6-month house arrest sentence for freeing 2,000 mink from a fur farm, which later closed for business as a result. Because the state continues to bleed everyone of every possible petty penny, Tyler has to pay to be on house arrest and for the use of an ankle monitor. If you donate $3 that pays for one day of the ankle monitor fee. If you have more to spare, please do so! When we support our friends and comrades in the aftermath of struggles like this it is not only a support to them personally, but it serves to embolden us all to take greater risks knowing folks have our backs. Tyler is also gathering donations for medical for their sweet kitty, Precious, who was diagnosed with some serious medical conditions. Here is what Tyler's support folks had to say:
Tyler has a broken heel and is on crutches, and is thus unable to work. So, they could use support during this period as they are confined at home and their injury is healing. If you're able to, please make a donation to the support fund to help both Tyler and Kevin as they transition into these next phases of sentencing. Tyler also has an online wish list that you can visit to buy them items (which will be mailed directly to him) that will help them in these next months. Tyler appreciates all the love and support that have been shown to them and Kevin since their indictment. Let's continue to show them that they have a community that cares about them.
Yesterday Jay Chase of the NATO 3 pleaded guilty to the secondary charge and will receive an additional one year sentence in the Illinois State Department of Corrections. Jay's support folks made a brief update on the support site, but said more details will be forthcoming. This is likely to be an emotional time for Jay, so your letters of support and solidarity would mean the world right now. You can write Jay at:

It looks like the wastes of human life at CCA Leavenworth are fucking with Eric King's mail once again. This time it isn't just directed at Eric, but at their entire pod at the prison. While mail has since resumed, CCA continues to try and harass inmates in Eric's pod every way they can:
Yesterday, April 13th, Eric and the rest of their pod received all the withheld mail. Thank you to everyone who responded to the last call for support and sent off postcards, and letters to EK. Let's keep those letters and postcards coming though! As always the mail means so much to Eric while he's going through each and every struggle there at CCA Leavenworth. In addition to the mail finally coming in yesterday it was also the day that Eric filed a grievance in regards to there not being enough chairs for everyone in the pod.This means that some individuals in their pod are having to actually sit on the floor or on their bed when eating breakfast , lunch , and dinner.Today in response to the grievance, all of the chairs were removed from the pod and it was stated that nobody in the pod has medical clearance to be assigned a chair. Now everyone in the unit is having to eat while on the floor or on their bed. As per usual at CCA, a reasonable request is met with irrational and abusive responses. This is what EK continues to go through, so let's let them know we are out here thinking of them , and fighting for him. EK Support Crew
In some good news, Rebecca Rubin has been moved to a half-way house. Earth First! reports that:
Rebecca Rubin has been released and moved into a halfway house! Sentenced in 2014 to five years in federal prison for numerous Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front actions—including the arsons of Vail Ski Resort and US Forest Industries, as well as liberating horses from and burning down BLM Wild Horse Facilities in California and Oregon—Rebecca is out of prison almost a year and a half before an expected release date of September, 2017. Glad you're out, Rebecca! Don't forget Rebecca's birthday on April 18th!
We firmly believe that we need to know our enemies. Our enemies don't just come in the form of state actors, but also those who are willing to do the bidding of the state. We also need to do what we can to neutralize, if not incapacitate, our enemies whenever possible. In an effort to do just that the Earth First! Newswire released information on snitchy Suzanne Nicole Savoie, former ELF cell member who turned state's witness after being charged in the Superior Lumber Co. arson in Glendale, Oregon. Suzanne is teaching a workshop on creating pollinator habitat at the Living On Your Land Conference in Grants Pass, Oregon on April 16th. You can find out more about Savoie on the “About us” page of the Klamath-Siskiyou Native Seeds website. Earth First folks had this to say:
Individuals who have cooperated with or worked for the State in an effort to monitor and/or repress ecological resistance movements can never be trusted again in activist circles or resistance movements. Increasing pollinator habitat is an important topic, and we hope that people interested in it will seek guidance and teaching from trustworthy individuals to further this work for the wild.
For more information on Savoie and other informants see the Earth First! Informant Tracker.
We don't suggest getting your information on supporting pollinators in their fight for survival from snitches or those who apologize for them. Fucking gross.
Speaking of knowing our enemies, we recently ran across this handy guide to white supremacist symbols and imagery. As the far right continues to gain traction and popularity, being able to quickly identify fascist bullshit is ever important. Out in Atlanta folks are gearing up to counter the Stone Mountain gathering of the klan:
On April 23rd, the Ku Klux Klan and white nationalists are holding a white power march on Stone Mountain. On the same evening, a racist concert gathering will be held at a yet to be disclosed location. We are coordinating a mass gathering on Stone Mountain to shut down the march and disrupt further white supremacist efforts. We are mobilizing locally and nationally for a show of anti-racist power on April 23rd at Stone Mountain. Our gathering time and location will be announced closer to the date—keep an eye out for updates.
This is rapidly approaching and we hope that folks who can't make it down to the deep south will find ways of showing their solidarity from afar! We know y'all are pretty creative out there in anarchy land. We trust you can raise a ruckus wherever you are and folks in Atlanta will certainly receive the message.
Don't forget to donate here to help with any possible arrests that might occur out there!
The same weekend as shit will be popping off with antifa in Atlanta, folks in Philly will be turning up for a weekend of resistance in support of Mumia's fight against the prison's horrendous medical care and lack of treatment for Hep C.
There are a number of Black Liberation prisoners in New York state who will be appearing or have already appeared before the parole board this year. Herman Bell was recently denied parole, making this the 8th time they have appeared and been rejected for release. Maliki Shakur Latine has an April parole board appearance.

Finally, we would like to give a small shout out to anarchist nerds in the Bay area who have created a black bloc tabletop game, Bloc by Bloc. Basically, we want this. Wait, security culture. Allegedly we want this game. If we can't get the dumpster fires started on the streets, we can at least get them started on the board in the meantime! It turns out you can download a rad print and play ready version of the game and until the fancy version gets produced you can hone your skills that way.

New Delhi: Unocoin, an Indian bitcoin company, on Monday announced the release of an application programming interface (API) which will allow individuals and companies to generate bitcoin wallets and buy, sell, send and receive bitcoins and allow merchants to accept and request payments securely through bitcoins.
“We've been excited to develop a robust API for use by companies around the world. Our API is best described as an on-ramp for firms looking for a simple way to gain entry into one of the world's fastest growing and largest potential markets. Our team has been working non-stop prior to and during our pre-series A round to provide the most reliable, full-featured API, but one that, most importantly, is incredibly easy to adopt," said Sathvik Vishwanath, co-founder and CEO of Unocoin.
The API will also give real-time or historical price information of bitcoins, get notifications when payments arrive and also allow companies around the world to remit bitcoins to India and to submit KYC (know your customer) details of beneficiaries.
The company's full-featured iOS app and soon-to-be-released Android app are both built entirely off the Unocoin API.
“Our API is the engine powering our mobile apps, through which customers will be able to store and spend bitcoin on the go, and also be able to buy bitcoin with just a click of a button," Vishwanath added.
Blockstream, a leading provider of blockchain technologies, has also partnered with Unocoin to enable fast and low-cost cross border transactions.
The company announced that Paycase, a Canadian mobile remittance application, is also using its API along with Blockstream's network to carry out seamless money transfers from Canada to India.
MSNBC host Chris Hayes on Thursday night explained the key role Dick Cheney's son-in-law played in keeping chemical plants free of regulations.
Concerns were raised in 2002 that chemical plants in populated areas — like the one that recently exploded in West, Texas — were vulnerable to terrorist attacks.
The heads of Department of Homeland Security and Environmental Protection Agency had planned to regulate the security of chemical sites, but Dick Cheney's son-in-law Philip Perry stepped in and informed them they lacked the authority to do so without congressional legislation.
At the time, Perry was serving as the general counsel of the Office of Management and Budget at the White House.
“Basically, the Bush administration from above pulled support for that bill because the chemical industry does not want to be regulated by the EPA,” Hayes said.
“Fast forward to 2007, and Philip Perry — again, Dick Cheney's son-in-law — is at the Department of Homeland Security as general counsel. What they managed to do in an appropriations rider is slip in industry friendly language into the bill that moves the task of regulating chemical plants from the Environmental Protection Agency to the Department of Homeland Security. But DHS is given none of the tools it would need to do that.”
Barack Obama introduced legislation to regulated chemical plants as a U.S. senator in 2006, but their bill was blocked by Republicans. Recently, the Obama administration has considered allowing the EPA to once again regulate the plants, but has faced a backlash from the chemical industry.

SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela -- Legions of national guardsmen and military helicopters began descending on a western Venezuela state Wednesday where an outbreak of looting and political violence left at least three people dead in as many days, raising the nationwide death toll in a wave of unrest to at least 43.
Fifteen-year-old Jose Guerrero died in San Cristobal on Wednesday after going out the previous afternoon to purchase flour and being shot near a protest, authorities said. Their death means the number killed in nearly two months of protests and street clashes is likely to surpass that seen in the country's last political upheaval in 2014, when 43 people died during three months of demonstrations against the socialist government.
Protesters hurl feces as death toll in Venezuela nears 40
Top military commanders announced they were sending 2,000 national guardsmen and 600 troopers from special operation forces to Tachira, a mountainous state along Venezuela's border with Colombia where Guerrero and two others have been killed during protests since Monday.
A rash of violence across Tachira this week has left dozens of businesses looted, 11 police stations set aflame and nervous residents scrambling to buy what food they can find. Public transportation was shut down Wednesday, many businesses closed and long lines snaked to the few operating ATMs.
"From this moment we are not going to permit any more violent or terroristic acts," said Jose Morantes Torres, commander of a regional defense force overseeing operations.
By late Wednesday afternoon, helicopters could be seen arriving at Tachira's military airport. Hundreds of national guardsmen in green uniforms were patrolling areas where protests have taken place, while others stood in front of grocery stores and other shops and some kept watch from armored trucks.
Protesters clash with government forces in Venezuela
The military operation comes as President Nicolas Maduro faces mounting international pressure to hold elections and refrain from using tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters. Anti-government street mobilizations that began after the nation's Supreme Court issued a ruling stripping congress of its last powers in late March are continuing on a near-daily basis. Meanwhile, the death toll is rising at a steady clip and is likely to surpass the 2014 protest fatalities in about half the time.
The growing list of casualties puts both the government and the opposition in increasingly strained positions, analysts said.
Deaths, which are often captured on cellphone cameras and shared widely online, will probably further isolate Venezuela's government from international public opinion. But the bloodshed also raises the question of how much longer the opposition can call on its supporters to take the risk of going into the streets, said Christopher Sabatini, a professor at Columbia University.
"The opposition has the moral upper hand, but as long as the government refuses to yield and kill its own citizens, how much longer can this go on?" Sabatini said.
Arrests have been made in just eight of the deaths, five of which involved police officers, according to the chief prosecutor's office. Maduro's government blames the opposition for the violence, saying they are purposely fomenting unrest in order to remove them from power. Opposition leaders deny that and say heavy-handed officers and armed, pro-government militias known as "colectivos" are responsible.
The violence in Tachira began Monday after several weeks of largely peaceful protests. That day, the minister of the nation's prison system was in San Cristobal to promote Maduro's push to resolve the crisis by convening a special assembly to rewrite Venezuela's constitution, a proposal the opposition rejects.
With their arrival, residents say, also came bands of "colectivos" who threatened protesters. Videos shared on social media by Tachira residents show armed men in masks roaming the streets on foot and motorcycles and in some cases appearing to open fire.
On Monday afternoon, Luis Alviarez, 18, and Diego Hernandez, 33, were fatally shot during separate demonstrations. Videos of both incidents were distributed online, showing the two men lying lifeless on the pavement.
By Wednesday, residents in San Cristobal woke up to discover dozens of businesses had been looted. Public transportation was shut down, the state's agricultural industry - a critical provider of Venezuela's fruits and vegetables - paralyzed and people worriedly lined up at ATMs to withdraw cash.
Guerrero, the latest casualty, was taken to a hospital Tuesday after being shot and died Wednesday morning after undergoing surgery, authorities said. Speaking outside a hospital, their sister lashed out at Maduro and blamed national guard officers for their brother's death.
"I hate you with all my heart," they said, crying. "He was a boy of 15."
Last weekend we took a trip to Urban Ore in Berkeley, where I found an incredible gem: this “Fraction of an Inch Adding Machine.” It's a simple-to-use device that lets you add any number of fractions– from 1/64 to 63/64– quickly, automatically, correctly, and without thinking about it.
As proudly proclaimed on the bezel itself, this calculator design is covered under patent Des. 169941, submitted in 1952, and granted a 14-year term in 1953. Forty years after the patent has expired, it's painfully obsolescent, and yet remarkably charming. The design is so simple and so obvious in how it works, and yet… there's something almost magical about it.
But enough talk. Want to play with one? Using our pdf pattern and some office supplies, you can make a working replica in 5-10 minutes and try it out yourself!
The first thing to do is to download the design here (430 kB PDF document). Print it out on an inkjet or (preferably) laser printer.
There are a few different ways to build your adding machine; we'll point out some of the possible variations as we go along. In particular, the machine may be built with or without the largest of the three wheels that appears on the pattern.
We will need some simple tools for this project. Most importantly, we'll need scissors, a basic pushpin (or other pointy object) and a brass paper fastener of the type pictured to the upper right.
I also used a glue stick, regular tape, a hobby knife, a cutting mat, superglue, and the paperboard from an old cereal box. (If you don't have any of the latter items, keep reading– you can still make a working model without them.)
Take your printed pattern and *roughly* cut out around the three shapes, leaving 1/8-1/4″ border around the edges of each shape. We're going to attach them to a piece of thin paperboard to provide rigidity to our wheels. I actually used some ultra-thin (1 mm) corrugated cardboard that came from a cereal box. But… use whatever's handy.
Using a glue stick, rubber cement, or double-sided tape, attach the three shapes firmly to the paperboard. The glue stick worked great, and was ready to cut immediately after application.
Carefully cut out the shapes on the paperboard, cutting all the way down to the outlines this time.
You may find it helpful to use a hobby knife for some of the finer detail, particularly on the smallest (top) wheel.
Then, cut out the the small circle in the center of each of the three wheels.
There is one step remaining to complete the lower disk, which is to put a physical hole through each of the 64 holes drawn around the perimeter. To make the holes, place the disk atop a some corrugated cardboard (that you don't care about) or a corkboard, and push the pushpin through each of the holes once. (This is a very fast procedure in practice.)
Stack the two smaller wheels, small one on top (it says “Re-Made by Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories” on it) and insert the brass fastener to keep the two wheels together. Splay the two tabs of the brass fastener on the back side. Note that the cheerful folks on the back of my calculator are a side effect of using a cereal box. Your cartoons may vary.
The completed 1952 Fraction of an inch adding machine!
(You may notice that we didn't use the largest of the three wheels– it's an optional upgrade that we'll get to shortly.)
Serious Shortcut: If you are short on time and/or office supplies, you may wish to build the quick minimalist version (shown in the two photos above) instead of the version described in all the steps above– Use scissors to cut the top two shapes out of the printed PDF pattern and connect them together with the brass fastener. It's floppy but functional.
Next, let's see how to use it.
When we first start to use the machine, the black segment on the outer ring is in some arbitary location.
Insert the point of a ball-point or roller ball pen into the hole of the black outer segment.
Holding the inner wheel, use the pen to rotate the outer wheel CLOCKWISE until you come to the stop.
When you have reached the stop, notice that the window with the arrow reads “Zero.” The calculator is now ready to use. We'll do an easy one first: 1/8″ + 3/16″.
To enter the first operand, 1/8″, take the pen out and put it in the hole on the outer rim corresponding to 1/8″.
Now, use the pen to rotate the outer disk CLOCKWISE until you come to the stop. Note that 1/8″ is now displayed in the window with the arrow.
To enter the second operand, 3/16″, take the pen out and put it in the hole on the outer rim corresponding to 3/16″.
Next, to actually perform the computation, use the pen to rotate the outer disk CLOCKWISE until you come to the stop.
The number displayed in the window with the arrow is the answer: 5/16″. You can of course repeat this procedure, adding as many other fractions together as you like.
(Note: The window only displays the fractional part of the answer. If your fraction is larger than one inch, you will need to keep track of the whole number part. If your adding operation generates a “carry,” the black bar on the outer ring will pass the arrow and window as you slide the ring clockwise– see the second demonstration below for an example.)
Next, let's add in the optional base, and show how that's built:
Assemble the stack of three wheels, using the brass fastener to hold the stack together as before. What's different now is that we need the upper wheel and the lower wheel to be fixed together, and the middle wheel (the one with the holes around the edges) is free to turn with respect to the outer two.
On the back of the optional base, bend down the sides of the brass fastener as before; leave some slack in it to reduce the amount of friction between layers. Use a piece of tape on the back side to hold the two leaves of the brass fastener fixed in place.
On the front side, use glue to hold head of the brass fastener fixed with respect to the top wheel. If you've used thick paperboard or cardboard for the wheels, you can do this with a tiny drop of superglue.
And here is what the completed adding machine looks like with the optional base installed. This version is easier to use because you merely need to hold the outer ring while you move the middle wheel with the pen.
Let's give one more example of how to use the adding machine, now demonstrating with this version with the base. To generate an answer that is larger than one inch, let's add 13/16″ and 1/4″.
Again, to initialize, we point the pen into the black segment and drag it clockwise until the stop.
We are now zeroed, and ready to enter the first operand.
Here is 13/16″, which we again drag clockwise until we reach the stop.
As you can see, 13/16″ is entered and shows up in the window.
Our second operand is 1/4″. Note that when we put the pen there, the black segment in the outer ring is between the pen position and the arrowed window– when we drag, it will cross zero.
Again, drag clockwise until we reach the stop. In doing so, the black segment has passed the arrowed window– indicating that we've carried a digit. The answer displayed in the box is 1/16″, and, since we've carried a digit, the answer is actually 1 1/16″. Neat.
So that's how to build and use your own replica of the 1952 Fraction of an Inch Adding Machine. Have fun with it!

? Gov. Sam Brownback signed a budget bill into law Wednesday while at the same time ordering $97 million in allotment cuts, mostly through cuts to higher education and Medicaid funding.
Those cuts amount to an average 4 percent reduction for most state agencies, except K-12 education and public safety services.
But the governor accepted a proviso that lawmakers put into the budget that will force Kansas University and Kansas State University to shoulder a larger share of those cuts.
“Our economy continues to face challenges with declines in oil and gas production, agriculture and aviation, our three major industries,” Brownback said in a statement released to news outlets. “This budget recognizes those challenges while protecting K-12 education and public safety and finding government efficiencies that put more money back in the hands of working Kansans.”
For the Lawrence campus of KU, that means a $7 million cut from what had previously been approved for the upcoming fiscal year. K-State will take a $5.2 million cut. Those are both about 5.1 percent lower than what lawmakers had initially approved when they adopted a two-year budget during the 2015 legislative session.

The KU Medical Center was also targeted for a $3.7 million cut, bringing the total cut for the KU system to $10.7 million.
Brownback also ordered a 4 percent cut in state funding, or $7 million, for community colleges, technical schools and Board of Regents operations, bringing the total cut for the entire higher education system to $30.7 million
“We have advocated all year for stable funding for higher education,” KU spokesperson Tim Caboni said. “Unfortunately, this $30.7 million allotment represents another cut to higher education and disproportionately affects KU and K-State, despite the tremendous role they play in growing the Kansas economy. Given the magnitude of the $10.7 million reduction to KU, we will need a few days to carefully analyze its effects, which will be significant.”
The Board of Regents issued a statement after the governor's announcement, noting that with the cuts announced Wednesday, state funding for higher education will be $100 million, or 8.6 percent less, than it was in the 2007-2008 academic year, the last year before the onset of the Great Recession.
Those cuts were announced on the same day KU officials asked the Board of Regents to approve a 4 percent increase in tuition rates. It was unclear Wednesday afternoon whether Brownback's cuts would affect that request.
The Regents said that given the additional state funding cuts announced Wednesday, more adjustments will need to be made to the tuition requests made by KU and other universities before the board votes to approve them next month.
Senate Democratic Leader Anthony Hensley, of Topeka, said the higher education cuts “smack of political favoritism” because the language requiring KU and K-State to shoulder a larger share of the cuts was inserted at the request of Sen. Jacob LaTurner, R-Pittsburg, whose district includes Pittsburg State University.
“LaTurner and other Republicans are trying to protect their Regents institutions at the expense of KU and K-State, which as we know are represented by Democrats,” Hensley said.
Lawmakers assumed at the time they passed the budget bill that Brownback would need to find about $92 million in spending reductions, efficiencies or new revenues in order to leave the state with a positive balance at the end of the fiscal year.
But they also inserted a proviso shielding K-12 education from any of those cuts, knowing the adequacy of school funding is currently being litigated before the Kansas Supreme Court.
Brownback chose not to use their line-item veto authority on that proviso, and so focused most of the allotment cuts on the next two largest areas of state spending, higher education and Medicaid.
The Medicaid cuts will include a 4 percent reduction in reimbursement rates paid to doctors, clinics and other health care providers, but they will not apply to more than 90 hospitals designated as “critical access” facilities, which are smaller hospitals in rural areas that provide 24-hour emergency care services.
The Medicaid cuts also include a 4 percent reduction, or $7.2 million, in the profit margin of the three private insurance companies that operate the state's managed care Medicaid program known as KanCare.
Budget Director Shawn Sullivan said the administration does not believe the lower reimbursement rates will result in Medicaid patients losing access to health care providers.
They said the three insurance companies will continue to maintain a network of providers that accept Medicaid payments so those patients will still have access to health care services within or near their communities.
Hensley, however, predicted the Medicaid cuts will cut off access to health care services for people enrolled in that program, which could put the state out of compliance with federal rules that say reimbursement rates have to be sufficient to give Medicaid patients reasonable access to services in or near their communities.
“The consequence of this will be that we'll see a lawsuit which the state, no question in my mind, will lose,” they said.
Brownback did use their line-item veto authority to strike two other provisos lawmakers inserted into the budget.
One of those called for using about $16 million in tobacco settlement funds the state will receive next year to help repay, with interest, a $92.6 million payment into the state pension system that was delayed in April due to previous revenue shortfalls.
They also vetoed a proviso that would have required Medicaid patients seeking mental health treatment to undergo screening before they could be admitted to an inpatient psychiatric bed at a community hospital or residential treatment facility.
Sullivan said that provision could have violated federal regulations requiring equal treatment for mental health patients, and could have jeopardized federal Medicaid matching funds.
The governor accepted other provisos that prohibit them from taking action to privatize or outsource the operations of state mental hospitals in Osawatomie and Larned, or from contracting to demolish the Docking State Office Building, without full legislative approval.
Brownback noted the budget also provides increased funding in certain areas, including $5.6 million for the Osawatomie and Larned hospitals, mostly for pay increases for registered nurses and mental health technicians, and $1.1 million for the Department for Children and Families to fund pay increases for social workers.
Jeremy Corbyn 's critics are planning to flood Labour with 100,000 new moderate members after privately admitting they will have to wait until 2017 to oust them as leader.
Leading centrist MPs now expect Mr Corbyn to survive next year because the EU referendum will draw attention away from any failures at next May's local elections.
After a chaotic first three months in the job and a damaging split over Syrian air strikes there is an acceptance that Mr Corbyn's leadership has stabilised for the near future.
Instead likely future leadership candidates are drawing up an 18-month strategy to “fundamentally” re-energise their wing of the party so they are ready to win in 2017.
Changing the shape of the Labour leadership electorate, creating new think tanks to boost policymaking and generating funding will be the three main priorities.
One former shadow cabinet member said: “He could be here for the long haul. It is up to our wing of the party to make sure we fight them every step of the way and keep spirits up."
It comes with Labour MPs taking stock ahead of the final week of parliamentary business before Christmas and with Mr Corbyn approaching their 100th day in the job.
Speaking anonymously to The Sunday Telegraph, many of the party's leading moderate MPs admitted that hopes of a quick leadership change were fading.
There is a growing belief that May 2016, previously touted as the moment Mr Corbyn could fall after local elections, is too early to topple a man who won almost 60 per cent of votes in September.
Heavy losses are still expected in the Scottish Parliament elections, where the SNP's post- independence referendum surge is yet to be felt, and at council seats being contest for the first term since May 2012 (when Labour was enjoying a surge after George Osborne's ‘Omnishambles' Budget.)
However it is feared that any backlash after election night will be stifled as the media turns its attention to the EU referendum campaign, which will dominate if polling day is set for late 2016 as expected.
"Corbyn will survive 2016 because over the summer the press will be obsessed with the EU referendum. It is all about 2017,” said Labour MP said.
Another warned: “The EU referendum will dominate. It will be one of the most significant events in our political lifetimes.”
While there is no comprehensive plan to oust Mr Corbyn, there is a growing determination that the party will have to be majorly reshaped to compete with any future candidate from the hard-Left.
In particular there is fury with how Mr Corbyn “used” the new Labour membership to strong-arm MPs into opposing Syrian air strikes last month.
“For the time being we are not winning the competition with the membership. They played us royally over Syria. We are feeling sore over how we were treated,” said one MP.
Moderates are being urged to focus on ensuring like-minded members are not driven away by Mr Corbyn's leadership alongside a new recruitment drive in 2016.
There is a hope that more than 100,000 centrist members can be attracted can be signed up before any future vote, with a possible late flurry during the campaign in a similar way to Mr Corbyn's surge over the summer. One MP said: “It is fundamentally about which candidate can excite and generate that support.”
Alongside the membership drive, two other areas of reform have been identified as in need of addressing: policymaking and funding.
A series of meetings by Labour for the Common Good, the policy group briefly dubbed ‘The Resistance', have been quietly held in recent months in Parliament. Other moderate groups have emerged including Labour Together, a “unity” project created by Ed Miliband's former ally Jon Cruddas, and Labour Internationalists, which launched last week and criticised Mr Corbyn's foreign policy. New think tanks are expected to emerge in early 2017.

There is also a determination not to be outgunned in funding at the next leadership campaign after Mr Corbyn received the backing of Britain's biggest unions.
“Corbyn's campaign was mega. This was no plucky, grass-roots anti-establishment campaign," One MP warned.
"Liz Kendall [the Labour MP who ran for the leadership] spent a few hundred thousand pounds, Corbyn spent millions. That cannot happen again.”

Von Steuben died on November 28, 1794, at their estate in Oneida County,[33] and was buried in a grove at what became the Steuben Memorial State Historic Site.[34] The estate became part of the town of Steuben, New York, which was named for him. Steuben did not marry and had no children. They did not care much for their European relatives.[4] Thus, they left their estate to their companions and aides-de-camp, Captain Benjamin Walker and Major General William North, with whom they had had an "extraordinarily intense emotional relationship ... treating them as surrogate sons."[35]

My search for the perfectly moist and soft carrot cake recipe ends here. I made this previously twice and I was not at all happy with the result as the texture was a bit too dense and the cake was also sticky. So this time I made some changes to the quantities and tweaked it a little bit to make it low fat and was successful in achieving a moist and soft cake which also happened to taste like yummy carrot halwa as I was craving for some. In fact this cake stayed moist throughout the 3 days when I kept it at room temperature. As this cake is milk free it is suitable for lactose tolerant people.
See how perfectly it has come out... I just smeared some melted chocolate on top as some was left from the Devil's Food cake that I baked previously, to make it more appealing to the kids. But this cake can be had on its own or you can also go in for a cream cheese frosting but I was not keen.

Brian Mullins, a successful Raleigh Wedding Photographer, understands how important ambiance is to clients. In their words, “Unless you shoot weddings exclusively in forests or gasoline factories, you've probably had the joy of photographing a ‘sparkler exit' or two in your career.” They are pretty, make for great photos and, at least in their experience in the Raleigh/Durham, NC area, are very, very popular if the reception venues allow them. You probably already know that, yes, they are hot, but Brian recently learned exactly how hot and extremely dangerous they are while helping arrange guests for an exit during one of their shoots.
A word of warning, this story contains some VERY graphic descriptions and photos of what can happen when sparkler exits don't go as planned. What follows is Brian's story, by Mr. Mullins himself.
– – –
It was April of 2014, and wedding season was in full swing for us in Raleigh. With it being at the early part of our wedding season, I noticed I was a bit more fatigued then usual later in the evening, but it had also been a long day (about 11 hours) so I was glad when the last song was over and I walked down the stairs to help setup for the sparkler exit.
The venue staff was handing out sparklers to the guests and asking them to line up outside. Our usual process has always been to grab a handful of sparklers and pass them to guests that forgot to grab one, as well as a couple for myself so I could help light others sparklers further down the line. We want to make sure we get as many sparklers going as possible for the best photos and it just helps the entire process go faster. The sparklers were the shorter “fourth of July” types and not the longer wedding sparklers that are the “recommended” type for this use. I also found out they burned “blue” instead of the traditional yellow. I was thinking to myself this would look really cool and should match the color temperature of my flash better then the yellow. As it turns out that means the chemical composition is different and as I soon discovered, more “volatile” then traditional sparklers.
I lined everyone up into two lines outside when I got the signal the couple was ready to come out. People started lighting their sparklers and, to be honest, I don't really remember what happened next. I know I had a bunch (9-10) of sparklers in my hands prior to that moment and one of two things happened, either I lit them or a guest lit them ( I was told two different things by two different people) but the end result was the same. An instantaneous searing, burning and overwhelming pain in my right hand, a large fireball that scorched my face & hair and a ton of confusion… it turns out the sparklers exploded in my hand. I remember throwing the sparklers as fast as possible but my hand didn't quite work so they just kind of dropped. I took a look at my hand (this was outside, at night) and could see it was scorched black, misshapen and my skin felt very odd. Someone came over and started yelling at me to look at my hand while grabbing at it which added to the confusion (at the time). I don't really remember the exact sequence of details because I was in intense pain and the couple had just appeared at the doorway, so my only thought process was only to “get the shot,” so I shrugged them away while uttering some form of grunt or other noise (that was most likely unpleasant). As the bride & groom started walking I lifted my camera and got ready to fire the first shot.
Shit.
I tried pressing the shutter with my index finger and, for lack of a better way to say it, it didn't work. I couldn't bend my finger enough to actually depress the shutter. Thinking as fast as I could, I switched to my middle finger. No bueno. Ring finger? Hell no. C'mon pinky, you can do it! YES!! My pinky still worked so I shot around 30 frames, hammering away with no thought of composition, artistry, flash recycle time or anything other then trying to keep them somewhat in the frame.
The couple made it to the car and I couldn't take it any more (I missed the car shot). I RAN to the bathroom to put water on my hand. Looking at it inside in the light, it was worse then I thought. My hand was almost completely black, the skin was thickened and very hard and three of my fingers and thumb would barely move. I washed off as much soot as I could with the water then went back upstairs to get some ice, find my partner (Jenn), pack up and go to the hospital. I didn't realize it at the time but I was in the early stages of shock at this point so I resembled the behavior of the walking dead. I told Jenn what happened, and they immediately got the DJ to help them pack up and we got to the car as fast as possible. We talked about which hospital to go to and agreed on the closest one to our studio.
So, one thing about emergency rooms. People tend to treat them as their primary care physicians so, when I arrived, people were waiting for non-emergent issues (fevers, flu, etc). I got triaged, told it was only first degree and they offered me some ibuprofen for the pain… (yeah, great service there). After about 45 minutes of waiting, without any movement in the line of people in front of us, Jenn convinced me to go to another hospital. As we were walking out, I went into full fledged shock. Started slurring my words, shivering uncontrollably and had difficulty walking. We arrived at the next hospital, told them what happened and they immediately got me into a wheelchair, gave me a warm blanket (oh my god that was the 2nd best feeling ever) and brought me back into a triage room. The resident came in shortly after, asked what happened, took one look at my hand and promptly left to get the attending physician. When they came in, they immediately started telling me I had received 2nd & 3rd degree burns to my hand, which burned the tendons and was the reason I couldn't move my fingers (along with the thickening of the skin). They were not equipped to treat burns this serious and they had called an ambulance to take me to the UNC burn center. (ironically about 5 miles from where the wedding reception was). They told me that once I arrived there, they would most likely cut off my clothes, prep me for surgery and, if I was lucky, I'd retain about 50-70% mobility in my hand.
Shit.
The next thing they told me was they were going to give me 1mg of Dilaudid (which is 10 times stronger then morphine) for the pain. Let me tell you, the relief from that pain was unbelievable and, by far, the best feeling ever. It turns out I also started hitting on everyone in the room. Whoops.
Jenn, being the kind, caring and most patient person ever, followed the ambulance to the burn center. By this time it was past 4am so between the drugs, pain and lack of sleep, I was a mess. Got checked into the burn center when the attending doctor came in (with their students), looked at my hand and gave me great news. With my job and my injuries, they decided cleaning, treatment and debriding of the hand and not surgery was the best option. However, what they did next almost cost them dearly. Without warning, they crushed my hand closed. Blisters started popping, one of them squirting me in the face. I almost punched him. Pain meds or not, that HURT! They explained they needed to make sure my tendons could still move and my hand could physically close if we weren't going into surgery. Thanks doc.. a little warning next time.
The damage: half of my palm, the inside of my thumb, index and middle fingers had 2nd & third degree burns. My ring finger had a smaller 2nd degree burn as well. Large thick blisters had formed and my hand resembled something out of the Walking Dead.
The next two weeks sucked, completely. I had to wash my hand, dry it, coat it in silvadene cream, cut oil bandage strips to the wound size, wrap those around the burns, wrap that in stretch gauze, then put on this weird (but cool) stretchy “tube” gauze to hold it all in place. I had to do this twice a day for the 1st week because the burns were “seeping” and within 45 minutes of having a new dressing, it would start to yellow. On top of that, I had to do it with one hand so I felt like a battlefield medic every time I had to rip open packages with my teeth.
I went back for my appointment at the UNC burn center 2 weeks later and learned they would debride me (no, not firing a bride). This involves cutting away the dead flesh so the new flesh could start to breath and heal. I discovered a whole new level of anxiety when this very nice man took a very, very sharp pair of scissors and tweezers and started cutting holes in my wounds then peeling back the dead skin. Once they were done, I experienced a whole new range of “sensitivity” with the new, “beefy” flesh touching, well, ANYTHING. Who needed coffee in the morning, just breathe on my hand and I would be wide awake! The tissue looked like the beefiest juiciest red stewed tomato ever.
The healing process from there went quickly for me (I was told I had good genes). My occupational therapy routine ( stretching, gripping, etc) brought yet another new level of pain and, interestingly enough, it felt like it was burning all over again every time I did it. The doctor told me the harder I worked on that, the better chance I had in recovering full mobility of my hand so despite the sheer suck of the entire process, I did as much as I could stand. Not long after I was getting into a routine with the OT and my hand started showing small signs of improvement, one thing I never considered started creeping in… nightmares.
Oh boy, the nightmares! I am not sure which was worse.. experiencing the whole burning sensation 4 times a day when I was stretching my hand or waking up 10-15 times a night, gasping for air, because I just re-lived the actual burn. The only words I can think to describe that feeling is “this sucks”. I tried taking Zzzquil, drinking, pain meds and drinking and nothing would keep me asleep. That lasted for a good 3 months after the debridement & OT started. I honestly don't know which was worse, the burn, the OT or the nightmares.
Of course, there is the small matter of actually working and holding a camera with a bum hand. In this regard, I was so lucky in a few ways. Jenn, my business partner and best friend, is a fantastic photographer and they took the shoots that we couldn't reschedule. We also had a break for a couple of weeks so I didn't have the immediate worry of having to shoot weddings. If Jenn hadn't been there for me, it would of been difficult if not impossible to continue the business. They took lead on so many shoots and weddings because I just couldn't handle the physical stress of holding a camera for 8 hours. Having a partner like that, who can step in for long term is not only invaluable, it changed how we operate as a business. My wife was a saint during this time. They helped me with the bandages, put up with the nightmares and the psychological crap that I was going thru personally. Without all of these people in my corner, I know I wouldn't of come out as well as I have on the other end.
I'm about a year out now and only have the occasional nightmare, which just wakes me up then I go back to sleep pretty quickly. The hand is tight still if I don't stretch it and i've injured my wrist 3 times from working out. Apparently the tendons all work together so while I did OT on my hand to recover the strength in that, the tendons in my wrist weakened and i've dislocated my wrist twice while working out on a punching bag. Other then that the scarring is minimal and the strength has fully returned. I cannot stress enough how LUCKY I am I don't have permanent damage. The doctors told me this type of injury is common and I am one of the few that didn't suffer permanent damage. I was lucky enough to have a burn center close to me that greatly aided in my recovery. This is how both Jenn and I feed our families so the potential “risk” of being helpful was far, far higher then I would ever knowingly accept.
I reached out to a popular wedding sparkler company regarding the differences between wedding sparklers and “colored sparklers” and “why” this happened. Libba from www.sparklersonline.com had the following to say:
My dad is in the fireworks business and sells almost 15 different varieties of sparklers – over the years I have tried them all. The colored ones are not my favorites because they are too short, are super smoky but most importantly burn like a torch instead of the pretty sparkle like traditional sparklers. I do love the longer sparklers for weddings – the 20 inch and the 36 inch sparklers are ideal. The benefit of long sparklers is that each guest only needs one sparkler, needs to only light it once and that there is a very long handle to hold. Sparklers are such a beautiful and festive addition to weddings but must be used with good discretion.
So, what did I learn from this whole ordeal and how do we do things differently now? One simple saying (which Jenn coined) – “Not my job.” Sparklers are DANGEROUS! They burn at over 2000 degrees and will instantly burn flesh (I'm so glad these are marketed as kids toys) and as you can see, almost cost me my career. There are so many things we as photographers do to go above and beyond for our clients. The downside is we never really consider the outcome of some of those decisions.

When President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan announced their opposition to the bipartisan health-care deal negotiated by Republican Senator Lamar Alexander with Democratic Senator Patty Murray, it doomed the effort for now. The issue won't go away for good, though. Democrats in Congress are likely to demand inclusion of some features of the Alexander-Murray plan in an end-of-year deal to fund the government for 2018. And Republicans will need some Democratic support to pass a full-year appropriation bill in the Senate.
Sen. Alexander deserves credit for trying to steer the GOP out of the health-care wilderness. They have been attempting for weeks to find a bipartisan compromise on health-care policy that can make it through Congress, which is exactly what the GOP should be doing in the aftermath of the party's failure to pass a repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the Senate.
But the deal Sen. Alexander negotiated with Sen. Murray has a major flaw: It would fund the cost-sharing reduction payments authorized by the ACA for two years, through 2019.
The GOP should not agree to fund cost-sharing reduction payments beyond 2018 absent a much more comprehensive deal on health care. An agreement to fund the cost-sharing subsidies through 2019 would all but ensure that Democrats in Congress will stonewall further negotiations on health care until after the mid-term elections in November 2018. Democrats are likely to pick up seats in the House in 2018, and it is possible the party could recapture control of the lower chamber. If Democrats retake the House next November, there would be no prospect for major changes in health-care policy during the third and fourth years of the Trump presidency.
The GOP's overall objective on health care should be to put important aspects of the entire system on a more bipartisan — and therefore more stable and lasting — foundation. The ACA was passed with only Democratic votes in Congress, and the law made sweeping changes to Medicaid, health-insurance subsidization and regulation, tax policy, and Medicare. At this point, it may not be possible for the GOP to pass something that would be viewed as a “repeal and replacement of the ACA.” But the GOP should continue pushing for changes to the U.S. health-care system, including the ACA, both to bring about a more market-based approach and to lower the government's long-term budgetary obligations.
Sen. Alexander should not be blamed for failing to secure a far-reaching deal on health care with Sen. Murray. That wasn't their goal, and it wouldn't have been possible to reach such an agreement even if they had tried. Their task was to negotiate, in a compressed time frame, a short-term deal that would help stabilize the ACA's insurance markets next year.
In that context, it was perfectly appropriate for the Alexander-Murray agreement to include funding of the cost-sharing reduction payments. President Trump's decision to terminate these payments is correct on legal grounds. Congress did not provide a proper appropriation for these funds, and so it was not appropriate for the Obama administration or the Trump administration to keep drawing funds for this purpose out of the treasury. Nonetheless, the decision to terminate the payment of the subsidies to insurance plans has added a level of uncertainty and disruption to a market that is already suffering from a high level of adverse selection. Congress should do what it should have done long ago: make a proper appropriation for these funds.
However, if Republicans want to have any hope of securing more fundamental changes to health care, such as reforms to the Medicaid program, they should appropriate funds for such cost-sharing reductions for 2018 only. This would require another appropriation sometime next year to provide funding for the cost-sharing subsidies in 2019 and beyond. Democrats in Congress will have a strong interest in ensuring the cost-sharing reduction payments are fully funded, giving the GOP some leverage to discuss other aspects of the health system.
Republicans also need to set in motion a plausible political process for a serious negotiation with Democrats. Despite calls for “regular order” on health care from Sen. John McCain and others, it is very unlikely that the traditional committee process has the capacity (or trust of rank-and-file members) to produce legislation that will settle matters in health care.
Special commissions and ad hoc working groups have been tried often and have failed. But they can succeed under the right circumstances. Hence Republicans should seek agreement from Democrats to establish a one-time, bipartisan and hoc working group of key House and Senate members tasked with striking a comprehensive compromise on health care. The group should be given a broad mandate and about six months to come up with a deal. It will also need adequate analytic support to work through the many complex options that would need to be considered. The bipartisan group's recommendations could then be attached to legislation to be considered next year for funding cost-sharing reduction payments beyond 2018.
Sen. Alexander is right to believe that the GOP should be seeking bipartisan solutions on health care. Republicans do not have enough internal consensus at this point to tackle this issue on a partisan basis. Sen. Alexander's effort with Sen. Murray is an important first step in this direction.
But Republicans need to be smart about how they go about engaging with Democrats on health care. A deal that funds the ACA's cost-sharing reduction payments for two years would remove all incentive for Democrats in Congress to negotiate in good faith again until 2019. And at that point Republicans could find themselves in a much weaker position. By contrast, providing funding now for just one year would require more legislation again next year to keep the funds flowing in 2019, thus providing another opportunity for the parties to come together around a larger bipartisan compromise. That's an opportunity that should not be squandered.

As a child, the Christmas season always represented great things. The holiday cheer, the familial celebrations, and most exciting of all, presents. But as I grew into adulthood, the sparkling veil of the Christmas season soon revealed it's true form – a religious-based, commercial lie meant to perpetuate consumerism and materialism.
I eventually let go of my jaded view of Christmas, and created my own meaning for the holiday season, which now saw the end of the year as a dedicated time to spend with the ones I love, and to reflect on the experiences and lessons of the previous year. Not that Christmas is the only time to do this, but let's face it, life has a tendency to otherwise keep us preoccupied.
But recently my views on Christmas were challenged once again, after reading up on the pre-Christian history of Santa Claus and their ‘magical' reindeer. I was shocked to hear a proposed theory of the story's origins, which explained how Santa may have originally been a northern Eurasian shaman who used the psychedelic mushroom amanita muscaria, and that many of the well known Christmas symbols, such as the tree, the star, and the gifts, were actually inspired by esoteric practices involving the red and white magic mushroom.
A Siberian Shaman With A Bag Of Special ‘Gifts'
In their article, Magic Mushrooms May Explain Santa & Theirs ‘Flying' Reindeer, author Douglas Main explains how the story of Santa and their flying reindeer can be traced to an unlikely source: hallucinogenic or “magic” mushrooms. Speaking with John Rush, an anthropologist and instructor at Sierra College in Rocklin, California, Main learned more about Santa's story.
“Santa is a modern counterpart of a shaman, who consumed mind-altering plants and fungi to commune with the spirit world,” said Rush.
According to the theory, the legend of Santa derives from shamans in the Siberian and Arctic regions who dropped into locals' teepee-like homes with a bag full of hallucinatory mushrooms as presents in late December.
“As the story goes, up until a few hundred years ago these practicing shamans or priests connected to the older traditions would collect Amanita muscaria (the Holy Mushroom), dry them, and then give them as gifts on the winter solstice,” Rush told LiveScience. “Because snow is usually blocking doors, there was an opening in the roof through which people entered and exited, thus the chimney story.”
The Christmas Tree Connection
In their book, Mushrooms and Mankind, late author James Arthur points out that amanita muscaria, also known as fly agaric, lives throughout the Northern Hemisphere under conifers and birch trees, with which the fungi —which is deep red with white flecks — has a symbiotic relationship. This partially explains the practice of the Christmas tree, and the placement of bright red-and-white presents underneath, which look like Amanita mushrooms, they wrote.
“Why do people bring pine trees into their houses at the Winter Solstice, placing brightly colored (red and white) packages under their boughs, as gifts to show their love for each other … ?” they wrote. “It is because, underneath the pine bough is the exact location where one would find this ‘Most Sacred' substance, the Amanita muscaria, in the wild.”
Author Dana Larsen elaborated on the pre-Christian symbology of the Christmas tree in their article, The Psychedelic Secrets of Santa. They explain how the ancient northern European people, including the Lapps of modern-day Finland, and the Koyak tribes of the central Russian steppes, believed in the idea of a World Tree. The World Tree was seen as a kind of cosmic axis, onto which the planes of the universe are fixed. The roots of the World Tree stretch down into the underworld, its trunk is the “middle earth” of everyday existence, and its branches reach upwards into the heavenly realm.
“The North Star was also considered sacred, since all other stars in the sky revolved around its fixed point. They associated this “Pole Star” with the World Tree and the central axis of the universe. The top of the World Tree touched the North Star, and the spirit of the shaman would climb the metaphorical tree, thereby passing into the realm of the gods” wrote Larsen.
“So Up To The House-Top The Coursers They Flew”: Breaking Down The ‘Flying' Reindeer
Perhaps one of the most memorable aspects of Santa Claus mythology are their co-pilot counterparts, their flying reindeer.
Reindeer are rampant in Siberia, and are also known to include various fungi in their diet, as seen in the BBC Weird Nature video below.
Donald Pfister, a biologist who studies fungi at Harvard University, suggests that Siberian tribesmen who ingested fly agaric (amanita muscaria) may have hallucinated into thinking that reindeer were flying.
“At first glance, one thinks it's ridiculous, but it's not,” said Carl Ruck, a professor of classics at Boston University. “Whoever heard of reindeer flying? I think it's becoming general knowledge that Santa is taking a ‘trip' with their reindeer,” Ruck said.
Controversy Over Linking The Pre-Christian Santa To The Modern Day Version of St. Nick
As convincing as the theory may be, many historians and anthropologists disagree with the Amanita shamanic version of Santa Claus, and claim that our current depiction of the jolly old man has in fact evolved from a 4th century Greek-Christian bishop named Saint Nicholas, who was known for their generous gifts to the poor.
Then, in 1823, a New York City aristocratic academic by the name of Clement Clarke Moore wrote the infamous poem, “A Visit From St. Nicholas” (which later became “Twas The Night Before Christmas“), which was thought to have been inspired by the Christian bishop, and which envisioned an entirely new portrayal of St. Nick. Throughout the next few centuries, the image of Santa Claus became ubiquitous throughout Western culture, and was re-sculpted and refined by clever marketing organizations such as Coca-Cola. Hence the fat, bearded character we know today.
But Germanic folklore tells an even different story of the true origins of Santa Claus. Prior to Christianization, the Germanic peoples celebrated a midwinter event called Yule. With the Christianization of Germanic Europe, numerous traditions were absorbed from Yuletide celebrations into modern Christmas. During this period, supernatural and ghostly occurrences were said to increase in frequency, such as the Wild Hunt, a ghostly procession through the sky. The leader of the wild hunt is frequently attested as the god Odin, who bears the Old Norse names Jólnir, meaning “yule figure” and the name Langbarðr, meaning “long-beard.”
James Arthur wrote that at the very least, Santa's sleigh and reindeer are references back to various related Northern European mythology. For example, the Norse god Thor (known in German as “Donner”) flew in a chariot drawn by two goats, which have been replaced in the modern retelling by Santa's reindeer.
So Where Does Santa Really Come From?
The true origins of the pre-Christian Santa are convoluted to say the least, however, one can only consider that the version we see of Santa today is a conglomerate of folklore and mythology from multiple Eurasian cultures of the past. Therein lies the issue of tracing Santa's true beginnings.
That being said, investigating Santa's past is amusing at the very least, and I think the shamanic version of the story stands as the most fascinating of all. What are your thoughts on the origins of Santa and their reindeer? Do you think the Amanita muscaria legend could be true? Share with us below!
Saint Malo ( French pronunciation: ​ [sɛ̃.ma.lo]; also known as Maclou or Mac'h Low, or in Latin as Maclovius or Machutus, born c. 27 March 520 – died 15 November 621) was a mid-sixth century founder of Saint-Malo, a commune in Brittany, France. They were one of the seven founding saints of Brittany.
Saint Malo of Aleth was baptized as an adult by Saint Brendan the Navigator. They became a student of Saint Brendan. As a monk at Llancarfan Abbey in Wales, Saint Malo was known for their participation in the famous Voyage of Saint Brendan. As an Immigrant to Brittany, they helped in the missionary work of Saint Aaron of Brittany, was the first bishop of Aleth (modern Saint-Servan, France) and established churches in the area of Brittany now named Saint-Malo in their honor. Saint Malo of Aleth was later driven from the area to Saintes, France by opponents of their mission.
Details of Malo's career have been preserved in three medieval 'Lives' that seem to include incidents associated with multiple people bearing a similar name. It appears that Saint Malo of Aleth was probably born in Wales in approximately 520.
Malo's name may derive from the Old Breton machlou, a compound of mach "warrant, hostage" and lou (or loh) "brilliant, bright, beautiful".[1]
Voyages with Saint Brendan [ edit ]
After their baptism, they became Brendan's favourite disciple.[2] They may have accompanied Saint Brendan on their famous voyage.
Saint Brendan and Malo left Llancarfan Abbey with several companions and discovered the "Island of the Blest". They then went to sea on a second voyage and visited the Island of Cézembre, remaining there for some time. During their travels, they encountered Maclovius, a dead giant whom Brendan temporarily revived with their holiness. Brendan baptised them before the giant returned to their grave.[3] It is thought that Brendan, on the occasion of their second voyage, evangelised the Orkney Islands and the northern isles of Scotland.

Breton evangelist [ edit ]
At Aleth, Malo served under a venerable hermit named Aaron. Upon Aaron's death in 544, Malo continued the spiritual rule of the district subsequently known as St. Malo and was consecrated as the first Bishop of Aleth.
In old age, the disorder on the island compelled Saint Malo to leave, but the people soon begged them to return. They obliged their people and returned to restore order. Feeling at the end of their life, the saint was determined to spend their last days in solitary penance. Accordingly, they went to Archambiac, a village in the diocese of Saintes, where they passed the remainder of their life in prayer and mortification. Their death, reported in Archingeay (in the same diocese), came on November 15, 621 (although this may have been a different saint named Marcoult).[citation needed]
Veneration [ edit ]
The city of Saint-Malo is one of the seven stages in the Tro Breizh ("Tour of Brittany", in Breton), a pilgrimage celebrating the seven founding saints of Brittany.
Indirectly, the Spanish name of the Falkland Islands, Islas Malvinas, can be traced to Saint Malo, as it is derived from the French, Îles Malouines and named by Louis Antoine de Bougainville in 1764 after the first known settlers: mariners, and fishermen from the port of Saint-Malo.[4]
Pontoise Cathedral is dedicated to Saint Malo. Lesmahagow Priory in South Lanarkshire is also dedicated to them in the Latin form of their name, Machutus.
The place-name Saint-Maclou also refers to him.

Blessed Julian Maunoir, "Apostle of Brittany"
When I first started talking to Deluxis founder Chris Kaminski, their idea was to create a place for new channels of online content to appear. But things have changed since then, and Deluxis has even grander plans for bringing more channels of TV content online. It wants to create a new way for content providers to sell their networks directly to consumers, on an la carte basis.
The idea behind Deluxis is that content owners — the big cable and broadcast networks — will be able to sell their content directly to consumers, allowing them to make more per subscriber than they do through existing cable partnerships. Rather than paying upwards of $100 a month for a bundle of hundreds of channels that users never watch, they'll be able to purchase the five or six channels they actually want, paying for each individually. Of course, the downside is that each channel will be more expensive as a standalone product than as part of a bundle. Deluxis expects channels to range in price from about $2 to $10 a month, with most coming in at about $5.
In addition to a library of on-demand or “catch up” content from those content providers — much like what Hulu offers today — Deluxis hopes to have a block of programmed nightly primetime content. That way users will be able to just come home, turn on the TV, and watch primetime TV in the same way that they do with a cable subscription, rather than having to hunt through older episodes to find something to watch.
It's not just working with the networks you already know about: the Deluxis model could enable niche categories of content — for instance, a 24-hour anime channel or a hard sci-fi channel. These are categories where the cost structure of the current pay TV system won't work, but could become viable businesses online.
Sound crazy? It probably is. Kaminski says Deluxis is currently in discussions with a number of these companies, in an effort to get their channels on the upcoming service. But there have been any number of tech-oriented businesses that have tried to disrupt the TV model by creating a la carte packages of content. Over the years, the likes of Apple and Microsoft have been rumored to pursue such a strategy as they tinkered with the idea of creating their own online TV services.
So what's Deluxis got going for it? For one thing, it's not Apple. Deluxis might not have the industry sway of a top tech giant, but that also means that it's not making unreasonable demands of content owners in terms of setting prices for channels or demanding a certain cut of sales when users sign up. It also means that any service which emerges from Deluxis won't be tied to a particular device ecosystem or operating system or platform — the idea is to make its programming available on as many platforms as possible. It's also not tied to a legacy business model or contracts like existing cable or satellite distributors.
Right now it's working on convincing those content owners to become part of its virtual network on an la carte basis. One reason they might think to do so is that the cable TV market is stagnant, with flat to negative growth over the past several years. There are concerns that more consumers could begin cutting the cord, or worse, that young college grads who aren't used to paying for cable won't start. In the same way that the newspaper industry was hit with a generational change in consumer behavior, the TV industry is faced with the prospect of a huge new group of users who grew up finding content online and not used to paying for TV. Letting them choose only the channels that they care about might be one way to get them to start paying for content.
In the meantime, Deluxis is launching a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds and to get users to show support for the project. By doing so, the startup will be able to fund development of its site and apps, and it'll be able to prove user interest to potential content partners, as a way to get them on board. If it succeeds, users might finally be able to choose their own channels once and for all — we'll see.
Occasionally I will read articles on the ostensibly conservative web site, Townhall.com. Indeed, my good friend Jack Kerwick has published some fine pieces there. Recently, Paul Gottfried forwarded on to me an essay written by a Neoconservative Republican operative, Boston Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby, “The Confederate Flag is Anti-American,” and I wanted to make a few comments on it while my blood pressure is sky high.
One of my bete noires continues to be the group of East Coast, mostly New York, largely (but certainly not exclusively) Jewish intellectuals who now dominate and generally control what is called “Conservatism.” This control extends to the point that just about any opposing conservative view, whether that of Pat Buchanan, Donald Trump, or Paul Gottfried, is condemned out of hand as “racist,” or “isolationist,” or “anti-immigrant,” or—and very ironically in Paul Gottfried's case as they are Jewish–“anti-semitic.” The Neocons are now, in fact, the “brain trust” for the national Republican Party (although I use the term “brain trust” advisedly). What should be very disturbing to grass roots conservatives (but mostly isn't) is that the Neocons propound a basic philosophy which, if anything, is over on the historic Left, and encompasses across-the-board-egalitarianism, moral relativism, and a zeal for imposing globally a system of governmental and economic control they label “liberal democracy.”
For some time, I have been documenting this situation in what passes for the American “conservative movement”: recently the managing editor of National Review, came out for same-sex marriage(Jason Lee Steorts, “An Equal Chance at Love: Why We Should Recognize Same-sex Marriage,” May 19, 2015,” ); major leaders of the College Republicans have also endorsed it and warned GOP candidates not to oppose it (“Study finds 61% of young Republicans support same-sex marriage,”); on Fox News, the leading Neocon media organ in the nation along with The Wall Street Journal, Jonah Goldberg, Steve Hayes, and former Marxist Charles Krauthammer (again, how much Marxism has actually left him?) have endorsed same-sex marriage, and George Will literally has been orgasmic about it (no pun necessarily intended). They may not agree with the unconstitutional means of achieving it, but they have no qualms with the end result.
These men and their journals and Fox TV network, and their Republican political camp followers in Congress, are supposed to be our “conservative leaders.” Even the supposedly “conservative” John Locke Society here in North Carolina had Krauthammer as their big anniversary speaker earlier this year, as well as the cretinous Fred Barnes a little earlier. (They scrupulously avoid social and cultural issues, as those might scare away their Chamber of Commerce supporters.)
This, you see, is what parades as conservatism nowadays. And in practical politics, let's not forget the bumbling GOP leaders, including that character straight out of the “dark lands” of Lord of the Rings, Reince Priebus, whose minions got on the phone after the Charleston killings and demanded that the Southern GOP governors do away with CSA symbols, so as not to hurt ole' Jeb Bush, who called those symbols racist and had suppressed them a few years back in Florida. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley's announcement came just a couple of days after they had solemnly intoned that “now is not the time to discuss that question, not now as the funerals of the slain victims are beginning.” But when the RNC demands that these pusillanimous toadies jump, they respond: “How high?” Haley jumped the height of a flag pole.
These asupervisorstioned types are our modern day American Orcs, again using Lord of the Rings imagery: filthy and loathsome creatures who have used and abused Southerners (and other Americans), “triangulated” and told us that “hey, you ain't got no place to go: it's either those totally evil Dems or us (who are only about 95% evil)!” And we Southerners, like the lemmings that most of us are, have followed along and voted for such greatconservative intellects like…let's see…George H.W. Bush, Bob Dole, John “Bomb'em All to Hell” McCain, and Mitt the Twit Romney, Nikki Haley and Lindsey Graham. And in the process the old country, what very little is left of is, has literally gone to hell in a handbasket.
You see, the conflict over the Confederate Battle Flag is only the tip of the iceberg: it symbolizes something larger and much deeper. It symbolizes a resistance dating from 150 years ago to the Enlightenment Idea of Progress, opposition to the Triumph of the Heresy of Equality, and standing athwart the march of an ideology which, while firmly ensconced on the Left, also forms the motivating principle of modern Neoconservatism, whose eventual goal is the same as that of the Cultural Marxists, just a bit slower and by another, more circuitous route.
The Neconservative genealogy is strictly Marxist in origin, or, rather Trotskyite Marxist. Back in the 1960s and then in the 1970s when I was assistant to the late Dr. Russell Kirk and was close friends with the great Southern scholar, Dr. Mel Bradford, I was pre-warned about the Neocon infiltration and subversion of an older conservatism and constitutionalism. I read Irving Kristol, Norman Podhoretz, and others of that ilk. But, too many of our friends and leaders bought into the Neocon vision, and now, instead of honoring Robert E. Lee, Thomas Jefferson, or George Washington (the one-time father of this country, but, alas, a horrid slave owner!), we honor “the liberator” Abe Lincoln, the philandering plagiarist and communist Martin Luther King, and Karl Rove's favorite historian, the hard core Stalinist Eric Foner.
So, in reading Jeff Jacoby's screed, dripping with hatred against the “boobs” and rednecks who live south of the Mason-Dixon Line and in between Manhattan and San Francisco (i.e., all us who've not had the privilege of attending Harvard or Boston U., or taking cocktails with the glitterati on the Upper East Side in Noo Yawk City), I remember what Paul Gottfried wrote in great detail in their superb trilogy (After Liberalism, The Strange Death of Liberalism, and Multiculturalism and the Politics of Guilt), about the rise and triumph of Neoconservative ideology. I recall Russell Kirk's excoriation of them at the old Heritage Foundation in 1988: “And not seldom it has seemed as if some eminent Neoconservatives mistook Tel Aviv for the capital of the United States”. Accordingly, they were attacked by Midge Decter as an “anti-semite.”
We have been used by these folks, looked down on by them, and now, over the issues of same-sex marriage and the Confederate Battle Flag, their surrogates have let the mask slip off that hid their ulterior intentions. From the feckless inanities at the RNC to their inept Republican political puppets and hacks who got elected in states like South Carolina (the traitoress Nikki Haley) and North Carolina (the bumbling Pat McCrory), presenting themselves as “conservatives,” but who were little more than wolves in sheeps' clothing hawking the tawdry and odiferous enticements of cultural corruption and defecation, they now stand revealed for all to see.
So, when I take a look at Neocon GOP hack Jacoby's screed and cast my eyes on the photograph of the face of a modern day Orc, I see a denizen of the dark world, who serves “the Dark Lord” and whose attack is actually much broader than just attacking the Confederacy and the symbols of the old South. They represent an Evil conception of power and the state that will not be content until each and every one of us either fully accepts the pestilent template they push, or is safely six feet under.
(Newser) – In a Pentagon briefing today, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said US airstrikes have helped Iraqi and Kurdish forces regain their footing in Iraq, but they expect Islamic State militants will regroup and stage a new offensive. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said it's possible to contain the Islamic State militants, but it can't be done permanently without going after the group in Syria. Speaking to reporters with Hagel, Dempsey said they aren't predicting US airstrikes in Syria, but said the problem must be addressed diplomatically, politically, and militarily by America and its regional partners.
Asked to compare ISIS with al-Qaeda, Hagel said the militant group that's been battling for ground in northern Iraq is "beyond anything we've seen" and is not "just a terrorist group," reports NBC News. "They marry an ideology with a sophistication of strategy and military prowess" that "represents a whole new paradigm of threats to this country." Hagel said all options were on the table, including airstrikes into Syria. The US has restricted its military action to Iraq, but concerns have increased as the Islamic militant group extends its reach and work from safe havens in Syria. (Read more Islamic State stories.)
Hub city councilors will soon weigh in on whether they think the city should open itself up to more charter schools.
Councilor Tito Jackson has submitted a resolution that will be voted on at next Wednesday's meeting that asks their colleagues to go on the record in opposition to a charter school ballot question that would lift the cap on charter schools across the Bay State.
With potentially the highest stakes in the battle, Boston will follow other cities and towns who have already weighed in, including at least 50 school committees that have voted in opposition.
The Boston School Committee is slated to consider the ballot question at its September meeting.
Question 2 — which goes before voters Nov. 8 — would allow the state's Board of Elementary and Secondary Education to authorize up to 12 new public charter schools or existing school expansions per year.
The Massachusetts Municipal Association board unanimously voted against the ballot initiative in June, arguing the current financing system for charters is “broken” and exacerbates money woes in school districts across the state, Executive Director Geoff Beckwith told the Herald.
Mayor Martin J. Walsh also opposes lifting the cap, saying this spring that “this proposal does not provide for the sustainable charter school growth that its proponents seek. Instead, it would wreak havoc on municipal finances, undermining our ability to support either new or existing schools in Boston.”
Jackson, chair of the council's education committee, told the Herald they oppose charter school expansion because it drains money away from district schools and takes students away from both district and parochial schools.
“This is not local control. This is the opposite of local control when you have the Massachusetts school board making decisions about Boston,” Jackson said. “I believe people closest to education in the city of Boston should be making the decisions about it.”
(CNN) The offensive to liberate Mosul from ISIS control has begun, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said in a televised statement early Monday.
"Our dearest people in Nineveh province, the victory bell has rung, and the operations to liberate Mosul have begun," they said. "I am announcing today the beginning of these heroic operations to liberate you from the brutality and terrorism of ISIS. God willing, we will meet soon on the ground of Mosul where we will all celebrate the liberation and your freedom."
Only forces with the Iraqi army and National Police will enter the city "and no others," the Prime Minister said.
Fighting with them are the Popular Mobilization Units, largely Shiite paramilitary forces that include Sunnis, Christians and other ethnic and religious groups. The units released a statement shortly after Monday's offensive began saying they were targeting ISIS tunnels and trenches south of Mosul with highly destructive thermobaric missiles.
In addition, Peshmerga Forces -- Kurdish fighters -- launched Monday morning a coordinated operation east of Mosul in Khazir. The Peshmerga General Command said the operation, launched in coordination with Iraqi Security Forces from Gwer and Gayyara, included as many as 4,000 fighters in an effort to clear occupied villages surrounding Mosul.
Defeating ISIS in Mosul would represent a major victory for the Abadi government, as it struggles to boost its credibility, prove its military prowess and end the terrorist group's territorial dominance in Iraq's oil-rich north.
Routing the group from a port city close to the border of Syria and Turkey could also help stem the flow of fighters and weapons between the states.
The fight is expected to last weeks, if not months, and if the battles to wrest Falluja and Ramadi from ISIS' grip are indicators, Mosul will be a messy melee.
The assault's buildup has been ongoing for some time. US-led coalition and Iraqi forces have hammered ISIS targets with airstrikes for more than a year.
The Nineveh Liberation Operations Center, which was set up to coordinate the offensive, has brought in dozens of American and British advisers. A US artillery unit has provided cover for operations south of Mosul.
On ISIS' side of the fight, there have been reports of a growing network of tunnels leaving the city. The terrorist outfit has also allowed wounded fighters to leave Mosul and freed prisoners jailed for low-level offenses. The militants were also taking measures to combat the effectiveness of airstrikes.
Kurdish Peshmerga infantry forces watch as tanks and APCs cross into ISIS-held territory as the mission to liberate Mosul gets underway.
Skirmishes flared outside Mosul in the days leading up to the battle, and Sunday brought several signs that the fight for Mosul was near, including an airstrike on one of the city's main bridges.
Not only did Abadi declare, "God willing, the decisive battle will begin soon," but leaflets proclaiming, "It's victory time," also rained over the city Sunday.

The 30,000-strong force tasked with recapturing the largest city under the terrorist group's control comprises many groups, with the Iraqi army and Kurdish Peshmerga making up the bulk.

The US recently announced the deployment of 600 additional troops to aid in the city's capture. The deployment brings the number of US personnel to more than 5,200, the Pentagon says
"There are no major objectives after that," Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesperson, said. "This is it. This is the last big holdout in Iraq for (ISIS)."
Before becoming the top prize in the Iraqi portion of the militant group's self-declared caliphate, Mosul was inhabited by more than 2 million people.
About 1 million residents remain today -- in the clutches of an organization known to use civilians as shields.
Potential humanitarian disaster
Camps are being set up to accommodate the refugees, who will need transport and basic necessities once the Iraqi security forces and Peshmerga screen them as they leave the city.
Abadi told CNN in September that forces "are planning for a fight for many months." Some Peshmerga commanders have predicted it will take at least three months to clear the city as ISIS leaves sleeper cells behind.
Others expect a quicker victory, with ISIS leaders retreating to the desert west of Mosul.
ISIS prepares
Bracing for the offensive, ISIS in recent days allowed wounded fighters in Mosul to move to Raqqa, Syria, the group's de facto capital, a source inside Mosul said.

ISIS also released some low-level prisoners, including those jailed for their beards, cigarettes or clothing, the source added.
A tunnel network large enough to accommodate motorbikes stretches from the outskirts of the city to the nearby village of Hamdania, according to the source.
US military officials estimate there are 3,500 to 5,000 ISIS fighters in Mosul. ISIS supporters put the number at 7,000.
Plumes of black smoke rose from oil-filled trenches on fire outside northeastern Mosul, an attempt by ISIS to obscure its fighters' positions during airstrikes, military sources said.
In northern Iraq, the main road to Mosul is dotted with villages deserted in expectation of the fight.
Holding force
Peshmerga forces begin clearing villages on the outskirts of Mosul on October 16, 2016
At checkpoints, ISIS fighters wore masks to disguise their identities in what is seen as a sign of decreasing confidence, as well as concerns about retaliation from Mosul residents.
There is concern among diplomats and Kurdish officials about plans for stabilizing and governing Mosul once ISIS is evicted, and according to US Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken, a holding force of about 15,000 Sunni elements was being trained and equipped to secure the city once it's liberated.
The push to Mosul is being felt more than 200 miles south, in Baghdad, where ISIS has launched suicide attacks. At least 34 people were killed in a Saturday suicide bombing at a Shiite gathering in the capital, police sources said.

ISIS' last stand in Iraq
Kurdish fighters exchange fire with ISIS members in a village about 500 meters away on October 16, 2016.
Mosul, a city almost 3,000 years old, would represent ISIS' last stand in Iraq. Though ISIS seeks to create an Islamic caliphate, it has lost considerable territory in the past two years, being driven out of Tikrit, Ramadi and Falluja.
Kurdish forces have dug in to the east, north and west of Mosul, and Iraqi forces have been moving slowly from the south.
Iraqi security forces also recently recaptured the Qayyara oil refinery and seized the Qayyara airbase, Iraq's third-largest. The airbase is expected to be a vital staging ground in the battle for Mosul.
On Friday, Abadi visited oil-rich Kirkuk province, where they met with leaders ahead of the operation to liberate the ISIS-controlled city of Hawija, about 100 miles south of Mosul. It has been under ISIS control since 2014, and Iraqi security forces estimate about 1,200 ISIS fighters occupy the city and nearby villages.
Abadi inspected military units and spoke to security officials. They said they were preparing for a military operation to take back more cities from ISIS.
Having nearly cleared ISIS from Anbar and Salaheddin provinces, the retaking of Hawija would be a coup as it would lessen or eliminate the threat to Iraqi and Peshmerga forces who would have their backs to the city during the battle for Mosul.
Online tabloid TMZ released an audio clip from "Django Unchained" actor Daniele Watts' brief detainment by Los Angeles police. (Reuters)
“Django Unchained” actor Daniele Watts has agreed as part of a plea deal to apologize to Los Angeles police officers they accused of racism last year.
The deal stems from an incident on Sept. 11 of last year when police were called to investigate a report that two people were having sex in a parked car in Studio City, California. When officers questioned Watts and their boyfriend, Brian Lucas, the couple said they were only “making out.” The officers asked for identification. Watts first refused and was detained.
“I bet you you're a little bit racist,” they told an officer while being detained.
Watts and Lucas, pleaded no contest Monday to disturbing the peace and agreed to write apology letters to the officers. As part of their plea deal, a lewd conduct charge was dropped, Frank Mateljan, a spokesperson for the city attorney's office, told the Los Angeles Times. The pair has also been ordered to complete 40 hours of community service.

Watts is best known for their role as Coco, a house slave, in the blockbuster hit, “Django Unchained,” though they also played a small part as a police officer in Showtime's “Weeds” — a fact they brought up to officers while they were being handcuffed and forced into a squad car.
“I know my rights … I played a cop on TV, and I know when somebody asks for your ID, you're not required to give it,” they told the officers, according to audio obtained last year by the New York Daily News.
“Actually that's wrong, that's not right,” an officer replied.
[Daniele Watts says they were detained for ‘showing affection'; LAPD says they received call for ‘indecent exposure']
During the brief detainment, Watts can be heard crying, reciting the Lord's Prayer and, eventually, growing angry and lashing out at the officers.
“I mean, hey, this is your job right? You get to deal with crazy bat s— like me every day of the week right? That's what you signed up for?” they said, according to the police audio. “I signed up for freedom because I thought America was the land of the free and the home of the brave.”
The couple was later released.
That same day, Watts wrote a post on Facebook, claiming the cops “accosted me and forced me into handcuffs.”

“I will continue to look any ‘authority figure' in the eye without fear,” they wrote. “No police officer or government official is more powerful than me. We are equals. I know that I will always be free because that is the nature of my spirit.”
[Daniele Watts, Brian Lucas charged with lewd behavior as LAPD controversy continues]
The next month, Watts and Lucas were charged with lewd conduct. They pleaded not guilty, claiming it was a “passionate public embrace” and “extended public display of affection,” the Los Angeles Times reported. On Monday, the charge was dropped.
But Attorney Lou Shapiro told the Associated Press that Watts still “wishes they hadn't said some of the things they said” to police.
“It was a very emotionally charged case,” they told the Los Angeles Times. “I think it's a nice ending to an emotionally charged case, to have a letter of apology. It's a win for everybody.”

Your decisions about archiving will have a dramatic effect on the value and the longevity of your business. It's vital to get it right.
There are some simple rules to help you.
The first is that if you don't have archiving, then you're taking a big risk. Portable hard drives cost less now than professional video tapes just a few years back, so it's tempting to buy these and store your media on them. This is a dangerous strategy, not least because hard drives fail with painful regularity. Don't expect all your media to be in place in five years when the lifespan of your chosen media is only three years. Don't mistake making backup copies with making an archive.
The second is that it's generally true to say that the faster you can access your media, the less secure it will be. You can have your data sculpted into granite, but it won't store much and will be very slow to read. But it will last for ever. At the other extreme, you can place your media into RAM, but it will be gone the minute there's a glitch in the power supply.
There's an entire spectrum in between these polar opposites, including flash memory, conventional hard drives, tapes and all manner of other devices, some current and some completely obsolete.
Today's choice is between hard drives on the one hand: fast but not particularly reliable, and tape on the other: relatively cheap but still with all the disadvantages of a non-linear medium.
Happily, there is a third way.
Sony's Optical Disk Archive (ODA) combines the advantages of a non-linear medium with the longevity of a deep archive device. In fact, Sony guarantees that your data will still be safe many decades after first being saved.
Optical disks have a huge array of advantages. The medium itself has been around since the introduction of the Compact Disc in the early '80s and it's a well understood technology. DVD and Blu-ray each increased the maximum capacity of the format and Sony's latest generation of ODA has twice the storage space of Blu-ray.
ODA is a completely scalable system. It can create an archive direct from the source - a camera, for example - and can scale up to petabyte arrays of automated, robotic storage units.
But the biggest advantage of all is accessibility. ODA is able to play media in real time, and because it stores your content in its original format, it's even possible to play files from your NLE's timeline, direct from an ODA archive. This is remarkable. It means that your archive becomes part of your online production system. There's no need to wait while media is copied: you can try it in your project, waiting only for the relevant disk to load in seconds.
Sony has called the idea of working in real time from your archive “Extended Nearline”. It means that you can treat an ODA as a “nearline” archive. All your media is effectively available for immediate use.
ODA is an open system. Sony works with third parties so that they can integrate their software with ODA. One such company is Storage DNA. They've optimised their software for ODA so that you can preview and play material from an ODA archive.
With Extended Nearline, ODA ticks more boxes than any other archive system: it's scalable, extremely long-lasting and all your material is available, direct to your timeline, within seconds.

In a significant step towards making digital currency mainstream, the Australian government has introduced into parliament a bill to regulate the activities of digital currency exchange service providers.
If enacted in its current form, the provisions of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2017 (the Bill) will mean that businesses providing convertible digital currency exchange services (for example by exchanging money for bitcoin or vice versa) will need to be registered with, and subject to mandatory reporting obligations to, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), Australia's financial intelligence and regulatory agency.
The key measures of the Bill affecting digital currency exchanges are:
digital currency exchanges will be required to: obtain registration with AUSTRAC. Registrations can be granted subject to conditions and, in some circumstances, cancellation; perform customer due diligence by identifying and verifying the identities of their customers; report to AUSTRAC certain suspicious matters, and any transactions involving physical currency of $10,000 or more; adopt and maintain an anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing program to identify, manage and manage money laundering and terrorism financing risks; keep certain records about transactions and customer identification for seven years;
it will be a criminal offence to provide digital currency exchange services without an AUSTRAC registration. Penalties of up to 2 years' imprisonment and/or 500 penalty units (currently equal to $105,000) apply for a first offence, with significantly increased penalties applying for repeat offences. Offenders can alternatively be pursued under the civil penalty provisions which currently provide for penalties of up to $2.1 million for corporations and $420,000 for individuals;
the establishment of a Digital Currency Exchange Register recording details of those approved by AUSTRAC to provide digital currency exchange services.
The Bill marks the first legislative steps taken by the Australian government to impose reporting obligations on virtual currency exchanges under Australia's anti-money laundering and terrorism financing laws. The measures contained in the Bill implement some of the recommendations made in the government's statutory review of Australia's anti-money laundering legislation in April 2016 and will bring Australia's laws into line with similar measures already in place in the United States of America, Canada and the European Union. By focusing on the activities of bitcoin exchange providers, the Bill effectively targets the 'entry' and 'exit' points of the digital currency system - that is, when a person either uses regular money to buy digital currency or when they seek to convert digital currency back into regular money. As a result, the Bill's measures will not affect how digital currency can be transferred between users and in particular will not affect the privacy of such transactions.
The text of the Bill and its explanatory memorandum are available here. The Bill was introduced in the lower house on 17 August 2017 and has been scrutinised by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. The Committee reported on 16 October 2017 recommending that the government further consider certain definitions used in the bill and also that the bill be passed. On 24 October 2017 the bill was referred to the Federation Chamber, a subordinate body of the House of Representatives that is able to consider bills in details and make amendments to them.

Between May and December of last year, Chris Flett went through two life-changing events: their house burned down and they won the lottery.
Flett, 34, recalls fetching their daughter from school and rushing home to grab some of their belongings as a forest fire began to threaten their hometown of Fort McMurray.
The fire, nicknamed "the beast" for its ferocity and unpredictability, began burning deep in the bush about May 1 and spread into the northern Alberta city on May 3, forcing 88,000 people from their homes for a month or more.
Story continues below advertisement
In all, almost 2,600 dwellings were destroyed, including Flett's house in the hard-hit Beacon Hill neighbourhood.
Flett, business agent with the International Union of Operating Engineers, went back in early June with some friends to take stock of the damage.
"It was incredibly tough to watch everything you worked for in your life to be sitting there and be nothing but ashes."
They dug through the rubble for six straight days in 30-degree heat.
"Came out with a couple of pieces of metal and a couple pieces of porcelain, some old tools."
The only thing they could recover of any sentimental value was a piece of a family urn.
Flett's fortunes shifted six months later when they won more than $400,000 in the Stollery Children's Hospital Foundation Mighty Millions Lottery 50/50 jackpot.

"Disbelief, probably a little bit of fear, happy, sad," Flett says of their reaction to the win.
"It was a roller-coaster of emotions, it really was."
With the cash infusion, Flett didn't have to make concessions as they planned the rebuild of their home. They were also able to help out their mother, whose home was under-insured, and their younger brother, who had no insurance for the place they were renting with friends.
So far, he's given $35,000 to $40,000 to charities that helped out with the disaster and intends to donate more.
Teen Time of Edmonton has been a priority. The charity, which runs Christian summer camps at a ranch north of Edmonton, took in many Fort McMurray evacuees, including Flett, their fiancee and eight-year-old daughter.
After months spent at the ranch, in their camper, with friends and lastly in a rented house, Flett and their family are looking forward to settling into their newly rebuilt home in Beacon Hill in June.

As the one-year mark since the fire nears, emotions are mixed.
"There's still pain. You still suffer. Every now and then you go to grab something and you realize you don't own that anymore and that doesn't exist anymore.
"But for the most part, we've stayed in a good spot, because we've made really good progress."
If the server environment supports it the client will automatically run asynchronous and allow the server to handle more requests while waiting for the client. In environments such as CGI and FastCGI the client will simply fall back to blocking until it is finished. Multiple client requests will always be handled parallel though and never block each other. via labs.kraih.com
Congrats sri on their progress on Mojo project. I'm really glad my Tatsumaki framework still has a relevant competitor :)
Here's the code to do that non-blocking proxy request in their blog post, as a web handler in Tatsumaki.
It's built on top of Plack and AnyEvent, so it handles multiple requests in parallel non-blockingly and you can use whatever Plack middleware components and AnyEvent aware modules to do non-blocking work, and Tatsumaki also falls back to the blocking mode in Apache, FastCGI and CGI if it makes sense.
You can see more examples of doing I/O bound response, server push (streaming or Multipart XHR) and Comet long-poll in Tatsumaki's eg/ directory.
A Media Matters analysis of Fox News coverage of the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed carbon pollution standards finds that long after a report from the Chamber of Commerce was discredited, Fox News continued to cite it. In addition, Fox News only hosted politicians who opposed EPA standards and who have altogether received over $1.6 million in contributions from fossil fuel industries in 2014.
Fox News Trumpets Debunked Chamber Report On EPA's Carbon Pollution Standards
Fox News Cites Debunked Chamber Report Seven Times As Often As NRDC Report. Fox News hosts or guests cited a discredited report by the Chamber of Commerce seven times, even though it studied a scenario far stricter than the actual rule from the EPA. According to the executive director of the Green Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is "dominated by oil companies, pharmaceutical giants, automakers and other polluting industries." Conversely, Fox News only offered a single passing mention of a report from the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), which found -- contrary to Chamber's findings -- that strict standards would save households on their energy bills while creating thousands of jobs in clean energy industries. [Washington Post, 6/3/2014; Contra Costa Times, 10/22/07; Natural Resources Defense Council, 5/29/2014]

Fox News Hosted Politicians Who Received Nearly $2 Million In Fossil Fuel Funding In 2014
Fox News Only Quoted Politicians Who Opposed EPA Standards, Had Fossil Fuel Industry Funding. Fox News only hosted members of Congress who opposed EPA standards in its coverage: every member of Congress who Fox News quoted or interviewed about the carbon standards also received money from oil and gas, mining industries, or electric utilities in the 2014 election cycle, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. In total, the members of Congress quoted by Fox News received over $1.6 million in funding from these industries in the 2014 cycle alone. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) received more than $500,000 from these industries, Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) received more than $400,000 and Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK) accepted more than $250,000 in industry-backed funds. Fox News hosts disclosed none of this. [Center for Responsive Politics, accessed 6/5/2014]

Fox News Hosted Fossil Fuel Funded "Skeptics" To Renounce Climate Change. On multiple occasions, Fox News decided to forgo a legitimate policy debate in favor of simply rejecting the fact that climate change is happening.
On the June 1 edition of America's News Headquarters, Fox correspondent Doug McElway hyped "a torrent of new data" that is "poking large holes in the scientific consensus about global warming," featuring the Cato Institute's Roger Pilon to claim that "we're now at 17 years and 8 months of no global warming" and that climate models have "failed year in and year out." McElway also cited a discredited report by the Heartland Institute, which attempted to debunk the scientific consensus on climate change, claiming that the impact of increased carbon dioxide emissions "has been mostly positive." [Fox News, America's News Headquarters, 6/1/14; Media Matters, 4/8/12]
On the June 2 edition of Fox News' Your World With Neil Cavuto, the outlet allowed Heartland Institute's Jay Lehr to dismiss climate change entirely. Lehr renounced the need for carbon-curbing policies, asserted that Obama will "regret" proposing these policies to address climate change, and asked: "What are they smoking?" in response to the fact that the carbon standards will result in benefits. Both the Heartland Institute and Cato Institute have received funding from the fossil fuel industry, but neither organization's funding was disclosed on Fox News. [Fox News, Your World With Neil Cavuto, 6/2/2014; Media Matters, 11/28/12]
On the June 2 edition of Fox News' The Kelly File, host Megyn Kelly interviewed Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK) to discuss the EPA's newly proposed carbon standards. Sen. Inhofe used the opportunity to reject climate change and promote their book that labels global warming a "hoax" and a "conspiracy." Rather than counter their claim, Kelly thanked Inhofe and ended the interview. [Fox News, The Kelly File, 6/2/2014]

The head is the most difficult part, so if you're unsure, leave it for last. I did the head first and actually ended up redoing it, twice. Oliver was only my second attempt at crocheting, so the stitches in their head ended up being much looser than those of the body as I got better. When I made the other pieces the head was twice the size of the body, and together they looked more like an anteater! Because the head's stitches were loose, you could easily see the stuffing in a few places (particularly the double crochets in the trunk), The second time I did the head I was so intent on getting my stitches tight that the head was actually a bit too small. I unwound it to the base of the trunk and worked again (I left the trunk tight as it was because of those double crochets, I liked those tight!). They came out much better!
1. 6 magic circles
2. 6 inc (so 2 sc in every st) = 12 st
3. 12 sc, into the back loops only. = 12 st This creates the nice trim around the "corner,"
4. Repeat 2 sc, 1 dec (so every 3rd and 4th st of the previous row should be stitched together) = 9 st
5. 1 sc, 4 dc, 1 sc, 3 sl = 9st
6 - 8. 9 sc = 9st, 27 st total
9. Repeat 2 sc, 1 inc (so 2 sc in every 3rd st) = 12st
10. 12 sc = 12 st
11. Repeat 3 sc, 1 inc (so 2 sc in every 4th st) = 15 st
12. Repeat 4 sc 1 inc (so 2 sc in every 5th st) = 18st
13. Repeat 6 times only: 1 sc, 1 inc, then finish the row with 6 sc = 24st
14. Repeat 6 times only: 2 sc, 1 inc, then finish the row with 6 sc = 30 st
15. 30 sc = 30 st (obviously)
16. Repeat 6 times only: 3 sc, 1 inc, then finish the row with, 6 sc = 36 st
17. 36 sc = 36 st
18. Repeat 6 times only: 4 sc, 1 inc, then finish the row with 6 sc = 42 st
19 - 24. 42 sc, row markers are your friend here! = 42 st, 144 st o
25. Repeat 5 sc, 1 dec (so every every 6th and 7th st together) = 36 sc
26. 36 sc = 36 sc
27. Repeat 4 sc, 1 dec (so every every 5th and 6th st together) = 30 st
28. 30 sc = 30 st
29. Repeat 3 sc, 1 dec (so every 4th and 5th st together) = 24 st
30. Repeat 2 sc, 1 dec (so every 3rd and 4th st together) = 18 st
Now is probably a good time to stuff the head if you haven't yet. You should also install the eyes if you're using safety eyes; somewhere between row 14 - 16ish, depending on the size of your head, works well. If you're confused which part is the top of the head, it doesn't really matter, but the part where you did the 6 sc after the repeated patterns of increases, will make that side a bit smaller and better suited for the bottom. However it also works for the top, especially if you want the nose tipped down instead of up!
Last two rows to finish and close:
31. Repeat 1 sc, 1 dec = 12st
32. 6 dec = 6sc
A long shuttered visitor center on Mission Bay that for decades welcomed tourists and locals will be transformed into a waterfront restaurant and event center that will preserve the seashell-shaped building's distinctive profile.
Earlier this month, the San Diego City Council gave its blessing to a new long-term lease with a San Diego development team to redevelop a 2.6-acre city-owned site on East Mission Bay Drive near the Clairemont Drive freeway off ramp. While the 4,600-square-foot building will primarily function as a casual, counter-service eatery, the redeveloped area will also offer outdoor seating, a children's play area, public information services, and beach and bike rentals.
The redevelopment is a long time coming, following two earlier failed efforts, starting in 2011, to attract capable developers willing to remake the prime bay-view locale.
The proposed $3 million project, known as Shoreline Mission Bay, will be undertaken by a relatively new hospitality firm, San Diego-based Playground Concepts. It was among six firms that responded to a 2015 city solicitation for proposals.
Envisioned is a “vibrant, architecturally-significant hub for waterfront dining,” states a report prepared by the city's Real Estate Assets department.
Under the terms of a 25-year lease negotiated with Playground, the city can expect revenues of more than $7.2 million over the term of the agreement, after taking into account a $450,000 rent credit to help cover the cost of public improvements.
Yearly lease payments, which will be tied to varying percentages of food and beverage sales and other commercial activities, will start out at $230,000, gradually escalating to nearly $415,000 by year 20.
Playground Concepts, which hopes to complete the development within the next 12 to 18 months, is a collaboration of a local husband-and-wife boutique design firm and restaurateur Greg Van de Velde, a partner in the downtown Bottega Americana restaurant and former general manager of Mister A's.
Kristine Schnell, creative director of Playground, said they and their husband were drawn to the project not only because of its unique architectural design but also its prime location in Mission Bay Park.
“My husband and I spent many days walking our dog by the site, we thought it was a cool building, a great area and it was a shame to see it sitting empty,” they said. “So we came to Greg with this crazy idea of doing a project there, and they have experience in the restaurant business.”
What appealed to Van de Velde, they said, was the rare opportunity to develop a dining venue so close to the waterfront.
Still, the path that led the city to the current project was not a smooth one. Its first effort to remake the site was in 2011, a year after the then visitor center operator terminated their lease five years early.
The center had relied heavily on advertising revenues from hotels and tourist attractions, but the growing popularity and ease of online bookings and reservation services ultimately rendered the center obsolete.
The Cohn Restaurant Group was the successful applicant in 2011 to redevelop the center site, but later opted out during the course of lease negotiations, said Vladimir Balotsky, the city's supervising property agent.
Two years later, a second city solicitation yielded three proposals, but none met the city's criteria for development.
The third time proved to be the charm, but only after the city considered — but then rejected — demolition of the late ‘60s-era building and decided instead to upgrade it to make it accessible under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Still, the building, with its sloping floor and curving facade that its original architect, Richard Lareau, likened to a “sculptured seashell,” is not without its challenges, said Kristine and Bradley Schnell.
They addressed the sloping floor by creating a tiered dining experience in which customers will go up a ramp to order at a counter, with seating below and outside. They also had to eliminate the building's spiral staircase.
“We're told the visitor information center is the highest point on Mission Bay, so we're utilizing that hill it sits on to have terraced dining seating that extends from the ordering counter and radiates out,” Bradley Schnell said. “This speaks to the importance of this site being a really public location, and the counter-service model really opens it up so that on a Fourth of July weekend, we don't have to turn anyone away because they don't have a reservation.”
Van de Velde pointed out that by choosing not to make Shoreline a full-service restaurant, it will remain affordable, with menu items priced between $10 and $20.
San Diego-based Eat Drink Sleep, a local hospitality firm that had competed with Playground to redevelop the Mission Bay site, said it too was drawn by the beauty of the site, which it felt merited a more ambitious redevelopment.
“We had proposed a 16,000-square-foot building with a wedding venue on the top floor with a deck overlooking the bay,” said Brett Miller, CEO of Eat Drink Sleep, responsible for developing the newer restaurants at Belmont Park. “The city wanted the building remodeled, so we stepped away.
“But this is a beautiful site and they have chosen a good operator.”

Here's info on the status of New England Revolution soccer-specific stadium proposal. Talked with Jonathan Kraft, Brian Bilello, Pat Sullivan, others. The story is published in the New England Soccer Journal: http://www.nesoccerjournal.com/nesoccerj_201706/index.html#ne_revolution_keep_dreaming
KEEP DREAMING
The odds of the Revolution – or anyone – building a Boston stadium, soccer-specific or not, are close to zero. That was to be my theme for this column, after having researched local stadium projects from the 1940s through the recent failed proposal for the Bayside Expo site.
But, following an informal interview with Jonathan Kraft, I am modifying my stance. Jonathan seems to be 100 percent certain it will happen, and soon. So, meeting them halfway, I'll say maybe there is a 50 percent chance of a Boston stadium being realized.
It is difficult to remain optimistic after encountering so many deceptions, obstacles and roadblocks. But if the Krafts are positive about this, you can't count them out.
They are, though, only the latest in a long line of stadium suitors in Suffolk County. Writing about the imminent erection of Schaefer Stadium in Foxboro in 1971, the Globe's Harold Kaese counted 29 proposal rejections.
In 1922, Sam Mark built the first soccer stadium in the U.S. in Fall River. But Mark's Stadium did not set a trend, and several venues played host to soccer matches in the Boston area during the last century, according to Alan Foulds' Boston's Ballparks and Arenas. The best might have been the Walpole Street Grounds, home of the Boston Wonder Workers of the American Soccer League – until the land (now Northeastern University) was reclaimed by New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1929. The Wonder Workers then went to Everett Memorial Stadium, and the move seemed to accelerate their demise.
In 1946, Mayor Curley proposed a football stadium seating 75,000-plus for Columbus Park in South Boston. (Yes, just across from the Bayside Expo site). Curley said the 1920s construction Columbus Park facility could be expanded to “seating [100,000],” according to Oct. 1, 1946 editions of the Globe. The mayor did not set a price tag, but the story noted that in 1940, a municipally-owned Boston Stadium proposed by Mayor Tobin was priced at $1 million.
Soccer teams, as well as the NFL's Boston Redskins and Boston Yanks, had to be nomadic, staging games at Boston College, Boston University, Fenway Park, Harvard Stadium, Veterans Stadium in Quincy. The emergence of the Boston Patriots in the 1960s changed the dynamic, the Patriots' popularity leading to concerted attempts to construct a multi-purpose stadium in the area.
By 1967, sites being considered included Canton, Dedham, Dorchester, East Boston, Fenway, Fort Point Channel, the Harbor Islands, Newton (on the grounds of the Woodland Golf Club), Readville, South Station area, Stoughton, Walpole, Weston, Westwood, Wilmington. Among the low-priced possibilities were a $5 million expansion of White Stadium. On the expensive end was a facility with a retractable roof, supported by helium – price estimates ranged from $55 million to $85 million. At the time, the only domed stadium was the Houston AstroDome, built at a cost of $35 million in 1965.
In those days, costs were lower (even owing for inflation) and land was seemingly more accessible. After several years of pitching and shopping, Billy Sullivan settled on a plot off the Southeast Expressway and near the MBTA Red Line tracks.
“The closest we ever came to a football stadium [in Boston] was Neponset,” former Patriots general manager Pat Sullivan recalled in a recent interview. “It's now the site of [Pope John Paul II Park], across from the Keystone Building. It would have cost $16 million, 53,000 seats, and the city council voted it down at the very last minute. There was a lot of pressure from the neighborhood – Neponset and Ashmont. And three weeks later, we went to Foxborough.
“It was literally a dump. At that stage, it used to be called MDC-owned land, now it's Parks and Recreation. And they reclaimed it and made it appropriate for people to walk on and play on. It would've been a terrific site for a stadium. But they didn't want it. You have to have the right neighborhood and them accepting it for such a thing. It does create an imposition on the neighborhood.”
By 1971, Schaefer Stadium was completed at a cost of $7.1 million. In Schaefer's first soccer match, Eusebio scored twice for SL Benfica in a 2-2 draw with Sporting CP June 16, 1972. An announced 24,396 crowds encouraged organizers to bring the teams back a week later. But soccer was not considered a part of the stadium plans until the emergence of the New York Cosmos, Sullivan said.
The Sullivans experienced similar setbacks to those of the Krafts.
“Visionaries think big and think about how this is going to affect things over a long period of time,” Sullivan said. “People who think about their own situation think in a very narrow sense – how is this going to affect me, rather than how it's going to affect the overall community?
“I honestly think back today – where we located a stadium originally in 1964, right at the end of the MassPike [where] now it's all going into the airport – could have been an incredible place for a sports facility, not only for the Patriots and Red Sox, but the Celtics, as well. The Red Sox had agreed to move out of Fenway Park, which was part of a big stadium plan, and a multi-purpose venue would've been fine at the time. The Celtics wanted to move out of the Garden and the Bruins would have moved, also, but they wanted a bigger piece of the concession and that squashed it.”
One factor that makes the Krafts' bid different than proposals mentioned above is the scale. Also, there are precedents for this transforming a section of the city, as has happened in Orlando, Portland, Toronto.
“It fits a little more from the neighborhood standpoint,” Revolution president Brian Bilello said. “It would be 22,500. There is public transportation, so there are not heavy carloads, at all. Games are Saturday night, so it's off-peak hours.”
The Revolution have explored several areas – Roxbury, Somerville (back on the radar, I'm told), Widett Circle. If there are doubts about commitment, planning alone is expensive – $3 million-plus has been spent on the Bayside Expo site, another $2 million on others.
“Those diagrams are not just to look cool,” Bilello said. “Our commitment to building a soccer specific stadium for the Revolution isn't wavering. We are committed as ever. We showed the rendering so fans can understand the type of building – it's going to be first class, great for fans – 4,000 standing supporters seats behind the goal, premium amenities. The premium seating is the best in all Boston sports. The whole sideline would look like Sporting Kansas City, looking out on the Bay.”
Many believe the Revolution need their own stadium in order to solidify their identity and regain their standing among the MLS elite teams. The Revolution believe Boston needs a stadium to help the city progress.
“We are aiming very, very high with this,” Bilello said. “It is not a high school stadium. This is a 30-year-plus project. This is something that would excite soccer fans, and the general sports fan. It [would have] a grass field, be a venue for the national team. It would drive the sport forward.”
Twenty years ago, my Hillel rabbi, a bearded man in a black suit with a velvet kipa who presented themselves as a committed Orthodox Jew, invited me to the Hillel building one evening to hang out with them and some other students. When I arrived, the building was dark, and they and I sat down to wait for the others. We chatted for a while, but when the other students didn't arrive, I suggested that I call them to see when they were coming.
The rabbi inched closer to me on the sofa and said, “They aren't coming. I didn't actually invite them.” Taken aback, I asked what they meant, and they said, “Would you like to go for a drive with me?” I said no, and they began to tell me that they were attracted to me, that they wanted to be close to me, that he'd like to spend time alone with me. They reached out to touch me.
I was a new graduate student, just out of college, and they were in their 50s. I knew their wife from Shabbat dinners, and their older children were my age. I had seen them as a religious role model: an observant Jew interested in music, connected to the modern world, deeply spiritual but also an intellectual. And they were trying to cheat on their wife with me on the Hillel sofa.

In that shocking moment, I had the presence of mind to tell them how uncomfortable I was; I pulled away from them and left the building, shaking.
I spent the rest of the evening thinking about what to do, and I decided not to do anything. I assumed no one would believe me, and I didn't know whom I would tell anyway. The decision plagued me for weeks, but I decided that pushing aside my anger and sense of betrayal was probably the best solution. I stopped attending Hillel.
A couple of weeks later, at a meal with local synagogue members, I heard some of them praising the Hillel rabbi for their exciting programming and dedicated leadership. To their surprise, I reacted strongly: “I hate the rabbi. He's an awful person!” I exclaimed, without adding any specific details.
That might have been the end of this story. Nothing might have happened; I might never have said another word to anyone. They might have ignored me or judged me or gossiped about that strange outburst. They might have defended them and moved on.
Instead, one woman from that group, whom I only slightly knew, said, “Can you come talk to me privately?” We stepped into a different room, and I told her, in tears, about that terrible night.
They didn't say, “You must have misunderstood him” or “But he's a wonderful rabbi” or “Are you sure?” They didn't ignore me. They didn't make me feel crazy or stupid. Instead, they said, “We have to do something about this right away.”
Later that week, I sat with them in their living room, facing the regional director of Hillels for the area, also an Orthodox rabbi. I told them the story while they sat beside me. They looked at me skeptically and said, “I think you must have misunderstood him” and “But he's a wonderful rabbi” and “Are you sure?” As I cried, the woman said, “Gillian didn't misunderstand him. They know what happened. You need to do something.”
After some discussion, the regional director agreed to pursue the issue and, as a first step, would speak to the rabbi himself. A few days later, the regional director contacted me and said, “I spoke with the rabbi. They corroborated everything you said. They admitted it all, and he's sorry.”
I don't know what happened after that, but within a week or so, the rabbi had been fired from Hillel and a statement was released suggesting that they had committed some financial indiscretion. I was told privately that they were being prevented from working for any other Hillel and was being required — I'm not sure how or whether this was enforced — to go to counseling. I never heard from them or saw them again. I can still locate them on Google, and they seem only to have worked in non-rabbinic fields since that time. Shortly thereafter, an Episcopal chaplain affiliated with the university very kindly reached out to me, presumably at the request of the Hillel board, so that we could meet to process what had happened, and I was offered additional counseling, which I declined. After a few months, I barely thought about the event again.
As I read the stories in recent years of terrible abuse perpetrated by rabbis and hidden or ignored by their colleagues and acquaintances, I think more and more about my very different story. Of course, unlike the many children who have been abused by rabbis, I was a legal adult at this time and not a young child; I was approached with the possibility of a sexual relationship and not forced into one; the rabbi in my story told the truth rather than trying to discredit me.
But another important difference stands out as well: someone believed me. How easy it would have been for that woman to ignore my outburst. How simple to have dismissed this student whom they barely knew as “having a bad day” or “being too emotional.” But they didn't. They listened to me and, when I couldn't speak for myself, they spoke for me. They pressed for change to be made, and it was made.
I don't know what would have happened if this ordinary woman, invited to an ordinary meal, had not taken the time they did to pursue justice. I would certainly have permanently stopped attending Hillel, and, since I met my now-husband at a regional Hillel event a few years later, that decision could have changed my life significantly.
On a more fundamental level, I never had to reckon with feeling betrayed by the Jewish community. I never had to doubt my own worth or veracity. I never had to face the man who attempted to abuse their power over me or hear them lie about me. I never had to rebuild my faith or lose it altogether. I was able to maintain my (I believe, accurate) sense that they were one bad person among a huge pool of good people. This incident has hardly touched my life since it happened. I felt, as all our young people should feel, as important to the Jewish community as this “important” rabbi was.
Ordinary people, like all of us, can pursue justice the way that wonderful woman did for me. We can save the Jewish community from itself if we listen, and if we make sure that every voice is heard. We can all learn not only from victims of abuse and their harrowing stories but also from situations in which sexual impropriety is handled correctly. That this man tried to abuse their power is a sad statement on humanity and, perhaps, on the Jewish community; that they were prevented from continuing to do so shows how much power we each have to change the world for the better.

Some Honey Bee Lore
Honey bees appear in the temple and tomb art of Egypt as far back as 2400 B.C. The honey bee was the symbol of Lower Egypt. In the solar cult of Ra, the tears of Ra were honey bees.
Bee-keeping shows up in Greek mythology. Aristaeus, a keeper of bees who lost their hives to disease, compelled Proteus, a shape-changer who was also the wise god of the sea, to tell them how to avoid such a loss in the future. More diseases have been described for honey bees than any other insects. The earliest written descriptions were made by Aristotle around 325 B.C.
The honey bee, a sacred symbol of Artemis, was an important design on Ephesian coins for almost 6 centuries. (Ephesus was the center of worship of Artemis.)
After their death in 323 B.C., Alexander the Great was embalmed in a coffin filled with honey.
Over the centuries, bees have been used many times as weapons of war. In the thirteen century, residents of the Aegean island of Astipalaia hurled beehives onto pirates storming the castle gates. During W.W. I, Belgians trapped in an apiary used bees against the Germans.
Honey, too, has been used as a weapon. Certain members of the heath family produce grayanotoxins, chemicals that act as breathing inhibitors and hypnotics. Honey from these plants is referred to as toxic or ``mad '' honey. Three squadrons of Pompey's Roman troops were slain while under the influence of toxic honey provided by local tribesmen. In small amounts, toxic honey has been used in alcohol, as an additive to increase its punch, and in medicine.
Honey bees are not native to the Americas, Australia or New Zealand. Settlers had established colonies in Virginia by 1622, but California had to wait until the 1850s. Because of their close connection with the advancing colonists, Native Americans referred to honey bees as the ``white man's flies''.
Today, honey bees perform a vital role in agribusiness, pollinating many of our food crops. The honey and wax produced are significant. According to May Berenbaum in their book ``Bugs in the System'', it takes 130000 loads of nectar or about 10 million flower visits to produce one kilogram of honey (about 2.2 pounds).

CNN has reached an agreement to study the use of drones in newsgathering. WSJ's Jack Nicas explains what this could mean for the future of news. Photo: Getty
IF YOU'VE got a drone and haven't been keeping a close eye on the regulations that outline where and when you can fly it — be very careful. Uploading videos taken from your drone to the internet could result in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) sending you a hefty fine.
One Queensland drone pilot found this out the hard way, after receiving an $850 fine for their drone use — all based on videos they had uploaded to YouTube.
The owner — who does not wish to be named, received a phone call from a CASA investigator notifying them of multiple breaches. Each of which could have resulted in an $850 fine. In the end their single $850 fine, obtained by EFTM.com.au was a lucky break with the CASA investigator stating, “while each individual breach was not major in itself, the number of breaches has caused me concern”.
CASA regulations state that hobbyists who fly for no commercial gain cannot fly their drones:
• Within 3 nautical miles of an airport;
• Above 400 feet in controlled airspace (large towns and cities);
• Over populous areas;
• Within 30 meters of people;
• At night.
The most popular drone on the market, the DJI Phantom — has software built into it that can prevent it taking off near airports and limit its height. The problem seems to be the owners who want to toy with the regulators, because they think no-one is watching.
For this Queensland owner, the specific offence outlined in this infringement was “operating a model aircraft over a populous area at a height less than the height from which, if any of its components fails, it would be able to clear the area.”
So does CASA have staff watching online videos to find offenders? Peter Gibson, spokesperson for CASA told EFTM, “I'm not going to pretend we sit there every day trawling through YouTube because that would be ridiculous. However, where we see things, or where people bring things to our attention then we will investigate”.
The fines can range anywhere from $850 for breaches of the basic guidelines, right through to $8,000 for “reckless operation”, with Mr Gibson pointing out “if you injure someone, CASA can also seek prosecution.
We're not trying to penalise people, but if you behave stupidly, then you certainly run the risk”.
When the fine was sent this week, it also had attached a set of “Facts and Circumstances”. This document outlined the reasons for the fine, including that CASA had been alerted to the videos, which prompted their investigation.
The owner of the drone has been thoroughly deterred and has reportedly put it up for sale on Gumtree. However with drones becoming more readily available, it's certainly likely that CASA will be dishing out more fines.
The drone in question has already appeared for sale on online classifieds site Gumtree, and one can only assume this fine has scared the flights out of this pilot.
Lock picking is as old as locks themselves, and is enjoyed as a hobby and practical skill worldwide. While it has been tainted in many people's minds as something only done by criminals, it is in fact a skill that could very well save your life if kidnapped, as well as saving hundreds of dollars in locksmithing costs to open things for which the key has been lost. Criminals and thieves are far more likely to break a window and in other ways use force to open things rather than trouble with the delicate, and many times lengthy method of picking.
Practice locks such as the one used in this video can be found for sale online with little searching, but all that is really necessary to practice is a simple padlock. Practicing lock picking should only be done on a lock that is not essential to some purpose, as it is possible to damage a lock if done incorrectly. It of course should also not be done on a lock that does not belong to you, as doing so is likely illegal.
Two works by the Lord of the Rings author discovered in the 1936 annual of Our Lady's School in Oxfordshire
Two poems by JRR Tolkien, in which The Lord of the Rings author writes variously of “a man who dwelt alone/beneath the moon in shadow”, and of the “lord of snows”, have been discovered in a school magazine in Abingdon, Oxfordshire.
Believed to have been written while Tolkien was professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University, the poems were found in the 1936 annual of Our Lady's School in Oxfordshire. The discovery was made when the US Tolkien scholar Wayne Hammond contacted Our Lady's headteacher, Stephen Oliver. Hammond had found a note from Tolkien in which The Hobbit author mentioned that they had published two poems in a magazine they named as the Abingdon Chronicle.
Hammond realised this was Our Lady's school magazine, and got in touch with Oliver. Initially, the latter could not locate the correct edition of the magazine, and passed Hammond on to the archives of the Sisters of Mercy, who had founded the school in 1860.

“Then, while preparing for an event for former pupils of the school, we uncovered our own copy and I saw the two poems Mr Hammond had been looking for. My excitement when I saw them was overwhelming. I am a great Tolkien fan and was thrilled to discover the connection with the school,” said Oliver.
The first poem, The Shadow Man, is an early version of a poem that Tolkien went on to publish in their 1962 collection The Adventures of Tom Bombadil. It tells of “a man who dwelt alone/ beneath the moon in shadow”, who “sat as long as lasting stone,/and yet they had no shadow”. When “a lady clad in grey” arrives, they wake, and “clasped their fast, both flesh and bone;/and they were clad in shadow”.
The second, Noel, is a Christmas poem, albeit one set in scenery that would not be out of place in Middle-earth. “The hall was dark without song or light,/The fires were fallen dead,” writes Tolkien, going on to portray “the lord of snows”, whose “mantle long and pale/Upon the bitter blast was spread/And hung o'er hill and dale”.
The school is now planning to show the poems at an exhibition about its history. “Both poems are very atmospheric and imbued with an air of mystery. I was very moved when I first read them,” said Oliver.
“Noel is a beautiful and unusual take on the Christmas story, set in a wintry landscape. The focus is on Mary, which may be why Tolkien wrote the poem for the school magazine, given that we are dedicated to Our Lady. The Shadow Man is also a very beautiful story, about two people finding each other and thereafter casting only one shadow – it feels like a poem about marriage. The Shadow Man is incomplete until a woman comes to them and relieves their loneliness.”

Oliver is confident the poems “will be enjoyed by lovers of Tolkien everywhere”. Fans of the novelist have been given a wealth of previously unpublished material to enjoy in recent years, from last year's release of their retelling of the Finnish epic poem The Story of Kullervo, to the unfinished Middle-earth story The Children of Húrin. David Brawn, Tolkien's publisher at HarperCollins, said that some unpublished poetry had been included in the revised edition of The Adventures of Tom Bombadil in 2014, and that “there is often scope to add rare material to future revised editions”.
Shenandoah would be ‘biggest winner' in wireless merger
After CNBC's David Faber reported that T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) are in “active” talks about a possible merger, Drexel Hamilton analyst Barry Sine called Shenandoah Telecommunications (SHEN) potentially the “biggest winner” if such a deal comes to pass.
Shenandoah Telecommunications Company, also known as Shentel, provides regulated and unregulated telecommunications services to end-user customers and other telecommunications providers in Virginia, West Virginia, central Pennsylvania, western Maryland, and portions of Kentucky and Ohio. It offers a suite of voice, video, and data communications services. The company operates in three segments: Wireless, Cable, and Wireline.
If T-Mobile bought Sprint, it would have to decide whether to acquire Shenandoah at fair market value, shut down its network and retail stores in Shentel's area within two years or to sell the T-Mobile customers and network to Shentel at a discount, which #Sine sees as the option the company would most likely choose given its integration challenges.
Note that insiders have recently been buying shares of Shenandoah. There have been multiple insider buys in recent weeks, all at or below $36.
The analyst, who foresees significant acceleration in Shenandoah's results in coming quarters even without a Sprint merger deal, keeps a Buy rating on the shares, which are up 3.1% to $36.75 in Tuesday's trading. The stock (SHEN) has a 52-weeks trading range of $22.05 – $37.90.

Sure, the 2015 Nissan GT-R NISMO is the fastest GT-R ever released by the automaker, boasting a 3.8-liter twin-turbo V6 that serves up 600 hp, 481 lb.-ft. of torque and a record-setting Nürburgring lap time—for "volume production cars"—of 7:08.679. But there's another number that's perhaps more important for most folks, and that's the $149,990 MSRP of the 2015 Nissan GT-R NISMO. The pricing is actually a relative bargain when compared to the GT-R's super-car rivals, yet it's also still enough to keep many drivers from ever getting behind the wheel—at least in the real world.
Digital drivers, on the other hand, will soon be able to download the 2015 Nissan GT-R NISMO for Gran Tursimo 6, the latest iteration of one of the gaming industry's top choices for virtual motorsports. As race-ready readers likely remember, the Gran Turismo franchise also is the starting point for Nissan GT Academy drivers, who each year attempt to graduate from virtual racing to the real thing. (Lucas Ordóñez, for one, has gone from the GT Academy championship in 2008 to multiple podium finishes in the LMP2 class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.)
It's also worth noting that any Gran Turismo 6 players who entered the 2014 GT Academy competition will be able to download the virtual 2015 Nissan GT-R NISMO for free from the in-game dealership, where all gamers can find more info about Nissan's new digital dynamo.
And don't worry, the 2015 Nissan GT-R NISMO has the official seal of approval from the president of Polyphony Digital and the creator of the Gran Turismo, Kazunori Yamauchi. After test driving the car for themselves at a special GT Academy event at England's famed Silverstone racetrack, Yamauchi said: "The GT-R NISMO is an incredible car, and I am thrilled that Nissan is able to not only offer it to drivers across the globe, but now also to gamers in the virtual world of Gran Turismo 6. It's another great example of how Nissan continues to bring innovation and excitement to all—both in the real and virtual world."
Popcorn lovers (and who isn't a popcorn lover?), I have found the best of the best in popcorn. I met the folks at Popcornopolis at the Summer Fancy Food Show in NYC this past summer and was completely WOWED by their products. Seriously, they've been described as the “Prada of popcorn” and it's no lie. The BEST I've ever had. Let me share what I learned at the show about this brand, and then show you our favorite flavors (because they have over 20 of them!).
One of the things that really sets Popcornopolis apart from other brands is that their product is both a snack and a gift. These bigger bags, which you can find in Costco, Sams, Kroger, and a bunch of other retailers, are perfect for snacking. They are SO good, and the reason why is that all Popcornopolis products are made with all-natural ingredients, certified gluten-free, and all of their corn is non-GMO, too. High quality ingredients = high quality popcorn.
I met Mike Arnold at the show, VP of Sales and self proclaimed Popcorn King (love it!). They told us all about the Popcornopolis brand and what makes it the best. I mean, one taste of the samples they had available and I was sold!
These are the more ‘gifty' varieties of Popcornopolis. You can see there are a bunch of amazing flavors here and check out the cone-shaped packaging! This is what makes this brand stand out first, even before you taste it.
I love the packaging not only because it's fun and unique, but also because it really does help the popcorn stay fresher longer. The packaging, combined with the use of 100% pure coconut oil to cook the popcorn, means these bags stay fresh for up to 9 months!
After being introduced to the brand at the show in NYC, I was sent a variety of Popcornopolis products to try with my own family. We just happened to be heading to the beach that weekend so we took it with us (because we snack a lot of vacation!) and dug in.
The Nearly Naked popcorn is amazing. This is pure butterfly popcorn, coconut oil, and just a pinch of salt. Guilt free, all-natural snack that seriously tastes SO good. Look for the giant bags at your Costco and Sams stores.
I have to tell you, I think this is the thing I'm most excited about with Popcornopolis: gift ideas! You can see the Halloween packaging on the assortment above. Popcornopolis has a bunch of these for different occasions, PERFECT for gifting!!
Who else struggles to find something for the Easter basket, or for a Christmas gift, or a birthday treat? Trust me on this. ANYONE would love to receive one of these popcorn assortments. They are to-die-for delicious and just so much fun to open and try each flavor!
My daughter Lily tried to claim this as their own. Nice try, love. Hand it over. 😉
So, let's talk flavors. Popcornopolis has 10 main flavors but a total of 22 in all. It's so hard to pick a favorite but I'll show you a couple we loved, and also mention that they do add special limited-time flavors throughout the year.
Look for Strawberries & Cream from Valentine's Day through Easter; Gingerbread, White Chocolate Pumpkin Spice (OMG!), and Candy Cane Crunch over the holidays; and Lemon Crunch in the springtime.
This is the Zebra popcorn, their best seller! Caramel corn with white and dark chocolate. I mean…. There are no words. It's insanely good.
We also received this larger, classic 5-cone assortment and this is where I found my favorite flavor: Cinnamon Toast!
Oh, you guys, it's so, so good. It's crunchy and sweet and just the right amount of cinnamonny (is that a word?). Ah, divine. I loved this one and tried my best to not let the kids have any. I failed but it was worth a shot!
Snacking on gourmet popcorn on the beach is a real treat. I promise the seagulls got not even one little crumb. The packaging makes it perfect for slipping into a bag to take on the go, and since you can seal it up with the little twist tie it comes with, nothing spills out.
Definitely look for Popcornopolis products in your local stores and remember it when you need a gift idea. It's so fun and easy to shop through the creative (and delicious) Popcornopolis products on their website! A gift from them will be a total hit with anyone you are shopping for. The kids, a hostess gift, a teacher gift, anyone!
Be sure to follow along on Facebook and Twitter too! Their Instagram feed has me drooling, and I'm loving some of these popcorn party ideas they've shared on Pinterest!
Popcornopolis is generously offering one of my readers the same amazing batch of goodies they sent to me:
A bag of Nearly Naked popcorn
A classic 5-cone popcorn gift basket
A 5-cone mini popcorn gift basket
This giveaway is open to US residents only ages 18+ and will end at 11:59pm ET on Friday September 4, 2015. This is a DELICIOUS giveaway! Don't miss your chance to win!
Good luck!
Israeli journalist Amir Rappaport reports that Israel, in response to the sale of Russian air defense systems S-300 to Iran can begin delivery of modern weapons to Ukraine and Georgia. Both countries “are considered to be enemies of Russia.”
Despite the fact that Iran will not receive the latest version of this system, S-300 would be able to hit several targets simultaneously at a distance up to 150 km. This is – a big challenge for the Air Force of any country, including for the Israeli Air Force.
In the case of Ukraine, Israel could unfreeze the sale of modern reconnaissance drones. The contract for the supply of drones has been suspended at the request of the Israeli Foreign Ministry.

In the light of the Russian Foreign Ministry's demarche this view may change and permit for the supply of weapons to Ukraine may be granted.
Brazil's lower house of congress voted on Wednesday to reject a corruption charge against President Michel Temer for allegedly taking bribes, saving them from facing a possible Supreme Court trial that could have ousted them from office.
At least 172 of the 513 members of the lower Chamber of Deputies had voted by late Wednesday against putting Temer on trial for allegedly orchestrating a scheme to line their own pockets with millions of dollars in illicit payments.
Temer won enough ballots to keep the opposition from gaining the two-thirds of the vote - or 342 votes - required to move the corruption case forward to the top court. A final tally was expected later on Wednesday night.

The strong show of support for Temer raised the prospects that they can now move ahead with controversial economic reforms in an economy emerging from recession.
Al Jazeera's Daniel Schweimler, reporting from Brasilia, said Temer was always confident they would win the vote and had pledged more than $1bn of government funds for projects to various members of congress to ensure their vote.
"So they are no doubt is breathing a sigh of relief - for now at least," said Schweimler.
But Temer is widely expected to face more corruption charges in the coming weeks, which would again put their presidency at stake.
'Tired of so much suspicion'
Opposition politicians, carrying briefcases stuffed with fake money, chanted "Out with Temer!" on the house floor at the start of the day-long tumultuous session.
Temer's main coalition ally, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), which seeks to win the presidential election next year, was split on whether to back Temer, whose economic policies it shares, or distance itself from their corruption-plagued government.
PSDB leader Ricardo Tripoli, calling for the charge to be approved, said Temer must be investigated, "not because we want to oust the president, but because Brazilians are tired of so much suspicion surrounding their politicians".
To shield Temer only further undermines the credibility of Brazil's political system, Tripoli said.
Brazil's top prosecutor Rodrigo Janot charged Temer in June with arranging to eventually receive a total of 38m reais ($12.16m) in bribes from the world's largest meatpacker, JBS SA, in return for political favours.
Temer and their legal team have denied any wrongdoing.
Brazil's stocks and currency rose earlier on Wednesday after a cloture vote signalled a victory for Temer and robust support for their reform agenda to cut spending and restore confidence in government accounts.
'This drama is by no means over'
Armando Castelar, a professor of economics at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, told Al Jazeera that, although Temer's approval ratings are very low, the vote showed their strength in congress. They added that Temer would now be able to return to their economic agenda.
Castelar said Temer's pledge not to run for re-election in 2019 was a further strength.
"This usually facilitates support in congress because parties don't see them as a future opponent if things go well. So this may work for the better for the economy. Obviously it's not a desirable situation for a political perspective," they said.
"But Brazil is in such a difficult position - with the public sector accounts and low growth - that maybe for this moment it's not bad news," said Castelar.

Al Jazeera's Daniel Schweimler said that, while Temer says they want to get on with running the country, the so-called "Car Wash" corruption investigation in which they and many others were implicated is still ongoing.
"The opposition are hoping that more revelations will come to light, especially as many of those implicated are plea-bargaining, they're naming names, and the opposition are convinced that Michel Temer's name will come to the fore again," said Schweimler.
"And [Temer] will no doubt be back in congress at some stage defending themselves against new charges of corruption - although they have said he's innocent and they want to continue governing. So this drama is by no means over."
