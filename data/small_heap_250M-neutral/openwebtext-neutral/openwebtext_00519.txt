Story highlights It's the first time the South has officially accused the North of conducting the attacks
Seoul says the codes used were similar to ones used before by Pyongyang
The attacks last month infected thousands of computers at major companies
South Korea accused North Korea Wednesday of carrying out a wave of cyberattacks that paralyzed the networks of major South Korean banks and broadcasters last month.
An official investigation found that many of the malignant codes employed in the attacks were similar to ones used by the North previously, said Lee Seung-won, an official at the South Korean science ministry.
Although some observers said at the time of the computer crashes that they suspected North Korean involvement, this is the first time that Seoul has formally pointed the finger at Pyongyang.
The allegations coincide with a tense situation on the Korean Peninsula, with the North making repeated threats of war. South Korean and U.S. officials have warned that a North Korean missile test could take place at any moment.
South Korea believes North Korea had spent at least eight months preparing for the cyberattacks, which also affected hundreds of individual citizens' computers and websites that cover North Korea, Lee said at a news briefing Wednesday.

There didn't appear to be any immediate reaction on North Korean state-run media to the South Korean accusations.
The main hacking attack took place on March 20, hitting more than 48,000 computers at the South Korean banks and broadcasters, authorities said.
It infected the companies' computer networks with a malicious program, or malware, that slowed or shut down systems.
The South's investigation found evidence including IP addresses and other elements used in the cyberattacks that it said proved North Korean responsibility.
The hackers routed the attacks through more 10 different countries, Lee said.
South Korea has accused the North of similar hacking attacks before, including incidents in 2010 and 2012 that also targeted banks and media organizations. Pyongyang has rejected the allegations.
First there was the "Like" button. Next there were the emoji-like reaction buttons -- a heart, a tear, an OMG face. And then there was a "pride button," a little rainbow flag Facebook created for its users during June to express their love of diversity and support for the LGBT community.
But now it has been weaponized, and Roy Moore has a bullseye on their Facebook page.
Alabama's former Supreme Court chief justice has been an outspoken opponent of LGBT rights, having once said that the state should use the "power of the sword" to keep children from being corrupted by the LGBT community's influence.
After a federal district judge ordered Alabama probate judges to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, Moore ordered those same judges to ignore the federal decree, a move that led the Alabama Court of the Judiciary to remove them from the high court's bench for the second time in their career.
Now Moore is running for the United States Senate, and their campaign's Facebook page has become the target of some next-level trolling by LGBT sympathizers and the new pride button.
As of Friday night, posts on Moore's Facebook page had been tagged with hundreds of pride reactions, and others had littered the comments beneath the posts with pride flag emojis.

Dear Andre,
First off, I want to congratulate you on your success at the NCAA championships, Pan Am Games and world championships this past summer.
Although we haven't met, I watched you and was cheering you on. It's always great to see fellow Canadians triumph!
I hope you have had a chance for it to all soak in now that you're back at USC. I know you are about to head in to a really critical time in your life and athletic career, something I can identify with, and I thought I could share a little advice and insight based on my personal experience.
I was flying high when the Cleveland Cavaliers selected me as the first overall pick of the 2013 NBA Draft, but I was about to go through the biggest test of my life. It has been a challenge I could not have anticipated, but I have learned some incredibly important things about life along the way, and for that I am grateful.
Most importantly, be extremely selective in who you let in your life. Your family and your friends are your lifeline, your support group and your biggest cheerleaders. Look for those people who have been there from the start, when you were just a kid from the neighbourhood, not a superstar athlete. Keep an eye out for those that are there for the wrong reason, just looking to enjoy the ride.
Friday Facts #182 - Optimizations, always more optimizations
Posted by Rseding91 on 2017-03-17, all posts
I've done several optimizations around the game update over the past few game versions but in 0.15 I decided to also look at some of the game GUIs. In particular there are 3 GUIs which tend to take a large amount of time when visible: the production stats, the trains view, and blueprint tooltip previews.
GUI performance
The production stats GUI has to render an icon, a progress bar, and some text for every item in the view and that view changes each game tick as the stats do. I figured that the destruction and re-creation of all the widgets would be responsible for the slowness but as it turned out the graph was taking the majority of the time. Calculating the graphs is simple - we already store all that data to make the stats work. However rendering the graph was very poorly implemented in that every line in the graph (each up and down) was done one at a time and sent out to the graphics card. To fix that Posila batched all of the lines and send the final result out in one draw call.
Next I moved on to the trains GUI. I did some improvements to it in the middle of the 0.13 stabilization several months ago so I already knew how it functioned internally - it doesn't create and destroy anything - it reuses all the visible widgets between updates (very efficient). So, when someone commented that the game would drop to 2 FPS when they opened the window I didn't believe them. But, when I tested their save they were right. After some debugging I found that it suffered from the same problems the production stats window did: for every visible train in the GUI it would draw the minimap and all trains visible on that section of the map.
So say you have 200 trains on your map and the view is showing 50 of them: each view would render its own train + any trains in that immediate area (which ended up being roughly all of them in packed factories) and the end result was you'd get 50 * 50 trains being rendered which ends up being very slow. Cleaning up how trains are drawn on the minimap gave a nice boost to the performance here. I still have some additional ideas to improve the performance of this GUI, but it's at least manageable now for 0.15.
Finally the blueprint tooltip preview: this one stumped me for a while. I've known it was slow since I first started with Factorio 2+ years ago but could never pin-point exactly what was causing it. The drawing of the blueprint preview is near identical to what happens when you view the normal game but would always take 4-5 times as much time to render. Finally recently I found that we did zero batching of sprites to be drawn when rendering the GUI: for every sprite that we would draw it would go out to the graphics card and tell it to draw it. Fixing that was as simple as turning a flag on and now it has no measurable impact on performance when rendered.
Weird long-standing bugs
While working on optimizations I frequently make small tweaks and re-run the game to see what difference they make. Sometimes when I make a larger change, I want to make sure nothing broke before trying it out on a larger save file, so I'll launch a new small map and test it out. While I was working on optimizing a train-heavy map earlier this week, I did just that, except I somehow corrupted the save file. I could load the save and it would crash every time i would mine a specific cargo wagon, but nothing I had changed could possibly affect the save in this way. After a few hours of testing I found a long-standing bug with trains that has hyper-specific requirements to reproduce (that I happened to only reproduce because I had a typo in an unrelated optimization I was working on):
Build 2 locomotives directly next to each other Disconnect the 2 locomotives so they're not one train anymore Drive the front locomotive into the rear one such that it can't move backwards any more Drive the rear locomotive into the front one such that it can't move forward any more Build a cargo wagon attached to the rear locomotive (making sure the cursor was more towards the rear locomotive so the cargo wagon snaps behind the back locomotive) Try to drive the rear locomotive (with the now attached cargo wagon) forward into the front locomotive
In this specific setup the newly built cargo wagon will have it's connection to the rails corrupt. Any attempt to drive that train off the rails its on would crash the game. Any attempt to mine the cargo wagon would crash the game. The game still saves/loads just fine but you can't do anything with the broken cargo wagon. Finally, if you save the game and load it between steps 5 and 6 it never breaks.
After about an hour of debugging (and fixing an unrelated different bug) I fixed the problem by adding an "else" and 1 line of code that runs when building cargo wagons.
As always, if you have any thoughts or feedback, let us know on our forum.
WASHINGTON ― While the debate over Obamacare repeal focuses on insurance subsidies, coverage equity and tax cuts, a far more radical attempt is quietly underway to end the Medicaid program as we know it.
As currently structured, Medicaid guarantees a set of benefits to everybody who qualifies. Most people associate Medicaid with the poor and working class, but historically the program has spent as much or more money on elderly and disabled people who qualify. They use it to pay for things like nursing-home care that Medicare doesn't cover.
The new version of the program would upend this arrangement. It would devolve Medicaid to the states and reimburse them using a predetermined formula that, as the Congressional Budget Office and other experts have concluded, would not actually keep up with the cost of care. As the federal contribution toward Medicaid eroded over time, states could make up the difference on their own or ― more likely ― they could make cuts in whom or what the program covers. The federal guarantee would be over, and with it, the Medicaid program as we know it.
That's not an accident. If House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) wanted Medicaid to keep up with the cost of providing coverage to those eligible, there would be an easy way to do it: leave the program as is. But Ryan has been salivating about targeting Medicaid most of their life, they said this week. When he's speaking with conservative audiences, Ryan is upfront about the goal. “We've been dreaming of this since I've been around ― since you and I were drinking at a keg,” they recently told keg-party buddy Rich Lowry, editor of the National Review.
Speaking earlier with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, the two of them were practically giddy about the opportunity. “The Medicaid devolution, in capping, is the most significant entitlement reform of my 60 years on this planet,” Hewitt said, adding that they had just been talking with conservative economist Avik Roy. “Avik says it is 10 times more important than the welfare reform of 1996.”
“Oh, for sure,” Ryan replied. “Welfare reform is a $16 billion program. We're talking about trillions in the end here in this program.”
The energy in their voice rising, Ryan got to the heart of the plan. “This is so much bigger by orders of magnitude than welfare reform, because ― let me just describe exactly what this bill does for conservatives. This is why I'm so excited about it, and this is why I think people need to see the forest through the trees. We are de-federalizing an entitlement, block-granting it back to the states, and capping its growth rate. That's never been done before,” they said.
Kevin Lamarque / Reuters President Donald Trump and Speaker Paul Ryan at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, March 16, 2017.
Brendan Buck, a spokesperson for Ryan, said that the new approach would be a better one for beneficiaries. “Sending back to the states lets each one tailor a system to its needs ― some states have much higher elderly populations, while others have more young, poor for example ― and by eliminating federal red tape, more physicians and hospitals will actually accept patients on Medicaid,” said Buck.
But states already have significant flexibility in how to administer Medicaid. (The House bill may be amended to allow states to implement work requirements to Medicaid, but the result there would merely be to shrink rolls, not provide more coverage.)
“Speaker Ryan and others often argue to governors that a Medicaid per capita cap is about more flexibility (even though states already enjoy expansive flexibility in their Medicaid programs) rather than what it is really about: a way to achieve big federal spending cuts and cost-shifts to states,” Edwin Park, a health policy analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in an email. “The House bill makes that starkly clear: $880 billion in federal Medicaid spending cuts over 10 years by ending the expansion and imposing a per capita cap without any new flexibility.”
Ryan's plan would cut taxes by some $275 billion over the next decade, mostly for the rich, and is setting the stage, they told Fox News' Tucker Carlson, for a much bigger tax cut to come. That's what's going on here.
When Ryan refers to seeing “the forest through the trees,” they are arguing to conservatives that they should swallow elements of the Obamacare repeal-and-replace bill that they don't like in order to seize the once-in-a-half-century opportunity to destroy a major federal entitlement program. Everything else is just trees.
Ryan is right that it is an enormous forest. Some 11 million seniors and people with disabilities are covered by both Medicare and Medicaid, according to a new report from the Kaiser Family Foundation. That's one in every five Medicare beneficiaries. Forty percent of those are under age 65 with permanent disabilities. Two out of three Medicare beneficiaries who are in nursing homes have their care covered not by Medicare, but by Medicaid. Many who get home health care are similarly covered by Medicaid.

Social insurance organized by the government is a relatively new phenomenon. Before the New Deal, society dealt with the elderly and infirm by shunting them away in “poorhouses” or by moving parents in with their children. “I can remember the terror that existed with regard to those county poor farms,” said former Rep. John Dingell Jr. (D-Mich.), who left office in 2015 after serving six decades.
Dingell's father, also a prominent House Democrat, was an architect of the Social Security Act. It had a tangible benefit for the Dingell home.
“Social Security — this is one of the things of which my dad was very proud — closed 1,100 old folks' homes in New York. Eleven hundred. And that was just one example, but it tells you what it did all over the country,” Dingell said in an interview for an article on poorhouses.
Before Social Security, they said, “everybody and their second cousin piled in with their families. I had relatives that came to stay with my dad and mom I didn't even know were relatives. To tell you the truth, I'm not sure they are. And my granddad on Dad's side, who threw Dad out of the house, came to live with Dad. Dad was the only one of their kids who'd take care of him. They are, quite frankly, the only one who could afford to do so, because Pop was making a fairly decent living during the war, but they were supporting a whole tribe of Dingells and Selmerses and a whole bunch of others who had other Polish names, but were related.”
Paul Ryan, in fact, got Social Security benefits himself; they were 16 when their father died. “It was a tough time for our family, and Social Security was there to help us when we needed the help,” Ryan has said.
Ryan saved much of it to pay for school at Miami University of Ohio, where ― who knows? ― a few dollars of it may have gone to pay for the kind of keg they would crowd around to fantasize with buddies about destroying Medicaid, which was created as part of the Great Society program in the 1960s.
The Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, expanded on the social insurance concept, with the goal of subsidizing coverage to make it universally affordable. The market-oriented approach has met with mixed success: Coverage is up, but premiums and deductibles both are high. The most successful element of Obamacare has been its expansion of the single-payer program Medicaid, even in the face of a Supreme Court ruling that allowed many Republican-led states to reject the federal expansion of the program.
Where the program has been allowed to expand, it has covered more people at a lower cost and led to healthier outcomes. Single payer ― or, at least, America's stitched-together version of it ― is working, but Ryan opposes it on principle.
That principle is freedom. For Ryan, the poorhouses run by charities, and the family homes crammed with parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles ― the world before social insurance ― represent not a dark moment in human history that society advanced beyond, but freedom. It's what Ryan calls “patient centered.” If a patient can afford health care, they or they can choose to purchase it or not. If a patient can't afford it, well, that's what children and charity are for.

Six months from the start of the BP oil spill and we now know the answer to the question of how badly the spill would hurt spawning bluefin tuna. New satellite data from the European Space Agency shows 20% of juvenile bluefin tuna killed by oil. Which is pretty significant since the Atlantic bluefin have declined over 80% in the past 30 years, and at current fishing rates the critically endangered fish will be extinct by 2012.Things could have been much worse though. The ESA analysis shows that the main spawning hotspot for bluefin to the west of the spill area was unaffected by pollution.
When bluefin tuna breed, females release eggs into the water and males following behind fertilize them. After hatching the larvae begin searching for food near the surface of the water. Which in the case of the BP oil spill meant they came into contact will the oil, which killed them.
Catherine Kilduff of the Center for Biological Diversity commented,
This study confirms our worst fears about the oil spill's impacts on bluefin tuna and provides more evidence that this species needs the Endangered Species Act to survive. The federal government could have predicted the effects of the spill during spawning season prior to the disaster; listing Atlantic bluefin tuna as endangered will prevent such an oversight from ever occurring again.

Which is true, but to give the Atlantic bluefin tuna any chance of recovery an international ban on trade in the species is what is required.
Such a ban was rejected at the last CITES meeting, with pressure from Japan, the world's largest consumer of bluefin, and from some European nations, who fear the impact on their fishing industry of ban, scuttling the proposal--which had backing of the United States, the UK, Monoco and some other European nations.
Current quota levels for the fish are already set too high to allow recovery of the species, with actual catch of the fish far exceeding these officially sanctioned levels.
LONDON — Bank of America said on Friday that it had chosen Dublin as its future European Union hub, the latest major financial services firm to outline its plans to deal with Britain's departure from the 28-nation bloc.
Many banks and financial firms have concentrated their European operations in London, taking advantage of deep and liquid markets as well as the wide variety of support industries that have built up in the British capital, including accountants and lawyers. But those companies now face the distinct possibility that they may no longer be able to serve European clients from London after Britain leaves the bloc.
With Britain as a member of the bloc, companies based in the country have been able to sell financial products across the Continent under “passporting” rules, which allow a lender licensed in one member state to work throughout the European Union.
That is no longer guaranteed when Britain leaves in 2019, so financial companies have been moving forward with contingency strategies, and Bank of America is the latest lender to announce its plans.

Thirteen years ago, Bethany Hamilton's left arm was bitten off by a tiger shark while they were surfing on Kauai. Despite losing 60 percent of their blood, they survived, returned to surfing three weeks later, became the subject of a number of movies and books over the years, and appeared on a ton of TV shows like The Amazing Race. Meanwhile, they also continued to work as a pro surfer.
Getting over the emotional trauma of a shark attack and then returning to the water is a feat on its own, but physically speaking, the actual balancing and paddling work of surfing seems near-impossible with one arm. Getting onto a big wave requires paddling up to speed then quickly pushing yourself up onto your feet, which are each hard enough on their own with two arms.
But their handicap hasn't stopped Hamilton from getting rad and competing in World Surf League competitions. This past weekend, they earned their highest WSL finish and took down the top-ranked surfer in the world, Tyler Wright, before bowing out in the semifinals. As you can see, they can still surf the hell out of a wave.
Famous as they are, Hamilton isn't a WSL regular, and they only entered the event as a wild card, but they proved they belonged pretty quickly. Getting back in the ocean at all after a shark bit your whole arm off is impressive as hell, but beating the world's top surfer is impressive is a pretty emphatic way to top things off.

Story:
According to Japanese Scientific Research, full ripe banana with dark patches on yellow skin produces a substance called TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) which has the ability to combat abnormal cells. The darker patches it has the higher will be its immunity enhancement quality; Hence, the riper the banana the better the anti-cancer quality. Yellow skin banana with dark spots on it is 8x more effective in enhancing the property of white blood cells than green skin version.
Eating 1-2 banana/s a day increases immunity.
Please pass/share and stay healthy.
Analysis:
It is a fact that nutrient content of fruits change slightly as they ripen. As a banana ripens and turns yellow, its levels of antioxidants increases. These antioxidants in ripe bananas protect your body against cancer and heart diseases. But while overripe bananas certainly have nutritional value, they also lose some benefits. In full ripe bananas with dark spots on skin, the starch content changes to simple sugars that are easier to digest and may raise your blood glucose levels quickly, but it could be harmful for people with diabetes. Also, the micronutrients like vitamins and minerals decrease as the bananas ripen.
Tumor Necrosis Factor(TNF-α) is a cytokine, substances secreted by certain cells of the immune system that have an effect on other cells. This is indeed helpful in fighting abnormal turmor cells in body. Research done on ripening bananas has proved that the levels of TNF-α induction increased markedly with dark spots on skin before the entire banana peel turned brown. The research concluded that the activity of banana was comparable to that of Lentinan, a chemical immunostimulant that is intravenously administered as an anti-cancer agent. So, ripe banana can act as an anti-cancer agent by stimulating the production of white blood cells in the human cell line.
Both green and yellow bananas are high fiber foods rich in potassium, vitamin B6, fiber, and vitamin C. They have high calorific value because of their high sugar levels. A medium sized banana provides about 105 calories. Also, bananas are very good for our Gastro-Intestinal tract and aid in digestion. Therefore, eating one or two bananas is indeed good for health. Once bananas ripen fully, store them in the refrigerator to minimize further vitamin loss. Fresh bananas with brown patches on the skin are ripe enough to eat immediately. Make sure to avoid over-ripe bananas whose skin has turned brown or split open.
And yes, you can share this healthy information with everyone.

One of the many monetary mysteries of the moment is why the inflation rate has been so persistently below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. Is the historical relationship between unemployment and inflation—the Phillips curve that suggests inflation rises as unemployment falls—broken?
Here's how former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, now a distinguished fellow at Brookings, answered that question when Alan Murray, editor of Fortune, put it to them recently at the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy. They said a lot turns on whether the public and financial markets continue to expect the Fed can get inflation up to target or not.
Inflation's harder to forecast than the Fed's statements on inflation. It's a safe bet the FOMC will stick to the party line at its next meeting and continue foreseeing a rise to 2 percent as the Phillips curve kicks in and the “transitory effects” of declines in oil and import prices work their way through the system.

The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday unanimously approved the toughest sanctions on North Korea in two decades, action that President Obama called “appropriate” in response to Pyonyang's latest nuclear test and rocket launch.
The sanctions, which the U.S. and North Korea's traditional ally China spent seven weeks negotiating, include mandatory inspections of cargo leaving and entering North Korea by sea or air, a ban on all sales or transfers of small arms and light weapons to Pyongyang, and expulsion of diplomats from the North who engage in “illicit activities.”
In a statement, Mr. Obama said the new sanctions impose “significant costs” for North Korea violating U.N. resolutions with its Jan. 6 nuclear test and Feb. 7 missile launch.
“This resolution levies strong new sanctions aimed at halting Pyongyang's efforts to advance its weapons of mass destruction programs,” Mr. Obama said. “Today, the international community, speaking with one voice, has sent Pyongyang a simple message: North Korea must abandon these dangerous programs and choose a better path for its people.”
The U.S., its Western allies and Japan pressed for new sanctions that went beyond the North's nuclear and missile programs but China, Pyongyang's neighbor, was reluctant to impose measures that could threaten the stability of North Korea and cause its economy to collapse.

Harlan Ellison Sues Again; Because No One Could Have Possibly Came Up With The Same SciFi Ideas As They Did
from the how-much-does-he-get-paid-to-piss dept
It ain't about the 'principle,' friend, its (sic) about the MONEY! Pay Me! Am I doing this for other writers, for Mom (still dead), and apple pie? Hell no! I'm doing it for the 35-year-long disrespect and the money!
Both works are said to take place in a "dystopian corporate future in which everyone is allotted a specific amount of time to live." In both works, government authorities known as a "Timekeeper" track the precise amount of time each citizen has left.
The complaint goes on to list similarities in the features of the universe as well as the plot surfaces -- the manipulation of time an individual can live, the type of death experienced by those whose time runs out, rebellion by story protagonists, and so forth.
"Why do people keep insisting that I join the 21st Century? I *LIVE* in the 21st Century! I just don't want to be bothered by the shitheads on the internet!"
People keep telling me that I might like the books of Harlan Ellison, but I won't go near them, since the man appears to be a total and complete wackjob when it comes to intellectual property. The guy likes to sue everyone, often without much understanding of the law. They famously sued AOL a decade or so ago, after they discovered some random people online had posted some of their content on Usenet. Yes, they sued AOL because of content they found posted on Usenet. But since they found it via AOL, somehow it must be AOL's fault. A judge had initially determined that, as per the DMCA, AOL had no liability , but after another court ruled that AOL lost its DMCA safe harbors for being too slow , AOL decided to simply pay Ellison to drop the suit.In a video from a few years back that has made the rounds time and time again, and which we've posted before, Ellison discusses how "I don't take a piss without getting paid" and bitches about all those damn amateurs undercutting their rates by giving stuff away for free.A few years ago, Ellison went legal again, suing Paramount over. He'd written an episode of the show in 1967, and was upset that some Star Trek book included elements from that show. Oh yeah, also there was a Christmas tree ornament that was sold, and they felt they deserved a cut of the profits. As they said at the time:So it's not surprising that he's suing again. This time, he's suing 20th Century Fox and trying to stop the release of a new sci-fi movie , which they claim is a pure copy of one of their most famous works, "Repent, Harlequin! Said The Ticktockman" Of course, as we've discussed plenty of times, copyright is only supposed to cover specific expressions, and not ideas... and the "similarities" they list certainly sound like ideas, not expressions:Of course, as Julian Sanchez points out , there are lots of sci-fi stories that have a very similar storyline (perhaps even more similar), including. Maybe Ellison will sue over those too.Unfortunately, these days, courts have really blurred the line between what's an expression and what's an idea, so perhaps something comes of this. But, once again, this really is just about money... and competition. It turns out that Ellison recently sold the rights to "Repent Harlequin" and another movie is being made. So, Ellison would like to censor this competition. But, really, it's pretty ridiculous for Ellison to think that no one else could have possibly come up with similar ideas on their own. And even if they were built off that bit of an idea from their work, is it really such a problem that people created a different version of it? Does Ellison really believe that none of their work was built off ideas influenced by others?I jumped over to Ellison's website to see if he'd put up any more colorful statements about the lawsuit (not that he'd want me to use them without paying him), but instead I find a splash page that just says:Seems like such a sweet guy.

Kasper Schmeichel: No regrets over leavng Manchester City
Leicester City goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel insists quitting Manchester City was the best decision of their career.
Schmeichel left City and the Premier League in 2009 to join Notts County in League Two and they believe the move helped propel their career.
The Dane is preparing for life in the Premier League with Leicester, who face Everton at home on Saturday, and Schmeichel has no regrets about leaving City despite their success in recent years.
"It was the best thing I've ever done. The best decision I ever made," said Schmeichel.
"I did not play for Manchester City and I had no prospects to play, so there was no reason to stay.
"I came to Notts County and I loved being there. It was great to play a full season and win the League Two championship.
"Leeds was not as good an experience, but then I came to Leicester, and it has only been positive.
It was the best thing I've ever done. The best decision I ever made. I did not play for Manchester City and I had no prospects to play, so there was no reason to stay. Kasper Schmeichel
"I signed a four-year contract with Leicester this summer so my future for the next years is reasonably set.
"My ambition right now is continued to play and hopefully stay in the Premier League."
The 27-year-old believes playing in the Premier League with Leicester will help them to emerge from the shadows of their dad Peter - a Manchester United and Denmark legend.
"That is something I have lived with my whole life," added Schmeichel. "There are a lot of people who like to talk about it but it is not something that means a lot to me.
"The only thing I do is to try to play my own game and be myself.

Three Borough Councillors Resign (report published yesterday)
In an email sent today (Thursday, March 14) to all Guildford Borough Councillors it was announced that three councillors have formally resigned. The three councillors are:
Councillor Wendy May (Lib Dem, Stoughton)
Councillor John Randall (Con, Ash Wharf)
Councillor Doug Richards (Con, Ash South and Tongham)
Cllr May wrote to their constituents: “It is with mixed emotions of sadness and excitement that I would like to let you know that I am standing down from my position as your Councillor in Stoughton at Guildford Borough Council.
“The decision has not been one that was taken lightly or quickly and it is because my family and I will be moving to Canada in the next few months to be closer to my Canadian family. After being in the UK since 1995 we feel that now is the right time to start a new chapter and for me to introduce my husband and kids to the cold Canadian winters which they have never experienced!
“Whilst we are very excited about our forthcoming move, it will be very hard to leave friends, family and all of you behind!
“I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for your support and communications since 2007 when I was first elected. It hasn't always been easy but I hope that you have felt well represented by myself and my colleagues in Stoughton and that you will continue to get in touch with them when you have issues that need resolving. Things may not always happen fast but we do try our hardest to make sure things get done for the benefit of the whole ward.”
Speaking as a spokesperson for the Conservative Group at GBC, Cllr Matt Furniss said: Cllr John Randall has resigned because their work commitments did not, they felt, allow them to give enough time to council duties. Cllr Doug Richards has simply moved out of Guildford Borough.
It is understood that it is likely three by-elections will be held on May 2 2013, the day of the Surrey County Council elections.

(Newser) – With the Proposition 8 trial entering its final stages in California, backers of the gay marriage ban are asking the judge to revoke all state recognition of the 18,000 gay couples who got married in the brief time it was legal. Doing so would honor “the expressed will of the people,” they argue in the court filing.
The conservatives aren't asking the judge to annul the marriages, their lawyer tells the San Francisco Chronicle, only to rule that government agencies and businesses no longer have to recognize them. Today the judge will hear final arguments in the case, in which gay rights advocates are suing to overturn the ban as unconstitutional. A ruling is expected in weeks, followed by a probable appeal to the Supreme Court within 2 years.

Emily Miller, the chief investigative reporter for Washington, D.C.'s Fox affiliate, delivered a rare segment on gun policy for the station. Them report was appended with the disclosure from their employer that "she is a strong advocate of the Second Amendment."
Miller, who was previously one of the most prominent sources of conservative misinformation on gun violence, has largely been silent on the topic since February, following controversies related to their pro-gun advocacy.
The August 24 broadcast of Fox 5 News @ 10 and the August 25 broadcast of Fox 5 Morning News @ 5 both ran a Miller segment on Washington, D.C., police chief Cathy Lanier's recent discussion of a spike in gun violence in the city. Lanier said at a meeting of law enforcement professionals that officers are recovering more high-capacity ammunition magazines -- those that can hold 10 rounds of ammunition or more -- at crime scenes in D.C., including some incidents "where there are 40 to 50 rounds fired."
Miller's segment -- which included their questioning Lanier at a news conference -- sought to cast doubt on the claim that more high-capacity magazines are actually being recovered. Miller often submits adversarial reporting on Lanier for Fox 5. During Miller's previous stint as senior opinion editor for the conservative Washington Times, they frequently criticized Lanier with the claim that they are anti-gun.
Following both broadcasts of Miller's segment, one of the program's co-anchors said, "It should be noted that chief investigative reporter Emily Miller authored a book about the national political debate over gun control.  They are a strong advocate of the Second Amendment."
The book referenced by Fox 5 is Emily Gets Them Gun: ... But Obama Wants To Take Yours, which was published in 2013 and advances conspiracy theories about a supposed desire by Obama to "disarm the populace" while pushing numerous falsehoods about gun violence.
Miller has not regularly reported on gun issues in D.C. since February, following controversy over their appearances at pro-gun rallies in Virginia and Maryland. During a January speech in front of an extremist gun group during a lobbying day at the Virginia State Capitol, Miller said that Washington D.C. "is not part of America, because they don't recognize the Second Amendment."
Miller's appearances at pro-gun rallies were criticized by journalism experts as a conflict of interest, given their coverage of gun issues in the D.C. metropolitan area.
Following the controversy, Fox 5 included a disclosure on one of Miller's reports that they "is a proponent for Second Amendment rights," but soon Miller left the gun beat entirely after a second controversy.
On February 25, The Washington Post's Erik Wemple reported that Miller had given different accounts of a 2010 "home invasion" in order to "squeeze the story for additional terror" in support of their pro-gun advocacy.
Miller's advocacy began with a series of blog posts for the Washington Times about their efforts to obtain a firearm license in Washington D.C. Miller explained that they wanted a gun in the wake of a "home invasion" in 2010.
Miller often told the story to pro-gun audiences, and in some instances described how they encountered a burglar inside of a residence they were housesitting and had to "talk them out of the house without" being harmed. Miller also had described being chased by more than a dozen of the burglar's accomplices after following them outside of the house.
But according to a series police documents obtained by Wemple, Miller told police that they encountered a suspicious man outside of the home, who gave them a business card for a tree service. Only hours later did Miller call the police after discovering that their credit card was missing from a wallet they had left inside of the house. Miller also made no mention of encountering more than a dozen of the suspected burglar's companions.
Fox 5's disclosure that Miller is "a strong advocate of the Second Amendment" is important given their long track record of spreading false information about gun violence, even while working as a reporter for the station.
During a May 19, 2014, segment on Fox 5, Miller reported on remarks about firearms given by Hillary Clinton during an appearance before the National Council for Behavioral Health. In their report, Miller claimed Clinton had "talked about hunting and fishing and all that stuff, now they are like, 'We need to pull back guns, nobody should have guns.'"
Clinton had actually said nothing of the sort. According to a video from the event, Clinton called for stronger gun laws but added, "I think you can say that and still support the right of people to own guns."

North Korean defectors say the communist country is feeling pressure for the European Union-led initiative to bring Kim Jong-un to justice partly because of the possible negative fallout on its source of hard currency.
So Jae-pyong, director general of the Seoul-based non-profit group Committee for the Democratization of North Korea, says the loss of hard currency will be inevitable for the North if the countries, who maintain diplomatic relations, cut them off.
They said in the Middle East there are thousands of North Korean workers and the remittances they send to the North are considered one of the major sources of hard currency for the North Korean regime.
"Countries in the region would feel pressure to end diplomatic relations with the North if public opinion goes from bad to worse because of its notorious human rights records," So told The Korea Times. "They may consider cutting off bilateral relations. If this becomes a reality, the North would no longer have remittances from the region."
According to the local government data, over 7,000 North Koreans are working in the Middle East. Kuwait has the majority share with over 4,000, followed by Qatar with 2,000, the United Arab Emirates host 1,000 and Libya has over 250.
So, a North Korean defector, said their former country has maintained close relationships with several countries in Africa and therefore it fears further diplomatic isolation if the EU-led effort to refer Kim to the international court gains further momentum.
They made the remarks amid growing international concern about North Korea following the U.N panel's fresh disclosure of human rights violations in February.
The U.N. report was drafted by Michael Kirby, chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea, and was based on testimonies from North Koreans who experienced prison camps.
Cha Kyung-sook, a North Korean defector who experienced prison camp once in 1999 and again in 2000, after their first two efforts to escape the communist country failed, said human rights violations there are ubiquitous.
They told The Korea Times that they and their second daughter lived like bats in the prison camp.
"At night, we slept holding the cell window tightly, so that our bodies didn't touch the lice covered floor. We lived like bats," they said. "We were treated like animals. I lost two teeth after I was badly beaten by a North Korean interrogator."
Cha called on the South Korean government to make human rights in North Korean a top priority, saying many North Koreans are malnourished and suffer from hunger.
On Wednesday, a North Korean seminar hosted by international human rights groups in collaboration with U.N. representatives of Australia, Botswana and Panama will take place in the U.N headquarters in New York.
At the beginning of the forum, Kirby, will speak on the issue and each of the defectors will share their experiences at prison camps before discussing the Stalinist state's abysmal human rights conditions.
Four defectors who were forcibly returned to the North, talk about the human rights violations they experienced at prison camps to raise international awareness of the shocking conditions.
Earlier this month, North Korea hosted an unprecedented session in the U.N. to explain its position on the EU-led effort to bring Kim Jong-un to justice for human rights abuses. Foreign diplomats and international journalists were invited.
Before this, the reclusive state also drew up a draft of human rights and circulated it to U.N. members in an attempt to minimize the EU-led drive to punish the North Korean regime.
Frank Cerabino has been a local news columnist for the Palm Beach Post for the past 24 years. They write five columns a week.
Donald Trump's noisy, rule-breaking entrance into national politics may be a revelation for some. But not for residents of their home town of Palm Beach, Fla., where for the past 30 years they have shattered old-money conventions and sensibilities with the same thin-skinned, sue-you-in-a-heartbeat, self-congratulatory ethos that has made them such a mesmerizing character on the national stage.
For decades I've watched most of this comedy-drama from my perch at The Palm Beach Post, where I work as a local news columnist on the hunt for humor. And when humor's your bag, there's no greater gift than Donald Trump. A gift I must now share, reluctantly, with my countrymen.
Story Continued Below
Where do I begin, America, to tell you what life dominated by The Donald is like—an experience you too will have if they enter the White House? There are many stories, but I think I should start with the flagpole on the front lawn of Mar-a-Lago, the 17-acre Palm Beach property Trump bought decades ago.
First you should know that Palm Beach is a town where measurements matter. Leaf blowers require inspections to verify they emit no more than 65 decibels from 50 feet away. Residents holding a garage sale are restricted to one sign that can't be more than 4 square feet in size. And residents flying flags on their property are restricted to flagpoles that are no higher than 42 feet and flags that are a maximum of four feet by six feet.
In October 2006, without getting a permit or a variance, Trump put up an 80-foot flagpole on the front lawn of Mar-a-Lago, with a car dealership-sized American flag of 15 feet by 25 feet flying from it.
Oh, they knew what they were doing. Trump, after all, had been fighting with the town poohbahs from the very moment he'd crashed into the complacent, clubby world of Palm Beach to buy Mar-a-Lago—the former estate of blue-blooded cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post—which turned out to be one of those great deals they couldn't afford. More on that later.
Trump knew from experience that Palm Beach was a stickler for adherence to its ordinances. They had once paid a $5,000 fine to the town for replacing a section of dead hedges with replacements that weren't quite tall enough.
But Trump had bigger changes in mind than merely out-flagging their neighbors. They were plainly inviting a lawsuit. The town council took the bait, citing the oversized pole and flag as violations of the town code, and fining Trump $250 a day for every day they remained on the estate.
“The town council of Palm Beach should be ashamed of itself,” Trump responded. “They're fining me for putting up the American flag. This is probably a first in United States history.” They went on Nancy Grace's national TV show to complain that the Town of Palm Beach was unpatriotic. Then, ignoring the town's violations, which grew to be a $120,000 fine and counting, they filed a lawsuit against Palm Beach, asking for $25 million in damages to what they called an abridgment to their constitutional right to free speech.
Tucked into their patriotic posturing was a completely unrelated legal matter that they made part of their multi-million lawsuit: a complaint about the town code that requires large commercial enterprises to be “town serving.” The town requires proof from local businesses that at least 50 percent of their business comes from town residents. So, for example, when Neiman Marcus opened on Worth Avenue in Palm Beach, it was allowed to do so by promising that it would only advertise in the town's newspaper, and not in publications that circulated to shoppers who don't live on the island.
For Trump, eliminating the “town serving” requirement would mean that they could offer more memberships to their Mar-a-Lago social club to people who had no connection to Palm Beach, making it easier for them to keep their club full. Softening up the town on the flag issue to pursue some other angle was a classic Trump move. Though they have yet to get this particular exemption waived, Palm Beach has learned from experience that Trump's lawsuits are never settled, just dormant. One of their Palm Beach lawyers said recently that the “town serving” issue is still unresolved and ripe for more litigation.
As for the flag, guess who won?
Trump eventually dropped their lawsuit over the flag, and in exchange the town waived its fines. As terms of a court-ordered mediation, Trump would file for a permit and be allowed to keep an oversized pole on Mar-a-Lago that was 10-feet shorter than original pole and on a different spot on their lawn. The agreement also called for them to donate $100,000 to veterans' charities.
That's some expensive defiance. But maybe you've got look at in a more Trumpian light. They essentially got what they wanted: The biggest pole on Palm Beach. (Paging Dr. Freud?)
Advantage, once again, Donald Trump. And for Palm Beachers, just another encounter with the human shock wave from New York.
***
So it has been all along down here, from the moment in 1985 when Trump decided that Mar-a-Lago would be their personal castle. Mar-a-Lago, the last of Palm Beach's estates to stretch from the ocean to the Intracoastal Waterway, was a single-family home of gargantuan proportions: Its Mediterranean-Revival-style mansion had 118 rooms, including 58 bedrooms and 33 bathrooms and a 75-foot tower that could be seen for miles. The property was roomy enough for its own 9-hole golf course and citrus grove.
Built in 1927 for Post, then the richest woman in America, they later willed it to the federal government to be used as a winter White House for American presidents. The home became a National Historic Landmark. But presidents didn't use it and the federal government grew weary of paying for the $1 million a year it took to maintain it.
“The town council of Palm Beach should be ashamed of itself,” Trump responded after learning that their mansion was in violation of a town ordinance that limited flagpole height. After Trump went on Nancy Grace's national TV show to complain that Palm Beach was unpatriotic, they filed a lawsuit against the town, asking for $25 million in damages. | AP
So the estate was put up for sale. At the time, Trump was a hotshot 39-year-old New York real estate developer who two years earlier had opened their signature 58-story Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan. And the federal government, eager to unload the Florida mansion, agreed to a $10 million sale—$7 million for the property and $3 million for the furnishings—in a contract that required Trump to put down only $2,812 of their own money.

They call the Optimus Prime Hoodie a costume, but come on. I would rock that shizit out any day of the year. Particularly days when I feel like spontaneously transforming into a brave and wise leader of robots (with accompanying mouth-made sound effects) in a large, semi-quiet public space, such as the Albuquerque airport or jury duty waiting room. Costume. Please. This zip-front hoodie featuring spacious kangaroo pockets and appliqued Transformer adornments is about to become one of my wardrobe staples.
Available in sizes S through 3XL, the Optimus Prime Hoodie design includes cotton and polyester blend expressions of Autobot lights, windows, and grills. The half-mask summoned forth by zipping the hood is fully lined with blue satin fabric, and sports topstitched accents and foam-lined antennae. A white Autobots logo is screenprinted on the upper left sleeve.

Former Aligarh Muslim University scholar Gulzar Ahmed Wani will walk out of jail after 16 years with an Uttar Pradesh court today acquitting them of the charge of having orchestrated the Sabarmati Express blast in 2000 that claimed nine lives.
Additional Sessions Judge in Barabanki, MA Khan freed 43-year-old Wani, a suspected Hizbul Mujahideen operative, and co-accused Mobin in the case due to lack of evidence, defence counsel MS Khan, who represented Wani, said over phone.
Wani, who was arrested by Delhi Police in 2001 allegedly with explosives and incriminating materials, is a resident of Peeparkari area of Srinagar (Jammu and Kashmir) and is lodged in a jail in Lucknow.
The blast was carried out on the eve of Independence Day near Kanpur when the train was on its way from Muzaffarpur to Ahmedabad, claiming nine lives and leaving several others injured.
"The court of Additional Sessions Judge M A Khan acquitted both the accused of all the charges as the prosecution could not establish any of the charges levelled against them," the lawyer said.
A case was registered by the Uttar Pradesh police at GRP police station, Barabanki for the alleged offences of murder, attempt to murder, criminal conspiracy, waging war, collecting arms and conspiring to commit offences against the country under the IPC.
Charges were also filed against them under the Indian Railways Act and Explosive Substances Act.
Ten other cases were also registered against Wani. Out of the 11 cases, they have been exonerated in 10 as they have either been acquitted or discharged, the lawyer said.
In one case, Wani was convicted and sentenced to 10 years jail for carrying explosives to trigger a blast in Delhi. However, the Delhi High Court had suspended their sentence.
The Supreme Court granted bail to Wani in April this year observing that they have suffered incarceration for over 16 years and has been acquitted in nine out of 11 cases lodged against him.
The apex court had said that Wani would be released on bail from November one on set terms and conditions of the trial court irrespective of the completion of the trial.
Wani was pursuing PhD in Arabic from the AMU when they were arrested from Delhi on July 30, 2001. The arrest was made in connection with explosives recovered in Delhi.
The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court had on August 26, had denied bail to him, saying, "Release of such persons would adversely affect the interests of the society."
Wani had challenged the high court order before the apex court which had last year directed the trial court to expeditiously examine the material witnesses in the case in six months.
The prosecution had alleged that the accused had hatched a conspiracy in May 2000 at Habib Hall, AMU, to carry out a blast in the Sabarmati Express on August 14, 2000. Charges were framed against them in July 2001.
Advocate Khan had argued that in the absence of any material to prove a meeting of mind which is required for proving conspiracy, the accused deserve acquittal as there was no independent material or evidence to prove that any meeting was held at Habib Hall in 2000.
"Since there was no independent material or evidence to prove that any such meeting at Habib Hall held in 2000, so the question that the same was called or attended by Wani or other accused does not arise," they had said.

Bilkis Bano case: Story of brutality and 15-year-long wait for justice
Amazon is aiming to join the productivity suite battle with its own solution, a new report reveals, with the company planning to develop software that would compete against the enterprise products owned by Google and Microsoft.
The Information writes that Amazon is already exploring ways to create its own productivity suite, and one way to do that is to extend the existing capabilities of two existing solutions, namely WorkMail calendar app and WorkDocs file storage service.
Furthermore, Amazon is also looking into its options to develop a series of additional tools, including document and spreadsheet apps similar to Microsoft and Excel, with the final goal of creating a fully-featured productivity suite specifically targeting corporate customers.
Chime video conferencing apps could also be included in the suite, the asupervisorstioned source notes citing people familiar with the matter.
While it could make sense for Amazon to expand in this business, the company undoubtedly has a long and difficult road ahead, especially because it has to fight the criticism that it received in the last couple of years for shipping updates at a rather slow cadence as compared to rivals.
Productivity tools running in the cloud
Both Google and Microsoft are already dominating this enterprise business with their productivity suites, so Amazon needs to make the most of its existing options, which could include a possible implementation based on the AWS AppStream service.
This makes it possible for customers to stream desktop apps with AWS to any HTML5 compliant device, which could give Amazon the opportunity of making its productivity suite available across a wide array of devices, including PCs, tablets, and smartphones, similar to Microsoft's Office 365.
All applications running on AppStream are based in the cloud, so they require no processing power on the target device, with all resources, including storage needs, provided by Amazon.
It goes without saying that Amazon does have a series of options when it comes to expanding in the productivity suite business, but it all comes down to how and when the company is planning to bring these plans to fruition.
In the meantime, the corporate productivity service market is becoming an essential cash cow for both Google and Microsoft, with the Windows maker itself reporting increases every new quarter. Microsoft currently has 23.1 million Office 365 subscribers, with revenue going up 54 percent in the last quarter.
Calvin Coolidge Julius Caesar Tuskahoma McLish (December 1, 1925 – August 26, 2010), nicknamed "Bus",[1] was an American professional baseball player and coach. As a pitcher, McLish played in Major League Baseball for the Brooklyn Dodgers (1944, 1946), Pittsburgh Pirates (1947–48), Chicago Cubs (1949, 1951), Cleveland Indians (1956–59), Cincinnati Reds (1960), Chicago White Sox (1961) and Philadelphia Phillies (1962–64). They were a switch-hitter and threw right-handed.
In a 15-season career, McLish posted a 92–92 record with 713 strikeouts and a 4.00 earned run average in 1,609.0 innings pitched.
Background [ edit ]
McLish was born in Anadarko, Oklahoma, on December 1, 1925.[2] McLish's parents were John and Lula McLish. Their father was three-quarters Cherokee Indian.[3] They were the seventh of eight children. They were named for Calvin Coolidge, Julius Caesar, and Tuskahoma, Oklahoma.[4] They stated that the origin of their lengthy name is that their father was given permission to name the newborn, after not getting to name their previous six children, and they took full advantage of the opportunity.[4][5] They were raised in Oklahoma City, and went to Central High School.[2]
Playing career [ edit ]
McLish signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers before the 1944 season.[1] They made their Major League Baseball debut with the Dodgers that year, the first time they played organized baseball.[2] They spent 1945 in the United States Army, and was deployed in the Western Front of World War II.[4] They returned to baseball in 1946, playing for the Dodgers.
On May 3, 1947, the Dodgers traded McLish, Hank Behrman, Kirby Higbe, Dixie Howell, and Gene Mauch to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Al Gionfriddo and $100,000 ($1,122,057 in current dollar terms).[6] In addition to pitching for Pittsburgh in 1948, they also pitched for the Indianapolis Indians of the Class AAA American Association (AA).[7] With McLish, the Indians won the AA pennant. After the 1948 season, the Pirates traded McLish and Frankie Gustine to the Chicago Cubs for Cliff Chambers and Clyde McCullough.[8] They played in the minor leagues for the Los Angeles Angels of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) in 1949.[4]
McLish won 20 games for the Angels during the 1950 season. The Cubs sold McLish to the San Diego Padres, also in the PCL, in 1955. In 1956, McLish returned to MLB, pitching for the Cleveland Indians. They had a 16-8 win–loss record for Cleveland during the 1958 season, with a 2.99 earned run average (ERA).[4][9] In the 1958 and 1959 seasons, McLish set a major league record with 16 consecutive wins in road games. This was later surpassed by Greg Maddux.[2] In 1959, McLish had a 19-8 win–loss record with a 3.62 earned run average. They appeared in the 1959 MLB All-Star Game, earning the save for the American League.[2][4] Despite having a chance for their 20th win, Indians management asked McLish to forgo their final start of the season so that Herb Score could pitch, as they returned from injury.[10]
After the 1959 season, the Indians traded McLish with Gordy Coleman and Billy Martin to the Cincinnati Redlegs for Johnny Temple.[9] Disappointed by the trade, McLish said that Indians' general manager Frank Lane "never did like me".[11] McLish played for the Redlegs in 1960. After the season, they traded McLish and Juan Pizarro to the Chicago White Sox for Gene Freese.[12] Before the 1962 season, the White Sox sent McLish to the Philadelphia Phillies when Andy Carey, who they had traded to Philadelphia, refused to report. Carey instead went to the Dodgers, and McLish was sent to the Phillies.[13] In 1963, McLish had a 13-11 win-loss record in 211 innings pitched, the most on the team. They suffered from an injured shoulder the next season, and the Phillies released McLish in July 1964.[14]
McLish also pitched for the Leones del Caracas of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League, posting a 14-12 record with a 2.69 ERA and 147 strikeouts in parts of two seasons spanning 1953–1956. They also helped themselves with the bat, hitting .358 (54-for-151) with three home runs and 14 runs batted in, being used occasionally as a pinch hitter.[15]
Coaching and scouting career [ edit ]
After their playing career, McLish became a major league pitching coach for the Phillies, under Mauch, the Phillies' manager. They coached for the Phillies in 1965 and 1966, and then spent the next two years scouting for the Phillies.[16] They then followed Mauch to the expansion Montreal Expos in 1969,[17] where they served as pitching coach and developed pitchers Bill Stoneman, Carl Morton, Steve Renko, and Ernie McAnally.[1] They were ill in 1973 with bronchial pneumonia, and team doctors sent them home to recuperate.[18]
The Expos fired Mauch and McLish after the 1975 season. They were soon thereafter hired to coach the Milwaukee Brewers.[16] They coached the Brewers from 1976 through 1982.[2] They then served as a scout for the Brewers. They worked in professional baseball through 2005, when they were an instructor for the Seattle Mariners.[10]
Personal life [ edit ]
McLish was inducted to the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame in 2009.[19]
McLish and their wife, Ruth, were married for 60 years. They had a daughter, three sons, and thirteen grandchildren. McLish died of leukemia in Edmond, Oklahoma.[4]

An Alaskan fisherman and their girlfriend have been charged over a plot, in which they staged the man's death, prompting the Coast Guard to waste over $300,000 on an unnecessary rescue operation. The hoax was meant to save the man from jail time.
"Two Port Graham, Alaska, residents have been federally charged related to their causing the United States Coast Guard to attempt to save life and property when no help was needed," the Department of Justice announced.
In order to avoid a prison sentence in a sexual assault case, Ryan Riley Meganack, 34, decided to fake their own death with the help of their girlfriend Ivy Rose Rodriguez, 25.
Port Graham Couple Charged with Crimes Related to False Distress Call and Causing a Hoax Search and Rescue Operation https://t.co/6ZYMk5NRnJ — U.S. Attorney Alaska (@USAO_AK) July 20, 2017
The couple devised a plan, where Meganack, a fisherman by trade, sailed out on their boat in November 2016 to an island near their home village of Port Graham, located near the southern tip of the Kenai Peninsula. They then abandoned the skiff there and returned to shore on a larger vessel.
There the man had a rendezvous with their girlfriend. The couple then traveled to an earlier prepared makeshift camp, where Meganack had hoped to lay low while their mate alerted authorities of their ‘disappearance.'
A day later Rodriguez told their boyfriend's family that Meganack had left in their flat-bottomed skiff.
Emphasizing that the skiff “wasn't running right,” they also told their boyfriend's family that Meganack had been drinking and was in possession of more alcohol when they set sail.

The US Attorney's indictment alleges that "Meganack and Rodriguez agreed that Rodriguez would tell Meganack's family that Meganack was missing, knowing that Meganack's family would report them missing and that a search for Meganack would commence," the Department of Justice said in their press release.
That is exactly what happened. Fearing that Meganack might be dead, the authorities organized a search for the missing person, while the 34-year-old was well alive and chilling at their camp.
During the three day search which involved state, federal, and local authorities, in addition to Port Graham residents, the rescue operation ran a massive bill. The Coast Guard alone spent more than $310,000 looking for Meganack in poor weather conditions.
Thanks to a tip, the fugitive was eventually found hiding out at their campsite on December 2. They were then arrested and taken into custody.
Both Rodriguez and Meganack have been charged with “crimes related to a false distress call and causing a hoax search and rescue operation.”
About a week after their “disappearance” they were scheduled to plead guilty in a 2015 sexual assault case in Anchorage in a court bargain, which would have landed them in jail. A court passed a sentence in that case in January.
Heading into the 2013 offseason, the San Francisco 49ers will be once again looking to situate the wide receiver corps. After Ted Ginn Jr. and Randy Moss inevitably depart, the Niners will have only four contracted players at the position.
And of the four returning, two are coming off season-ending injuries and another has yet to record a single NFL catch. Michael Crabtree stands out as the one dependable WR for the Niners going forward. It's a virtual certainty that the 49ers will look for outside help this offseason, and should explore all options.
On Sunday, NFL.com reported that the Minnesota Vikings will be examining trade offers for Percy Harvin. The Vikings WR currently has one year left on their deal, and reportedly wants out. Finally, the Vikings are in agreement and seem willing to meet Harvin's demands.
49ers would seem like a good landing spot for Harvin…He would be a weapon in that offense and the 49ers have a zillion draft picks. — Daniel Jeremiah (@MoveTheSticks) February 10, 2013
The 49ers will have roughly 14 available selections in the 2013 NFL Draft. They could potentially gain more with the trade of Alex Smith as well.
49ers 2013 picks
1. First round: Own pick
2. Second round: Own pick
3. Third round: Own pick
4. Third round: From Carolina in trade-back during 2012 draft
5. Third round: Likely compensatory selection
6. Fourth round: Own pick
7. Fifth round: Own pick
8. Fifth round: From Indianapolis in trade-back during 2012 draft
9. Sixth round: Own pick
10. Sixth round: From Miami in trade-back during 2012 draft
11. Seventh round: Own pick
12. Seventh round: From Cincinnati for Taylor Mays
13. Seventh round: Likely compensatory selection
14. Seventh round: Likely compensatory selection
According to Steve Bateman, the talk around Minnesota is that they are looking for a 2nd and a 4th rounder to part with Harvin. If that is the case, the 49ers can make the trade and still have three 3rd round picks to move around in the early-to-mid rounds.
They would still have 12 picks to do whatever they please, leaving them plenty of ammunition to maneuver throughout the draft.
Harvin is an extremely dynamic player that could be a multidimensional threat for San Francisco. They can be a kick and punt returner, sharing time with Kyle Williams and LaMichael James. Over their career, Harvin has shouldered the return duties, emerging as one of the top threats in the league.
Again, since Ginn is expected to be on their way out, this would be a logical addition.
Harvin also operates out of the backfield and could potentially add an entire new dimension to the Pistol formation. With Harvin lining up in the backfield like Randall Cobb in Green Bay, San Francisco can introduce a litany of innovative new plays.
And if Delanie Walker leaves, Harvin can be that "swiss army knife" for the Niners.
Harvin was also greatly frustrated in Minnesota; likely because of the inconsistency and lack of dynamism outside the running game. In their fifth year, they could come to the Bay Area and find a home with sensation Colin Kaepernick. As a pass-catcher, Harvin possesses the perfect skill set for this timing-based West Coast hybrid system.
From a financial perspective, Harvin's cap figure in 2013 is set at approximately $4.02 million, which is a steal. The 49ers would have a dynamic tandem between them and Michael Crabtree, and it would cost them next to nothing. A lot of the top receivers average double-digit millions per season. Harvin's deal would be closer to what San Francisco paid Randy Moss this past season.
Now, given that Mario Manningham is coming off a torn ACL and owed a cap figure of $4.95 million in 2013, the 49ers may cut them and start fresh. If they part ways with Manningham, the 49ers can save $2.35 million in cap room and put it toward Harvin.
And once Harvin's deal expires in 2014, they could potentially take a deal to re-sign with the 49ers and lock down this WR group. The opportunity to win, see a lot of touches and play with a franchise quarterback may be enough to make Harvin fall in love with San Francisco.
This deal may not only work out in the short-term, but it could be a terrific move in the long run.

The attorney for Adnan Syed, the subject of the "Serial" podcast, filed a petition Tuesday requesting that Baltimore Circuit Court reopen post-conviction proceedings so an alibi witness can testify on the convicted murderer's behalf.
The conviction of Syed, 35, has been questioned by many since "Serial," an offshoot of the "This American Life" public radio program, aired 12 podcast episodes that revisited the evidence in their case, as well as the defense Syed received in their murder trial 15 years ago.
The podcasts raised questions about the competence of their defense attorney, the accuracy of cellphone records, crime scene items that might have gone untested and an alibi witness for Syed whom their trial lawyer never approached.
Syed was convicted of killing their ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, a Woodlawn High School classmate, on Jan. 13, 1999. Prosecutors had no physical evidence or eyewitness tying Syed to the killing, but the testimony of Jay Wilds, an acquaintance who said they helped Syed bury the body in Baltimore's Leakin Park, was seen as the "linchpin" of the state's case, according to Syed's petition.
After Syed's arrest, Asia McClain, a Woodlawn classmate, wrote two letters to them in jail in which they wondered how they could be a suspect in the murder when they had seen them in a public library near school on the day prosecutors believe Syed killed Lee.
Adnan Syed, the imprisoned subject of the "Serial" podcast series, said their trial lawyer's failure to interview an alibi witness was worse than many other cases where new trials were granted.

Syed told their attorney at the time, M. Cristina Gutierrez, about McClain, but the lawyer did not interview them
The Court of Special Appeals agreed in February to hear Syed's appeal of a lower court ruling that denied their request for a new trial. The court said in May that McClain should be allowed to testify so their testimony could be considered in deliberations on whether Syed deserves a new trial.
The court called on the Baltimore Circuit Court to reopen Syed's post-conviction hearings so McClain's testimony could be taken. Syed's petition Tuesday formally requests that the lower court do so.
A spokesperson for the Maryland attorney general's office, which opposes Syed's court challenge, said state lawyers would file a response to the petition.
"The state has reviewed Mr. Syed's filing and is looking forward to the opportunity to explain why reopening the post-conviction proceedings is not appropriate under these circumstances," said David Nitkin, the attorney general's spokesperson.
Syed's current attorney, C. Justin Brown, argues in the filing that McClain didn't testify in the initial hearings because they said then-prosecutor Kevin Urick dissuaded them from doing so by telling them that Syed's claims of innocence had no merit. Urick has denied that claim but has acknowledged that they did have a phone conversation with McClain.
McClain has never wavered from their story that they saw Syed in the Woodlawn branch public library in Baltimore County after school on Jan. 13, 1999. Prosecutors maintain Syed killed Lee in a nearby retail store parking lot at the same time.
"If this Court re-opens the post-conviction proceeding and McClain provides testimony consistent with their affidavits, their testimony would establish that they saw Syed between 2:20 and 2:40 at the Woodlawn Library, which directly contradicts the State's theory that Syed killed the victim between 2:15 and 2:36 in the Best Buy parking lot," the petition said.
The attorney general's office has said Syed's legal team is overstating the effect McClain's testimony could have on the case. In a previous brief filed in the case, state lawyers say McClain's alibi rules out one timeline prosecutors have used in the case but it does not rule out another equally probable timeline that fits evidence in the case.
"To be clear, the point is not that the State's asserted timeline was flawed, but only that Syed overstates the significance of Asia McClain," the state's brief said.
"Serial" was created and co-produced by former Baltimore Sun staff writer Sarah Koenig, a contributor to "This American Life." The podcast was downloaded 76 million times, becoming a worldwide phenomenon.

Milwaukee Public Schools Score, on Average, 20 Points Worse Than the Statewide Average
September 16, 2014
by Christian D'Andrea
MacIver Institute Education Policy Analyst
The Department of Public Instruction (DPI) released the latest School Report Cards on Tuesday, allowing Wisconsinites to get a better look at the performance of their local public schools. The average report card score rose by half a point in 2013-14 thanks in part to fewer deductions in Wisconsin's classrooms for problems like high school dropouts and high absentee rates.
This was the third year that data was reported for the state's School Report Cards, but since changes were made after the pilot year in 2011-12, our comparisons will be limited to the past two years. These grades are based on student performance in grades 3-10 in four different categories. Those are: student achievement, student growth, closing gaps, and postsecondary readiness. Schools are also subject to deductions from their overall score if they fail to meet state benchmarks for attendance, test participation, and dropout rates.
Only one district fell in the “Fails to Meet Expectations” range. That was Milwaukee, whose score of 51.1 was 4.8 points lower than the next-worst district (Bayfield). Only one of the state's 20 largest districts, Elmbrook, earned the equivalent of an “A” grade in 2013-2014.
15 of the state's 20 largest districts saw their School Report Card scores rise in 2013-14. Madison, Eau Claire, Wausau, Sun Prairie and Elmbrook all saw gains of a full point or more in the past school year. Conversely, Janesville, West Allis-West Milwaukee and West Bend all saw their scores drop by the same margin.
Superintendent Tony Evers pointed out that these higher scores may be the product of fewer point deductions that were related to student behavior. Only six of the state's 424 districts earned five-point deductions for absentee rates, low test participation, or having a high concentration of dropouts. Evers praised this performance but warned that there's still work to do in Wisconsin's public schools in this morning's release.
“Most of our public schools and school districts are providing a solid education to our children, but we don't want to rest on our laurels,” said the Superintendent. “These report cards are a good communication device to focus discussion among parents, schools, and communities on how our schools and school districts are doing and how they can continue to improve.”
These higher scores are a step forward for Wisconsin's schools. This year's improvement on state metrics may help ease concerns over the discussed use of the School Report Cards as a measuring stick for sanctioning consistently underperforming schools and rewarding/replicating consistently strong ones. We'll have a more in-depth breakdown of these marks – including what they mean for the state's charter school population – as the week wears on.
A college student from Key Biscayne was arrested on drunk-driving and manslaughter charges after police say they struck two cyclists on Crandon Boulevard early Wednesday, killing one and seriously injuring the other before driving off.
Alejandro Alvarez, 21, a University of Maryland student who said they had been out all night at a Miami Beach club, turned themselves in after having second thoughts about fleeing, Miami-Dade police said in an arrest affidavit released late Wednesday. Alvarez returned to the site of the collision some 20 minutes later and, while crying “hysterically,” admitted they had hit the cyclists, police said.
Cyclist Walter Reyes, 50, CFO at the South Florida real-estate firm Keyes Company, was pronounced dead at the site of the collision, which occurred at 5:22 a.m. in the southbound portion of the road about half a mile past the Crandon Park Marina. Their cycling companion, Coral Gables attorney Henry Hernandez, was taken to Mercy Hospital in serious condition.
Police say Reyes and Hernandez were riding in the marked bike lane where the road curves towards the village of Key Biscayne when Alvarez passed other vehicles, drove into the bike lane and hit both cyclists. Alvarez, who said they were looking at their iPhone to change a song when they swerved into the cyclists, told police they were “scared” and drove home to Harbor Drive in Key Biscayne.

The windshield of the motorist's gray 2014 Volkswagen Jetta bore two large indentations, suggesting the cyclists were hit hard enough to be sent flying. The grass off to the right of the showed tire marks, indicating the motorist drove off the pavement before taking off, leaving the severely injured cyclists prone on the road.
Both men's bikes were equipped with bright front and rear lights, as required by law when riding after dark, photos of the bikes show. The rear red light on Reyes' Cannondale bike was still flashing hours later as it lay in the road while police investigated.
Reyes' is the third hit-and-run death of a cyclist on the road to Key Biscayne — the most popular cycling route in Miami-Dade County — in five years, and seems certain to prompt renewed calls for long-promised, but only partly implemented, safety improvements along Crandon and the Rickenbacker Causeway.
“It's just tragic,” said Miami architect Bernard Zyscovich, who has been pushing county officials to speed up improvements for cyclists and pedestrians along the causeway since the 2012 hit-and-run death of triathlete and business person Aaron Cohen on the William Powell Bridge. “It's so frustrating. It's bordering now on issues of culpability. If we spend some money, we could solve it right away. That's the call to action we need to make.”
Cohen's death, and a light sentence of less than two years given to the motorist who killed him, prompted an outcry from cyclists and a successful campaign to make penalties mandatory for motorists who leave the scene of an accident. Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez also pledged to make extensive safety improvements to the roadway, though advocates say they have been slow to be implemented and don't do enough to protect cyclists and pedestrians.
In 2010, cyclist Christophe LeCanne was struck from behind and killed by a drunken driver while riding in the bike lane on Bear Cut Bridge, which connects Virginia Key and Key Biscayne.
The stretch of Crandon along which Reyes and Hernandez were struck has long been scheduled for a makeover that would widen the bike lanes and narrow the two automobile lanes to slow speeding cars and provide greater separation from motorized traffic for cyclists. Some advocates have also called for a physical barrier, like a curb or low wall, to protect cyclists on the road.
But the work was delayed by the emergency reconstruction of the Bear Cut Bridge last year, and is now supposed to happen this coming spring, according to county public works officials.
Gimenez issued a statement after Wednesday's fatal collision expressing condolences to Reyes' family and pledging to complete safety improvements along the causeway.
“I want to reiterate that the safety of all of our pedestrians, bicyclists and our traveling public is of the utmost importance and is a top transportation priority,” Gimenez said in their statement.
Reyes had been training for next month's Dolphins Cycling Challenge, a two-day event that raises money for the University of Miami's Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. They were leader of Keyes' team for the event.
“Our hearts are with Walter Reyes' family & the entire @ridedcc community. We are deeply saddened, but forever grateful for their support. #RIP,” the cancer center tweeted.
Police charged Alvarez with leaving the scene of a crash involving a death and a serious injury, DUI manslaughter and DUI serious injury to another.
In the arrest affidavit, police say Alvarez smelled strongly of alcohol, was slurring their speech, had blood-shot eyes and was “hysterically crying” when they returned to the scene of the collision. There they approached a Key Biscayne officer, saying, “It was me, I was the one that was involved in the accident.”
But Alvarez denied they were drinking and, after failing a roadside sobriety test, refused to consent to a blood sample. Paramedics drew several blood samples after obtaining a warrant. After they were taken to the homicide bureau, police say, Alvarez said they had been out at a Beach club until 4:30 a.m.
After hitting the cyclists and going home, Alvarez told police, they tried smashing the Jetta's rear window with a golf club to “fake a robbery,” but thought better of it and called 911. The operator told them to return to the scene and turn themselves in.
All three fatalities on the road to Key Biscayne, safety advocates note, have been eerily similar — occurring early in the morning, when many serious cyclists ride to the key, but also when some people are driving back home to the island after a night of partying. In all three cases, police said the cyclists were riding legally and safely in designated, marked bike lanes when they were struck from behind.
In February 2012, Key Biscayne resident Michele Traverso fled home after striking Cohen and a fellow cyclist, who suffered a broken leg. Although police suspect they had been drinking, they could not prove they were impaired because they didn't turn themselves in until the next day.
The Aaron Cohen Act, approved by the Florida Legislature last year, imposed a mandatory-minimum prison sentence of four years for drivers convicted of leaving the scene of a fatal crash. It also boosted the mandatory-minimum prison sentence from two years to four years for a DUI driver who leaves a fatal crash scene.
Both could apply to Alvarez in Wednesday's collision.
In an odd twist, a Miami-Dade judge in December sent Traverso to prison for 28 more months after their probation officer caught them on the beach outside their Key Biscayne condo, where they were serving house arrest.
In the LeCanne case in January 2010, aspiring pop singer Carlos Bertonatti dragged the man's crumpled bike for two miles through Key Biscayne before police caught up with him. Bertonatti, who was drunk after a night of partying at Club Space in downtown Miami, was sentenced in 2013 to 12 years in prison.
After some moving and eloquent testimony, the Main Senate voted to approve same-sex marriage 20-15 this morning. There is a possibility however that the legislation may get tabled because of a late amendment that would put the issue before Maine voters in November. From the Sun Journal:
Immediately, however, one of the senators who voted No – Republican David Hastings of Fryeburg – introduced an amendment from the floor that would send the issue directly out to statewide voters in November. That move prompted Democratic Majority Leader Philip Bartlett of Gorham to request a recess. The House of Representatives has already adjourned until next Tuesday, so the bill can't come up for preliminary consideration there until then.
A recent poll shows Maine voters are evenly split on the issue. And, while it remains unclear if Governor Baldacci would sign the bill should it reach their desk, they have suggested recently that they would favor the legislation.
UPDATE: It appears the amendment to put the issue up for referendum in November has failed, and the revised vote is now 21-14 in favor of same-sex marriage!

England (0) 12
Tries: Foden, Cueto Cons: Wilkinson
France (16) 19
Tries: Clerc, Medard Pens: Yachvili 2 Drop-goal: Trinh-Duc
Media playback is not supported on this device England's best days are ahead - Johnson
England's World Cup dreams fell apart under a French onslaught on a night when their shortcomings were brutally exposed at the quarter-final stage.
First-half tries from Vincent Clerc and Maxime Medard opened a lead of 16 unanswered points as England shipped penalties and made basic errors across the park.
England struck back with a fine try from Ben Foden and closed to within seven points with three minutes left when Mark Cueto capitalised on a break from replacement Matt Banahan.
But they ran out of time and inspiration as Les Bleus set up a deserved semi-final clash with Wales.
France, so poor in their pool matches, were a side transformed as they took revenge for their World Cup defeats of 2007 and 2003.
Ex-England scrum-half Matt Dawson on BBC Radio 5 Live "England were blown away in the first half and probably got a proper telling off. They came out with a little more pace and precision but they made too many mistakes with knock-ons, penalites and turnovers. England were never going to score from 80m out. "Those who have watched England before could see they were not any different but whereas Scotland and Argentina couldn't last the distance and England won late on, France were a different outfit."
The defeat will leave manager Martin Johnson under pressure after their gamble of pairing Jonny Wilkinson and Toby Flood at 10 and 12 failed to ignite the England back line, while their forwards were repeatedly second best at the set-piece and in the loose.
Johnson's contract expires in November, and four weeks as memorable for scandals off the pitch as any achievements on it will do little to appease the notoriously twitchy committee-men at the Rugby Football Union.
France were supposedly a team in pieces, beaten by Tonga just a week ago and with coach Marc Lievremont publicly berating their players, but so clear-cut was their victory that much of the atmosphere had been sucked from the contest long before the end.
England had an early opportunity with a line-out deep in French territory after a clever grubber from Foden only for Lionel Nallet to burgle back possession, and they then tore into France again as Alexis Palisson was smashed backwards after taking a garryowen and Manu Tuilagi thundered into Morgan Parra.
After spluttering sporadically for four games, England's Kiwi campaign ended as it probably deserved to: in defeat, to a team that was more dynamic, more clinical and far more composed when it mattered most. Tom Fordyce blog Read more from Tom's blog
But it was the most fleeting of false dawns. Dmitri Yachvilli slotted a penalty from distance after Flood failed to release their man on the deck, and France took a grip they would never relinquish.
Wilkinson was struggling, sending the re-start straight into touch and flinging a pass the same way, and France then went close to the first try of the contest as Clerc took a long pass out on the left and was just bundled into touch by the corner flag.
Yachvilli made it 6-0 with a second sweet strike from 45 metres after Matt Stevens was penalised for collapsing a scrum, and then slid another penalty just wide from the same spot.
England's World Cup record 1987 - quarter-finals
1991 - runners-up
1995 - semi-finals
1999 - quarter-finals
2003 - winners
2007 - finalists
2011 - quarter-finals
England's players had talked of "blitzing" France in the first 20 minutes, but it was Lievremont's men with all the menace and danger.
Another line-out was stolen, and when the ball was sent left Clerc stepped and spun through limp challenges from Wilkinson, Chris Ashton and Foden to dive over and make it 11-0.
England were once again static in their few attacks, only Tuilagi's bullocking runs offering any threat, Flood reduced to aiming a long-range drop-goal pit which missed by a street.
Louis Deacon shipped another sloppy penalty, allowing Yachvili to kick to the corner, and after thunderous drives from the forwards left wing Alexis Palisson and Medard combined out wide to put the full-back in for France's second try.
England were in disarray, only Yachvili's failures with the conversions keeping them in the game, and when they finally created space for their wingers Cueto was dragged down metres from the line before another wayward pass from Wilkinson shut the door on Ashton wide out right.
Cueto's try came too late for England
England had never before come back to win from a margin of more than 12 points, and the errors continued to come thick and fast as Tom Croft became the latest to cough up the ball.
They grabbed an unlikely lifeline when Ben Youngs took a quick tap and go to release Foden, who jinked and dummied their way over to make it 16-5 with 23 minutes left on the clock, Wilkinson popping over the conversion for 16-7.
Johnson threw on their replacements but England kept wasting what good field possession they could work.
Flood popped out a careless off-load deep in the French 22 to allow a clearing kick to snuff out the danger, and when Nick Easter tried to rumble from deep within their own 22 their hospital pass to Tuilagi triggered another knock-on.
France, led by man-of-the-match Imanol Harinordoquy, set up camp in front of the English posts, and when the ball was fed back to Trinh-Duc the replacement fly-half slotted the drop-goal to make it 19-7.
Banahan's late charge allowed Cueto to touch down for a try at the death, but with Flood's conversion sliding wide England needed a converted try to force extra time - something they could neither conjure nor say their performance deserved.

We were particularly taken with Tvori when we first saw it last year. This Vive app offers a comprehensive suite of animation features, essentially allowing you to record your own stories in VR. As promising as its beginnings were, though, Tvori was in need of a brush up.
Today, it's finally getting one.
The creators of Tvori just published a long-promised update for the game. Dmitry Kurilchenko and Viktor Komarovskih gave me a brief rundown of what's new earlier this week and, overall, Tvori is looking like a much more polished and accessible product than it was before, and allows for even more animation options to create better experiences. You can see some of the updates for yourself in this new video.
Starting with the app's foundations, the Tvori team has come up with a more approachable system. It's got the intuitive sort of menus you'd expect to interact with in a creative VR app now, allowing you to better navigate through its tools and options. An object shelf, for example, has been added that provides quick access to the app's many props that you can place down in a scene.
These kinds of options will now be at your side at all times, staying in your local space so you can quickly edit a scene from whatever position or scale you might be at. There are also new orbs that allow you to save and switch between scenes with ease.
Setting up scenes has had a few key features added, like the ability to scale yourself all the way down to human size so that you can experience a scene first-hand. Objects themselves can be scaled as well, and you can color them to give your scenes more identity. For viewing, you're now able to choose specific spots that viewers will be placed in.
Animation itself is getting more robust, too. The pair showed me a monster comprised of multiple parts that they can articulate with greater detail than was possible before. When it comes to filming, you can now record and share videos at up to 1080p and screenshots in resolutions of up to 8K. When recording video, you can slow time to help make sure you capture important moments the way you want to.
There are finer points to discover in the developer's changelog, which are worth reading through if you have any interest in VR movie making. With this update the developers of Tvori are hoping to start growing a bigger community around their app.
The app is available on Steam for $20.
As MetaGeek has grown, so has its CEO.
“Nobody's born a CEO,” MetaGeek's Ryan Woodings says. “You learn on the job.”
They should know.
The company they started as a side project in 2006 is now one of Boise's top technology companies, with more than 30 employees, a 30% annual growth rate and a shiny new office atop the Owyhee Plaza.
Today, life at MetaGeek is pretty awesome. But that wasn't the case in early 2008. The year before, Ryan had brought in what they thought was a professional manager to run their young company and serve as CEO. Ryan hoped to spend less time running the business and more time doing what they loved, designing and improving the company's products.
“I have a master's degree in computer science, but I never took a business class,” Ryan says. “I knew nothing about business. I thought someone else could do it better than me.”
They were wrong.
Things came to a head one morning when their bookkeeper, who also happens to be their mother, came to Ryan insisting they take a closer look at the company's finances. Ryan did, and they didn't like what they saw.
“It turned out there was almost no money in the bank,” Ryan says. “Accounts payable was huge and it wasn't even showing everything. We had ongoing fees of $20,000 per month for our hardware designers and those weren't accounted for. It was a mess.”
That was 8 a.m. By 4 p.m. that afternoon, Ryan was once again head of MetaGeek.
It was an experience that has shaped Ryan's view of leadership. “Not knowing doesn't make anything better,” they say. So now they seek to understand every aspect of their business, even the parts that are difficult to see.
In fact, Ryan spends most of their days working on the invisible. Sometimes it's MetaGeek's products, tools to help IT professionals see and improve invisible wireless internet connections. Sometimes it's the unseen forces of building a business.
Not bad for a company that was never meant to be a business at all.
The idea for MetaGeek grew out of a minor annoyance Ryan was experiencing in their previous job at a hardware company, where they worked as a computer programmer. As convenient as Wi-Fi is, it turns out that a lot of things — from microwaves to baby monitors — can disrupt the connection. To sort out the problems, companies utilize tools, called spectrum analyzers, to help them see the invisible offenders. At the time, these tools were large and unwieldy, usually stored on a cart that could be rolled around the office. And for some reason or another, Ryan often found their employer's large, clunky and expensive spectrum analyzer parked in their cubicle.
So one night Ryan went home and hacked together a simple, handheld version of the same tool. It worked great. This, Ryan thought, could be a good opportunity to learn more about business by starting a little company on the side.
As a programmer, the software wouldn't be a problem. They could handle that himself. But the hardware? That would have to be purchased.
“The hardware I needed had already been designed, but the minimum order was 240 pieces, and that cost ten grand,” Ryan recalls. They did the math and figured if they could sell them steadily, say 10 a month, he'd be all out in a couple of years, learn a lot, and make a small profit in the process.
“The plan was to make it a nice side project,” they say. But the early response stunned him.
“I sold 65 the first day and sold out in three weeks,'” Ryan says. “I knew by the end of that first day that my original plan wasn't going to hold up. This was a full scale business.”
A few weeks later Ryan went to their boss, explained their situation and offered a letter of resignation. But their boss wouldn't accept it. “He convinced me to go part-time to see how it would go, but after six months of working part-time I had made more than my annual salary at my job, so I had to leave. I figured if it turned out to suck, in a year I could go get a job.”
But it didn't suck.
Instead, MetaGeek continued to grow and Ryan knew they needed help. Their first hire? Their mom, to help with the books. “She had done some Quickbooks stuff so I handed over a box of receipts to see if they could help,” Ryan says. “She's been here every day since.”
A few months later Ryan brought on former co-worker and current MetaGeek Chief Technology Officer Brian Tuttle, who Ryan now refers to as their co-founder. “Neither of us had any idea of what we were doing in terms of management, but we've grown into a good leadership team. Brian's evolved into a great CTO.”
As the company matured, so has Ryan and their leadership team, who have spent a lot of time in recent years thinking about the company's core purpose — its reason for being beyond making money.
“Why are we really in business?” Ryan asks rhetorically. “Sure, we make spectrum analyzers, but we are more than that.”
The answer they uncovered is both straightforward and amorphous: “What we're really about is making work awesome,” Ryan explains, pointing out that the awesomeness he's aiming for begins with their company and its employees, but ultimately expands to their customers and even the City of Boise.
Stepping into the MetaGeek office, this goal of making work awesome is evident everywhere, from walls adorned with phrases like “Awesomeness Happens Here” to its corner ping pong table with a view to its programmer-friendly desks. The company even uses generous employee perks, including a $5,000 “bonus” for taking a vacation, to ensure employees don't burn out because of overwork.
“Besides just making your time at MetaGeek awesome, how do we help you make your life awesome? Encourage you to actually take vacation,” they smile.
Ryan also believes that MetaGeek's quest to create an awesome workplace will have a big impact on the broader Boise community as some of their employees eventually leave to start companies of their own.
“If you share this idea that work should be awesome, we want you to work here,” Ryan says. “But we want Boise to have lots of awesome places to work. That's good for everybody. To get more awesome companies, some of them will have to come out of MetaGeek.”
That's a lot of awesome.

Private Hell
It's about the time that Kondraki blows up a bus full of nuns to capture the flying fire-breathing walruses that Dr. Alto Clef has the first suspicion that things are not going as they should be.
It should be awesome, they realize. And it is awesome. Riding the adrenaline rush of explosions as the fire-breathing flying walruses scorch the earth around them, causing bystanders to flee in terror from the pyroclastic pinnipeds. Diving behind the counter of a Starbucks and opening fire with their shotgun (loaded with FRAG rounds) and seeing the fat flying walrus (with the flames jetting out from under its massive mustache) explode in a shower of meat and blood. And it definitely should be awesome when they and Kondraki fist-bump on top of the stack of bodies as the city of Des Moines burns around them both.
But as they rode their black convertible back to Site-19, with a beautiful blonde woman giving them head from the front passenger seat, Dr. Alto Clef could not help but feel a small voice in the back of their head whispering something to them (like the Roman soldiers who would stand next to conquering generals, telling them that they, too, were human).
This is wrong.
They were rappelling down the side of a building, with the office windows exploding outward all around him, a beautiful redhead at their side and Dmitri Strelnikov providing covering fire from a hovering Little Bird helicopter, when Dr. Clef suddenly realized that they might not be the hero.
It was the expression on the girl's face that did it. They were frightened, yes… of course they are. And they were exhilarated, and aroused, and ready to make love to him…
… just like every single woman they had met in the past few years.
Why was it that every beautiful woman in the world wanted to share their bed? That was statistically improbable. There was no way that even the sexiest man in the world could shag every single beautiful woman they came across… and Clef was not sexy.
After they had destroyed the Skyscraper's Spontaneous Combuster, as they were leaning in for a kiss with the redhead, Clef paused with their lips bare millimeters from hers, then leaned back and gestured to the door.
"You can leave if you want," they said.
They aren't surprised when the girl bolted.
Something was wrong.
"Crow?"
"Yes, Clef?"
"… how many civilian casualties were there?"
"None. They evacuated the place before we went in."
"They evacuated ten city blocks in thirty seconds?"
"Of course. The cops are very efficient."
"… six cops can't even knock on ten city blocks worth of doors in thirty seconds. Much less evacuate everyone within."
"Well, maybe they just weren't around. Maybe we just got a lucky break."
"Are we sure there were no civilian casualties?"
"Of course there aren't any. Do you see any?"
"No, I don't. But… I just have this feeling that something is wrong."
It was during the middle of their ninth swordfight against SCP-076 that Clef realized what the problem was.
Life was… too exciting.
There was no way that life could ever be this exciting, they realized. The life of an SCP Foundation agent could be interesting… but a firefight and a life or death struggle every day? Not a single day passing during which they did not battle for the sake of the world? Not a single day in which all they did was paperwork and file reports?
They were a researcher who spent more time bashing in people's heads with a crowbar than they did doing any actual research.
After they kicked Able over the edge of the Grand Canyon. Dr. Clef took a moment to think back to the last day they could remember ever being bored…
… oh.
Oh.
OH.
That's what went wrong…
And if that were true…
"… Gears?"
"Yes, Clef?"
"… I'm thinking that maybe we shouldn't deploy against SCP-953 this time."
"… why?"
"Because… in the end. With all the collateral damage we'll deal bringing them in… it would be less destructive just to let them eat a liver or two."
"Are you saying that you're giving up?"
"No! I'm just… look. Is this the only way?"
"We are the Foundation. We secure. We contain. We protect. But if you're tired, I can send in Kondraki instead."
"NO! No… I'll do it. I just… needed a moment to think."
"Take all the time you need, Doctor Clef. You've done enough work. After all, the Foundation would fall apart without you."
It is after they have thrown SCP-953 into the intake of the Boeing 747 that Clef finally allows themselves to grieve.
They grieve for the dead bystanders they will never see. For the pain and chaos they know they are causing, but cannot perceive. They grieve for the Foundation, fallen from grace, and for their friends, who know not what they do.
They grieve for Dr. Alto Clef, trapped in a hell of their own creation.
Damned to be badass for the rest of their life.
This article is about the chess game. For other uses, see The Game of the Century (disambiguation)
In chess, The Game of the Century is a chess game played between 26-year-old Donald Byrne and 13-year-old Bobby Fischer in the Rosenwald Memorial Tournament in New York City on October 17, 1956, which Fischer won. The competition took place at the Marshall Chess Club. It was nicknamed "The Game of the Century" by Hans Kmoch in Chess Review. Kmoch wrote, "The following game, a stunning masterpiece of combination play performed by a boy of 13 against a formidable opponent, matches the finest on record in the history of chess prodigies."[1]
Background [ edit ]
Donald Byrne (1930–1976) was one of the leading American chess masters at the time of this game. They won the 1953 U.S. Open Championship, and later represented the United States in the 1962, 1964, and 1968 Chess Olympiads.[2] They became an International Master in 1962, and probably would have risen further if not for ill health.[3] Robert "Bobby" Fischer (1943–2008) was at this time a promising young master. Following this game, they had a meteoric rise, winning the 1957 U.S. Open on tiebreaks, winning the 1957–58 U.S. (Closed) Championship (and all seven later championships in which they played), qualifying for the Candidates Tournament and becoming in 1958 the world's youngest grandmaster at the age of 15. They won the world championship in 1972, and is considered by many to be the greatest chess player of all time.
In this game, Fischer (playing Black) demonstrates noteworthy innovation and improvisation. Byrne (playing White), after a standard opening, makes a seemingly minor mistake on move 11, losing a tempo by moving the same piece twice. Fischer pounces with brilliant sacrificial play, culminating in a queen sacrifice on move 17. Byrne captures the queen, but Fischer gets far too much material for it – a rook, two bishops, and a pawn. At the end, Fischer's pieces coordinate to force checkmate, while Byrne's queen sits useless on the other side of the board.
The game [ edit ]
This section uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.
White: Donald Byrne Black: Bobby Fischer Opening: Grünfeld Defence (ECO D92)
1. Nf3
A noncommittal move by Byrne. From here, the game can develop into a number of different openings.
1... Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7
Fischer defends based on "hypermodern" principles, inviting Byrne to establish a classical pawn stronghold in the center , which Fischer intends to target and undermine with their fianchettoed bishop and other pieces.
4. d4 0-0
Fischer castles, bringing their king to safety. The Black move 4...d5 would have reached the Grünfeld Defence immediately. After Fischer's 4...0-0, Byrne could have played 5.e4, whereupon 5...d6 6.Be2 e5 reaches the main line of the King's Indian Defense.
5. Bf4 d5
The game has now transposed to the Grünfeld Defence (5...d5, ECO code D92), usually initiated by 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5.
6. Qb3
A form of the so-called Russian System (the usual move order is 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.Qb3), putting pressure on Fischer's central d5-pawn.
6... dxc4
Fischer relinquishes their center, but draws Byrne's queen to a square where it is a little exposed and can be attacked.
7. Qxc4 c6
Also possible is 7...Na6 (the Prins Variation), preparing ...c5 to challenge White's center.
8. e4 Nbd7
In later games, Black played the more active 8...b5 followed by 9...Qa5.[4][5] An example is Bisguier–Benko, U.S. Championship 1963–64.[6] Fischer's choice is a little slow, although one would not guess that from the subsequent play.
9. Rd1 Nb6 10. Qc5
An awkward square for the queen, which leaves it exposed to a possible ...Na4 or ...Ne4, as Fischer brilliantly demonstrates. Since both of those squares are protected by Byrne's knight on c3, they understandably did not appreciate the danger. 10.Qb3 would have left the queen better placed, although it would have invited further harassment with 10...Be6.
10... Bg4
Byrne's pawns control the center squares; however, Fischer is ahead in development and has castled, while Byrne's king is still in the center. These factors would not have been very significant had Byrne attended to their development on their next move.
11. Bg5?
a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h Position after 11.Bg5
Wanting to prevent 11...Nfd7 followed by ...e5, but Byrne errs by not completing their development.[7] Numerous authors suggest 11.Be2 instead, protecting the king and preparing kingside castling.[4][7][8] Flear–Morris, Dublin 1991, continued 11.Be2 Nfd7 12.Qa3 Bxf3 13.Bxf3 e5 14.dxe5 Qe8 15.Be2 Nxe5 16.0-0 and White was slightly better.[4]
11... Na4!!
"One of the most powerful moves of all time." (Jonathan Rowson).[9] Fischer offers an ingenious knight sacrifice. If Byrne played 12.Nxa4, Fischer would reply 12...Nxe4, leaving Byrne with some terrible choices: 13.Qxe7 Qa5+ 14.b4 Qxa4 15.Qxe4 Rfe8 16.Be7 Bxf3 17.gxf3 Bf8 produces a deadly pin;
13.Bxe7 Nxc5 14.Bxd8 Nxa4 15.Bg5 Bxf3 16.gxf3 Nxb2 gives Fischer an extra pawn and ruins Byrne's pawn structure;
13.Qc1 Qa5+ 14.Nc3 Bxf3 15.gxf3 Nxg5 regains the sacrificed piece with a better position and extra pawn;
13.Qb4 Nxg5 14.Nxg5 Bxd1 15.Kxd1 Bxd4 16.Qd2 Bxf2 with a winning material advantage (Fischer).
12. Qa3 Nxc3 13. bxc3 Nxe4!
Fischer again offers material in order to open the e-file and get at White's uncastled king.
14. Bxe7 Qb6 15. Bc4
Byrne wisely declines the offered material. If 15.Bxf8 Bxf8 16.Qb3, Fischer analyzes 16...Nxc3! 17.Qxb6 (17.Qxc3?? Bb4 wins the queen) axb6 18.Ra1 Re8+ 19.Kd2 Ne4+ 20.Kc2 Nxf2 21.Rg1 Bf5+, which they consider winning for Black. Also strong is 16...Re8 17.Qxb6 (17.Be2 Nxc3!) axb6 18.Be2 Nxc3 19.Rd2 Bb4 20.Kf1 Ne4 21.Rb2 Bc3 22.Rc2 Nd2+! 23.Kg1 (23.Nxd2 Bxe2+ 24.Kg1 Bd3! 25.Rc1 Bxd2 leaves Black with a winning material advantage) 23...Rxe2 24.Rxc3 Nxf3+ 25.gxf3 Bh3 26.Rc1 Rxa2 leaving White paralyzed.
15... Nxc3!
Now both 16.Qxc3 Rfe8 and 16.Bxf8 Bxf8 favor Black.[10]
16. Bc5 Rfe8+ 17. Kf1
a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h After 17.Kf1. Instead of protecting their queen, Fischer launches a stunning counterattack with 17...Be6!!
Byrne threatens Fischer's queen; Fischer brings their rook into play, displacing Byrne's king. It appears that Fischer must solve their problems with their queen, whereupon White can play 18.Qxc3, with a winning material advantage. Jack Straley Battell writes that the masters observing the game considered Black's position lost.[11]
17... Be6!!
This is the move that made this game famous. Instead of saving their queen, Fischer offers to sacrifice it. Fischer pointed out that 17...Nb5? loses to 18.Bxf7+ Kxf7 19.Qb3+ Be6 20.Ng5+ Kg8 21.Nxe6 Nxd4 22.Nxd4+ Qxb3 23.Nxb3.[12]
18. Bxb6?
Byrne takes the offered queen, hoping to outplay their 13-year-old opponent in the ensuing complications. Fischer gets far too much for their queen, however, leaving Byrne with a hopeless game. The move 18.Bxe6 would have been even worse, leading to a smothered mate with 18...Qb5+ 19.Kg1 Ne2+ 20.Kf1 Ng3+ 21.Kg1 Qf1+! 22.Rxf1 Ne2#. White's 18.Qxc3 would have been met by 18...Qxc5! and if 19.dxc5, 19...Bxc3 and Black should win the endgame. White's best chance may have been 18.Bd3 Nb5!, which Kmoch wrote would also result in "a win for Black in the long run".[13]
18... Bxc4+
Fischer now begins a 'windmill' series of discovered checks , picking up material.
19. Kg1 Ne2+ 20. Kf1 Nxd4+ 21. Kg1
21.Rd3? axb6 22.Qc3 Nxf3 23.Qxc4 Re1# (Fischer).
21... Ne2+ 22. Kf1 Nc3+ 23. Kg1 axb6
Fischer captures a piece, simultaneously attacking Byrne's queen.
24. Qb4 Ra4!
Fischer's pieces cooperate nicely: the bishop on g7 protects the knight on c3, which protects the rook on a4, which in turn protects the bishop on c4 and forces Byrne's queen away. Perhaps Byrne overlooked this move when analyzing 18.Bxb6, expecting instead 24...Nxd1? 25.Qxc4, which is much less clear. Otherwise, it is hard to explain why Byrne played 18.Bxb6, since Black now has a clear win .
25. Qxb6
Trying to protect their rook with 25.Qd6 loses the queen to 25...Nxd1 26.Qxd1 Rxa2 threatening 27...Ra1.[10]
25... Nxd1
a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h After 25...Nxd1. Fischer has gotten more than enough material for their sacrificed queen.
Fischer has gained a rook, two bishops, and a pawn for their sacrificed queen, leaving them ahead the equivalent, roughly, of one minor piece – an easily winning advantage in master play. White's queen is far outmatched by Black's pieces, which dominate the board and will soon overrun White's position. Moreover, Byrne's remaining rook is stuck on h1 and it will take precious time (and the loss of the pawn on f2) to free it. Byrne could have resigned here, but chose to play on until checkmate, as a courtesy to Fischer's skill.[14]
26. h3 Rxa2 27. Kh2 Nxf2 28. Re1 Rxe1 29. Qd8+ Bf8 30. Nxe1 Bd5 31. Nf3 Ne4 32. Qb8 b5
Note that every piece and pawn of Black's is defended, leaving White's queen with nothing to do.
33. h4 h5 34. Ne5 Kg7
Fischer breaks the pin, allowing the bishop to attack as well.
35. Kg1 Bc5+
a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h After 35...Bc5+. Mate is inevitable.
Now Fischer uses their pieces in concert to force mate.
36. Kf1 Ng3+ 37. Ke1 Bb4+
Kmoch notes that with 37...Re2+ Fischer could have mated a move sooner.[15]
38. Kd1 Bb3+ 39. Kc1 Ne2+ 40. Kb1 Nc3+ 41. Kc1 Rc2# 0–1
Responding to an interviewer's question about how they were able to bring off such a brilliant win, Fischer said: "I just made the moves I thought were best. I was just lucky."

Obama to open entire Mall for inauguration Nick Juliano
Published: Thursday December 4, 2008
Print This Email This The entire length of the National Mall will be open during President-elect Barack Obama's inauguration for the first time in history to accommodate the million-plus people expected to travel to Washington next month, the inaugural committee announced Thursday.
Officials predict anywhere between 1.5 million and 4 million people will travel to Washington to see the nation's first black president take the oath of office.
Members of the House and Senate are allotted between 200 and 400 inaugural tickets each to distribute to constituents, but demand this year is massively outpacing that supply.
The National Mall, which covers the 2-mile long stretch from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, will be outfitted with large screens and speakers for people unable to obtain tickets to the swearing-in. In previous years, the Mall has been used as a staging area for inauguration participants and was not open to the general public.
"We're grateful to local, federal, and military officials for their efforts to open up the National Mall to Americans who want to participate in this historic occasion," inaugural committee executive director Emmett S. Beliveau said in a news release. "These arrangements represent our committee's continuing commitment to make next year's historic inauguration as accessible as possible to citizens in Washington, D.C., and across the country."
The Presidential Inaugural Committee has launched a Web site with further details about the inauguration.
Guest Post: How to Spice Up Your Limited Formats in Epic Card Game
This is a guest blogpost by Josiah Fiscus. Josiah Fiscus is a 31-year-old gamer from Pittsburgh, PA who has been playing CCGs and designer board games for over two decades. When he's not at the game table, you'll find them playing drums and serving as a deacon in their local church or enjoying time outdoors with their wife, Erin, and two kids (ages 5 and 3).
Let's get this out of the way right now: the suggested formats in the rulebook are all really good, and you should play them (especially Dark Draft). Are you interested in trying new formats, though? Let's spice things up!
Tench ester: 300 cards, 2-8 players. Lay 10 random cards on the table face-up. The first player picks one card then each other player follows in turn. After all players have selected a card, discard the remaining cards and lay out 10 more. Rotate the player who picks first each time. Continue drafting until each player has a 30-card deck.
Tenchester creates constant difficult decisions. You will be constantly aware of each card that your opponents are taking, yet you can rarely afford to take something away from them since every pick is so crucial for your own deck. Additionally, you will be faced with the internal tension of choosing between a powerful Champion with a huge board impact and a powerful removal Event. Or perhaps the choice between a 0-cost and a 1-cost card. Compared to a typically drafted deck, Tenchester decks end up with far more synergy and Loyalty triggers, giving them nearly the same feel as a constructed deck.
Team Sealed: 240 cards, 6 players. Players are broken into two teams of 3 players each. Each team receives 120 random cards. Each team works together to construct three 30-card decks, one for each team member. Each player then plays a match against each member of the opposing team and the team with the best record wins.
The team element adds a dynamic not really seen in typical limited formats. It will often make sense for two players on a team to be playing the same color, which can create difficult deckbuilding decisions. This format is not really a timesaver in the way that a typical sealed event would be, as the deckbuilding process can often take as long as a draft would or longer. Nevertheless, the larger card pool leads to more deckbuilding options than sealed usually does.
Auction Draft: 40 cards per player, 3-6 players. Give each player 100 points for bidding (you can use pennies or just keep a running tally). The first player flips a card off the pile and bids points on it. Bidding escalates in player order and the high bid pays the points and takes the card. If no one bids, the starting player gets it for zero. The second player flips the next card and this continues until all cards are drafted. Players each construct a 30-card deck from the cards they've won in the auction. If a player wins fewer than 30 cards, the rest of his/her deck is filled in with random unused cards.
Epic is a game of resource management, but this does not usually extend to the draft itself! Each player's valuation of the cards that come up will be influenced by their past experiences with the card, preferred style of deck, and currently drafted cards. Knowing the players at the table, when to try to run the bidding up, and knowledge of the card pool are all crucial skills.
Wizard's Tower: 120 cards (or more), 2-5 players in a single multiplayer game. Shuffle all the cards you have into one large draw pile. Each player starts with a 3-card hand. 7 cards are placed face-up into the middle of the table. Before you draw your card at the start of each turn, also select one of the face-up cards and at it to your hand. If there are none left in middle, flip 7 new ones first. All players share a discard pile. If the draw pile is empty, Banish the discard pile (no victory for running out of cards).
This format is best played with free-for-all multiplayer rules. It is a very accessible format to newer players, due to the randomly shuffled draw pile, but also implements an element of open drafting throughout the course of the entire game. This drafting throughout the game, rather than just at the beginning, is a nice change of pace.
Rotisserie Draft: 1 copy of every card you own, 2-4 players (more players possible with more expansions/promos). Lay all the cards out face up on the table. The first player drafts any card, then the second player and so on. The last player goes twice, then it proceeds in reverse order (a snake draft). Repeat this process until each player has drafted 30 cards.
This is by far the most intimidating and time-consuming way to draft. It's difficult to imagine that any group would do this on a regular basis, but as an occasional choice, it has considerable merit. The singleton nature of this format means that unique effects are to be highly prized. Additionally, you will get excellent insights into what the players believe are truly the best cards in the game.
Finally, here are some VERY first-pickable cards, regardless of the format you are drafting:
NAIROBI, Kenya — The killing and kidnapping of tourists at Lamu Island will change that tourist resort's reputation as a relaxed and safe destination.
More change will come to Lamu, now that Kenya has announced plans to build a new port at the island. The massive construction will kickstart Africa's largest infrastructure project to catalyze economic growth in the country and wider East Africa region.
The 20-berth deepwater port that will jut into the crystal-blue waters off the historic Lamu island is just one key element in an ambitious $22 billion infrastructure plan linking Kenya, Ethiopia and South Sudan with new roads, railways and oil pipelines.
“Groundbreaking for construction of the first three berths should be done soonest,” said President Mwai Kibaki in Nairobi. “I look forward to the commissioning of the first ship docking at Lamu port next year,” they added.
In a rare display of unity, Kibaki's political opponent and coalition partner Prime Minister Raila Odinga added, “It is time to get this show on the road.”
Conservationists, however, will be disappointed with the announcement. They fear the large-scale developments will threaten Lamu town, a Unesco World Heritage Site, and damage both fishing waters and mangrove swamps around the island.
Unesco has pledged to ensure Lamu's cultural heritage is not ruined, but Kenya's government has made it clear that economic development is the priority.
More from GlobalPost: In Kenya, a glimpse into the future of the Global Health Initiative
The announcements came after a feasibility study, funded by China and carried out by a Japanese company, concluded that the long-held dreams were economically viable.
Plans for a new port and transport corridor were first drafted in 1975 but stalled due to lack of financing and political infighting. That appears to have changed with Kibaki and Odinga in agreement and with China, Gulf states and European nations reportedly expressing interest in funding parts of the vast project.
There will also be a 780-mile oil pipeline linking the oil fields of South Sudan to a new 120,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Lamu, a 1,000 mile standard-gauge railway running through the northern Kenyan town of Isiolo and on to Juba, a new international airport at Lamu, and a 550-mile highway heading northwards toward South Sudan and Ethiopia.

Much of the new infrastructure will run through — and open up — the neglected northern regions of Kenya.
"It will also act as a catalyst for productive economic activities such as fish-processing in Lamu and around Lake Turkana, livestock development in the North Eastern region, tourism and agricultural development in the coastal region and coal mining in Mwingi, among other activities along the corridor," said Kibaki.
The oil pipeline via Lokichoggio and Moyale leading to a new refinery could be a solution to South Sudan's disputes with the north over how to share oil revenues. Recently the secretary general of the ruling Sudan People's Liberation Movement, Pagan Amum, described Khartoum's levying of a $23 per -barrel transport fee on southern oil pumped through northern pipelines as “daylight robbery” and part of a strategy of “economic war” with the newly independent south.
There is also talk of building a pipeline from Uganda's oil fields on the shore of Lake Albert to Lamu for refining and export. The pipelines from Uganda and South Sudan would meet south of Lake Turkana and continue across arid northern Kenya to Lamu.
Kenya hopes the new port and economic “free” port at Lamu will be able to ship 24 million tons of goods a year, helping to decongest the existing overcrowded port at Mombasa while also becoming the main gateway to Kenya's two landlocked neighbors: Ethiopia and South Sudan.
Much of Ethiopian imports and exports transit through the seaport at Djibouti, while South Sudan is hostage to its northern neighbor, which controls access to Port Sudan on the Red Sea. For both countries an alternative route via Kenya would open up options and reduce costs.
The new infrastructure is also intended to stitch more closely together the East African Community, or EAC, a regional group established in 1967 but only recently becoming more than a paper agreement, with monetary cooperation and even political unity mooted.
Rwanda and Burundi joined fellow EAC members Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania four years ago and South Sudan is widely expected to follow suit. Already the EAC is a market of 140 million people, a growing proportion of whom have disposable income and increasingly middle-class tastes and aspirations.
The new transport corridors would ease trade through Uganda and Rwanda to the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo and, combined with a proposed EAC customs union, reduce the cost of trade.
The project is, however, far beyond the reach of Kenya's domestic budget, so the real test will be whether foreign investors can be persuaded that ploughing
their money into this ambitous project will result in good returns as well as good development for the region.

YEREVAN, Armenia — The stand-off between Armenian government forces and gun-toting members of a political fringe group who seized a police station in the capital of Yerevan has ended in the raiders' surrender.
The question is: What next?
They say cats have nine lives. By my count, President Serzh Sargsyan has used up all nine of his.
Four of those nine lives have been expanded in the anti-government protests that Armenians have staged each of the past four summers. Before this summer's marches in support of the police-station raiders, there were protests against transit-fare and electricity-rate increases, and pension reform that would have hurt Armenia's most vulnerable.
The other five lives that Sargsyan has expended have involved non-summer demonstrations.
Many Armenians protested what they considered fraud in the 2008 election that catapulted them into the presidency and in their 2012 re-election victory. They also demonstrated against Russian President Vladimir Putin browbeating Sargsyan in 2013 to reverse Armenia's plan to join the European Union in favor of the country joining the Kremlin-led Eurasian Economic Union.
There were protests in the spring of 2015 against Armenia's initial decision to allow a Russian military court, and not an Armenian civil court, to try a Russian soldier who murdered an entire Armenian family in Gyumri, the site of a Russian military base. And there were demonstrations in the winter of 2015 against Sargsyan's successful bid to force through a change in the constitution that will allow them to stay in office for many more years.
The 20 raiders who were still in the police station on Sunday surrendered exactly two weeks after they and 11 others occupied it.
In seizing it, they killed a top-ranked police officer and wounded two others. That bloodshed made it more difficult right from the start to end the stand-off with a compromise instead of the full-scale raider capitulation that authorities demanded.
The death of a police officer from a sniper's bullet outside the station in recent days further hardened the authorities' position on capitulation, although the raiders denied that any of them had fired the fatal shot.
In recent days, police snipers had been picking off the raiders one by one, especially when they ventured outside the station.
Of the 11 occupants who left the facility before Sunday's mass surrender, nine apparently were wounded and needed hospital care, while two able-bodied men decided they'd had enough.
The sharp-shooters could have put bullets through the brains of those they wounded, but with one exception hit them in the legs — an apparent strategy to avoid creating martyrs that would have stoked occupation hopes of fomenting a general uprising against the government.
The beginning of the end of Viktor Yanukovych's presidency in Ukraine was when, in the spring of 2014, their forces martyred more than 100 people in the Euromaidan protests in Kiev that had been demanding Yanukovych's resignation. Sargsyan wanted no repeat of that.
When the raiders seized the station on July 17, they demanded the release of Jirair Sefilian, head of the Founding Parliament fringe party. The government had arrested Sefilian, a hero of the Nagorno-Karabakh War between ethnic Armenians and Azerbaijan, on charges of plotting a coup attempt — allegations their followers have denied.
The station occupiers also demanded that Sargsyan resign.
In the first day or two of the stand-off, only a couple of hundred protesters showed up on the streets near the station to support the occupiers. Most, presumably, were hard-core Founding Parliament supporters.
As the tense drama continued, the demonstrations grew larger — up to 6,000 people at times, according to news accounts — and the participants represented a broader opposition spectrum than Founding Parliament.
The authorities didn't help their cause by using what independent observers such as the U.S. Embassy in Yerevan, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and Transparency International said was excessive force against the protesters.
On the worst night, about 75 demonstrators were beaten, a third of them badly enough to be hospitalized, according to news reports.
Those roughed up included journalists from both Armenian and non-Armenian news organizations.
Before the second police officer was killed, authorities offered the station occupants an amnesty from prosecution if they laid down their arms. And Sargsyan said they would be willing to talk with Sefilian directly — again, on the condition that the raiders surrender first.
It's unclear whether authorities revoked the amnesty offer and Sargsyan backed away from their offer to talk with Sefilian after the second officer was shot.
But those offers appear to be off the table now.
The leader of the raiders, Varuzhan Avetisian, said the hold-outs had decided to become “prisoners of war” to avoid further bloodshed.
Although the occupation failed to achieve its key goals of getting Sefilian released or forcing Sargsyan's resignation, Avetisian said, it succeeded in increasing anti-government sentiment that could one day help bring change to the country.
While Sargsyan dodged another bullet by ending the stand-off in a way that keeps them in power, they have to be sobered by the fervor of the opposition to their regime that became apparent during the demonstrations.
Armenians are increasingly frustrated with the country's widespread poverty, the corruption that has allowed Sargsyan and their cronies to live like potentates, and the shadow the Kremlin casts over the country — one that has already prevented Armenia from casting its economic future with Europe rather than Russia.
The best way for Sargsyan to proceed would be to usher in real economic and anti-corruption reform.
But dictators rarely understand that lesson until it's too late.

Attorney Karl McNamara has purchased the historic Steinway Mansion from Philip Loria for an undisclosed sum and they plan to restore it and open a music school.
Preservationists had been alarmed since the spring when construction began on 11 warehouses on the property. While the 27-room home, built by the legendary piano-making Steinway family in 1858, was landmarked, the land was not and Loria was free to excavate the hill on which it sits.
In a mission statement, made available by the Friends of Steinway Mansion, McNamara writes, “The Steinway Conservatory is dedicated to providing a tuition-free, world class musical education for all gifted individuals who come from low-income or disadvantaged backgrounds.”
Bob Singleton, the executive director of the Greater Astoria Historical Society, who runs the Friends of Steinway Mansion, was greatly relieved.
“We are pleased to see our vision for the mansion is shared by the broader world, as exemplified by this person's vision,” Singleton said.
McNamara, and their team will share more details on the sale of the Steinway Mansion and its future as the Steinway Conservancy at a public meeting on Mon., Sept. 21.
The meeting will take place at the Greater Astoria Historical Society, at 35-20 Broadway, beginning at 7 p.m. It is open to the public.
WITNESS: White Kid Chased, Tackled at Trump Rally Had Been Beaten Before They Tried to Run From Mob
The teenage white male Trump supporter who was seen on ABC News video being chased and tackled by a Black Muslim male, identified as Seyfudin Mohamud, had been beaten and their hat was stolen by the anti-Trump mob before they tried running away from their attackers, according to a person who claims to have witnessed the attack.
Seyfudin Mohamud tackles teen Trump supporter after anti-Trump mob chased them though downtown San Jose.

The claim was made on 4chan:
LMAO, this is on /pol/? LOL i was there i saw the whole thing. they stole their hat and punched them a few times
the funniest part was when the white kid was trying to jump into a moving firetruck they were scared for their life, i have the video, give me some (yous) and ill upload here, here screen shot but who wants me to upload it
The 4chan poster posted a photo with the comment of the Trump supporter looking stunned.
The 4chan poster also posted a thumbnail photo of the young Trump supporter getting sucker-punched from behind.
thanks for the (youare) im curently uploading the raw video file , in the meantime here is another clear footage of a fight that broke out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI2IteYiKcI [Embed] pic related is the poor kid getting punched in the back of the head, by a nigga

Several videos show the attack, one from up close and the other from a distance. However neither shows the initial attacks on the Trump supporter. Both videos pick up about the same time in the attack as the Trump supporter is checking the back of their head as they start to flee the mob.

This video contains a longer version of the chase and confirms the claim the Trump supporter tried to escape by climbing on a firetruck.
San Jose Police Chief Eddie Garcia used a photo of the young victim in a SJPD Facebook post that promised on to seek justice for those attacked in Thursday's anti-Trump riot. As of this posting the San Jose police have not responded to inquiries as to whether Seyfudin Mohamud had been questioned or arrested for their attack on the young Trump supporter. There are no media reports on whether Mohamud has been arrested.
Video of the victim before the attack shows them acting in a civil, non-confrontational manner as they engage an anti-Trump protester.
BANGKOK: Visitors from Singapore and Hong Kong will be able to use automatic passport scanners in Bangkok airports soon, with immigration processing time reduced to 20 to 30 seconds, according to Thai news outlet The Nation.
The system, which is currently reserved for Thai nationals, will be implemented "this month or next", police Lieutenant-General Nathathorn Prousoontorn said in the report on Tuesday (Aug 1).

"Cooperation with Singapore on the matter is nearly 100 per cent complete, but for Hong Kong we need more discussions," they told The Nation.
Eligible visitors who want to use these scanners will have to first register with the Thai immigration office before entering the country, the official added in the report.
There are 52 automatic passport check machines at Suvarnabhumi and Don Mueang airports, and these scanners will be installed with software to read information on the passports of foreign visitors, reported The Nation.
Visitors from these two countries were chosen in particular because of the high frequency of entry into Thailand annually compared to other countries, the report said.

There are plans to extend the new system to border checkpoints in Nong Khai and Sa Kaew provinces, as well as to other countries with no-visa requirements such as Australia and parts of Europe. It will however not be offered to visitors from parts of the Middle East, South Asia and Africa due to "security concerns", The Nation added.
IT'S being billed as the deal of a lifetime for Australia's economy.
After nearly a decade of intense negotiations, the Prime Minister is expected to sign a free-trade agreement (FTA) with China today in Canberra.
This morning PM Tony Abbott announced that negotiations for a China-Australia Free Trade Agreement had been completed, following a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping.
“Trade and Investment Minister Andrew Robb and Chinese Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng will sign a Declaration of Intent this afternoon, undertaking to prepare the legal texts in both languages for signature,” Mr Abbott said in a statement.
“I look forward to making further announcements on this landmark agreement later today.”
The deal is expected to open up billions of dollars in new markets for Australian exporters.
But not everyone is welcoming the agreement. Radio host Alan Jones said this morning that the deal would not pass the “pub test” and Mr Abbott did not have a mandate.
“China are giving us nothing. The dairy farms are owned by China,” Jones said.
“The public are very, very angry Prime Minister about this I can tell you.”
The Greens have also come out against the deal, agreeing with Mr Jones that it did not pass the pub test.
Details emerging today show that the agreement could free up more than 90 per cent of Australian exports from tariffs over the next four years. According to Fairfax, dairy farmers could also gain access to China's lucrative infant formula market.
However, state-owned Chinese companies will likely miss out on preferential treatment, with the threshold at which an investment will attract scrutiny by the Foreign Investment Review Board to remain at zero. However, this threshold is expected to be increased for private companies, from $248 million to $1 billion.
If signed, it would be the third such deal in three months following similar agreements with Japan and South Korea.

The opportunity to get unfettered access to China's $10 trillion economy which is growing 7.7 per cent a year and poised to become the biggest in the world, could lift Australia's economic prospects to the next level.
MORE: South Korea FTA raises labour concerns
So as government negotiators hammer out the final details behind closed doors, here's what the deal could really mean for the rest of us:
WHAT'S THE DEAL?
With $150 billion in annual trade, China is already Australia's largest trading partner.
However rapid urbanisation and a growing middle class in the country of more than 1.36 billion people makes it “vital to Australia's future economic prosperity,” according to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
The deal has been in the works since 2005 and covers a complex series of agreements on everything from agricultural tariffs to quotas, manufactured goods, services and investment.
While this week, delegates have been nutting out finer details on things like “rules of origin” and “customs procedures” in the 21st round of negotiations, the broad scope is to cover three things; reduction in trade tariffs, removing regulatory barriers and fostering more foreign investment.
YEAH, YEAH BUT WILL STUFF GET CHEAPER?
In a word, yes. Getting rid of tariffs will make it cheaper for companies to import and export goods, helping to improve efficiency for customers on both sides of the deal.
China will get better access to Australian products like dairy, meat, wine, minerals, wool and agricultural products. Australia will get cheaper manufactured goods like clothes and textiles, plus more foreign investment in local businesses.
Former Austrade economist Tim Harcourt said while the deal has been an “ultra-marathon” the beauty of FTAs mean that both sides can win.
“It'll benefit both [China and Australia]. Free trade agreements are not like a footy scoreboard where you get a “winner”. It's about building exports and imports simultaneously and building investment both ways,” they said.
“A lot of it will be agricultural sectors. I think when you look at companies that export to China they pay higher wages than those that don't. There could be some real benefit to workers in terms of wages and jobs.”
“Those prices will come down and the services and tourism sector will go quite well because we'll see a big influx of Chinese tourists and students at our universities.”
WHAT'S THE DOWNSIDE?
But it's not all about cheap phones. Australian School of Business at UNSW senior lecturer of International Business Dr Jane Qiu said the FTA will change the underlying structure of the economy by exacerbating the two tier system already in place in Australia.
“The nature of free trade agreements is that they follow economic principles,” they said.
For things like agriculture and minerals where Australia has a comparative advantage over China, the FTA will enhance their success. But other sectors like manufacturing could find themselves doing it even tougher.
“We will for sure lose employment in manufacturing sectors for products that can be transported but we will have employment in other sectors namely agriculture and mining, but the argument is those sectors are not labour intensive.”
Despite this, they said the overall lift in GDP means “I'm very confident it's positive.”
“We will have increases in the service sector especially tourism so it depends on how much we can boost tourism. The Chinese are keen to go out but we need to pitch in what they really like.”
“One of the few sectors that will gain for both countries is logistic providers, transportation. So people in this industry will be happy, especially the cold chain providers required for meat products, dairy and wine. For cold chain providers it will be very good news,” they said.
While Chinese consumers will notice an increase in products like dairy, meat and wine from Australia, for Aussie consumers the main benefits will be indirect.
Dr Qiu said it's unlikely prices will plummet in time for Christmas as most of what is imported from China is already cheap. However there will be savings from economies of scale and efficiencies created.
The government is touting the deal as the opportunity of a lifetime that will take the relationship to “another level altogether” according to Trade Minister Andrew Robb.
“There is so much opportunity sitting here for Australian service industries, manufacturers, resources and energy and agriculture, education, you name it,” they told ABC radio.
Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said if it comes off, the deal will be a “fitting tribute” to the relationship between Australia and China.
“That's an outstanding result ... it creates jobs, it drives economic growth, it gives important benefits to exporters and creates opportunities for new businesses,” they said.
But it also brings the risk that Australia will be even more closely tied to the economic fortunes of China, according to Dr Qiu.
“One thing about free trade agreements is they always increase their reliance on each other. Because of the size this is a much bigger risk to Australia than to China. Having said that we're already like that. Our economy already fluctuates with China a lot and with the FTA it will be even more so,” they said.
Labor is worried the FTA will be a raw deal for the sugar industry and could include other “nasties” for Australians. It also thinks Chinese workers could be employed at the expense of Australians and wants special conditions to protect locals such as limiting migrants in certain categories.
While this morning, Liberal Senator Bill Heffernan said it could mean “disaster” for Australia as China does not have a floating currency.

Permanently injured Cirque performers make do with workers' comp
Athletes who perform with Cirque du Soleil risk their physical health for their performances, but they are usually treated like ordinary workers when they are injured.
An analysis by the Wall Street Journal found that Cirque's Ka show in Las Vegas ranked 79th in a list of 52,000 most dangerous workplaces compiled in 2011 by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Its injury rate in 2012 was four times that of professional sports teams, according to the Wall Street Journal. (Cirque says it has since improved its safety checks.)
Yet Cirque performers are treated as employees who can receive workers' compensation, which generally limits their ability to sue and provides limited compensation for permanent disabilities, according to this companion Wall Street Journal story (sub. req.). Other professional athletes, on the other hand, often receive full salaries after an injury throughout the term of their multiyear contracts.
The newspaper interviewed Natasha Hallett, a Cirque performer in Florida who broke 19 bones after they had failed to set up their harness correctly and a colleague didn't catch the error in a safety check. They were making $150,000 a year at the time, but their compensation dropped to about $2,000 a month for the two years they received workers' compensation before they hit a payout cap.
They were offered $45,000 for their permanent ankle injury, but disputed the amount and received $170,000. The amount is considered a large payout in Florida.

What Future Buyers Will Look At
Every buyer is different and has a different concern, but these are the things commonly asked about and looked at by used car buyers, according to Kelly Blue Book:
Headlight condition : Cracked or foggy headlights are an immediate, obvious repair that seems to indicate that many parts of the car have been ignored.

Note that there are plenty of other logical things a potential buyer may or probably should ask about, such as the shocks, whether or not you still have the car's manual, or if you have a paper trail of maintenance records to go by.
Typical Car Maintenance and Repairs
What should you fix up if you intend to keep your car going? Here are things you'll need to replace if you want to get well beyond 100,000 miles:
Oil, fluids, and filters
Brake pads and rotors
Batteries, fuses, and pumps
Mufflers and alternators
Spark plugs and belts
Shocks and struts
One of the keys to how to maintain your car's value is to do the typical repairs and stick to your car's recommended maintenance schedule. Actually use your manual and follow it, keep abreast of recalls, and watch for warning signs of greater problems (like foul smells, dripping liquids, or an odd-feeling drive).
The Most Preventable Damage to Your Car's Value
An accident can really damage the value of your car, obviously, but that's not something that's preventable. These are the top preventable factors that lower your car's value:
Spills and stains : Clean up messes immediately to prevent small spills from becoming stains, and put spillable items in a cup holder or on the floor.

The residents of Brevillier Village love living there. The retirement community in Erie, Pennsylvania overlooks Lake Erie, and paths dotted by benches follow the shoreline. The location provides beautiful views, and a grave threat: Just beyond the fence at the edge of the property lies a cliff that plunges 30 feet to the water below.
Compounding the danger, elderly residents with progressing states of dementia live in the building closest to the cliff. To protect them from harm, Brevillier adopted technology more common in sci-fi thrillers than homes: iris scan recognition.
A biometric that most people associate with a particularly grisly scene in Minority Report makes a lot of sense for elder care. Keycodes can be hard to remember, and difficult to tap into a keypad if you suffer from tremors or poor eyesight. Fingerprints might work, but your skin thins as you age, making prints harder to read. Plus, a weakened immune system increases the microbial hazard of key pads and fingerprint readers. All of which makes unlocking a door with your eyes pretty handy.
Iris scanners have been popping up at ATMs and airports, in hospitals and police stations, and even on mobile phones lately. And if the 300 residents of Brevillier Village are lining up to have their eyeballs scanned, the rest of you can't be far behind.
Brevillier Village installed the iris scanners last fall, making it the first retirement home in the US to use the technology. Most residents come and go as they please after gazing into a scanner, but anyone with cognitive impairment must ask someone to open the door because their irises aren't in the system.
An iris scanner essentially slices the eye in half. An algorithm bisects an infrared snapshot of your eye vertically, from the edge of the white part to the pupil, unwrapping the iris into a flat, rectangular plane. Then it looks for places of high contrast—locations where microscopic melanin pigments are clustered—and measures the distances between them and the ends of the rectangle. The average iris scan collects more than 200 of these contrast points and stores them as a unique digital map.
All scanners work on this principle, and run on some variation of the system University of Cambridge mathematician John Daugman developed and patented in 1994. Until a few years ago, only a couple of companies held the rights to this technology, limiting the uses beyond law enforcement. But Daugman's patent expired in 2011, giving rise to all kinds of new applications.
Scott Kimmel founded BioClaim, a company that helps hospitals and insurers use biometrics to reduce fraud. They say more than 20 million patients have volunteered to include an iris scan in their electronic health records, and sees it becoming more common. Instead of handing over your driver's license and insurance card at your next doctor's appointment, you'd step up to a scanner. This could go a long way toward minimizing mix-ups, because healthcare researchers estimate that as many as 10 percent of patients are routinely misidentified during medical record searches.
“We're trying to make it about who you are versus what you carry or what you know,” says Mark Clifton, CEO of Princeton Identity. “You are the password.” The biometric tech company, made the system Brevillier Village installed, and the technology Samsung included in the Galaxy S8 smartphone and the S7 before it.
Smartphone iris scans seem much more plausible now that people don't think twice about unlocking a phone with the touch of a finger. And it could improve security: Biometric security methods do a better job of preventing unauthorized access than credentials like a social security number or PIN. But critics note that once you've scanned your iris, it becomes a digital file that thieves can steal like any other data—and you can't replace an iris like a lost insurance card. That said, turning a stolen digital file into a 3-D copy of an iris remains an expensive and time-consuming proposition. “Biometric-based recognition does really raise the bar for hackers and terrorists,” says Anil Jain, a computer scientist and computer vision researcher at Michigan State University.
None of the iris scans at Brevillier Village are linked to medical records or financial accounts, so residents have little reason to worry about hackers or identity thieves. And surrendering a bit of privacy could keep them safe. Brevillier Village plans to tailor the system in the future by allowing some dementia patients greater access at different times of day. As a patient's health declines, administrators could limit their access rather than move them to another building. Studies have shown that seniors with dementia do better not only when they're surrounded by more cognitively competent peers, but also when they can remain in a familiar setting. So for them, iris scans aren't just a way to stay alive longer, they're a way to thrive longer.
CAIRO Islamic State's Egyptian branch claimed responsibility for a bombing that killed at least seven people in a hotel in North Sinai on Tuesday where judges overseeing a parliamentary election were staying.
A militant tried to drive a car bomb into the hotel in the provincial capital al-Arish before security forces opened fire, causing the car to explode, the military and a witness said.
A suicide bomber broke into the hotel restaurant and blew themselves up and a gunman entered the guest rooms area and killed a judge, they said. Seventeen people were wounded, the Health Ministry said.
"A brother ... seeking martyrdom hit with their car bomb the security force protecting the Swiss (Inn) hotel where 50 judges were staying, only to be followed by a lion ... who broke into the judges' base with their automatic weapon ... then blew up their explosive belt among them," Sinai Province said in a statement circulated by its followers on Twitter.
The group has carried out similar attacks in the region as part of its bid to topple the Cairo government.
It said two of its members carried out the attack. The Interior Ministry said there were two attackers but the military and a witness said there were three militants. It was not immediately possible to clarify the contradiction.
Two judges, four police officers and a civilian were killed, the Interior Ministry said. The military said the three militants were killed.
The blasts followed Monday's second round of voting in Egypt's parliamentary election.
Egyptian elections are monitored by the judiciary with judges running polling stations, observing the voting and counting ballots.
"This brutal incident is a failed attempt to hinder the state from building its institution but we assure all that it will increase the drive and insistence of the armed forces and the Interior Ministry to weed out the roots of terrorism in North Sinai," a military statement read.
The attack happened early in the morning and started with the car bomb, Swiss Inn manager Mohamed Mahana told Reuters.
"The security forces shot the suicide bomber and their car and their tyres blew up but they kept driving until they got to the hotel entrance then the explosion happened. It was huge."
A second suicide bomber came in through the beach and into the hotel restaurant, breaking its window, before blowing themselves up, said Mahana. The restaurant was empty.
"A third attacker sneaked into the hotel through the side where the guest rooms are and shot passers by, killing one judge, before a security official shot him."

I recorded this video a month ago. It is my message to America. In it, I attempt to explain the global implications of a second Obama presidential terms
This election was the most crucial in modern American history. It was not primarily about jobs and economics, it is about national security and, to be blunt, national survival.
America, and indeed the entire Western World, faces possible destruction now communist sympathizer Barack Obama is returned to office.
This video is being distributed all over the United States. Please watch it, and if you agree with the basic ideas expressed, send it out through your networks, to as many people as you can.
Sometimes it takes an outside view to clarify important matters. I hope this message will serve that purpose.
From a very grateful New Zealander.

I saw it when McKay Coppins tweeted a link to an article at The Week by Damon Linker, The cowardly spectacle of the anti-anti-Trump movement.
The article makes ad hominem attacks on Sean Davis and Mollie Hemingway of The Federalist for supposedly being among the worst anti-anti-Trump offenders.
What is the offense according to Linker? Attacking people who attack Trump:
There is a rising anti-anti-Trumpism on the right. And it is a sad and cowardly spectacle to behold…. One of the strangest developments in this very strange moment in American politics is the rebirth of politics by negation, this time on the right — in the form of anti-anti-Trumpism, which effectively argues that the president's liberal opponents are somehow worse than this phenomenally bad president…. Today a few prominent #NeverTrumpers remain, many others have moved over into the explicitly pro-Trump camp, and anti-anti-Trumpism has become a safe position from which to avoid having to take any kind of stand at all. Or rather, it allows the right to indulge its hatred of liberals and liberalism while side-stepping the need for a reckoning with the disaster of the Trump administration itself…. Achieving a sense of proportion requires analysts and commentators to let go of their knee-jerk hostility to Democrats and place the good of the country ahead of other considerations. It requires that they choose between forthrightly supporting and opposing Trump. And that they refuse the cowardly evasion of being anti-anti-Trump.
I was going to write about it in early April, but ended up trashing the post. The anti-anti-Trump argument seemed so passive aggressive: Linker starts from the premise that almost everything about Trump requires opposition, and that anyone who does not agree with them is dishonest.
What prompted me to write this post, which required retrieving the prior draft from the website “trash” bin, was that Charlie Sykes wrote a similar op-ed for the NY Times. Charlie is someone I do know, at least online, and I enjoyed their radio show (which they left recently); they have made a tremendous contribution to the conservative movement. Charlie was one of the reasons Ted Cruz won the Wisconsin primary.
Here is an excerpt from Charlie's op-ed, If Liberals Hate Him, Then Trump Must Be Doing Something Right:
If there was one principle that used to unite conservatives, it was respect for the rule of law. Not long ago, conservatives would have been horrified at wholesale violations of the norms and traditions of our political system, and would have been appalled by a president who showed overt contempt for the separation of powers…. But perhaps most important, we saw once again how conservatism, with its belief in ordered liberty, is being eclipsed by something different: Loathing those who loathe the president. Rabid anti-anti-Trumpism…. Here is how it works: Rather than defend President Trump's specific actions, their conservative champions change the subject to (1) the biased “fake news” media, (2) over-the-top liberals, (3) hypocrites on the left, (4) anyone else victimizes Mr. Trump or their supporters and (5) whataboutism, as in “What about Obama?” “What about Clinton?” For the anti-anti-Trump pundit, whatever the allegation against Mr. Trump, whatever their blunders or foibles, the other side is always worse. But the real heart of anti-anti-Trumpism is the delight in the frustration and anger of their opponents. Mr. Trump's base is unlikely to hold them either to promises or tangible achievements, because conservative politics is now less about ideas or accomplishments than it is about making the right enemies cry out in anguish.
Charlie's argument suffers from the same problem as the original “anti-anti-Trump” attack in many ways.
Most important, it takes place in a vacuum, ignoring that the Democratic Party, entire mainstream and liberal media, and significant parts of the @NeverTrump Republican Party have devoted themselves full time to bringing down the Trump administration. Even if that meant interfering with the Electoral College vote and justifying the corruption of the federal bureaucracy through illegal leaks.
The anti-Trump movement, as presently constituted, is deserving of an “anti-” movement.
To argue that anti-anti-Trumpers presume “the other side is always worse” seems like an inversion of reality; it is the anti-Trumpers who treat anything and anyone supporting Trump or any of their policies as always worse. Defending oneself against this onslaught is not the same as the onslaught itself.
For me, the attempt by anti-Trumpers to intimidate Electors into switching their votes so as to undermine the election was a turning point, the point at which I realized the #TheResistance was a danger to the rule of law and “norms and traditions of our political system.” One leading conservative luminary even suggested that the country would be better off run by the unelected deep state rather than by the duly-elected Trump state, a position implicitly argued by many #NeverTrump Republicans.
In such an environment, being anti-anti-Trump is a principled conservative position.
I supported Ted Cruz, as did Charlie, but Cruz didn't win even the Republican nomination. As I have argued in my “you go to war with the President you have” posts, Trump is not a conservative, but they are willing to do some conservative things. The anti-Trump movement, by contrast, seeks to drive conservatives out of the public square.
Much of the relentless opposition to Trump from #NeverTrump Republicans is not principled in conservatism, because if it were they'd have to present a viable more conservative current alternative.
Instead, it's resume building for the possibility that #TheResistance may actually succeed in taking Trump down, likely with substantial help from Trump's own foibles. It's also an insufferable desire for a disastrous Trump presidency, so they can say “I told you so.” I want no part of that.
The choice now is between Trump and the conspiracy theorists, Antifa street thugs, campus anti-free speech police, Soros-funded front groups, deceptive anti-Trump media, Democrat obstructionists, and illegal leakers in the permanent bureaucracy who consider themselves above the electoral process.
You don't need to be pro-Trump to be against those who collectively are a greater threat to our liberty than Trump.
Being anti-anti-Trump is no vice, at least not now.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's charitable foundation, which last year admitted violating federal rules on "self-dealing," is in the process of dissolving, according to newly filed documents reviewed by NBC News.
The move fulfills a promise Trump made last December, when they said they would wind down the Donald J. Trump Foundation to avoid conflicts of interest. New York's attorney general ordered the foundation to stop soliciting contributions in October 2016.
"The foundation announced its intent to dissolve and is seeking approval to distribute its remaining funds" to other charities, according to its 2016 Internal Revenue Service filing, filed this month and uploaded to the website of the nonprofit information source Guidestar.org by the foundation.
At the end of 2016, the foundation had assets of about $970,000, the document shows.
In a statement, a spokesperson for the foundation confirmed that it is being shuttered. "The Foundation continues to cooperate with the New York Attorney General's Charities Division, and as previously announced by the President, their advisers are working with the Charities Division to wind up the affairs of the Foundation. The Foundation looks forward to distributing its remaining assets at the earliest possible time to aid numerous worthy charitable organizations."
The attorney general's press secretary, Amy Spitalnick, said the foundation can't close just yet, however. "As the foundation is still under investigation by this office, it cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete," said Spitalnick.
In its previous tax filing in 2015, the foundation acknowledged violating a legal prohibition against a "self-dealing" that bars nonprofit leaders from funneling their charity's money to themselves, their businesses or their families.

In one section of the 2015 form, as The Washington Post first reported, the IRS asked whether the Trump Foundation had transferred "income or assets to a disqualified person." A disqualified person could be Trump — the foundation's president — or a member of their family or a Trump-owned business, The Post reported.
In 2015, the foundation checked yes. For 2016, the foundation checked no.

The records detail around $3 million in contributions that the foundation made to other nonprofits. In 2015, the foundation made contributions totaling $896,380, tax records show.
Recipients in 2015 included the Red Cross, the Make-a-Wish Foundation and the Salvation Army, along with several veterans' charities.
In 2016, the foundation gave more than $2 million to military and veterans' support organizations like Disabled American Veterans, the Green Beret Foundation and America's VetDogs. They also gave $50,000 to their son Barron's school in Manhattan, and $100,000 to the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.

"The Foundation has done enormous good works over the years in contributing millions of dollars to countless worthy groups, including supporting veterans, law enforcement officers and children," Trump said in a statement in December. "However, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways."
The statement did not clarify the means in which they planned to continue their charitable interests.
Trump has not donated to the foundation since 2008 but it has received tens of millions of dollars during the past 10 years.
Daughter Ivanka Trump donated $100,000 to the foundation in 2016, the tax records show.

Billionaire casino mogul Phil Ruffin, 82, also donated $1 million. They and Trump are longtime business partners, and Trump was the best man at Ruffin's 2008 marriage to a Ukrainian model.
Ohio shopping mall developer John Cafaro donated $50,000. Cafaro was convicted in 2002 of bribing former Ohio member of congress James Traficant, and in 2010 pleaded guilty to making false statements when they didn't disclose a $10,000 donation to their daughter's failed 2004 congressional run. They were sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay a $250,000 fine.
Cafaro, Ruffin and Perlmutter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Despite early career struggles, Keith Tandy emerged from Lovie Smith's doghouse and appears to be on track for the starting safety job for the Buccaneers.
A lot of people aren't a fan of his, but Keith Tandy showed last season exactly why the Buccaneers have stuck with them so long. They went from playing sparingly, to Lovie Smith's doghouse, to a force in the Bucs' secondary last season. And, according to Ira Kauffman, it appears as though Tandy has nearly cemented their place in the starting lineup.
Kauffman, of Joe Bucs Fan, spoke about Tandy on the latest episode of their podcast (which I highly recommend you listen to here) saying;
“I have been told that in this competition, maybe a four-way competition when you add in Wilcox and the rookie Evans with Conte and Tandy, I've been told that Tandy basically has a starting job secured. He's basically going to be very difficult to dislodge this fall unless Evans is lights out and Wilcox is even better than they think.”
What that boils down to is it's a three horse race for the other safety spot between J.J. Wilcox, Chris Conte, and Justin Evans. When it comes to Bucs news and insider information, Kauffman is one of – if not the – best in the industry so hearing that from them means you can pretty much take it to the bank.
One of the other points Ira and the Joes touch on is the fact that Tandy and Conte have had the vast majority of the reps while Wilcox and Evans have been on the sidelines “in the floppy hats.”
Tandy earned the first shot at starting in 2017 with their break out performance in 2016, finishing the season with 58 tackles and four interceptions – most of which coming at critical moments at the end of games.
Like them or not, another year in Mike Smith‘s system should give Buccaneers fans reason for optimism regarding Tandy as they continue to grow and improve off of the best season of their career. Being the full time starter will only help as they get more reps, gets into more rhythm, and hopefully continues to put themselves in position to make more big plays.
In a press release issued yesterday, the UCI have detailed the level doping controls during this year's Tour de France. The data revealed in the press release has been published by the Cycling Anti-Doping Federation (CADF). Related Articles UCI grants wildcard to Australia for Olympic time trial
French and UCI anti-doping staff to work together at the Tour de France
Paolini informed of cocaine positive at Tour de France
Night-time doping tests blocked by French law at Tour de France
Britain looking into criminalising doping
According to the document, a total of 656 tests were completed during the three-week event. The anti-doping controls at the Tour de France were done in collaboration with the French Anti-Doping Agency (AFLD) and were all sent to the Châtenay-Malabry laboratory in France to be analysed. Of those tests completed, the majority, 482, were blood tests while the remaining 174 were urine tests.
“I would like to highlight once again the excellent climate in which all the stakeholders involved in the fight against doping work together on a daily basis for the benefit of our sport,” UCI president Brian Cookson said in the press release. “In particular, I would like to congratulate the AFLD and the CADF for their collaboration on this 2015 Tour de France. Thanks to the sharing of information between all anti-doping actors and a strategy focused on even more targeted controls, we can be confident of the robustness of our programme.”
There has been a lot of tension between the UCI and the AFLD in the past and it is only the second year that they have worked together on the Tour since the French organisation refused to collaborate with the UCI in the spring of 2013.
Ahead of the race, several night-time tests were done, however none took place during the race its self after it was blocked by French law. Currently, Luca Paolini (Katusha) is the only rider to have been confirmed as testing positive during the Tour de France. The Italian rider, who won Gent-Wevelgem earlier this year, produced an adverse analytical finding of cocaine following a test taken after the cobbled stage 4 of the French Grand Tour. They have been provisionally suspended by their team and is still awaiting the result of their B sample.
As has become procedure, the samples taken at the Tour de France will be stored for potential future testing. “The UCI, the CADF and the AFLD have agreed to keep the samples for potential retrospective analyses in the future. As for all Grands Tours, all the collected samples concerning the best five riders in the general classification will be kept for ten years for potential retrospective analyses,” said Bruno Genevois, President of the AFLD.
WALTHAM, Mass. -- Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens is giving a whole new meaning to being dressed for success.
Boston is 7-1 this season when Stevens wear a tie, and a mere 3-6 when they do not. Call it happenstance if you prefer but with 20 percent of the season completed, the data can no longer be ignored.
What's harder to decipher is when and why Stevens wears a tie. They never has gone more than two games in a row with the same look. They don't stick to any discernible pattern based on location, or what jersey their players are wearing. They have blown off Wear a Tie Wednesday and brazenly busted out neckwear on Casual Fridays.
"I just really enjoy formal attire," Brad Stevens said when asked to explain an increased usage in neckties. Greg M. Cooper/USA TODAY Sports
After Monday's tie-clad win in Miami -- with South Beach being maybe the most preposterous NBA location for neckwear -- we decided it was time to confront Stevens on their tie habits. So, Coach, how do you decide if you're going to wear a tie or not on gamedays?
"I don't even know," shrugged Stevens.
Are you superstitious at all?
"I'm not superstitious at all," they replied, stonewalling our initial efforts.
Are you aware of your team's record when you wear a tie this season?
"I don't know my record with the tie, but I know that's being bantered about," Stevens said. "I also know that, when you lose however many games good teams lose in this league -- what is it, if you win 50, you lose 32 -- like that's 32 ways to screw up being superstitious. I've lost all my superstitions. If I had any coming in, they're all gone."
UPSET TUESDAY According to our Basketball Power Index, there was less than a one percent chance that Spurs, Clippers and Cavaliers would all lose. But they did. • Stats: Upsetting night all around
• In Boston, tie goes to the winner
• J.R. Smith hugs it out. Oops.
• Porzingis: Whose team? Doesn't matter
• Tuesday's TrueHoop podcast
Fair enough, Coach. But your tie usage rate is off the charts this season. Stevens wore a tie only 17 times during the 81 regular-season games they coached last season or a mere 21 percent of Boston's schedule. This year, they have gone with a tie in eight of Boston's 17 games. So why the uptick?
"I just really enjoy formal attire," deadpanned Stevens, who probably would coach in windpants and a team polo if the league allowed it.
Stevens clearly wasn't going to divulge their neckwear habits. But we had to take one more shot at cracking the code. Did their kids, Brady and Kinsley, or wife, Tracy, happen to buy them some new ties before the season?
"No. I don't know why," Stevens said. "That's a great question. I'm going to try not to put any more thought into it."
Good luck with that, Coach. If the trend continues, every loss will be blamed on your pregame decision to ditch the tie.
Then again, Stevens is probably safe to not overthink things. Their team was a mere 9-8 last season when they wore a tie. Late in the season they went almost exclusively tie-less and the team posted a 39-25 record with the more casual appearance.
Stevens must tread carefully, however. If the current trend continues, they are going to be bombarded this holiday season with ties from family, friends, fans, and everyone in the Celtics' organization. They might not be superstitious, but most of the sports world is insanely irrational.
Hey, you don't mess with success.
Arsenal fans' ingenious idea to beat Barcelona involves Leo Messi & ‘billionaire' Mathieu Flamini [Tweet]
The news that Arsenal will face Barcelona in the last 16 of the Champions League, has certainly not gone down well with fans of the North London side.
But don't despair Reds fans, as Arsenal supporters have thought of a brilliant way Arsenal can overcome Barcelona, and reach the quarter finals of the tournament, and it involves Leo Messi and Arsenal's ‘billionaire' midfielder Mathieu Flamini.
It was recently reported that the Gunners enforcer could be worth up to 20bn over their involvement with GF Biochemicals.
With so much money at their disposal, an Arsenal fan has suggested that the 31-year-old use their billions to buy Leo Messi from Barcelona in the January transfer window, thus giving Arsenal the edge in their forthcoming Champions League tie in February.
The problem is, even if Flamini did buy Messi for Arsenal, the North London side would probably still need to buy Luis Suarez, and Neymar to ensure victory.
Watch Flamini buy the star players from the teams we get drawn against to increase our chances of winning. Legend. — EŃK (@OziLInstinct) December 9, 2015

BOSTON — What a difference a healthy David Krejci makes.
The Bruins entered Wednesday's game against the Philadelphia Flyers ranked second in goals scored per game and first in power-play goals, and Krejci helped Boston improve both areas in a 5-4 overtime loss at TD Garden.
Krejci extended their NHL-leading power-play scoring total to six points with an assist on Patrice Bergeron's goal at the 17:26 mark of the first period. They followed that up by earning the primary assist on Jimmy Hayes' second period goal, which gave the B's a 4-2 lead.
Krejci now leads the league in scoring with 11 points (four goals, seven assists), one ahead of Dallas Stars duo Jamie Benn and Tyler Seguin. They also have a six-game point streak, which means he's found the scoresheet in every contest this season. Only four other players have done that at this point in the campaign.
Krejci has been an important part of the Bruins' offense since the 2008-09 season. He's one of two Bruins to tally 70-plus points in a single season over that span (Marc Savard is the other) and has finished first or second on the team in scoring five times.
This is why losing them to injury for 35 games last season was devastating for the B's. It was one of the main reasons why Boston's offense fell to 22nd in goals scored in 2014-15 after ranking third the season before. The power play also fell to 18th after ranking third in 2013-14.
One of the ways Krejci helps the Bruins score at even strength and the power play is by executing successful zone entries. It's an underrated part of their game.
He's able to enter the attacking zone with possession and help set up scoring chances, which is more effective than dumping the puck in, chasing it and hoping to win a 50-50 battle along the boards.
Hockey analytics expert Jen Costella did a nice job of explaining this in a series of tweets Wednesday night.
Krejci isn't the most valuable Bruins forward — that would be Bergeron — but he's their most important offensive player. Their ability to score goals, slow the game down and set up teammates for chances, in addition to their power-play skill is unmatched by any other B's forward.
Ryan Spooner's struggles as the third-line center and the lack of scoring production from the bottom-six as a whole also have increased Krejci's importance.
The Bruins cannot afford to lose them for an extended period of time. They're going to need their offense to score a lot of goals to offset the defensive mistakes being made on a nightly basis.

The European Union Commission has announced the result of its investigation into Google and the placement of shopping comparison results, the conclusion of which is a fine of 2.42 billion euros. That there need to be antitrust rules is entirely true, we would indeed prefer both that no one had monopoly power and also that no one exploited such power if they had it. The problem here is that the Commission has folded into one the two parts necessary, the determination that such market power exists and also that it is being used. For it's not illegal to have market power, that is made clear. It is also not illegal to favour the presentation of your own services. It is only if you have market power and also favour your own services that one is doing anything even reprehensible, let alone illegal. This decision thus fails a basic part of natural justice. It is only today that we get the ruling of market dominance. Thus, it is only from today that we can usefully insist that Google should know that it should not exercise favourtism to its own results.
That we don't want people exercising monopoly power is entirely true, but we also want to make sure that we're all living and working under the rule of law, this being something this decision doesn't provide.
Google has been fined 2.42bn euros ($2.7bn; £2.1bn) by the European Commission after it ruled the company had abused its power by promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results.
That's the basic result:
The European Commission found that the U.S. tech giant denied "consumers a genuine choice" by using its search engine to unfairly steer them to its own shopping platform.
Regulators said that Google must change its behavior within 90 days or face additional penalties.
There is no guidance as to what Google must do either, just an insistence that it must do something in the face of further heavier fines:
European regulators gave the tech giant 90 days to stop its illegal activities or face fines of up to 5% of the average daily worldwide turnover of parent company Alphabet.
The full judgement is here, and this is just most odd:
The Commission Decision requires Google to stop its illegal conduct within 90 days of the Decision and refrain from any measure that has the same or an equivalent object or effect. In particular, the Decision orders Google to comply with the simple principle of giving equal treatment to rival comparison shopping services and its own service:
Google has to apply the same processes and methods to position and display rival comparison shopping services in Google's search results pages as it gives to its own comparison shopping service.
It is Google's sole responsibility to ensure compliance and it is for Google to explain how it intends to do so. Regardless of which option Google chooses, the Commission will monitor Google's compliance closely and Google is under an obligation to keep the Commission informed of its actions (initially within 60 days of the Decision, followed by periodic reports).
If Google fails to comply with the Commission's Decision, it would be liable for non-compliance payments of up to 5% of the average daily worldwide turnover of Alphabet, Google's parent company.
That is pretty odd, don't you think? We're not going to tell you what you must do, not going to tell you what is sufficient you do, but we're going to keep on fining you until we're happy?
But that's not the part which actually has me so concerned. I already know that I have rather different ideas about monopoly and antitrust than the EU Commission. As I differ with them on almost everything else in fact. What really concerns is the basic process of natural justice, the rule of law. This is vital for any economy. It's simply not possible for us to operate a complex economy without certainty, things just fall apart if we're subject to the capricious decisions of a ruler or bureaucracy. Vital to this is that we all know what the law is ahead of time. It must be possible for us to know that we are acting illegally that is, the law must be known, it must be possible for us to know that we are subject to it.
And that's where this decision fails. From the decision:
Google's practices amount to an abuse of Google's dominant position in general internet search by stifling competition in comparison shopping markets.
Market dominance is, as such, not illegal under EU antitrust rules. However, dominant companies have a special responsibility not to abuse their powerful market position by restricting competition, either in the market where they are dominant or in separate markets.
The implication of this is that Google could do anything it wanted with the presentation of search results assuming that it didn't have market dominance. For that's the crime for which it is being fined, the use of the dominance to provide leverage. OK, fair enough we might think.
But when was the finding of market dominance meaning that Google could possibly know that it should not try leverage? From this decision again:
Today's Decision concludes that Google is dominant in general internet search markets throughout the European Economic Area (EEA), i.e. in all 31 EEA countries. It found Google to have been dominant in general internet search markets in all EEA countries since 2008, except in the Czech Republic where the Decision has established dominance since 2011.
It's only from today that the law defines Google as having market dominance, isn't it? Because it is this very decision which states it does, therefore that Google has special responsibilities to not use that as leverage.
That is, this decision both defines, for the first time, the activity as a crime and also finds Google guilty of it. Natural justice insists that guilt can only be assigned to actions after the definition of the crime. This is a bad decision.
Millions of children under five dice every year due to toxic germ-infested unsafe drinking water. This means that almost four babies a minute die from a lack of water according to UN-Water's estimations. In the 2015 World Water Report released on the eve of World Water Day, the UN said that 768 million people do not have adequate access to water, 2.5 billion do not have access to improved sanitation. Among the deprived are a significant number of people in Detroit and this will soon spread across the nation.
It would seem that the problems of the third world are being visited upon Detroit and soon the rest of the country.
Obama Refused to Bail Out the People of Detroit So The UN Could Begin to Control Their Water
Obama has taken American taxpayer funds to bail out the privately owned General Motors. Obama has helped themselves to the same pot of money and has devastated this country by bailing out key Wall Street businesses (e.g. Goldman Sachs). However, when it comes to helping 700,000 residents of Detroit, they are not worthy of an Obama bailout, even when their health and their very lives are being put in danger by severe third world economic conditions that are currently present in Detroit.
Detroit is still trying to come to grips with its newly founded Chapter 9 Bankruptcy plan that includes a significant loss of pension benefits for retired city employees. However, the most devastating part of the Detroit financial crisis may not be the loss of pension benefits, it is the access to clean drinking water. Today, Detroit is a city in which nearly 50% of the residents have no access to clean drinking water. Yes, that is correct, nearly half of the residents in Detroit, cannot obtain clean water and this has become a serious life crisis. Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) announced it would send shut-off notices to customers with balances more than $150 past due or who are more than 60 days behind in their water payments. The department, has stated that nearly 50% of Detroit's 324,000 water bills are overdue. Already, 4,500 accounts have had their water shut off by DWSD. This is a looming health crisis of epic proportions!
Obama's refusal to involve themselves in helping the people of Detroit in such a stark contradiction of their constitutionally mandated priorities, is yet another example of Obama's Treason Quotient.
Both history and current events demonstrate that the more debt a country acquires, the more at risk that country has with regard to losing control over its infrastructure and in particular, its water supplies to private interest
Beware of the UN Trojan Horse
Beware of the UN Trojan Horse, as the UN's solution to this crisis is a case of the cure being worse than the illness.
After reading this section of the report on the Detroit water crisis, it will be apparent why Obama has refused to bail out the people of Detroit, even as the people face an extreme crisis.
Clearly, when OBama failed to bail out Detroit, Obama was waiting for the United Nations to interject themselves into Detroit and recently, this is exactly what has happened. Right on Cue, the United Nations has promised to intervene in the Detroit water crisis. The U.N. High Commission on Human Rights special rapporteur on safe water and sanitation, Catarina de Albuquerque, is in possession of a mandate which dictates that they must directly intervene with the U.S. government, first in a confidential manner and then in a public manner. This is a case of problem, reaction and solution!
What do countries do when they are being strangled by debt? The answer is simple, the United Nations asserts its authority to intervene, in the name of human rights and then they bring in their corporate partners for fun and profit. On the UN's website they fully admit to resorting to facilitating corporate involvement when there is a water crisis.
As America's aging infrastructure falls further into disrepair, and this administration has done nothing to mitigate the damage, the various levels of government will be forced to borrow more money in order to keep its water supplies safe. This has been done before and the results were devastating to the country borrowing money.
Examples of UN NGO Involvement In Previous Water Crises
Bolivia, in 2000, is the poster child for what happens to a country when it lets the UN and its partner, the World Bank, has when it can convince governmental leaders to borrow money to fix its water issues. The Bolivian case in point is exemplified by the fact that the country borrowed money from the predatory World Bank in order to fix its water issues. The World Bank brought in Bechtel Corporation to fix Bolivia's water issues, however, Bolivia predictably defaulted on its World Bank loan obligations and their water supplies went into receivership as prices skyrocketed by 400%. Further the Bolivians lost the right to trap rainwater and reuse irrigation water.
The exact scheme is also underway in Lima, Peru, where the typical poor family pays private vendors up to $3 per cubic meter to collect contaminated water in buckets while the elite pay 30 cents per cubic meter for treated water that pours out of taps in their homes. Also, in India, some families spend a quarter of their income on water. Debt manipulation, for the ultimate purpose of controlling water, is not just in play in the third world. Very soon, America's crushing debt load combined with a quickly declining water infrastructure will lead officials in the US to acquiesce. Is this why we are seeing UN vehicles in every part of the country?
The derivative debt has paralyzed the economies of Europe and the United States. Debt default, followed by the banker bailouts will lead to private entities controlling our essential resources.
How long will it be until the globalists have to bail out the American economy while we continue on our trek towards unsustainable debt? When America's economy falters, the bankers, armed with their central bank printing presses, will come to the rescue. The price for their intervention, judging by what happened in Bolivia, will be the total control over our infrastructure. Collecting rainwater and purifying stream water to drink, have already become illegal acts. As the UN has recently called for, all water will eventually be obtained through the public private partnership corporations and you can bet, as history has set the precedent, the price of water will get very expensive.
Draconian Water Policies Are Present In the US
States like Colorado, Utah and Washington have already made it illegal to trap rain water and use these resources for such purposes as drinking and irrigation.
In Douglas County, Colorado, just south of metropolitan Denver, engineers conducted a study on how rainwater collection affects aquifer function and health as well as groundwater supplies. The study revealed that when private parties collect rainwater on their properties, this serves to reduce the demand on local water facilities and improves conservation efforts. Based upon this research, trapping rainwater should be encouraged. However, conservation is not the goal of modern day water management, political and personal control of the citizenry is the final objective.
The Bolivian water experience is already underway in the United States. Did we really think that this was only going to happen in Bolivia? Similar projects are underway in Manila, Pakistan and San Francisco. Yes, this is correct; Bechtel now has a contract with San Francisco's city government to upgrade the city's water system. Bechtel employees are working side by side with city workers in a privatization move that people-in-the-know fear will lead to an eventual take-over of San Francisco 's water system and create a fiasco similar to the one in Bolivia.
The wolf is at the door as massive debt will soon cause the US to lose control over our water. This is all part of an Agenda 21 plot to control the water of the United States in order to subjugate the people and to make a lot of money in the process.
Conclusion
It is not just Detroit that is in trouble. St. Louis, Cleveland and Pittsburgh are just a few of the several aging communities that are in severe financial stress. Soon, these water practices are going to be visited on many American cities.
“A paper by US-based NGO Corporate Accountability International asks: “what is the ulterior motive, or at least the commonality of interests between these corporations in financing WHI's expansion? At least three strategic outcomes can be observed: (1) self-dealing (profiteering), (2) political and cultural commodification of water, and (3) advancement of a self-proclaimed ‘new global architecture' for corporate control of water.” This quote is not only accurate, it is prophetic. It has been announced that Nestle (the thieves robbing the Great Lakes), Coke and Veolia are participating in what is being called the 2030 Water Resources Group Phase 2. The groups announced strategy is to insert “private management” of all water resources on the planet.
How will the Agenda 21 sources get people into the “stack and pack” urban centers of the future? Simple, they will use water to accomplish this goal. And will this serve a higher political goal? You already know the answer to that question.
At the end of the day, and just like they will with food, the end game for the UN involves the the globalists using water as a weapon to subjugate the population.
This process is already underway and will accelerate in the difficult times which lie ahead.
And we did not even mention that scores of Californians are on the verge of being driven from the state in an artificially controlled drought. And do you know who is setting water policy in California? It is the UN and it is called Agenda 21.

• State agency staff discussed ‘how Duke wants to be sued' • January 2012 case led to $5bn company paying $99,100 fine
Internal emails between staff at North Carolina's environmental agency show state regulators were coordinating with Duke Energy before intervening in efforts by citizens groups trying to sue the company over pollution leeching from its coal ash dumps.
The emails were provided on Thursday to the Associated Press by the Southern Environmental Law Center, which had filed notice in January 2012 of its intent to sue Duke under the Clean Water Act.
Within days, the emails show a Duke lobbyist contacted the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, where staff exchanged messages discussing “how Duke wants to be sued”.
The agency used its authority to intervene in the lawsuit, quickly negotiating a proposed settlement where the $5bn company would pay a $99,100 fine but be under no requirement to stop its pollution.

CPS twice stepped in to help children allegedly killed by mom
Sheborah Latrice Thomas, 30, is charged with two counts of capital murder in the deaths of their two children, ages 7 and 5, about 9:30 a.m. Friday, Aug. 12, 2016 at 3011 Tierwester in southeast Houston.

(Houston ... more Image 1 of / 42 Caption Close CPS twice stepped in to help children allegedly killed by mom 1 / 42 Back to Gallery
Just three days before Christmas in 2012, 2-year-old Kayiana Thomas was wandering the streets of Houston with a homeless man who was intoxicated and mentally ill.
They were cold and had wet herself, and their mother was nowhere to be found, according to court records.
It was the second time in two years that Child Protective Services had stepped in to protect Kayiana and their older brother, Araylon, from a life of drugs and instability that social workers feared put the children at risk.
But the help didn't last. On Friday, with the children back in their care, their mother, Sheborah Thomas, systematically drowned them in a bathtub and stuffed their bodies under a neighbor's house, then later told an acquaintance they had killed them, according to prosecutors.
A confidential court document obtained by the Chronicle paints a troubling picture of the life the children faced in the years leading up to their deaths, including the bout of homelessness in 2012.
Twice the family was investigated for child neglect, and at least once custody was taken away from the mother, according to the sworn statement by a CPS investigator.
And police showed up five times in just the past four months - including the day before the children died - to the home where Thomas and their children lived in the 3000 block of Tierwester.
Mom 'comes and goes'
A passer-by alerted authorities on Dec. 22, 2012 after spotting little Kayiana sitting on top of the homeless man, shaking him. Emergency responders rushed them to Texas Children's Hospital and the man to Ben Taub Hospital for psychiatric treatment, according to the investigator's report.
Kayiana appeared healthy to hospital workers, aside from a healing wound on their stomach from having a cyst drained the previous month. They were discharged from the hospital that day and taken to the CPS office.
The man, who experienced hallucinations and admitted using PCP, gave police the mother's name and said they both were homeless. The mother, they said, "comes and goes." They said they had been on the streets for about six days when they left the child with him.
Contacts on their cellphone led to Thomas' mother, who told the investigator they had not spoken with their daughter in several weeks. The investigator located an address where Thomas received government benefits for themselves and their three children, but no one answered the door. Another address listed for Thomas had been vacant for months.
CPS decided to hand the child over to the grandmother. By the next day, when they came to pick up the child, the grandmother said they had since heard from their daughter, who was living in a homeless shelter in northeast Houston with Araylon, then 4. An older son from a previous relationship, who was 8, was with their father.
Thomas admitted to the investigator that they had used marijuana and PCP, and said they left their daughter at the bus stop with the homeless man after catching a ride with someone else when the buses stopped running.
Kayiana's father could not be found.
Emergency temporary conservatorship was granted to the grandmother for both children.
"Miss Thorn (Thomas) does not have a stable home environment and their drug usage prevents them from properly caring for their children," the investigator wrote.
The report also refers to a 2010 CPS investigation, when Sheborah and Danny Ray Thomas were accused of putting all three children at risk with "illegal drug activities." The couple was investigated for neglectful supervision and exposing the children to drug use, which created "an unprotected environment that may compromise their safety," according to the report.
The children's mother passed a drug test, while the father tested positive for THC, a component in marijuana. It appears from the court document that the children were allowed to remain with them because the father no longer lived in the home.
Weapons disturbance
It is unclear when Thomas regained custody of the children after the 2012 incident, but the family's troubles continued this year.
CPS has declined to comment about the case, except to say they have had involvement with the family.
Since early April, when a landlord and neighbors said Thomas started renting the house in the Third Ward, police visited three times for family disturbances, two of which involved a weapon. They responded two other times for child custody situations, one of which coincided with one of the family disturbances.
Police returned again on Thursday, the day before the children were killed. Thomas accused a woman they knew of threatening to harm them on Facebook, and a police report was filed.
None of the police calls was generated in response to abuse or neglect allegations made to Child Protective Services, said Houston Police Department spokesperson Jodi Silva.
By then, Danny Ray Thomas was in state prison for possession of PCP. They had already served numerous jail and prison sentences for a litany of charges, including burglary, theft, family violence, trespassing and drug possession.
The final police call came Sunday, when an acquaintance flagged police to tell them Thomas had confessed to killing their children. They were taken into police custody that morning and charged later in the day.
On Monday, prosecutors said Thomas had forced Kayiana and Araylon's heads underwater as they struggled against them They hid their bodies under a neighbor's house.
Court records show Thomas, 30, has a minor criminal record, including three misdemeanor theft convictions and failure to identify themselves to a peace officer.
 They are expected to appear in court Wednesday.

ALLEN PARK, Mich. -- During the spring, Matthew Stafford admitted there was a lot to pick up in the new offensive system, only the second one he's had to digest in the NFL.
Through two weeks of training camp, though, Stafford has not shown many issues. Anything positive that happens for the Detroit Lions this season will start with the improvement of Stafford, who needed to show better decision-making and efficiency in practice and in games.
So far, not bad. They have not thrown an interception during any serious team or seven-on-seven periods in the first two weeks of training camp.
“I'm being coached differently,” Stafford said. “Our drops are different. Our reads are different. Our plays are totally different. It was kind of nice to scrap everything and start from the new way they wanted me to do it.
“I tried to embrace myself in that as hard as I possibly can and it's been fun.”
That Stafford has shown this already -- along with strong rapport with receivers Golden Tate and Kevin Ogletree to go with Calvin Johnson -- is a massive positive for the Lions as they search for offensive efficiency.
Both Stafford and their offensive coordinator, Joe Lombardi, understand that pressure is on Stafford every play in practice. So far, he's handled it.
“That's the quarterback position,” Lombardi said. “All of the pressure is always going to be on them [Stafford]. Like all competitive people, and he's a highly competitive guy, they put more pressure on themselves than anyone else does.
“It's fair.”
It also needs to continue as Stafford continues to learn the offense.
Three reasons for optimism:
Players are buying into new coach Jim Caldwell's focus on efficiency. AP Photo/Carlos Osorio This team appears to truly believe in Jim Caldwell, at least for now. Yes, it is easy to speak positively of a new regime before a regular-season game has been played, but the players are buying into their focus on efficiency. From their elimination of stretching periods in practice to their promise that he'll treat every player equally, the Lions have been appreciative of Caldwell's approach compared to the previous regime under Jim Schwartz. Accountability has been a big focus for Caldwell, and so far it has worked.
Megatron. It might sound simplistic, but if this team has a healthy Johnson, that is a massive reason for optimism because of what they are able to do to opposing defenses. Johnson has looked impressive through the first two weeks of camp, making jaw-dropping plays essentially every day. This is typical for Johnson, who has been doing that since their first-year student year at Georgia Tech in 2004. But Johnson looks healed from their offseason knee and finger surgeries, and the Lions are being smart with their repetitions during practice. As long as Johnson is healthy, Detroit can feel good about its passing game.
Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley have been dominant. Both entered camp in great shape and are playing for future contracts this season. If the Lions receive first-round efforts from both Suh (expected) and Fairley (questionable) in 2014, Detroit could have the dominant defensive front it has sought since it drafted them in back-to-back first rounds.
Three reasons for pessimism:
If Stafford gets hurt, the Lions are in major trouble. Yes, many teams can say that about their starting quarterback, but in previous years Shaun Hill gave Detroit a level of confidence that it could remain competitive if Stafford were to go down. So far, No. 2 quarterback Dan Orlovsky has looked somewhat rough both in practice and in one preseason game. Kellen Moore showed some flashes of potential in the preseason opener, but they were mostly facing players who won't make Cleveland's 53-man roster. More than any other season, Stafford's health is of supreme importance right now.
A lot of the Lions' success in 2014 will depend on how well Matthew Stafford picks up the new offense and if they can stay healthy. Leon Halip/Getty Images The secondary is still questionable. The Lions are set with their starters here, but the depth is still up in the air at both cornerback and safety. Beyond Rashean Mathis and Darius Slay -- and even with them -- the Lions have no sure things at cornerback and in a division with Aaron Rodgers and Jay Cutler, that is not good for Detroit. Safety appears to be a little stronger both in starters (Glover Quin, James Ihedigbo) and also depth (Don Carey, DeJon Gomes, Isa Abdul-Quddus) but lacks a top-end playmaker.
The offense has still looked a little shaky. Stafford has practiced well, especially with Johnson, but the defense has looked stronger than the offense on multiple occasions. There is still a large learning curve, but considering what the Lions have put into their offense in the offseason, that might not bode well for a team trying to score points in bunches. Part of the issue might come from Detroit's multiplicity offensively, with players lining up in different spots on almost every play. Early on the defense has looked stronger.
Observation Deck:
With the exception of the Ukrainian and Russian flags, flown by each side in Ukraine's conflict, newcomers to eastern Ukraine have to learn the meaning of a whole range of unfamiliar banners and symbols. Some, like the Ukrainian and Russian ones, are old pre-Soviet flags revived, some are new ones incorporating elements from older flags, and many are old Soviet ones catering to those on the barricades who are nostalgic for the country of their youth.

The black and orange flag of St George is one of the most important symbols of the anti-Kiev rebels. However, even more important than the flag itself, are the ribbons which people tie to their jackets. Over the last decade these ribbons have grown in Russia and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union as a commemorative symbol. The black and orange stripes were established as the colours of the Russian imperial Order of St George in 1769, and survived until the revolution of 1917. During the second world war, when Stalin sought to infuse Russians with patriotism, the ribbon was revived to accompany a Soviet order which survives in a new form today. Here in Ukraine however they have now become a symbol of loyalty to Russia.
As the ribbon's stripes closely resemble those of the Colorado beetle, pro-Russians are being derided by pro-Ukrainians as “Colorados”, who need to be eliminated, just like the notorious potato pest beetles.
All buildings seized by the rebels now fly the Donetsk flag, though sometimes below that of the Russian flag. There are two versions. One is a plain tricolour and the other features a double-headed eagle crest. While the flag was adopted with the declaration of the republic last month, it is not new. In 1918 it was that of the Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Republic which lasted less than six weeks and was also a rebellion against Ukraine.
Very common at rallies in eastern Ukraine now and on barricades are old Soviet flags, particularly that of Soviet Ukraine, which was a variation of the flag of the Soviet Union but featured a blue stripe. The flags of Soviet Russia, and Belarus in particular, are also a common sight and fuse the idea of a common Soviet past and united, Slavic future.
Rarer are Tsarist-era Russian imperial flags. The basic one is a simple black, yellow and white tricolour and others are variations on this, including the imperial double headed eagle crest. As Vladmir Putin has revived the name New Russia, which covers the old imperial possessions in Ukraine's east and its Black Sea coast, whoever flies these flags leaves no uncertainty about their wish that these regions should become part of an empire reborn.
On the Ukrainian side there has not been a re-appearance of old or new flags in the east. However, many easterners have been convinced by the Russian media that they are under massive attack from a fringe Ukrainian nationalist group called the Right Sector. The flag they have been using, and which was much in evidence in Kiev during last winter's revolution, is a black and red one. It was the flag of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army during the second world war. At times this group collaborated with the Nazis and later it fought against the reimposition of Soviet rule.
According to Andreas Umland, an academic in Kiev, many Ukrainians regard the red and black flag as one representing freedom. They do not know that originally the red and black stood for blood and soil with all the sinister historical connotations that come with that fact. Indeed, the same could be said for many of the new-old banners under which Ukrainians are now marching to war.
Khabib Nurmagomedov's nutritionist opens up about road to UFC 219, lessons from UFC 209, potential move to 145
LAS VEGAS — Nine months ago, disaster struck in Las Vegas when Khabib Nurmagomedov was forced to withdraw from their scheduled interim title shot at UFC 209 after their weight cut went awry just hours before official weigh-ins. A golden opportunity for Nurmagomedov was lost without the undefeated Dagestani contender even getting a chance to step foot inside the cage.
Now, Nurmagomedov is once again in the entertainment capital of the world readying for their first fight since the drama that unfolded this past spring. Set to meet Edson Barboza in a likely No. 1 contender's match, Nurmagomedov may have briefly lost their shot at Octagon gold, but the lightweight strap will not be far away if they overcome the feared Brazilian on Dec. 30 at UFC 219.
Ahead of the contest, Nurmagomedov has employed the services of a new nutritionist, Tyler Minton, a name that may be familiar for MMA fans due to their association with George Lockhart and past work with Chris Weidman, Daniel Cormier at UFC 214, Max Holloway at UFC 218, and many others. With less than 24 hours before UFC 219's weigh-ins — which kick off Friday at 9 a.m. PT/Noon ET — MMA Fighting sat down with Minton for an update on Nurmagomedov's progress, their road to UFC 219, how things have changed since the spring, a potential move to featherweight, and more.
(Portions of this interview have been edited for clarity and concision.)
Shaun Al-Shatti: Thanks for taking the time today, Tyler. So it's Thursday afternoon, less than a day out from weigh-ins. How is Khabib looking right now? How is the cut feeling about 12 hours away from doing what they need to do?
Tyler Minton: He's about four pounds off. He's still eating every three hours, we're still having carbohydrates. A lot of guys cut the carbohydrates all week — we did carbohydrates with breakfast this morning. They had eggs and berries and things like that, so he's still got good energy. He'll still drink water today. Like, we don't ever actually stop drinking water until the cut starts Thursday night, and then after they cut tonight, he'll eat too. Like, I'll give them fruit after they cut weight tonight.
So he's got four pounds to go, but he's been drinking two gallons of water a day. Two gallons of water is 16 pounds, so you don't drink 16 pounds and lose 16 pounds every day, meaning he's got a lot of water still in him, so I'm not worried. They say they feel great, says this is the best he's ever felt. So they might be maybe a little too eager, but he's like, ‘I'd fight tonight if I have to,' so they feel good, so that's good.
SA: When we saw Khabib today at media day and open workouts, they looked good. They looked healthy. I remember back to UFC 209, this seems like a much better situation than where they were on that Thursday. It sounds as if there were some lifestyle changes.
TM: I don't know all the details from that time, but I know from my own experience, sometimes a fighter's too heavy going in, things like that. But I know that sometimes one of the best things that could ever happen to a fighter for the rest of their career is to miss weight like that one time. These guys that are always so close, or they're right on the verge — miss weight for an important fight and that's the best thing that could ever happen to you. They came in a little bit lighter this time, they took it more serious. So I was handed a much more determined and strict athlete, so it made my job a lot easier that they were already coming into this with the fear from [UFC 209].
SA: Four pounds out from this distance, that seems encouraging compared to the numbers we normally hear from fighters.
TM: It's turning out.
Someone tweeted me, they said something about, ‘Are you trying to tempt the MMA gods, because this is how you tempt the MMA gods,' so I hate to say that it's just going to be a breeze and all of that. But I will say that I have never, ever worked with a fighter that we were this (close). Following the hydration protocols, the food protocols, everything, only four pounds away on Thursday night, I've never dealt with that.
SA: So what's the process like, then, for the rest of the night and getting ready for tomorrow morning?
TM: So we'll still drink water as he's thirsty today. I don't put a limit on it. I don't say, ‘You need to drink two gallons, you need to drink one gallon.' I say, ‘Listen, if you're thirsty, drink,' because we really believe that. What we do is we work with the body. The body is smart. The body is very smart and it's very hard to kill the human body. It takes physical trauma and a lot of trauma to kill the body, so I've always laughed anytime someone goes, ‘I'm trying to trick the body.' You're not smart, you're not going to. So a lot of these guys, they try to do all of these things that are just crazy.
We study the human body, we know how the body works, how the body recovers, how the body metabolizes things, and we use those to do what is going to make the body want to work with us. So we keep doing that. When he's thirsty, I need them to drink, because every time you're thirsty and you're not drinking, that's a signal to the body like, ‘Hey, something's wrong, we might be dying.' And that's the truth. So today is a very low stress day. Again, we don't want the body to know that we're about to cut weight, and that's why we've kept them eating. He'll eat every three hours today, same calories he's had all week. The calories don't even drop today.
So keep eating, we'll eat every three hours, drink when he's thirsty, and then tonight we'll hit the tub. Probably get close, if not right on. No matter what, we'll cut tonight though, and then we'll go back to the room, get comfortable, I'll have them eat a little bit more before they go to bed and hopefully sleep really good, and either float the rest off or cut a little bit more in the morning.
SA: What has it been like working with Khabib for the first time? I always wonder about athletes who have had so much success in the past — has they been responsive to suggestions and ideas, or they are more like they want to do things how they do them?
TM: No, he's super coachable. Very coachable. And that was one thing you always worry about. That's a nutritionist or any coach's worst nightmare, is a guy who's just stuck in their ways. And Khabib had all the positive risk factors for someone who was going to be difficult to work with. He's had issues before making weight. There's a communication barrier because of different cultures, different languages — which, they speak English, and very good, but there's that communication barrier a little bit. He's, what, 24-0 doing it the way he's done it? I mean, a guy who's had that much success doing things, sometimes it's like, ‘Man, what am I going to be able to tell them?'
But immediately — I mean, if they have a question, they ask me. If someone asks them about something, they look at me and wants me to answer. Super easy. They talk to me, texts me, calls me. If I'm not around, he's texting and calling me constantly, saying this is what's going on or asking what's next. So he's been super coachable and super in-tune to the process.
SA: Seemingly out of nowhere, all of a sudden, today he's talking about featherweight. Is this real or is they messing with everyone?
TM: Well, they mean it. This cut's going really well. Again, I'm not trying to tempt the MMA gods here, but the cut's going really well. And when a guy sees that the cut's going really well, and you see big possible fights at 145, you think, ‘Well, are there things I could start doing two months sooner and be 10 pounds lighter to make the cut easier?' You start looking, ‘Are there things I could do?'
So I think he's seeing this weight cut's going better and seeing maybe if they even start sooner, it would be easier. But no, I think they mean it.
SA: In your professional opinion, do you think they could cut down that way in a healthy manner?
TM: I think their body will do it. That being said, I think they would need to have plenty of time. They would need to have the most integrity he's ever had in their life. He's going to have to be on their game way ahead of time. It might be worth it, it might not. Some guys, just because you can make a weight doesn't mean you should.
Look at Robert Whittaker. They can make 170, but obviously they shouldn't have. He's better at 185. There's a lot of that. So I think they can, it's just, I would like to see where he's at a couple months after this fight, what he's walking at. I can generally tell you there if a guy's ballooned up so much weight after one fight, it's just not reasonable.
With Halo 2: Anniversary launching as part of Halo: The Master Chief Collection on the Xbox One and attending the reveal of Halo 5, it's been a Halo-filled week for me.
This got me thinking about Halo 2 and how much it contributed to advancing the first-person shooter genre, despite many people's claims that the game is overrated (it isn't, not even a little bit). After going hands-on with both the remade version of Halo 2's multiplayer and the standard version of the game, one thing is for sure – it's aged exceedingly well.
Unfortunately the same can't be said about the original Halo's multiplayer, a game I was eagerly anticipating revisiting in The Master Chief Collection. Halo: Combat Evolved just isn't as much fun as it was back in 2001.
It's still the same game, faithfully recreated on the Xbox One, and even after all these years it surprisingly still looks great in high-definition. Unfortunately in terms of gameplay, Halo: CE feels sluggish, slow and just isn't that much fun.
As part of The Mastechief Collection though it's an interesting novelty, one that I'll probably check out occasionally (now that matchmaking is finally working). I waited 13 years for online Halo: Combat Evolved action, so I have to play it, right? (no Halo: CE on PC doesn't count)
Halo: CE also suffers from significant balancing issues I seem to have conveniently forgotten about. Why do other weapons even need to be in the game when most players just opt to use the pistol and three-shot people from across the map?
But back to Halo 2, the crown jewel of the Mastechief Collection and the reason I finally convinced my parents to upgrade our internet from dial-up back in 2004, all so I could four-shot “noobs” on Xbox Live.
Halo 2 created matchmaking
What some people might not realize is Halo 2 actually created matchmaking as we now know it. Before Halo 2 online multiplayer gaming, especially on consoles, suffered from a significant learning curve. Players were forced to manually navigate servers and often ended up playing against opponents significantly better than themselves.
Matchmaking assigned each player a skill-based rank, something that's disappeared from first-person shooters like Call of Duty over the last few years. Matchmaking also gave players something to work towards – that little number beside your name. Before the first update in to Halo 2's multiplayer being a level above 30 really meant something.
In most modern first-person shooters rankings are based solely on how long you've played the game, not on how many matches you've lost or on your performance. Rankings in first-person shooters today mean nothing and this wasn't the case in Halo 2. Also, in most modern first-person shooters players are dropped into games with players who are significantly better than they are and in some cases even halfway through a match. In Halo 2 each game started with even teams and at the same time.
Sure, this meant matchmaking took a little longer, but it also made the experience more fun (this feature is something The Master Chief Collection thankfully emulates).
With the help of a close high school friend I managed to make it to the post-first update rank of 44 in Team Doubles (a gametype where it's two vs. two) and somewhere in the low 40's while playing rumble pit (a free-for-all gametype).
Balance was key to Halo 2's success
Halo 2 built on Halo: CE's foundation of simplicity and every encounter amounted to a first-person rock paper scissors match of who had the better weapon, the faster reflexes and the ability to gain the upper hand in a firefight.
For the most part the Battle Rifle was a great all-around weapon but the SMG-Pistol dual-wielding combo also packed a decent punch. Then there was the Sniper, the dreaded energy sword, the noob combo-enabling plasma pistol and many more. Each weapon had its own strengths and weaknesses and took hours to truly master, especially when you throw dual-wielding into the mix.
Matches were a matter of territory, tactics and weapon control. There weren't power-ups, jet packs or perks. Just two teams of four all starting with the same abilities, weapons strewn across a map and an all out battle supremacy and weapon control.
Of course things weren't perfect though. The game's balance was often upset by bridging, standbying (pressing the sleep button on your modem to interrupt the game), swipe sniping and the dreaded BXR glitch (some fans love this exploit), but for the most part, Halo 2 remains one of the most balanced first-person shooters I've ever played.
The cheating situation got so bad in Halo 2 at one point that up to five matches would go by before my friends and I were paired with a legitimate team of opponents who weren't cheating. Eventually Bungie cracked down on most culprits though.
Multiplayer maps were memorable
Halo 3, Halo: Reach and even Halo 4, each had a number of memorable multiplayer maps, but nothing compares to the superb level design of Halo 2's multiplayer arenas. Whether it was Lockout, Ascension or the narrow corridors of an inventive map like Turf, even to this day I still marvel at how great Halo 2's map design is (and I promise that isn't just the nostalgia talking).
The remade versions of Lockout (called Lockdown in anniversary), Zanzibar (Stonetown in anniversary) and Sanctuary (Shrine in anniversary), are among the best remakes in Halo 2: Anniversary, retaining the awesome elements of each multiplayer arena, but also adding an extra sheen of 2014 polish to Halo 2's balanced gameplay.
Even the somewhat secret hiding places still remain in Halo 2: Anniversary like getting above the sniper town in Lockout and jumping across massive gaps to save precious seconds.
Introducing a new generation to Halo 2
Sometimes I wonder where the many random online Halo 2 players I ran into and forged digital friendships with are today. Where is Icedragon44 now that I haven't played a game with them since 2006? Probably not playing Halo 2 anymore.
Regardless, I like to think that I might run into a few Gamertags I remember from back in the day.
Hopefully the revival of Halo 2 in The Master Chief Collection marks a change in the first-person shooter genre, one that affects the upcoming Halo 5: Guardians in a positive way. Franchises need to evolve and this is important to stay relevant, but there are certain gameplay elements that make Halo feel like Halo. Recent entries in the Halo franchise, at least when it comes to multiplayer, seem to have lost their way.
The short period of time I spent with Halo 5: Guardians earlier this week seems to indicate 343 Industries is committed to striking a balance between maintaining what makes Halo so special, but also adding enough new features to ensure the game doesn't feel dated.

Embed Sen. McCain Pressed on Vets Asking Him to Renounce Trump 3:53 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog
A frustrated John McCain tried to dismiss any and all Donald Trump questions during a roundtable discussion on Thursday. But their efforts quickly fell flat.
Here's a sample of the exchange the Arizona senator had with reporters:
Q: Are you more confident now in Mr. Trump's presidential—
MCCAIN: See what I said? What did I tell you? ... Thank you very much. Do you have a question about veterans? Do you have a question about veterans?
Q: —now that they have a new team in place?MCCAIN: Do you have a question about veterans? That was my question for you, because this is a veterans event.
McCain avoided saying Donald Trump's name at a national security roundtable event in Phoenix, Arizona, but could not evade a bevy of Trump related questions, including one about a group of veterans poised to deliver 100,000 signatures to their office asking them to denounce Trump.
“My reaction is that I'm asking them to renounce Hillary Clinton, who lied to the family, the families of the brave Americans who were killed in Benghazi...I'm asking them to renounce Hillary Clinton, who has presided over as Secretary of State and part of the Obama administration of the disastrous consequences of Obama's leadership and their service as Secretary of State, which has been a disaster,” they said.
McCain has said they have “strong disagreements” with Trump but that they support the Republican party nominee. The senator is in the middle of a hard fought re-election fight where they view on the presidential race have become a top issue.
The presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan will meet in Vienna early next week for talks that will be co-hosted by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and their Russian and French counterparts, the U.S. State Department said on Friday.
State Department spokesperson John Kirby confirmed the meeting in a statement that detailed Kerry's travel schedule for the next few days.
“Secretary Kerry will travel to Vienna, Austria, May 16-17 … Together with Russia and France, the United States will also co-host a meeting on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict with Armenian President [Serzh] Sarkisian and Azerbaijani President [Ilham] Aliyev,” Kirby said.
Plans for the Armenian-Armenian summit in Vienna were first announced by senior Russian diplomats on Thursday. They said it will be primarily aimed at bolstering the ceasefire regime along the Karabakh “line of contact” following last month's heavy fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces deployed there.
Sarkisian's and Aliyev's offices did not confirm the upcoming meeting as of Friday evening, however.
“We report on the visits and meetings of the president of the republic in a proper manner and in due course,” Sarkisian's press secretary, Vladimir Hakobian, told RFE/RL's Armenian service (Azatutyun.am). They declined to comment further.
The Vienna meeting most probably topped the agenda of Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian's talks with France's Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault and State Secretary for European Affairs Harlem Desir held in Paris on Thursday and Friday respectively. Ayrault, Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will be present at the Aliyev-Sarkisian talks.
According to the Armenian Foreign Ministry, Ayrault and Nalbandian agreed on the need to introduce a mechanism for international investigations of truce violations and deploy more OSCE monitors in the conflict zone.
Meanwhile, after several days of relative calm on the Karabakh frontlines the warring sides accused each other of opening intensive mortar fire there on Friday evening. The Karabakh Armenian army said Azerbaijani forces fired about 120 mortar rounds on its positions in Karabakh's northeast.
Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry, for its part, said the Armenian side shelled an Azerbaijani village located several kilometers northeast of Karabakh. It said its frontline troops are carrying out “retaliatory strikes on enemy positions.”
The ministry said earlier in the day that one Azerbaijani soldier was killed at an unspecified section of “the line of contact” on Thursday. The Karabakh Defense Army reported a combat death within its ranks late on Wednesday.
The ceasefire seemed to be largely holding when an RFE/RL correspondent visited Armenian positions southeast of Karabakh on Friday morning. “There are few gunshots right now,” one of the soldiers deployed there said. “When the situation gets a bit more tense we act so that they know that our guys stand firm here.”
“We don't leave unanswered any action against us,” another soldier told RFE/RL's Armenian service (Azatutyun.am).
A couple weeks back, fellow LWOS writer Chris Pudsey brought us a nice two part pieces on keeper league players to target for the future. As we draw towards the end of the fantasy regular season, it's important to plan for the future in our keeper leagues. Today we'll go over a few things to keep in mind when strategizing for these types of fantasy hockey leagues.
Keeper Leagues vs Dynasty Leagues
If you don't know the difference, keeper leagues are leagues where you only hold onto a set amount of players per season. For most keeper leagues this would only be 2-5 players. Dynasty leagues generally you're keeping your entire lineup or at least your entire starting roster and only drafting bench or rookies the following season.
Make sure you're aware of how many keepers the league plans on for the next season and don't assume it's going to be the same as this year. Often times the number of keepers changes if a league manager wants to create more parity or add more owners to increase the prize pot. Talk to your league manager about these things now so you're able to plan accordingly.
If you're a league manager thinking about changing things up for next season, start the discussion now! Don't wait until the offseason to work these things out. Keeper and Dynasty owners want to have a strategy worked out as soon as possible, and it's easier to get feedback now while everyone is still checking their team and league pages regularly.
Retooling
If you're already out of the running for the playoffs, or know you're not catching the top of the roto standings, it's time to revamp your lineup heading into the offseason.
The most obvious moves to make are to drop the deadweight from this season and pick up players who might make an impact next season. The free agent IR list is a great place to find guys for next season. For example, Mathieu Perreault is owned in less than 8% of ESPN leagues right now because he's hurt. Perreault was having a terrific year and plays on a decent team. He's of no use right now for fantasy players, but if you're out of contention you don't care about the now, you care about the future and he's someone who can definitely help a dynasty team next year.
If you're on the fence about a veteran who's having a career year, but never shown as much potential before, (i.e. Derick Brassard) perhaps trade them to a contender now, while their value is high. Get back a younger player of similar worth, or someone you think will break out next season, instead of keeping a player who potentially could regress to their career average.
Even if you're a contender this season, it's not too early to think about next season and what you can do to improve. You may not want to break up your team right now if you're playing well, but if you can make a move with another team to get a younger player of similar worth to a current rostered player, it can help in the long term.
Draft Picks
Owners who are already out of the playoff picture should be looking to stockpile as many picks as possible, while trading away guys they won't be keeping. Even if you're not sure you'll have five good keepers in a five keeper league, trade for lower draft picks and use those draft picks to trade for better draft picks. Being proactive is a key to building a team!
If you're a contender this season, it's often worth trading picks now to get an edge in playoffs while your team is good. You might be thinking about your future and worrying that trading draft picks could cost you down the line, especially if you don't win this year. However, if you're a real contender, and in a keeper league that holds onto four or more players each season, you probably have six or seven guys this year who will be potential keepers next year. This provides you with the opportunity to trade your 1st or 2nd round draft picks now. Why? Because come next preseason you'll be able to trade those players you can't keep for another draft pick. The rich can keep getting richer if they work their draft picks efficiently.
In a dynasty league, the same type of strategies can be applied, but it's a big tougher with less draft picks to choose from. Also, this season will be interested in dynasty leagues because of Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel likely going 1st and 2nd in drafts. This should give you a head start on your draft strategy though. Once your team's final seasons standings are determined you'll have a good idea what the first two owners are doing and can plan accordingly. Start working on that owner that gets the third pick as soon as you can!
If you don't already know, Samsung is bringing back the Galaxy Note 7. Dubbed “FE”, which stands for “Fan Edition”, Samsung is reviving the Note 7, which was recalled by the company and ultimately discontinued, back in October 2016. The Galaxy Note 7 was one of the best smartphones of its time, if not the best. However, it got discontinued by Samsung because of some incidents, which were caused by a Note 7 exploding/catching fire.
It looks like Samsung has fixed the Note 7 now and they are going to release it back into the market again. According to Korean carrier called LG U+, the Samsung Galaxy Note FE will launch on July 7, 2017. The release date was revealed through a post by official LG U+ Facebook page. However, the post was taken down shortly after.
Here's the picture that was attached with the post:
As you can see above, according to LG U+, the Samsung Galaxy Note FE will launch on 7/7/2017. The photo also states that the Note FE will be available for preorder on July 6, 2017. It also states that the phone is available in limited quantity.

Dwyane Wade is one of the greatest players of their generation, the greatest Miami Heatian ever and a sure-thing, no-questions-asked Hall of Famer. He's also 34 years old.
Wade has always been extra crafty on both ends, but what made them a star fresh out of Marquette was their incredible athleticism. That athleticism is waning. It's not gone, but it's leaking out into history and not coming back. Father Time is undefeated. Wade is fighting valiantly, but he's much closer to the end of their illustrious career than the beginning.
They were not a priority for the Miami Heat this offseason. That much is obvious: the Heat went hard to keep Hassan Whiteside in the wee hours of July 1. Whiteside is essentially a 27-year-old with 1.5 good NBA seasons under their belt. The Heat then spent the opening weekend of free agency chasing Kevin Durant.
Dwyane Wade was not a priority. This argument is strengthened if you believe those reports that Heat puppetmaster Pat Riley lowballed Wade with a $10 million annual offer. (Yes, $10 million a year in a league where Timofey Mozgov makes $16 million and Solomon Hill makes $12 million.)

There are two ways to look at Pat Riley's decision to put Wade on a back burner this summer. The worm everyone seems to be eating in the immediate aftermath says that Riley tried to call Wade's bluff and never expected the superstar to leave for Chicago, Milwaukee or wherever. That after dress rehearsals in 2010, 2014 and 2015, in which Wade stayed in Miami at discount rates, Riley stopped believing Wade was prepared to ever actually leave the city that adored them and adorned them with superstardom and three titles. This reading of the situation shows Riley to be just a bit bumbling and Wade to be the hero fed up with being taken for granted.
An alternate reading would suggest that by failing to prioritize their pricey 34-year-old star, Riley knew exactly what they were doing.
It would suggest that Riley knew their franchise's future depended on gathering as much flexibility as possible in for the 2017 offseason, and that locking up the aging Wade would snuff that out. It would suggest that Whiteside is young enough and holds enough potential for improvement that they could absolutely be a part of the next great Miami Heat roster. Whereas the slowing, but increasingly-expensive Wade probably couldn't be without a free-agent coup. A coup impossible with Wade soaking up $25 million of salary space in 2017-18.
Do we have any clues as to which reading is more accurate? Wade's decision to leave could really point to either. The issue here is the Heat's motivations for putting Wade on the back burner this summer. Pat Riley texted a statement of sorts to Dan Le Batard (who understands the mechanics of this ego stew better than anyone). Here it is.
"SADDDDDDD!!!! SO saddddddd! I will never forget the sixth game in Dallas in 2006. DW rebounded the ball, and threw it to the heavens and the Heat universe was perfect for that moment. Our first world championship. Our universe is not perfect today. It will be fraught with anger, judgment, blame instead of THANK YOU!!! Ten years ago. Ten years older. Ten years wiser. Ten years changed. All of us. Dwyane had a choice, and they made it. They went home. Bad, bad summer for us. But there will be another 10 years, and it will be someone or something else in 2026. Move on with no blood or tears. Just thanks. I truly loved Dwyane, but families grow, change and get on with another life. They will always be a part of us. ALWAYS! And no more bruises and enough fighting. Let's just fly above it if we can and never forget. I feel their pain and pride for what pushed them over the ledge. Been there. Forever, for always, your coach I will be. FOREVER!"
No number of ds in the word "sad" or exclamation marks can conceal the truth of this reaction: Pat Riley knew this was going to happen. Riley is trying to sell the "we screwed up" angle here in talking about Miami's "bad, bad summer" and Wade's "pain and pride." I'm not buying it. Pat Riley doesn't get caught flat-footed.
And there are clues here that Riley had already internalized the endgame and prepared for its aftermath. Move on with no blood or tears. Families grow, change and get on with another life. It will be someone or something else in 2026. In the context of a passionate, heat-of-the-moment reaction to the greatest player in franchise history bolting, these sentiments belie surprise.
Here's one more clue from a different source.
While you're watching Kelly Ripa, one more nugget: Pat Riley never called Dwyane Wade during the entire process. — Ethan J. Skolnick (@EthanJSkolnick) July 7, 2016
Funny way to act for a franchise who boasts of its loyalty. This was Pat Riley's endgame all along: string Wade along until they leaf.
Why? That's easy to answer. You saw the Lakers over the past three seasons, right? There's no upside in hosting an extended retirement party in which your fading star also demands to make the highest salary and maintain a huge role. Wade isn't Kobe, but he's not Tim Duncan, either. Duncan took repeated paycuts and a permanent backseat. Kobe did the opposite: raises and as prominent a role as possible. Wade is happy to defer to Goran Dragic for stretches and never asked for $30 million, but he's not going along with getting benched regularly and making $10 million. Obviously.
That's only part of the answer. The rest of it is this: 2017.
Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Gordon Hayward, Serge Ibaka -- all of those guys are likely to be unrestricted free agents in 2017. Curry is unlikely to leave Golden State, and CP3 doesn't exactly fit Miami's situation given the commitment to Dragic and age concerns. But Westbrook, Griffin, Hayward: these are huge targets for Riley. And with Wade heading to Chicago, Miami could in theory add two of them ... if Chris Bosh is forced to medically retire, which may be where the Heat are pushing this complicated, sad story.
Imagine adding Griffin and Hayward to a roster with Justise Winslow, Whiteside and Dragic. Or Westbrook and Griffin, trading Dragic and adding J.J. Redick in free agency. Every plot like this in the NBA is a die roll, but Pat Riley tends to do pretty well at the craps table.
Look at 2015-16 as the new 2009-10 for Miami: a season of waiting. Miami wasn't in position to give Durant a better situation than the Warriors or Thunder could, not with Wade uncommitted and, again, 34 years old. But with Wade gone and the cap space there, the free agents of 2017 could see Miami as an alluring option.
This could all be for naught if the Heat decide to match the Nets' Tyler Johnson offer sheet (four years, $50 million) or ink a high-dollar free agent still on the table to a multi-year deal. We'll see. But with the single exception of LeBron's flight in 2014, Pat Riley have never been known as a man who is caught off guard. For 29 NBA teams, you'd agree that in this situation the GM's bluff got called.
Not the Miami Heat. Not Pat Riley. There's always something up their sleeve.

A waiter at a bar in Austria, which controversially banned asylum seekers after some of them sexually harassed the female clients there, is pressing charges after migrants sexually assaulted them on New Year's Eve, they told Sputnik.
Steffi G, a 19 year old waiter at Charly's Bar in the Austrian town of Bad Ischl, told Sputnik German that they are pressing charges after migrants sexually assaulted them on New Year's Eve.
Charly's Bar attracted attention earlier this month when it banned asylum seekers from entering its premises because some had attacked staff and patrons.
Owner Karin Siebrecht-Janisch inspired a heated reaction on social networks when they posted that "we are now again asylum seeker free," after some committed attacks on women in their bar on New Year's Eve.
"Asylum seekers began visiting my bar as guests in November, and there were many who, more and more, harassed my female guests. They groped, grabbed, they stared, followed them to the toilet or outside the front door," Siebrecht-Janisch explained the ban.
Why did Charly's owner ban #refugees from their bar? "Many of them more and more often bothered my female guests — touched… Posted by Sputnik on Thursday, 14 January 2016
On New Year's Eve, waiter Steffi G alleges they were sexually harassed by five men, who touched their breasts and bottom, and has now officially complained to police.
Security guard Peter G, who was working in the bar that night, told Sputnik that unfortunately the attack was not an isolated incident.
"Everyone is focused on New Year's Eve in Charly's, but such incidents happened here before. Fighting, groping of staff and guests. On New Year's Eve drinks were just taken from guests, they would take them from the table without asking and pour it out for themselves," Peter said.
After Steffi G informed the police about the assault they were taken to the Altenheim Sarsteinerstiftung asylum reception center, where 80 asylum seekers are housed. When they were there, they felt their complaint was not taken seriously, until they produced a photo of the men who assaulted them
"Luckily I had a photo on my mobile phone," Steffi told Sputnik.
"And there were the five from New Year's Eve. Earlier I hadn't been able to identify their faces, unfortunately. The supervisor had laughed and thought then that nothing would come out of it."
"When I showed them the photo they were embarrassed that five refugees from their establishment were in it."

Steffi G said that the bar was used to having foreign guests, but that recent newcomers are different to those who came before.
"We have a lot of foreigners in our bar – Turks, Albanians, all sorts. And we are not in any way xenophobic. It's not about that. I'm not saying that all asylum seekers are like that."
"It's just about the people in question. These asylum seekers soon started coming often, and from the beginning behaved badly and drew attention. It began with 'I love you,' and handholding. But then they started grabbing girls' butts."
"I hope that those five individuals admit what they did and for example get a curfew. These five need to see that in Austria they can't just do whatever they want," said Steffi, who has spoken to other women assaulted the same night and urged them to come forward and report assaults.
"I am not xenophobic, nor racist. But I have been attacked personally, that's why I have made a complaint."
Bar owner Karin Siebrecht-Janisch said that not only has Steffi G had to endure sexual harassment, they have also been attacked for speaking out over the attacks.
"My waiter had their tire slashed. They went to the garage and they said to them no, you didn't just run over something, someone definitely put a knife or screwdriver into the tire."
Fantastic Mr. Fox & Where the Wild Things Are Character Posters
Both of these are easily in my top five most anticipated films left this year and both studios just bombarded us with a ton of print art for both films featuring all the characters. Don't mistake these films for kids movies either, suitable for children for sure, but just for kids, not at all. Both are being directed by two of the finest autuers (Spike Jonze and Wes Anderson) of the last decade and film fans everywhere should be really excited. Plus both use old school techiniques to bring their films to life from puppetry to stop motion animation, oh and they are also both adaptations of a pari of the most beloved children's novels of all-time. I can't wait…

China's volatile shares have affected millions of individuals - the shop owners, pensioners and other small traders, who make up 80% of China's investors. How have China's stock exchanges come to be dominated by "traders in pyjamas"?
When my Aunt Jin retired from their sedentary office job at the age of 55 several years ago, they spent some time wondering what to do with their golden years. They started by going dancing with their old friends from work but then they moved away from their old apartment and gradually that hobby fizzled out.
Thankfully my outgoing aunt never keeps still for very long - she's always got a new interest bubbling away.
Shortly after hanging up their dancing shoes they found a new pastime. They started watching various TV talk shows that teach old-timers how to become rich.
'Self-made billionaires'
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Many retirees have been keen to grow their savings by investing in the stock market
You can see the attraction. These shows are usually fronted by pundits dressed as sophisticated self-made billionaires - a bit like a TV version of the book Rich Dad, Poor Dad.
It all started in 2009 when China was seeing a massive stock market boom. Every time I visited my aunt, as I chatted away I'd see them move closer and closer to their TV screen - sometimes they would just interrupt me so they could examine every single word emerging from the lips of the latest screen icon purporting to be the Chinese Warren Buffett.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Brokerage houses - places to drink, socialise and make money
Watching this on TV was not enough though. Soon after my aunt upgraded their desktop computer and bought new software, and I was called in to help with the installation.
The software looked a bit like a Bloomberg investors' terminal with charts and quotes and numbers - all looking very smart. Oh, and it also has a smart name: Big Wisdom.
Bedroom or stock exchange?
There are lots of products claiming to be the most influential equity investment product. Most can be used on different platforms and - as a result - Auntie Jin also has an app installed on their mobile phone.
So now, with TV pundits and a Big Wisdom stock tracker as well as a mobile phone app, they can track stocks and make financial decisions with a tap of their fingertips.
When my uncle comes back home every evening, their bedroom looks more like a stock exchange than a place of rest.
Image copyright AP Image caption With apps and software, you can carry the stock exchange around in your pocket
Suddenly I felt Auntie Jin had found a brand new post-retirement career: as a professional trader in pyjamas.
She's not alone. In fact, there are millions of Auntie Jins. According to some statistics, there are about 90 million individual brokerage accounts in China, greater than the entire population of the UK.
Making friends and money
Last year I went to a brokerage house in Shanghai, the sort of stock exchange shop floor. All around me were people of a certain age, all busily trying to fill the family coffers.
They arrive in the mornings with their flasks of green tea and spend the entire day watching the red and green flashing lights and making bold decisions about their future. It's also a venue for socialising: people are making friends and, of course, passing on tips of the trade.
This isn't just an interesting phenomenon - it does have implications on the market.
Large numbers of small traders can move in unpredictable ways, which can add to the swings we've seen in the last week. Experts call it "herd behaviour".
Image copyright Reuters Image caption All eyes on the stock exchange board - where red means the price has gone up
I spoke to my aunt the other day and as you might imagine the ups and downs of the stock market have been mirrored in their mood as well.
They do sometimes talk to me about their investments - they think as a journalist I have a wider view about what really is going on with China's economy and the global market.
The truth is I don't think anyone can predict where the market will go next. The government argues the recent rally in prices was due to the success of their reforms.
But there's no saying that the markets won't keep fluctuating. In fact, it seems even the regulators were caught off guard by the recent roller-coaster ride.
So I told Auntie Jin on the phone the other day to be cautious.
But to be honest I think they were only half listening - I think the other ear was turned towards the TV and I suspect their fingers were busy flicking through their apps, looking for the next pot of gold.

While they may not be as powerful as U.S. political action committees, there's a new form of campaign fundraising in Canada that works on the same keeping-up-with-the-Joneses rationale as the American campaign behemoths.
The newest one, HarperPAC, has been launched in response to the left-wing group Engage Canada.
“The inspiration for a lot of this came from the fact that the left has been doing this provincially and now federally and we had to respond,” Stephen Taylor, HarperPAC's spokesperson, told iPolitics.
The Conservative strategist who single-handedly created the #BoycottTims social media campaign has launched a new project, this one meant to influence a much larger outcome.
While Engage Canada may have a similar mandate, Taylor's political action committee is the first to include PAC in its title.
Engage Canada calls itself a non-partisan grassroots organization, despite being run by former Liberal and NDP strategists, and its intent, which is to make the Conservative party “unelectable.”
Political Action Committees are popular fundraising mechanisms in the U.S. and now, thanks to Taylor, that style has entered Canadian politics. In the U.S., PACS are used to pool campaign contributions from donations to fund campaigns for candidates, or to rail against opponents without being legally linked directly to a candidate.
The U.S. Federal Election Commission defines a PAC as “a committee that makes contributions to other federal political committees. Independent-expenditure-only political committees (sometimes called “super PACs”) may accept unlimited contributions, including from corporations and labor organizations.”
Late-night comedian Stephen Colbert famously protested the much-maligned U.S. campaign finance bodies in 2012 by setting up their own PAC.
In Canada there are few, if any at all, legal restrictions on where a non-profit corporation without charitable status can raise its funds. Non-profit corporations in Canada do not have to open their books to anyone the way that political parties are obliged to. While there are reporting requirements for groups that spend money to advance a viewpoint during an election, there is no restriction on how much third party groups spend outside the election writ period and no obligation to reveal how much money is spent or where it goes.
In a press release, Taylor describes HarperPAC as “a group that aims to defend the interests of everyday Canadians against the tide of cash from professional leftist agitators and big union bosses that has been earmarked to take down the Conservative government.
“Unions in Canada have amassed a war chest of millions and plan to relentlessly attack Stephen Harper's Conservative government. We are leveling the playing field.”
“Justin Trudeau represents dangerous and unpredictable change, while Thomas Mulcair's NDP is eager to implement the same disastrous economic formula that ruined provinces for whole generations,” Taylor says in the release.
According to Taylor's release, “HarperPAC will raise money from concerned Canadians from every corner of the country to push back against such attacks. The group is purchasing advertising to inform Canadians of the important choices they face on election day in October.”
HarperPAC's site shows the group's mandate, along with a quote from Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and an opportunity to add your email to a list to “fight back.”
Also on the site, are photos and short bios of eight “advisory council” members, which consist of former chiefs of staff, former senior staff in the Harper government, and also the former Attorney General of Alberta.
Shortly after the site launched, Taylor tweeted a link to the group's very first Trudeau attack ad.
This isn't the first private group to launch a campaign aimed at fundraising in support of the Conservative government. In March, iPolitics reported that the Conservative Party of Canada's former executive director, Dan Hilton, set up a new organization called Conservative Voice to raise money and promote the government, while bypassing the legal limits on fundraising faced by political parties.
In an interview with iPolitics' Elizabeth Thompson in March, Hilton said Conservative Voice is “simply a group of people who are trying to level the playing field and make sure that the right's perspective is adequately represented in papers and the media.”
There will always be great interest and great debate about the National Baseball Hall of Fame, to the point where we now even have exit polling with the voters. There is always the constant drumbeat about steroids and moralizing, and especially equivalencies: Wait, if that guy is in, why isn't my guy in? It isn't like this with the other sports and never will be. It is all about the force and pull of baseball history, and the way the record book has always connected generations, even now that steroids guys have spilled juice all over the books.
Barry Bonds isn't in yet. Neither is Roger Clemens. There is clear proof that both of them used performance-enhancing drugs, even if the government never made a lasting case against either one of them. Both will eventually get in. There was no proof on Mike Piazza, who finally got in last time, the way there was never any proof on Jeff Bagwell, who will probably get in this time.
There is Tim Raines, who waited their turn, and is now expected to see their long wait finally end. Jack Morris, one of the best big-game pitchers, waited their turn and never made it, even if they came close at the end of their time on the ballot.
This is how it goes with the writers given the charge of making their determination about Cooperstown. It shouldn't just be writers, of course. The idea that Vin Scully never got a Hall of Fame vote and Bob Costas hasn't ever got a Hall of Fame vote is patently ridiculous. That's not even open to debate.
Here is something else that shouldn't be: Mike Mussina, of the Orioles and the Yankees, one of the great righthanded pitchers in baseball history, should not only be in the Hall of Fame, they should be there already.
Mussina came along in 1991, and even made 12 starts for the Orioles their rookie year. After that? Look it up. If people still went to the Baseball Encyclopedia to look these things up, the way they once did, their page would give off a beam of light. High up on their resume is that they did what they did in the meat grinder of the American League East, and in the middle of the steroids era.
They won 270 games against 153 losses across 18 seasons. When they left the Orioles, the Yankees gave them a six-year contract worth around $89 million and when that contract ended, the Yankees still thought enough of Mussina that they gave them two more years on top of that. You know baseball history is littered with dumb long-term contracts for starters. You see what a guy like CC Sabathia looks like now at the end of their own longterm deal with the Yankees. Go back and see how many starters like Mussina got deals longer than five years and then at the end of them got invited to stay.
But it is much more than that with Mussina, who finished in the top six in voting for the American League Cy Young Award nine times and in the top five six times. Besides is rookie year, they had just one losing record in a season. In their time as a starter, in both Baltimore and New York, only Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine and Randy Johnson won more games than they did. It is the same with innings pitched: Across the span of Mussina's career, only those three guys -- Maddux, Glavine, Johnson -- pitched more innings than they did.
All of this Mussina did in a quiet, dignified manner, also fielding their position well enough to win seven Gold Gloves. I know there are pitchers like Jim Kaat, who won more games than Mussina did (283) and also fielded their position like a champion and isn't in the Hall. Doesn't change the fact that Mussina should have punched their ticket to Cooperstown already.
Mussina could have stayed around and chased 300 wins, which would have made Cooperstown automatic. They did not. They elected to go out on top and go home to their family and live a life. In their last season with the Yankees, 2008, Mussina won 20 games and lost nine and had a 3.37 ERA and started 34 games. Starting with their second season, Mussina never made fewer than 24 starts.
This is part of what they said when they officially did announce their retirement, when they explained that they had long since made up their mind:
"I don't think there was ever a point where I looked around and said, 'You know what? I'm going to change my mind.' I just felt so good about the season, the way it was going, and enjoying it and not getting caught up in the bad times. It was like the last year of high school. You know it's going to end, and you just enjoy the ride."
So they never chased 300 wins. Just excellence. There was even the night in 2003, Game 7 of the American League Championship Series against the Red Sox, where they came out of the bullpen for the first time in their career because Joe Torre needed him, and pitched three scoreless innings. We all remember that Mariano Rivera pitched three innings later in that game for the Yankees, and said that if they had to, they were coming back out for the top of the 12th. Rivera had spent their career pitching out of the bullpen. Mussina was a starter. But they were great that night in relief -- if Mussina hadn't been, Aaron Boone never gets the chance to hit one of the most famous home runs in Yankee history in the bottom of the 11th.
When Mussina retired, Derek Jeter, who always got most of the big things right in baseball, said that all of Mussina's accomplishments "represent a Hall of Fame career." They were right about that.
For my mind, Mussina is a Hall of Famer the same as Curt Schilling is, despite the fact that Schilling is expected to go the wrong way this time because of some tweets and political views you are reluctant to poke with a stick. But even if Schilling were more virtuous in the minds of voters than the Justice League of America, they are not as worthy a candidate as Mussina.
They were not just a numbers hanger. Mussina was grace and excellence and consistency and a won-loss record that was finally 117 games over .500. They won 20 games in their last season the way Sandy Koufax did. There was once a guy named Henry Schmidt who won 20 games for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1930 and then retired. But, since 1920, the only other guys to walk after a 20-win season are Koufax and Mussina. Not bad company for Moose.
Eventually, they will be keeping company in the Hall of Fame with the best starting pitchers of all time. They should be doing it already.
An experiment on the International Space Station has successfully beamed high definition video back to Earth with a laser–a feat that could someday aid communication with astronauts and spacecraft traveling to distant planets.
The Optical Payload for Lasercomm Science completed a 175 megabit video transmission (which works out to a 22 MB video) to a ground station in California in 3.5 seconds. With equipment currently in use aboard the ISS, the same transfer would take more than 10 minutes, according to NASA.

OPALS makes use of a laser that locks onto a target as the ISS orbits over the Earth. During an interview in April, OPALS project manager Michael Kokorowski likened the feat to hitting a human hair with a laser pointer from 20 feet away while walking.
The laser can transfer 10 to 1,000 times more data than traditional radio communication. During last weeks test, the video was transferred multiple times during a 148-second connection. The team achieved a data transmission rate as high as 50 megabits per second. That's more than most people's home broadband speeds in the U.S.
“We–JPL, NASA, humans–are making science instruments that gather just an awfully large amount of data. Just a huge amount. And we can't possibly get it all back with radio communications right now,” Kokorowski said in April. “Really, what optical communication will do is make that pipe larger. It has the potential to make every mission just that much more useful because of the return.”
The video riffed on the “Hello world” computer program, which is often used to establish that a computer system or language works, with different clips containing the phrase.
For now, OPALS is just in a testing phase. But it is possible someday it could be used to provide internet to the entirety of the ISS, plus other spacecraft and distant planets.
“It's incredible to see this magnificent beam of light arriving from our tiny payload on the space station,” OPALS mission manager Matt Abrahamson said in a release. “We look forward to experimenting with OPALS over the coming months in hopes that our findings will lead to optical communications capabilities for future deep space exploration missions.”
After decades at the anchor desk for late news, WJZ anchor Denise Koch is leaving the late shift.
Starting the last week of April, Koch will no longer anchor the 11 p.m. news on the CBS-owned station. They will still be at the anchor desk for the 4:30 and 6 p.m. weekday newscasts as well as doing more reporting for the station.
In a note sent to their colleagues at WJZ tonight, Koch wrote:
“Just wanted to share a bit of news. Both of my girls are graduating from college next month. I am using this moment of economic relief to make a change. (No, I'm not retiring. Love my job.)
"Instead, the station is letting me finally, after more than 3 decades, actually drive home while it's still light out. I'm moving off the night shift and for the first time EVER working days. I'll see the sun rise and the sun set! I will still be anchoring the afternoon shows and this will also give me the opportunity to report. Those who've known me for a long while know my real love is working in the field. So, starting soon I'll actually see some of you for the first time in a long time! And....good-bye midnight drive home!
Koch, who has been a WJZ anchor for almost 30 years, was at their best during the coverage of the unrest following the death of Freddie Gray in 2015 and the trials of the police officers involved in Gray's death the last two years.
 They are at the head of the class when it comes to Baltimore TV anchors and set the standard during the Gray coverage for responsible, community-oriented anchor-desk discussion of what was happening in the streets and later at the courthouse.
The station has not yet announced who will replace them at 11 p.m.
Denver's Colorado Convention Center hosted two events on Tuesday that, in past years, would have seemed diametrically opposed. The larger event was the National Cannabis Industry Association's business summit and expo, and the smaller was a private fundraiser for presidential candidate Rand Paul.
Paul's closed-door event cost $2,700 to attend, and despite its curious venue choice, their campaign said it was a private fundraiser not officially affiliated with the expo. “Do we attract people there? Yes,” a Paul aide told The Washington Post. “People know Rand's position on medical marijuana. People know their position on banking.”
Paul believes the federal government shouldn't be conducting anti-marijuana activities in states that have legalized the drug, and they have said they would allow the marijuana industry to use the U.S. banking system (and, by extension, use traditional tax returns), which it is currently not allowed to do.
RELATED: Rand Paul Announces 2016 Presidential Run On Website
During the last presidential election in 2012, marijuana hadn't become quite the industry it is today, and so Paul is believed to be the first presidential candidate to use the industry as a source of funds. “I can't imagine Chris Christie would be coming here,” one expo attendee told The Post.

Som ung student ved Universitetet i Tromsø var jeg en av de unge håpefulle som ikke så poenget i at «examen philosophicum» var en obligatorisk del av studieløpet. Jeg hadde tross alt ingen spesiell interesse for filosofi, og jeg kunne ikke se hvordan Platon og Kant var relevante for mine drømmer om å bli musikkskribent i England. Dette resulterte blant annet i at filosofiprofessoren min, etter mitt første forsøk på å bestå muntlig eksamen, oppgitt spurte om jeg virkelig trodde at jeg skulle slippe unna med dette. Så mye for Sokrates' påstand om at uvitenhet er en dyd.
Det tok mange år før jeg forsto visdommen i det Sokrates faktisk mente, som var at sann innsikt ligger i å vite at man ikke vet alt. Jeg måtte, som mange andre, gjennom perioder hvor jeg kombinerte bastante overbevisninger med total uvitenhet, før jeg sakte og usikkert begynte å se verdien i nyanser. Jeg synes nå det er mer interessant å få mine egne overbevisninger utfordret enn bekreftet, selv om det kan være ubehagelig å innse at man står på ideologisk skjelvende grunn. Om dette skyldes modenhet eller ren kjedsomhet er jeg ærlig talt redd for å spekulere for mye på. Men hvis du først vil være en intellektuell nomade, som prøver å plukke opp gode ideer uansett hvor de stammer fra, vil du tidvis også føle deg ganske hjemløs.
En av de tingene jeg bevisst har prøvd å forandre på er min hang til å instinktivt avfeie ethvert forslag som kommer fra Fremskrittspartiet. Frp er (så vidt jeg vet) det eneste partiet som har tatt debatten om aktiv dødshjelp seriøst, og jeg er ikke et mindre selvopptatt menneske enn at jeg også vil ha billigere alkohol i Norge. Jeg synes ikke engang alt partiet sier i asyl- og innvandringsdebatten automatisk kan avskrives som reaksjonært fjas. For eksempel er deres mantra, om å hjelpe flyktningene der de er, i utgangspunktet godt, om det bare hadde et snev av oppriktighet over seg. Til tross for dette, så må jeg innrømme at vår første innvandrings- og integreringsminister vekker gamle uvaner i meg (selv ordet «integreringsminister» strekes under i Word når jeg skriver det, så selv et relativt primitivt dataprogram har sett gjennom denne fasaden).
Sylvi Listhaug ser ut til å kombinere en fortreffelig kombinasjon av moralsk inkompetanse og ekstrem selvtillit. Uttalelser om «godhetstyranniet» (en ordsammensetning på logisk nivå med «nytelsesdiktatur» og «himmelhelvete») og innvandreres «gullstoler» bekrefter bare at vi them står overfor en uhellig treenighet av karakterbrister. Hun har til og med rettferdiggjort sin motvilje mot å hjelpe syriske flyktninger med at Jesus ville gjort det samme. Det at regjeringen, samtidig med retur av asylsøkere til Russland, nå også vil gjøre det lettere å sende mindreårige asylsøkere til krigssoner og diktaturer, burde vekke ubehag i alle som ikke har latt all medmenneskelighet drukne i kynisme. Asylavdelingen til Utlendingsdirektoratet vil nå også åpne for at flere områder i Afghanistan blir vurdert som sikre, men understreker at dette ikke vil omfatte «områder hvor IS har etablert seg». Og det er jo ekstremt betryggende.
Det er nok av utfordringer og dilemmaer som oppstår i forbindelse med masseinnvandringen til Europa, og jeg skal ikke utgi meg for å sitte på noen løsninger. Åpenhet og moralsk forstand må uansett være gode utgangspunkter, og man kan for eksempel problematisere enkelte innvandrergruppers kvinnesyn uten å fornekte at også norske menn kan ha råtne holdninger. Jeg tror til og med den amerikanske professoren Valerie Hudson har et poeng når hun sier at en overvekt av mannlige migranter kan ødelegge likestilte samfunn. Jeg er en innbitt forsvarer av sekulære verdier, og alle former for religiøst inspirert intoleranse bør eksponeres og diskuteres mest mulig åpenlyst. Det må være mulig å kritisere Per Fugelli når han sier at Muhammed-karikaturer er en «rabiat» bruk av ytringsfriheten, og samtidig irettesette Hege Storhaug når hun kaller syriske flyktninger for IS-sympatisører. Det må finnes en middels grunn mellom slike tanketomme ytterpunkter.
Ifølge Wikipedia er ideologi «et helhetlig tankesett av politiske eller filosofiske teorier om hvordan samfunnet bør styres». Og hvis du er både skråsikker og bastant i din ideologi, så lider du mest sannsynlig av overmot, ungdommelighet eller et politisk verv. Du bør alltid la tvilen komme deg til gode. Så gjenstår det å se om jeg på noe tidspunkt vil begynne å tvile på min egen grunnleggende medmenneskelighet. Jeg håper bare aldri det går så langt at Sylvi Listhaug høres fornuftig ut.

Congressional Democrats introduced legislation on Tuesday to make it easier for older workers to win age discrimination lawsuits (a Supreme Court decision in June had made it harder by requiring that the worker show that age was the deciding factor in an employment decision).
Unemployment for older workers has climbed to record levels. Has age discrimination on the job become a bigger problem?
A Lose-Lose Situation
Teresa Ghilarducci, director of economic policy analysis at the New School for Social Research, is the author of “When I'm 64: The Plot Against Pensions and the Plan to Save Them.”
The bad news is that age discrimination is skyrocketing. According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission age discrimination claims were up 29 percent in 2008. This is almost double the increase in overall
discrimination complaints for race, sex, etc.
A hidden cause of the increase in age discrimination claims is the pension crisis. Discrimination on the basis of age takes place when older workers are laid off, or bypassed for promotion or a pay increase. Getting hired is a problem too. Unemployed workers between the ages of
55 and 64 have the toughest time finding new jobs; 30 percent of older men are out of work for almost 30 weeks compared to 25- to 34-year-olds who get work in 10 weeks. One reason is that health insurance can cost an employer twice as much for a worker over age 40. This is yet another good reason for health care reform.
The good news is that the increasing numbers of older workers may break down barriers and prejudice.
But asking a pension economist if it's a good thing that older people are working more is like asking a vegetarian about the falling price of beef. Eroding pensions — 401(k) assets in mutual funds declined by 40 percent last year — and a lousy economy explains why many older people are clinging to their jobs or returning to the labor market after retiring. A hidden cause of the increase in age discrimination claims is the pension crisis.
Read more… Everyone who wants to work should be able to and no one deserves to be judged by their age or any other factor that does not relate to their productivity. But forcing older people to work in order to cover their pension losses will have the unintended effect of also causing more age discrimination claims — a lose-lose situation.
Prejudice Is Flourishing
Peter Cappelli, the director of the Center for Human Resources at the Wharton School, is the author, with Bill Novelli, of a forthcoming book on managing older workers.
We can see evidence of discrimination in many different contexts from experiments where employers are presented with identical job applicants whose only difference is age to employee complaints brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
It has gotten worse in recent years especially with the end of lifetime employment. Seniority-based pay schedules that paid more to experienced workers led many employers to cut experienced workers — who happen to be older — as a way to save money fast.
In the past, the terms and conditions of employment for older workers were laid out in formal rules. No longer. The perception that older workers can't or won't change leads some employers to replace them with younger candidates as a means of changing the organization. Most distressingly and despite all research evidence pointing in the opposite direction, there is a common belief that older workers don't perform as well as their younger counterparts. That causes employers to pass over them in hiring and promotions and to target them for layoffs.
Prejudice against older workers may not be worse now, but the ability to exercise that prejudice in the form of age discrimination is more common. In the past, the terms and conditions of employment especially as they relate to older workers were laid out in formal rules: The most senior workers got the promotions, pay increased with years of service, and layoffs were targeted at the newest hired.
Those rules have gone away in most organizations, leaving managers with discretion over how pay, promotion, hiring, and job assignments are determined. With that discretion, prejudice that may have always been there can be made manifest.
Legislation May Harm Workers
Joanna Lahey, an assistant professor of public policy at Texas A&M University, specializes in the economics of work and aging.  They are on leave this year at RAND.
Age discrimination remains a significant workplace issue. From 1992 to 2008, 15.79 percent of cases brought to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or about 4,585 cases per year, were described as successful claims. While this number is small given the number of workers covered by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, many, if not most, instances of age discrimination are never litigated, and cases of hiring discrimination often go undetected.
If it is more difficult to fire an older worker than a younger worker, a firm will be less likely to want to hire older people. Most of those who do sue are white, male middle-managers who are likely to have lost a sizeable salary and pension. For the most part, other groups do not litigate because the costs of a lawsuit do not outweigh the potential benefits.
There is strong experimental evidence for age discrimination in hiring, at least for entry-level jobs. In 2002-2003, I performed a labor market experiment in Boston and St. Petersburg, Fla. in which I sent out thousands of resumes for fictitious entry-level female candidates and measured response rate based on date of high school graduation. Among this group, younger applicants, whose date of high school graduation indicated that they were less than 50 years old, were 40 percent more likely to be called back for an interview than were older applicants.
Read more… It is difficult to tell whether employment problems are worse for older workers than for other workers when times are bad. The number of discrimination lawsuits increases during times of high unemployment, but this finding by itself does not indicate an increased level of age discrimination. In times of higher unemployment, the opportunity cost to a lawsuit is lower than it is when times are good. From the employer's perspective, mass layoffs may seem like a good chance to remove a higher proportion of generally more expensive older workers without the worry of being sued. On the other hand, employers may be less likely to remove protected older workers because they still fear lawsuits. One thing we do know is that once an older worker loses a job, they or they are much less likely to find a new job than a younger worker is. Unfortunately, the effect of legislation prohibiting age discrimination is not clear-cut and may actually be part of the reason it is so difficult for older workers to find employment. If it is more difficult to fire an older worker than a younger worker, a firm will be less likely to want to hire older workers. Indeed, my research finds that in states where workers have longer time to bring a lawsuit claim, older men work fewer weeks per year, are less likely to be hired, and less likely to be fired than men in states where they do not have as much time. Not many people would suggest that we go back to a world prior to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, in which advertisements specify the specific ages of people they are willing to hire. However, legislation prohibiting discrimination is no panacea. The recent Supreme Court decision and the recent proposed congressional legislation could have both positive and negative effects on potential older workers.
More Expensive Workers
Alicia H. Munnell is the Peter F. Drucker professor of management sciences at Boston College's Carroll School of Management and director of the college's Center for Retirement Research.
Older workers today should be more attractive to employers than they were in the past. They are better educated, with no significant educational deficit relative to younger workers. Employment has shifted away from activities that require physical strength and stamina. And employer retirement income programs are no longer an escalator of compensation costs as workers age.
Keeping healthy older individuals in the labor force is best, but this may be a tough goal to achieve. Nevertheless, there is little indication thus far that the employment prospects of older workers have improved. A 2006 survey conducted by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College revealed that employers have mixed views of older workers. They think of them as knowledgeable about the company, at ease with customers, and reliable. But employers also worry about physical stamina of older workers, their ability to learn new things, and their commitment to continued employment.
This mixed view is reinforced by the economics. The productivity of older workers can be expected to at best stay level, but will likely turn down. The compensation of older workers at their career job will at best stay level, but probably rise. These patterns make the retention of older workers relatively unattractive. The hiring of older workers occurs only when they are willing to accept significantly lower rates of compensation than they had earned previously.
Keeping healthy older individuals in the labor force is best for them and for the economy. But given employer perceptions, this may be a tough goal to achieve.
Words That Harm
Robert M. McCann is an associate professor at the Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California
Ageist stereotypes are rife in society, and when placed in a workplace context, those generalizations often play out in unfair expectations about older workers by management and staff. Unfortunately, those views can also lead to discriminatory practices toward older workers.
The repercussions of age-laden communication and practices can be devastating to older employees, who may suffer declines in self-esteem and mental health. Such practices also hurt their employers, which may have to deal with declining productivity and age discrimination lawsuits.
Laid-off older workers, facing a grim job market, may have more incentive to take sue to recover lost wages or jobs than before. Language can play a major role in many age discrimination cases. Remarks like “we need young blood around here,” “let's make room for some M.B.A.s,” or “let's bring in the young guns” are commonly found in age discrimination cases, where they're seen as evidence of discriminatory motive.
Age discrimination probably has gotten worse in recent years. A variety of factors may account for the recent increase in age-bias claims among workers age 40 and above. Most notably, there is the possibility that laid-off older workers, facing a grim job market, may have more incentive to take legal action to recover their lost wages or jobs than before. On the other hand, it may be that companies are targeting older workers for layoffs because of their comparatively higher salaries, benefits, and medical costs.
It's important to note that there are some positive trends happening in older worker employment, (see the AARP Best Employers for Workers Over 50). But in general, today's older worker has many challenges to overcome.
Politics and Bias Cases
Mark A. Graber is a professor of law at the University of Maryland School of Law and a professor of government at the University of Maryland, College Park.
The Congressional effort to strengthen protections against age discrimination is not surprising. Two years ago, in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, the five conservative justices on the Roberts Court read the Civil Rights Act of 1964 very narrowly when denying the claim of a woman who alleged gender discrimination on the job. This year, Congress passed legislation to overturn the Ledbetter decision.
Two employment discrimination cases may be the first shots in what could be a protracted war. This June, five justices in Gross v. FBL Financial Services interpreted the provisions of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act as permitting employers to fire employees as long as age was not the only reason for termination. On Tuesday, Democrats began what is likely to be the successful effort to reverse that decision.
From one perspective, these decisions and subsequent congressional reversals may be ordinary events. Both the Ledbetter and Gross decisions interpreted federal statutes, so there is no constitutional problem when Congress corrects judicial interpretations of federal law. Quite frequently, judicial decisions interpreting statutes even invite Congress to hand down a different rule.
The St. Paul Police Department is requesting 230 Tasers to outfit the all of the department's officers with the electroshock weapon, Fox 9 News reports. The SPPD will purchase the Tasers with $210,000 collected from drug raids. The St. Paul City Council will have to approve the purchase.
The purchase is expected to arrive in St. Paul just in time for the Republican National Convention prompting media speculation that the weapons are being purchased specifically for the convention. When asked by Fox 9 News whether the police will use the weapon at the convention particularly against protesters, police spokester Tom Walsh said, "Our hope is that no one will have to use any degree of force. If it becomes necessary, will that be one of the tools available to them? I suppose that's safe to say."
NEWARK — Elected officials, advocates and the leader of Newark's largest police union all said Sunday they welcome the federal government's decision to place a monitor over New Jersey's largest police department.
News of the decision was first reported in The Sunday Star-Ledger. Citing multiple sources close to the decision, the newspaper reported that a years-long investigation into allegations of misconduct and abuse by Newark Police had resulted in the decision to appoint a federal watchdog.
West Ward Councilman Ronald Rice Jr., who had been calling for an outside agency to reform the city police department years before the federal government began it's 2011 probe, said they hope officers embrace any and all proposed reforms.
"I feel vindicated. I feel that is good for the Newark Police Department. This is not a witch hunt, this is not to beat up the police department," they said. "This is to make it better."
The Justice Department investigation began less than a year after the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union published a scathing 96-page petition that claimed the department could not police itself. Citing dozens of lawsuits and years of internal affairs statistics, the ACLU said the department routinely failed to address accusations of brutality and misconduct against its officers.
In 2008 and 2009, the department received 261 allegations that its officers used excessive force, arrested someone under false pretenses, conducted illegal searches and treated residents differently based on race or gender, according to the petition. Only one of those complaints resulted in disciplinary action against an officer.
James Stewart Jr., president of Newark's Fraternal Order of Police, said they are "looking forward" to the monitor's input. They said they hope the reforms go beyond the scope of the ACLU's allegations, adding that the department's emphasis on using arrests as a metric for officer success have seriously harmed the agency's rapport with the community.
"That mentality, the pressure to bring in numbers, leads our cops to frequently stop people for record checks, which often leads to arrests for open bench warrants. That is also what contributes to that divide that our community activists so often talk about," Stewart Jr. said in a statement. "They become afraid to approach the cop on the street out of fear of being arrested."
Udi Ofer, executive director of the state chapter of the ACLU, said any reforms must include the creation of a Civilian Complaint Review Board with the power to file subpoenas against officers. Former Mayor Cory Booker said such a board would be created earlier this year, but no action has been taken yet.
"In order to ensure that oversight of the Newark Police Department outlasts any one administration or any one federal monitor, any reforms must also include the creation of a strong and independent civilian complaint review board and an inspector general's office," Ofer said in a statement.
Some city leaders was less optimistic. South Ward Councilman Ras Baraka, one of four candidates in the May 2014 mayoral election, said they believe the department should be given a chance to reform itself before the monitor is appointed. Baraka said loss of local control has hurt other city agencies, like the Newark school system, which has remained under state control for several years.
"I understand that the police department needs some kind of overhaul, it needs some kind of cultural change," they said. "But I don't know if I totally agree that we should have a federal monitor."
Shavar Jeffries, another mayoral candidate and former assistant attorney general, said the need for a monitor highlights not only flaws in the police department, but shortcomings in city leadership as well.
"It really shows that we've had inadequate oversight at the local level," they said. "Between the mayor and the city council they should provide the oversight that allows our officers to be effective, and in doing so, not trample over our residents civil liberties."

Liverpool have endured a mixed start to their WSL1 campaign, with a win and a defeat from their two matches. They took part in the first fixture of the new winter schedule, winning against Everton thanks to goals from Natasha Harding and Niamh Charles, but their first designated home fixture – Liverpool's Select Security Stadium is also home to the Toffees – was against Reading last weekend and they fell to a 3-0 defeat. Beth England, who is on loan at the club from Chelsea, played in both matches but they are ineligible to face their parent club on Saturday.
VIEW FROM THE DRESSING ROOM
Katie Chapman (pictured top) was at the heart of a gritty Chelsea performance on Wednesday against Bayern. The skipper looks back on that night and ahead to another tricky match against Liverpool on Saturday.
‘We wanted to put on a great performance for the crowd,' they said of our 1-0 victory. ‘Our team spirit is brilliant, confidence is high, and I think that showed going into the game.
‘Now I'm looking forward to the match against Liverpool. It's another competition we want to do well in and it's important we put the Bayern Munich game aside and we just focus on Liverpool. It's going to be another tough game for us.
‘We've got a big squad and as you can see with the players who have been on the bench or in the stands, Emma has got plenty of choices to make. They can make changes for Saturday and that's the great thing about our squad.'
PREVIOUS MEETINGS
Chelsea have won each of our past five matches against Liverpool in the WSL1, three of which have come at home. The Reds were our last-ever opponents at our former Wheatsheaf Park home and at the time of our meeting at the end of May they topped the Spring Series standings, but Scott Rogers' side had no match for our attacking prowess. Flaherty gave us the perfect start with a glanced header after only two minutes, and a pair of quick-fire strikes on the stroke of half-time from Kirby and Ji secured the lead our dominance deserved. After the interval it was one-way traffic, as Mjelde, Karen Carney, Cuthbert and Spence all found the back of the net to ensure the perfect ending to our five-year stay at Wheatsheaf Park.
There were even more goals in the previous meeting between the sides at Staines, which finished 6-3 to Chelsea (highlights available below). Spence and Kirby were the heroes with two goals apiece in a topsy-turvy match, with the latter's first effort earning them the Ladies' Goal of the Season award.
Attorney General Eric Holder could soon be declared in contempt of Congress, if House Republicans have their way.
Led by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), who chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Republicans told The Los Angeles Times on Friday that they have been stonewalled by the Department of Justice in their probe of a law enforcement operation that saw U.S. firearms end up in the hands of Mexican drug cartels.
Confirming the report, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) told the committee on Friday that Holder “is leading us down a path where we have no other choice.” They added that if Holder would simply turn over an additional 73,000 pages of documents, the threat of a contempt citation would subside.
“We can end this tonight if the Department of Justice will turn over these documents and hold the senior-most individuals… accountable for their actions,” they said, according to Politico. CBS News added that House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) has not yet decided to pursue the contempt citation, which would require a vote by the full House.
Issa's probe of the “fast and furious” gun running operation has been ongoing for months, and they've so far received more than 7,000 pages of documents from the DOJ. Holder said that several ongoing criminal investigations which resulted from the operation preclude them from releasing all the information Republicans are asking for.
The sting, which was set up by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) in 2009, saw hundreds of guns sold to Mexican drug cartels. The scheme failed, however, and hundreds of weapons went missing, with some turning up later at crime scenes.
Two of the firearms in particular were discovered near the body of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry, who was killed near the Mexican border in 2010. Holder has profusely denied that they knew about the ATF's illegal sales and asked for an internal DOJ probe.
The last time Congress issued a contempt citation was in 2008, amid a probe into the Bush administration's politically-motivated firing of U.S. attorneys. Two Bush officials were held in contempt by Congressional Democrats after they refused to comply with subpoenas that would have compelled their testimony.
Republicans at the time argued that administration officials are immune from Congressional probes due to protections afforded through executive privilege, but a court ultimately agreed with House Democrats and upheld the citations.
Ironically, if the Republican-led House did pass a contempt motion against Holder, it would leave Holder themselves to enforce it, and could ultimately trigger their recusal from the case altogether.

Officially created in 1999, Nunavut Territory is an administrative unit hived off from the former Northwest Territories. Nunavut, in the language of the Inuit who live here, means "our land" and covers the whole of the eastern section of northern Canada. With an area of 1.9 million square kilometers, Nunavut is almost eight times the size of the United Kingdom and comprises roughly one fifth of the total area of Canada. Its southern border is the 60th parallel, while the north extends to within about 800 kilometers of the North Pole. Most of the Territory is situated above the tree line, in a region of predominantly treeless tundra with dwarf shrubs, grasses, mosses, and lichens. Fiords cut deep inland from the coast.
Craft- and handicraft-based businesses have achieved extraordinary success. Produced mainly in small workshops, the leather goods, jewelry, ivory work etc. have great appeal for tourists throughout Canada. Hence, in addition to meeting the demand from the as-yet small number of tourists who visit the Far North, there is a lively "export trade" to the major tourist centers of the Canadian South (including Québec, Toronto, Niagara Falls, Banff, Lake Louise, and Vancouver).
1. What the top FSB officer thinks about Russia's conflict with the West
What happened
The head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Alexander Bortnikov, gave an interview (Russian) to the official government publication, Rossiyskaya Gazeta. The cause was the 100th anniversary of FSB, KGB and their predecessor secret services. Almost half of the interview focuses on the history of the Soviet secret services and the FSB as their successor, but much of the rest addresses foreign adversaries' plans to destroy Russia.
Read the highlights:
On foreign adversaries: “Our Fatherland has many times become an object for hostile infringements by foreign powers. The enemy has tried to defeat us both in open battle and with support from the traitors inside the country. For some [adversaries], the destruction of Russia is still an obsession. Our goal is to prevent them from fulfilling it.”
On Soviet mass repressions of the 1930s: “Many associate this period with mass fabricated charges, but the archival documents give evidence that a significant part of the accusations were based on real facts, including the famous open trials.”
On the fall of the Soviet Union: “The reform team led by M.Gorbachev hadn't lifted the ban on investigation of the Party elite. The Party Central Committee gave no response to the information about foreign agents of influence in the Soviet government.”
On foreign intelligence activity in Russia now: “Foreign intelligence services are still trying to penetrate into all the areas of work of our government. Naturally, they are met with firm response by our counter-intelligence. Since 2012, 137 foreign secret service agents were sentenced for espionage”
On Ukraine: “We pay special attention to building up a secure barrier to the threats coming from Ukraine. We take measures to prevent the diversionary and terrorist activities by its intelligence, which are coordinated by the Western secret services.”
On cybersecurity: “In recent years, the maintenance of the cybersecurity of our country advanced to another level. Under the direction of the FSB, since 2013 we have established a system of prevention and mitigation of cyberattacks, which proved its effictiveness during the 2016 DDoS attacks and the May 2017 [Wannacry] virus attack.
Why the world should care:
Bortnikov's interview is a rare occasion to get an understanding of what people from the FSB — perhaps the strongest faction in the Russian elite today — think about the conflict with the West. For the top FSB officers, the concept of foreign powers' quest to tear Russia into parts is not a propaganda cliche but a fundamental element of their picture of the world.
Yet Bortnikov is still moderate in speech, unlike the former director of the FSB, now head of the National Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev. The latter usually calls a spade a spade, saying in multiple interviews that the goal of the U.S. is to destroy Russia in order to get access to its rich resources.
2. THE BELL SCOOP: Government may extend capital amnesty to return more funds to Russia
What happened
At a meeting with Russia's wealthiest business people, Vladimir Putin announced a special anonymous treasury bonds issue, designated for Russian billionaires who wish to return their foreign funds home. As The Bell has learned (Russian), the government is also weighing the possibility of extending the capital amnesty.
Under the capital amnesty law, Russian residents willing to return their undeclared foreign assets to the country, were freed from legal responsibility for failing to declare the assets, and related tax penalties.
The law was introduced in 2014, after the capital outflow from Russia increased due to an economic downturn and deterioration of relations with the West. The amnesty expired on July 1, 2016.
About 2,500 Russians took advantage of the amnesty. The total amount of funds that returned to Russia is unclear, but in 2015 foreign direct investment from offshore centers has risen (Russian) in billions U.S.
Repatriation of capital through special treasury bonds is a novelty. Reuters fist reported the idea earlier in December. The terms of the issue may be favorable, with rates exceeding those of bank deposits and guaranteed anonymity for the bidders.
Both acts are introduced based on requests from large business owners, who fear further extension of U.S. sanctions after February 2018, which may block their assets in the West.
Why the world should care
In general, the repatriation of foreign funds, mostly held offshore, is good news for the national economy. However, for the Russian elite those monies provide an essential tie to the Western world, and in current circumstances, the move might become another step further isolating the country.
3. Russian parliament to register individuals as media foreign agents
What happened
Russian legislators are going further in their campaign against state-backed foreign media. A month after the implementation of the law introducing foreign agent status for select international outlets, the parliament has proposed amendments allowing individuals to be added to the foreign agent media list (here's the piece on it in English by the official agency TASS).
The move is described as yet another retaliation to the labeling of the Russian state TV channel RT and news agency Sputnik as foreign agents in the U.S. RT and Sputnik editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan suggests that the legislation will be used against Russian journalists who report for the media controlled by the U.S. Department of State as freelancers, thus helping them to avoid official registration in Russia.
Why the world should care
While the Russian and American state-backed news outlets might be different in their goals, attitude and credibility, the foreign agent war hurts lots of innocent people in both countries — like this local radio station owner in Virginia and many others.
4. Russians behind Silicon Valley giants' success
What happened
Russia is still not just a source of oil, offshore capital and secret service conspiracy theories for the world. In Silicon Valley, Russians are among the people behind the success of the major tech companies and most promising startups. This week, The Bell launched a special project of video interviews with about Russians in the Valley, starting with Google product director for VR and the designer of the YouTube mobile app, Andrey Doronichev. Here's a promo video of the project with subtitles in English.
Why the world should care
Despite what you read in the news (including our newsletter, unfortunately), the Russians in fact are not alligators; besides oligarchs with unfairly collected fortunes. There are talented entrepreneurs, inventors and achievers, and we want to share the stories of those people.

New Zealand needs to find out "whether it can stand on its own two feet" and consider holding a vote on becoming a republic, Labour leader Andrew Little says.
In the wake of the flag referendum, the opposition leader said they voted against the alternative as it "doesn't reflect anything about New Zealand at all".
"I'm pleased to say we haven't adopted it," they said.
Mr Little said the country should revisit the issue "sooner rather than later", suggesting a flag that "genuinely represents who we are, the diversity that is New Zealand".
When asked if a republic referendum is something they would do in power, Mr Little said it is something they would discuss.
"I would do that at the end of the reign of the current monarch, have a good public debate," they said.
"To me the big issue is... a sense of identity, standing on our own two feet.

NFL Network Analyst and former Super Bowl winning coach Brian Billick joined The Morning Show on Thursday. Hugh Douglas asked Billick if they were surprised how the Falcons handled Aaron Rodgers in the NFC Championship Game: “Not really, that defense has started playing so well and so fast, and from an offensive side you know they were going to be trouble for the Green Bay defense,” said Billick. “The fact that the Packers were never going to challenge defense with a running game helped them against Rodgers.”
When asked if the Patriots were overlooking the Falcons: “No, not Bill Belichick,” said Billick. “I think it's just them being unfamiliar with what the Falcons have been doing this year. But be assured they will do their due diligence to prepare for the Falcons.”
Other notable quotes from Billick:
On the rise of the Falcons defense of late: “Dan Quinn deserves so much credit, particularly for what they're doiong on the defensive side of the ball.”
“Dan Quinn deserves so much credit, particularly for what they're doiong on the defensive side of the ball.” On the trouble defending Atlanta's offense: “You knew that Green Bay, from the defensive standpoint, was going to have a tough time with all of the weapons that Atlanta has. I mean, who do you double? I'm sure for Dom Capers it was like playing Whack-A-Mole. ‘OK, I'll double Julio [Jones], oh, there goes [Mohamed] Sanu. OK, I'll run a passive zone and cut these guys on the outside, well then they've got two tight ends on the inside.' And then of course Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman are so dynamic out of the backfield.

U.S. troops fighting in Afghanistan are experiencing some of the greatest psychological stress and lowest morale in five years of fighting, reports a military study according to USA Today.
"We're an Army that's in uncharted territory here," says Gen. Peter Chiarelli, Army vice chief of staff, according to the report. "We have never fought for this long with an all-volunteer force that's 1% of the population."
Mental health strain was most severe among veterans of three or more deployments, with a third of those showing signs of psychological problems defined as either stress, depression or anxiety, the report obtained by USA Today says.
The research, based on a survey of soldiers and Marines in 2010, also found that the praise the troops have for their unit sergeants has never been higher as the United States approaches the 10th year of its longest war, according to the article.
USA Today writes that the report says decline in individual morale is significant: 46.5 percent of troops said they had medium, high or very high morale, compared with 65.7 percent who said that in 2005. About one in seven soldiers — and one in five Marines — reported high or very high morale.
The report says soldiers and Marines reported more intense fighting than during the surge in Iraq in 2006-07, with 75 percent to 80 percent of those in Afghanistan involved in firefights, according to USA Today.
Half or more of those surveyed said they had killed the enemy, and 75 percent to 80 percent described the death or wounding of a buddy. Half also said that an improvised explosive device detonated within 55 yards while they were on foot patrol. The study's researchers also found evidence of physical wear-and-tear with a third of the force experiencing chronic pain.
Mental health staffing has doubled in Afghanistan since 2009 and troops report better access to this care, though many are so busy fighting "outside the wire" to seek help, the study says.

Ordinarily, when a team trades up in the second round to draft a player, that player's roster spot is safe for at least a couple years. But Roberto Aguayo is no ordinary second-year player.
Aguayo, the kicker the Buccaneers drafted last season, had a terrible rookie year and will have to compete with veteran Nick Folk for the kicking job. They say they embrace that.
“It is motivation,” Aguayo told PewterReport.com. “When I was in college there would be walk-on kids come in and I didn't know who they were or if they were good or whatever. But whoever they were, it was always a competition for me. Just seeing someone else out there trying to compete. I like it.”
Aguayo said they think both they and Folk will benefit from the pressure of a camp competition.
“I look at it like playing golf,” Aguayo said. “When you go out there playing by yourself you are playing to shoot par or shoot your best, but when you have someone else out there it's like, ‘Well they hit a good shot so I want to hit a good shot.' So it is good motivation for both of us and it is just going to make both of us better. And the better one will come out on top.”
The Bucs' decision to draft Aguayo was widely criticized at the time and will be criticized even more if they can't beat out Folk this summer. They sound confident that they can vindicate the team's faith in him.

If you know their name or link on them write in comments and I add it here.I think many people right now asking why did they release Korean server if International server have so much bugs?1. Different publisher. Nexon told IMC Games to focus on Korean server and release it fast.2. Right now game very vulnerable to hacks but to play on Korean servers you must have legal account. Sure, sometimes even legal accounts can't help to fight with hackers but it a lot better than we can see on any other server right now.3. Developers fixed most bugs that Korean server been had. If we compare both servers we can clearly see that KR version ready to be released and International server still in 'alpha' test.I think we can expect International version OBT in Q2.
Amid chants of
, people from 11 countries on Saturday walked through a
long forest trail which Lord
Buddha had once taken to reach
from
around 2,543 years ago.
PATNA:‘BuddhamSharanamGachchami'13kmGautamBodhGayaOver 500 pilgrims converged at Jethian in Rajgir district, around 100km southeast of Patna, for the journey, marking the success of the first-ever Buddha Heritage Walk introduced by the Bihar Tourism Development Corporation (BSTDC).“Buddha took this route when they decided to move to Rajgir after attaining enlightenment at Bodh Gaya . They were welcomed at Jethian by Bimbisara, the King of Magadh empire whose capital was Rajgriha, BSTDC general manager Navin Kumar said.“Bimbisara took Buddha to Venuvan, around 13km from there, and offered the place to them as a gift. Buddha had stayed there during their visit,” they said.The route is well-documented and is believed by scholars to be the only authentic one among several other such routes taken by the Buddha during their 45 years of preaching in various parts of India. It wends its way through lush green forest, hills and valleys, away from the noise of cities and villages. Several ancient stupas could be seen in the valleys along the route.“We are happy that pilgrims, including several monks from Japan, China, South Korea, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Vietnam, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil, apart from our own country, have walked on the sacred path. We are sure it will become more popular as awareness about it spreads across the world,” Kumar said.The BSTDC served packed lunch at the start of the walk, and had arranged for two camps along the route to serve water and tea to the pilgrims.The state tourism department is planning to hold many more such Buddhist Heritage walks for pilgrims and tourists alike. “Today's walk was organized as part of the ongoing Rajgir Mahotsav. We plan to organize many more in the coming months so that visitors are able to experience the path on which the Buddha walked,” Kumar said.
Is "bench from the trench" all bro-science and you better bench with bands - additional bands, of course?

HILLARY CLINTON ‘Sick, Shocked, Appalled' by Weinstein Allegations – Will Give Their Donations to Charity (Wink-Wink)
Hillary Clinton went on with Fareed Zakaria to discuss sexual predator Harvey Weinstein.
Hillary said they were “sick, shocked and appalled” by allegations that Weinstein was a serial sexual predator.
Weinstein is a major donor and bundler for the Democrat Party.
Hillary Clinton told Zakaria they will give all of their donations to charity.
“Well, there's no one to give it back to. What other people are saying, what my former colleagues are saying, is that they're going to donate it to charity, and of course I will do that.”
Yeah, that's gonna happen.
…Says the woman who wrote off used underpants on their tax returns!

High-stakes negotiations to head off a government shutdown went down to the wire Thursday night after President Obama rejected a last-minute bid by House Republicans to give the rest of the government a one-week reprieve on a shutdown.
Mr. Obama said they would veto a House-passed bill that would fund U.S. troops through the end of fiscal year 2011 and fund the rest of government through April 15. That veto threat leaves just two options: Either all sides could agree to a full-year deal to fund all government, or the government will shut down at midnight Friday.
Mr. Obama, House Speaker John A. Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid met privately twice Thursday to try to reach an agreement, but publicly engaged in a testy brinksmanship.
“We made some progress today. Those differences have been narrowed,” Mr. Obama announced at the White House after another nighttime meeting, the second time the three men gathered Thursday. “There are still a few issues that are outstanding. They're difficult issues. They're important to both sides.”
They said staffers from all sides will work throughout the night, and said they expect an answer back from Mr. Reid and Mr. Boehner “sometime early in the day” on Friday as to whether they should begin the process of shutting the government down.
In a joint statement, Mr. Reid and Mr. Boehner agreed the issues “have narrowed,” but said nothing more about the sticking points or the chances of success.
A shutdown would shutter national parks and the Smithsonian, and could halt Internal Revenue Service tax audits and processing of tax returns that are filed on paper, though electronic refunds still will be sent. Social Security and Medicare benefits will still be paid, though new applications could be delayed.
Administration officials said about 800,000 federal workers, about 20 percent of the total federal workforce, would be furloughed.
There are three moving parts to the negotiations to try to work out a long-term deal: The total dollar amount of cuts to be made from last year's spending level, the makeup of those cuts, and what legislative add-ons, known as “policy riders,” will be included.
In February, the House passed a bill that cut $61 billion from 2010 spending levels, and included dozens of riders such as stopping federal funding for Planned Parenthood and halting Obama administration plans on health care and the environment.
The Senate, meanwhile, has yet to pass a bill of its own. Last year's Democrat-led Congress did not pass a budget or any of the annual appropriations bills for 2011, instead funding the government through a series of continuing resolutions.
With negotiations sputtering on a full-year bill to run through Sept. 30, the end of fiscal year 2011, House Republicans sought to give the sides a one-week reprieve, as has happened six times already. Mr. Obama has said that short-term funding bills must cease.
The Republicans wrote a bill to fund the military fully through the rest of fiscal year, while keeping other government functions funded through April 15, which they said would allow more time to strike a broader deal.
On Thursday, the bill passed by a 247-181 vote with 15 conservative-leaning Democrats joining most Republicans in backing it. Six conservative members of the GOP voted against the bill.
But just before the vote, the White House issued a statement promising a veto.
“This bill is a distraction from the real work that would bring us closer to a reasonable compromise for funding the remainder of fiscal year 2011 and avert a disruptive federal government shutdown that would put the nation's economic recovery in jeopardy,” the White House said, arguing that the House bill “simply delays that critical final outcome.”
Saying that he, too, opposed the House bill, Mr. Reid did not schedule it for floor action in the Senate.
Republicans said Mr. Obama's promised veto makes a government shutdown almost impossible to avoid since, given that funding bills must originate in the House, that bill is the only one that could pass by the shutdown deadline.
“To have the president of the United States issue a veto threat on a bill to fund our troops is an outrage,” said House Republican Conference Chairman Jeb Hensarling, Texas Republican.
Lawmakers began warning constituents of the possible effects of a shutdown, including some closed federal offices.
Most federal employees would still be expected to report for work and would continue to earn pay, though paychecks would stop until Congress resumes funding.
In the shutdown negotiations, Mr. Reid said all sides have essentially agreed to a dollar amount in a final agreement, and said the delay is the policy provisions. They don't want any of those riders included.
Mr. Boehner, though, said policy riders are included in every broad spending bill and that both parties have made use of riders.
A 2008 Congressional Research Report recapping appropriations during the first year Democrats controlled Congress while President George W. Bush was in office said that year's spending bills included nearly two dozen policy riders.
Among new riders Democrats added that year were a provision tying the Bush administration's hands on offering new oil-shale drilling leases on public lands, and another provision blocking Mr. Bush's EPA from following through on a proposed rule to change hazardous air-pollutant standards — similar to Republicans' proposed limit on Mr. Obama's EPA rules.
Democrats argue they've met Republicans halfway on spending cuts by agreeing to more than $30 billion in reductions in 2011, compared with 2010 spending levels. House Republicans' bill cut $61 billion.
Both of those cut totals, while historic in real dollar terms, pale in comparison to the size of federal spending and deficits.
The federal government ran a deficit of $189 billion in March alone, according to preliminary estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.
The total deficit for the first six months of fiscal year 2011 is $830 billion, putting the government on pace for a new record.
Overall, government revenues are up $66 billion compared with last year, but spending is up much more — $179 billion more than the first six months of 2010. CBO says most of that was a result of changes in the way Wall Street bailout money is accounted for, and said if those accounting issues are taken away, spending is up only $15 billion over last year.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Six months after Rob Hruskoci closed their business, a debt collector called and demanded payment that day for the $5,000 balance on their business credit card.
"They want me to wire them $1,900 in 5 hours," Hruskoci said. "It was all about intimidation and harassment."
With the economy in a tailspin, more consumers like Hruskoci are falling behind in their loan repayments, and finding themselves the target of aggressive debt collectors.
Complaints against debt collectors have risen substantially in the last few years, according to the Better Business Bureau - up 20% in 2006 and 26% in 2007, according to preliminary figures.
As cash-strapped consumers struggle to make ends meet, third-party collection agencies are buying up debt from companies and actively trying to recoup losses and collect commissions.
Collection services go after past-due accounts referred to them by various credit grantors such as credit card issuers, banks, car dealerships, stores and hospitals - any business that extends credit or offers payment installment plans.
There are about 6,500 collection agencies in the United States. And they serve a useful purpose - debt collectors returned $39.3 billion to the U.S. economy in 2005, according to the Association of Credit and Collection Professionals.
Third-party collectors are regulated by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), which is administered by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). There are strict guidelines aimed at protecting consumers from abusive or unfair debt collection practices.
But there are also agencies that blatantly disregard those rules.
After a bad bicycling accident, Mike Gambino, 28, had a $20,000 bill from the hospital and no savings with which to pay it. They tried to work out a payment plan, but despite what agreement they thought they had made, their debt ended up in the hands of a collection agency.
Then began the months of harassment, they said, with agents often calling five or six times a day - from 6 in the morning to 12:30 at night.
"They were harassing me, one of them threatened to throw me in jail," they said. So Gambino learned what their rights were and got themselves a lawyer.
In fact, collectors may contact you in person, by mail, telephone, or fax. However, they may not contact you at inconvenient times or places, such as before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m., unless you agree. A debt collector also may not tell you that you will be arrested if you do not pay. (For more on your basic rights, see "What's prohibited")
Proceed with caution
If a debt collector contacts you, your first move should be to ask for proof of the debt, said Linda Sherry, of Consumer Action, a consumer advocacy group. "What you should get is a real document with your signature that shows you applied for the debt."
Collection agencies use a practice of tracking people down called "skip tracing."
"Sometimes they make huge leaps between what's real and what's not," Sherry said. You might have been contacted erroneously, just because you have the same name as the debtor they are looking for, or their old cell phone number.
Even if the debt is yours, it could be old enough to no longer be collectable. Some debt has a statute of limitations, which can range from three to 15 years, depending on your state. Make sure you find out your debt's expiration date because once you pay a portion or initiate a payment plan, the clock starts ticking all over again, Sherry said.
If you do negotiate a repayment plan, make sure you get it in writing - and that goes for every other correspondence as well.
It's very important to open up a file and write down the names and numbers of the people who contact you, Sherry said. Keep copies of every letter sent and received, and track all correspondence with certified mail and return receipt.
To further protect yourself from harassment, use a pay phone if you don't want the collection agents to have your phone number, and tell them not to call you at work.
You can stop a debt collector from contacting you altogether by writing a letter telling it to stop. Once the collector receives your letter, it may not contact you again except to say there will be no further contact. That does not make your debt go away, but it will offer a reprieve from the phone calls.
"I really recommend that people contact an attorney that's a member of the National Association of Consumer Advocates," Sherry said. If you feel like you have been treated unfairly, find an attorney with expertise in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act who will take the case on a contingency basis.
Plus, if you have an attorney, the debt collector must contact the attorney, rather than you.
You can also report any problems you have with a debt collector to your state attorney general's office and the Federal Trade Commission. Many states have their own debt collection laws, and your attorney general's office can help you determine your rights.
The most obstinate, the most ominous, and the most stubborn of enemies, whose characteristics have been enumerated. One of their characteristics is that when they find power on Earth they foster corruption and kill people and products. They corrupt the product; that is, both the plant and human products, and destroy them.
[The] first [point] is on the viewpoint of Islam about the Earth and this planet and this complex which is the cradle of human life and a place for their birth and growth, and then the center of their return [to the Afterworld]. [It is related to] the viewpoint of Islam about the Earth and everything that exists on the Earth. In one place, Quran says, “We have created the Earth – that is this earthly planet – for human beings; [so] it belongs to all of them. It does not belong to some of them; some people are not more entitled to [exploiting] it than others. It does not belong only to one generation. Today, it belongs to you and tomorrow, it will belong to your offspring, to your grandchildren, to your scion, and so forth, and this is true about the entire Earth. The Earth has been created for humans and belongs to all of them. In another verse, [the Quran] says: “He created for you everything that exists on Earth.” Everything that exists on Earth and belongs to Earth has been created for you, humans. Therefore, because they are yours, [and since they] are to your benefit and belong to you, you must not destroy them. Everything [on Earth] is valuable. There are things that an ordinary human being may see as valuable and there are things that may seem worthless to them, but they are all of them precious. Once upon a time, there were people in our very country who asked, “What is this odious substance good for?” They were talking about oil. Some people may love the green territories of the northern region of the country and do not like deserts. Now, go and talk to Dr. Kordavani and see what they have to say about the desert. They are all the same, they are all blessings, they are all bounties, [and] they all belong to you. You have no right to destroy them; neither gardens, nor plantations, nor forests, nor pastures and plains, nor the desert. They all belong to human beings and we must take advantage of them.

In another verse [of the Quran, God] says, “[And God sent] you [to Earth] to build it.” The Almighty God, who has created this Earth and crated you, has obligated you to work for the development of the Earth; that is, you should activate the potentialities that exist on Earth. There are many potentialities that have not been known so far and will be known later and their importance and value will be understood later. This is your job; something that you should do. Even now that we think we are taking advantage of all the capacities of Earth, this is not the case. The water, the soil, the air as well as underground reserves and products that exist on the surface of Earth, of which you are currently taking advantage, can be probably used in a way which will be millions of times more efficient, but of which we are not aware now. Humans should continuously strive to find new capacities and to use those capacities to the benefit of human life. There is another verse in Quran about the “avowed enemy,” that is, the most obstinate, the most ominous, and the most stubborn of enemies, whose characteristics have been enumerated. One of their characteristics is that when they find power on Earth they foster corruption and kill people and products. They corrupt the product; that is, both the plant and human products, and destroy them.
Today, if you look at the world politics, you can find people who are doing this with all nations or with many nations; [that is], destruction of products and people. Almighty God considers this as corruption. Then They say, “And Allah does not like corruption.” These were just a few verses [of Quran] that I recited here. There are tens of traditions [hadith] with lofty content in Islam and in our religious texts about the Earth, [and] about our environment. These verses that I recited here are among those verses [of Quran] which refer to products of earth all of which belong to humanity and belong to you. The issue of environment is a very important issue. In short, this issue is important because it is about responsibility of humans vis-à-vis nature; they should feel that responsibility. Just in the same way that we feel responsibility with regard to human life, we must feel responsible with respect to the nature. Islam and other divine religions have wanted to preserve the equilibrium between humans and nature. This is the basis and main goal [of these religions]. Not preserving this equilibrium is the result of [a number of] factors, the most important of which is human complacency, thirst for power, and bullying nature of some of us, humans. When this does not happen – that is, the equilibrium is not preserved – then environmental crises take place; an environmental crisis will harm all the humanity and all generations [of human beings].
Today, this crisis is not special to us – of course, if “crisis” is the right word [but] to say the least it is a “major challenge.” This major challenge is not special to us. Today, this challenge can be seen all across the world and is the result of not feeling responsible – with regard to environment. You saw how in the case of Kyoto Protocol, the Americans stood [against the protocol] as a bullying government. I said this in Friday Prayers [sermon] a few years ago and talked about this. That is, a sort of bullying approach to a treaty, which is not related to one country or two countries and this and that corner of the world. It is related to the entire globe. The issue of greenhouse gas is not an issue, which is related to a single country and which damages a single group of people. No, it is related to the entire humanity. The issue of greenhouse gas is not something that may harm a country or a specific group of people; no, it pertains to all humanity. Nonetheless, the main problem with regard to environmental issues is that the consequences of destruction [of environment] are not observed in short term. [And] when they are observed, it takes a long time to make up for [environmental] damage and subsequent problems and in some cases it is impossible. [For example,] consider the melting of the polar ice, which can lead to elevated sea level and many other environmental problems. This is not something to be remedied by humans. Such problems cannot be made better within 10 years and 20 years and [even] 100 years; they will have lasting effects for humanity. I mean, when there are human beings who do not feel responsible [with regard to environment], have decided to convert public riches of the world into their own personal wealth, [and] take advantage of any opportunity to make themselves richer, this will be the result. Bullying [nature] of human beings, brazen disrespect for red lines, and bullying of human powers, powers with money and force, have created such effects and consequences in the world and across the globe.
Statements made in a meeting with Environmental Officials and Activists on March 8, 2015
Image caption Alun Davies said they do not need to choose between being British or Welsh - they are both
The government minister in Wales responsible for the Welsh language has said unionists should embrace the Irish language as it does not compromise their identity or politics.
An Irish language act has become one of the biggest stumbling blocks in the Stormont talks process.
Speaking to the BBC NI's The View, Alun Davies appealed to opponents of an act.
"I would say embrace the language, embrace the culture, embrace it as part of your identity," they said.
"When we have taken the politics out of the language, we have all benefited."
'Share experiences'
Mr Davies, who is a Labour assembly member in Cardiff, added: "I am a unionist and speak Welsh. It is a part of my cultural experience and it is a part of my future, my British future.
"I don't need to choose between being British or Welsh, I can have both."
In 2011, Welsh became an official language in Wales and it meant for the first time it could not be treated any less favourably than English.
The measures also introduced a new position of Welsh language commissioner, whose job was to promote the language and penalise those who failed to comply with the changes.
Image caption Meri Huws said a bilingual society must be based on mutual respect and honesty
Since 2015, all new road signs in Wales are in English and Welsh.
The measures introduced in 2011 placed requirements on government bodies to publish documents in both languages.
The Welsh Language Commissioner, Meri Huws, told BBC Northern Ireland that any discussion about creating a bilingual society must be based on mutual respect and honesty.
They said the parties in Northern Ireland need to be clear about what they want and what they think is achievable.
"Certainly mythology creates fear and I think one of the most important things is to get rid of any myths," they said.
"You are trying to create an energetic bilingual community - in order to do that you need to be able to talk to each other, share experiences and pull down the fences."
Some Irish Language campaigners want a commissioner with powers like Ms Huws.
Image caption Prof Diarmait Mac Giolla Chriost said the idea of a commissioner needs to be thought through
However, there are words of caution from Northern Ireland-born academic, Prof Diarmait Mac Giolla Chriost.
'Rules and regulations'
 They are a professor of Welsh at Cardiff University and said the idea of a commissioner needs to be thought through.
"It can have certain benefits, but the office has to be created designed with the particular tasks of the office in mind," they said.
"Clarity on that is absolutely essential and I am not sure that the different actors that are engaged with the Irish language agenda in Northern Ireland at present have got that clarity as yet," they said.
Suzy Davies, a Conservative assembly member who speaks English and Welsh, also thinks the role of a commissioner needs to be examined closely.
"If you are going to have a language commissioner to oversee how policy works then focus on the promotion and the benefits of being bilingual, rather than the insistence that certain rules and regulations have to be followed," they said.

So is enforcement the wrong approach?
Colin Nosworthy, a Welsh language campaigner with the group Cymdeithas yr Iaith, insists that cultural change must be backed by law.
They told The View: "You need legislation to guarantee rights for those people. You need basic fundamental rights guaranteed by law."
The differences between the debate in Wales and the debate in Northern Ireland about languages is stark - in Cardiff there is a political consensus but in Belfast there is a stalemate.
A potential Irish language act would guarantee Irish was given the same official status as English.
'Distinct cultures'
That would lead to measures like Irish being used used in court and the language being used in all assembly debates.
There could also be widespread use of Irish by all state bodies, including the police, and the appointment of an Irish language commissioner to ensure the language guidelines are adhered to.
The Democratic Unionist Party and the Ulster Unionist Party have both made it clear they have no issue with people speaking Irish, but they do not support an Irish language act.
Image caption Plaid Cymru's Sian Gwenllian said a compromise is possible if parties work together
Both parties say an act would be too expensive and should not be a priority.
The Alliance Party supports the creation of a comprehensive languages act.
Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) say an act would create equality for Irish speakers.
Plaid Cymru's Sian Gwenllian said a compromise is possible if parties work together.
"It is different in Northern Ireland because you have got two distinct cultures there anyway," they said. "But I think it is a matter of showing respect. Respect to each other, mutual respect."
The Welsh experience shows that over time dialogue created a political consensus.
However, as the talks at Stormont continue there is little sign that when it comes to Irish, politicians are ready to speak the same language.
Around 40% of infertility cases are due to problems with the size, shape, motility, and/or count of the man's sperm. A recent study seeking to explore lifestyle factors that may influence sperm morphology discovered that young men who smoked marijuana were more likely lower amounts of normally-shaped sperm. The study was led by Allan Pacey of the University of Sheffield and the paper was published in the journal Human Reproduction.
Pacey and their team went to 14 fertility clinics in the UK and collected samples from 2,249 men of at least 18 years of age. 1,970 of these samples had reliable sperm morphology results. A man should have at least 40 million sperm in every 2 cc of ejaculate, and if at least 4% of them are the correct size and shape, their sperm morphology is considered normal. The researchers found that 318 of the men in the study were below normal. The remaining 1,652 men with normal morphology were considered the control group.
The study participants were then asked to self-report on certain lifestyle factors, such as smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, and using recreational drugs. The researchers also took note of the time of year the samples were donated, as heat can affect sperm morphology (which is why the testicles are located outside of the body).
The men younger than 30 whose normal sperm morphology was below 4% were more likely to have smoked marijuana during the three months before giving the sample as the control group. The age of 30 is somewhat arbitrary; while research has shown sperm quality does decrease with age, there isn't a definitive threshold for decreased fertility like there is with women. These men were also more likely to have made the sample during the summer, which may have affected the morphology as well. It takes 72 days for sperm to mature, so any exposure to heat or drugs during this time could very well affect the quality of the sperm. Further study will need to be completed, controlling for factors such as heat and trauma, in order to verify or exonerate marijuana as a causal agent.
“Our knowledge of factors that influence sperm size and shape is very limited, yet faced with a diagnosis of poor sperm morphology, many men are concerned to try and identify any factors in their lifestyle that could be causing this,” Pacey said in a press release. “It is therefore reassuring to find that there are very few identifiable risks, although our data suggests that cannabis users might be advised to stop using the drug if they are planning to try and start a family."
The researchers did not find a link with other factors such as smoking cigarettes or drinking, though anyone plans on having a baby should probably cut back on those as well.
This study builds off of previous research Pacey co-authored in 2012, when the team explored lifestyle factors that influenced sperm motility. That study also found few things that men could change in order to increase their motility. However, the study only looked at factors like smoking or drinking habits, and never analyzed the quality of the DNA carried by the sperm, which may have yielded different results.
Cannabis isn't the only factor found to influence sperm morphology. A companion paper published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine described men working with chemicals like paint strippers or lead would also be more likely to have a lower percentage of normal sperm. Previously, it had been shown that men who routinely had exposure to organic solvents were more likely to have slower-swimming sperm.

UP to 15 gardai had to remove a woman from the Criminal Courts of Justice when they caused a disturbance after a judge told them to leave.
UP to 15 gardai had to remove a woman from the Criminal Courts of Justice when they caused a disturbance after a judge told them to leave.
Up to 15 gardai forced to remove woman from court
The woman began shouting and resisting attempts by officers to escort them out of the building's main hall in the middle of the day.
They were then arrested, put in a patrol van and driven away.
The incident unfolded during a recent sitting of Dublin District Court.
At around midday, the woman started to talk and mutter loudly while the court was in session before judge Michael Walsh.
They had been sitting in the public gallery with a number of bags of belongings since the courtroom opened and began to speak loudly as the day progressed.
No case involving them had been called at that point.
Judge Walsh asked for silence before gardai tried to escort the woman out.
REFUSED
They refused to stand up or leave their seat and began to shout as two to three gardai lifted them up and brought them out into the hall.
While there, they continued to shout and resisted attempts to move them on.
Eventually, assistance was called for and a large number of gardai, many wearing stab-proof vests, lifted and walked the woman to the front door of the complex on Parkgate Street.

MPs on both sides of Commons back amendment promising them a decisive vote on final Brexit deal
Conservative rebels inflicted a humiliating defeat on Theresa May in the House of Commons as they backed an amendment to their flagship European Union withdrawal bill over parliament's right to a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal.
How did your MP vote on the successful Brexit amendment? Read more
As the prime minister prepared to meet their fellow EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday, a series of last minute concessions by ministers and intense pressure from Tory whips failed to deter 11 of the government's MPs from voting against the leadership.
Backers of amendment seven, tabled by former attorney-general Dominic Grieve, included former education secretary Nicky Morgan, former business minister Anna Soubry, and South Cambridgeshire MP Heidi Allen.
MPs cheered and waved their order papers as the result of the crucial vote was read out, revealing the government had lost by 309 votes to 305: May's first Commons defeat over Brexit.
Grieve's amendment had the effect of limiting ministers' power to make sweeping changes to the law before parliament has approved the Brexit deal.
This government defeat on Brexit can now inspire other Tory rebels | Polly Toynbee Read more
The victory heartened proponents of a soft Brexit, who hope that over time they can use May's narrow working majority in the Commons to shift government policy towards a closer ongoing relationship with the EU.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described the result as “a humiliating loss of authority for the government on the eve of the European Council meeting”.
They added: “Theresa May has resisted democratic accountability. Them refusal to listen means they will now have to accept parliament taking back control.”
A government spokesperson insisted: “We are as clear as ever that this bill, and the powers within it, are essential. This amendment does not prevent us from preparing our statute book for exit day. We will now determine whether further changes are needed to the Bill to ensure it fulfils its vital purpose.”
Theresa May loses Commons Brexit votes as MPs back curbing government powers in EU withdrawal bill - Politics live Read more
Brexit secretary David Davis tabled a written statement on Wednesday morning, promising MPs a vote on the final Brexit deal before Britain leaves in March 2019.
“The government has committed to hold a vote on the final deal in parliament as soon as possible after the negotiations have concluded. This vote will take the form of a resolution in both houses of parliament and will cover both the withdrawal agreement and the terms for our future relationship,” Davis said.
Their statement was aimed at assuaging Grieve's concern that ministers could use the powers in the bill to press ahead with Brexit without full parliamentary scrutiny.
But the rebels stood firm through eight hours of heated debate in the Commons. Just minutes before the vote was due, justice minister Dominic Raab said the government would table its own amendment later during the bill's passage through the parliament to put into law the idea of a meaningful vote on the final deal.
But Grieve insisted: “It's too late,” and joined Labour MPs in the division lobby.
Stephen Hammond, one of the rebel MPs, was quickly sacked as vice-chair of the Conservative party.
Labour sources said their own whips' efforts to convince the Brexiters in their own party to vote for the amendment had been crucial to the crunch vote.
Leave-supporting MPs including Dennis Skinner, Grahame Morris, Ronnie Campbell and John Mann all voted for Grieve's amendment in order to inflict defeat on the government.
The Guardian understands Corbyn rang some of Labour's pro-Brexit MPs themselves to urge them to back the Grieve amendment. Meanwhile loyal Tory backbenchers were asked to contact their Labour counterparts in Brexit-backing seats to warn them against appearing to disregard their voters' views.
One party whip described the loss as a game-changer for the hung parliament. “It has broken the dam,” the MP said. “It will be much, much easier to do it again. Rebelling once gives you a taste for it. The discipline has been broken and it shows actually that if you do risk it and rebel for something you believe in, you can make a difference.”
The numbers were so tight many MPs coming out of the chamber after the vote said they believed the government had won. Catching their eye across the chamber, Soubry shook their head at Labour chief whip Nick Brown.
In a passionate half-hour speech, Grieve warned that if left unamended, the bill would unleash “a form of constitutional chaos”.
They said they had sought to engage with ministers to find a compromise over several weeks, but without success: “The blunt reality is, and I'm sorry to have to say this to the house, I've been left in the lurch, as a backbench member trying to improve this legislation.”
Tory MPs repeatedly clashed during the debate in a series of spiky exchanges.
Soubry said in the Commons,: “There comes a time when you have to set aside party differences and even party loyalty and you have to be true to what you believe in, and perhaps that time is now.”
They told the Guardian: “They have actually turned people into rebels by their complete inability to understand and listen to our concerns.”
Tory whips spent the day pressing backbenchers to reject the Grieve amendment, and several of them were called to No 10 in a last-minute attempt to persuade them to change their minds.
Relations with the “mutineers”, as they were dubbed by the Daily Telegraph, have deteriorated so much that some were even threatened with legal action if they made false public remarks about the activities of the government's whips. At least one potential rebel was warned by Julian Smith, the chief whip, that they could be sued if they made defamatory comments about the whips' activities.
Another backbencher described the approach of the whips, who are responsible for party discipline, as “bullying junior MPs”Some Tories reacted angrily to what they regarded as their colleagues' disloyalty, with Conservative MP for Mid-Bedfordshire even calling for them to be deselected for undermining the prime minister.
May promoted their chief whip Gavin Williamson, who had delivered victories in a string of tight parliamentary votes, to the job of defence secretary last month, after the resignation of Michael Fallon, and the relative inexperience of their successor, Julian Smith, was blamed by some rebels for the defeat.
But others said Davis had failed to pay sufficient attention to the concerns of the rebels, accusing them of a lack of “attention to detail”.
Some Tories reacted angrily to what they regarded as their colleagues' disloyalty, with Nadine Dorries, the MP for Mid Bedfordshire, even calling for them to be deselected for undermining May.
Nadine Dorries (@NadineDorries) Tonight, the Tory rebels have put a spring in Labours step, given them a taste of winning, guaranteed the party a weekend of bad press, undermined the PM and devalued their impact in Brussels. They should be deselected and never allowed to stand as a Tory MP, ever again.
Ministers have repeatedly promised MPs a “meaningful vote”; but it had been unclear when that would happen – and some rebels feared the government could renege on its promise if it was not enshrined in law.
MPs will only be given the option of accepting or rejecting the deal, and the government has insisted the only possible alternative will be to crash out without a deal. But Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has suggested May could be forced to go back to Brussels to renegotiate. Some MPs believe any government that lost such a crucial vote would struggle to survive and could be forced to trigger a general election.
Wednesday's defeat came after the government had already been forced to make concessions earlier in the week to quell a separate rebellion over the so-called Henry VIII powers contained in the bill. It raised questions about whether May will be able to command a majority next week for another contentious amendment, tabled by the government, to put the proposed date of Brexit – 29 March 2019 – into law.
Sarah Wollaston, the Tory MP for Totnes, said the concessions when they came had been “far too little too late”.
Wollaston said it was “a moment, when parliament genuinely, without wanting to repeat a cliche, did take back control, we don't change constitutional principles by statutory instruments”.
“No one wanted to vote against the government, but when the chips are down, do you feel its important enough to take a stand?” they said. “And we did. I think if we had rolled over on this, we would have stood no chance next week of having anyone take us seriously.”
The Tory rebels:
Heidi Allen (South Cambridgeshire), Ken Clarke (Rushcliffe), Jonathan Djanogly (Huntingdon), Dominic Grieve (Beaconsfield), Stephen Hammond (Wimbledon), Oliver Heald (North East Hertfordshire), Nicky Morgan (Loughborough), Robert Neill (Bromley and Chislehurst), Antoinette Sandbach (Eddisbury), Anna Soubry (Broxtowe), and Sarah Wollaston (Totnes).
John Stevenson (Carlisle) voted both aye and no, which is considered a formal abstention.

It's official, there is a new UFC Featherweight Champion. On August 2nd Chad Mendes will unseat Jose Aldo. The fight will take place at the Staples Center. The two met in January 2012 with Aldo getting the KO victory at 4:59 of the first round. Since that defeat Mendes has gone 5-0 with four knockouts. The reason why I think Mendes will win is because they were winning the last fight up until one very small mistake. Their wrestling is top-notch and their striking is way better now then back in 2012. They reign from Team Alpha Male which means their chokes are also great. I see Mendes pressuring Aldo up against the cage, taking them down some, and doing a good enough job on the feet the get the win. I'll have more on the fight as it gets closer. Who do you get?

Bushido: Lessons for the West
K R Bolton Review
Bushido: The Code of the Samurai
By Inazo Nitobe, first ed. 1899. Reprinted 2006 by Sweetwater Press, USA. Despite the time lapse between the republication of this book
Bushido
, and its last publication in 1905 in its tenth edition, the English prose has remained immensely readable for the contemporary audience. Inanzo Nitobe was during their day one of Japan's leading scholars and one of the best known in the Western world, having married an American Quaker. While it might seem a paradox that a man of peace such as Nitobe would write about a martial way of life, this is more due to the misunderstanding by the Westerner of what Bushido is, clouded by Japan's role as an adversary during World War II, whilst shortly before Japan had been considered an ally of the English-speaking world
. For the ethos of Bushido is far deeper than merely a ‘soldiers creed'. It is the Japanese equivalent to the Medieval Knightly ethos at its point of the highest mystical idealism. Like the Western chivalrous ideal, the Bushido ideal might not have always been upheld at its most sublime, but Bushido is analogous to the knightly ethos of the West and the chivalric codes of other cultures in their prime.
Bushido
the book will therefore be of interest to the ‘perennial traditionalist' and to the cultural morphologist. The chivalric ethos of Medieval Japan, like the chivalric ethos among the Christian Crusaders and their Islamic adversaries, is another example of a similarity of outlook common to certain castes (as distinct form their debased forms as ‘classes') at the cycles of their particular cultures when those cultures are still a reflection of the metaphysical and have not succumbed to the materialistic. It is what the Hindu
ksyatraya
call
dharma
, the cosmic duty of the warrior, and this Hindu equivalent is described in the
Bagavadh Gita
.
As for Bushido, the word literally translates as ‘Way of the Warrior', the code of life developed among the Samurai. With Nitobe's cogent description of the inner meaning of this to the West, one is also reminded of the cogency by which Yukio Mishima described the Samurai doctrine of
Hagakure
, although Nitobe the scholar is not possessed of the angst of Mishima the alienated militarist in post-World War II Japan.
Nitobe themselves was born into the Samurai caste in 1862. Although their grandfather and father were rice farmers, both practiced the martial arts, which were imparted to Nitobe as a youngster
. Educated in Japan, Germany and the USA, Nitobe became an international scholar of note, garnering five doctorates. Nitobe converted to

Anglo-Japanese Alliance, 1902.

The warrior caste in Hindu society.

Contradicting past statements that no records exist of police involvement in the search for the lost prototype, San Francisco Police Department spokesperson Lt. Troy Dangerfield now tells SF Weekly that "three or four" SFPD officers accompanied two Apple security officials in an unusual search of a Bernal Heights man's home.
Contrary to previous statements, SFWeekly reports that the San Francisco Police Department now admits to assisting Apple investigators with the search of a lost iPhone 5. An earlier report suggested that Apple had acted on its own without the participation of the police department.The four plainclothes San Francisco Department Police officers accompanied two Apple investigators to the home of Sergio Calderón. According to the most recent report, only the two Apple employees entered the home and searched while the four police officers remained outside.SFWeekly suggests that there are some questions now why this incident was not recorded as per standard procedure. San Francisco Police Department spokesperson Lt. Troy Dangerfield now says "Apple came to us saying that they were looking for a lost item, and some plainclothes officers responded out to the house with them. My understanding is that they stood outside. They just assisted Apple to the address."The previous report had suggested that Apple investigators may have impersonated the police which is a criminal offense. It seems now that this was not the case.An Apple employee reportedly lost this iPhone prototype in a restaurant/bar in late July. It seems, so far, that CNet's original account of the tale was accurate.

A draft labor protection regulation that grants female workers paid leave during menstruation was unveiled in North China's Shanxi province on Monday, Shanxi Daily reported.
The draft regulation, if approved by the provincial legislature, would enable Shanxi to become the first region in China that offers a menstrual leave benefit to female employees.
According to the regulation, female employees experiencing overly painful or heavy menstruation (also known as dysmenorrhea or menorrhagia in medical terms) may be given a paid leave of absence of one or two days upon providing a certificate from a legal medical institute or hospital approved by the employer.
It also says that menstruating female employees who spend the majority of their work day standing up be given time for rest, should their shift be greater than four hours in length.
The situation has attracted the public attention in recent years after Zhang Xiaomei, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Committee, proposed that menstrual leave be granted to female workers at the "two sessions" in 2011.
But their proposal also drew conflicting opinions on the issue. Some people are worried that menstrual leave would mean "exposing their privacy" and others fear this would make it harder for woman to contend for jobs with men.
China last amended its provisions on labor protection of female workers in 2012, adjusting the scope of jobs that employers cannot assign to female employees during their menstrual periods, pregnancy or lactation.
It offers female employees 98 days of maternity leave for childbirth, an increase of 8 days from the previous regulation.
The new provisions also allow female employees to use their work time to visit a doctor's office for prenatal care.
Donkey Kong Lays an Easter Egg By Don Hodges Posted July 1, 2009
An elderly cancer patient whose home flooded while they were getting treatment was denied coverage from Grey Power, because they left their house in Pembroke, Ont., unattended for more than four days.
"I feel hurt and let down. They should have informed me about what I am in for," said Ivy Scotland, 84, who, by all accounts, is meticulous about paying their bills and takes pride in their home.
"I did not expect to be away from my house for any period of time."
Scotland's home is now a mess from water damage. She's facing an $11,000 repair bill, because of a little-known standard policy exclusion they said she'd never heard of.
Scotland was undergoing cancer treatment at Ottawa General Hospital when their furnace went out in their home, causing the pipes to freeze and burst last winter. (CBC)
"What I read in the policy was just that I had coverage for water damage," they said.
Insurance experts told Go Public that few Canadians are aware that if they leave their home for more than four days in the winter, without a responsible person to check the heat inside each day, home insurance won't cover water damage if pipes freeze and burst, as in this case.
Alternatively, water supply valves need to be shut off, but some policies may still require periodic checks, even with that precaution.
Homeowners unaware, says broker
"There are millions of people insured in this country — and I would suspect that maybe a couple of hundred thousands understand this part of their policy," said Monica Woldring, an independent insurance broker in B.C.
The Insurance Bureau of Canada said it doesn't have numbers, but Woldring expects this last harsh winter led to a spike in this type of claim — and this kind of denial.
"They are disastrous for most people, because it's not like the water has only dribbled."
Grey Power refused to cover the $11,000 repair bill because of a little-known policy exclusion. Scotland's home was left unattended for more than four days this past winter when their water pipes burst.
Scotland's home in Pembroke is almost a two hours' drive from Ottawa General Hospital, where they are being treated for multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer.
Them doctor didn't like their travelling back and forth, they said, so they reluctantly left home in November to stay close to the hospital during treatments. They had a neighbour watch the house and pick up mail, but they didn't ask them to go inside.
Three weeks after their last visit home, their furnace went out and the pipes froze and burst.
$3K per month for temporary home
"You wonder whether they are sort of complicit in keeping their policyholders in the dark about this," said the neighbour, Tom Spooner, who added that Grey Power's claim denial makes their blood boil.
They said he'd never heard of the four-day rule either. "And how many other people have ever heard of it?"
Scotland is draining $3,000 a month from their savings to stay in an Ottawa retirement home temporarily.  They are also still paying Grey Power $90 a month for home insurance.
"I would love to be able to go back home, to my house," said Scotland. "I am not the only person who was caught in this situation. The weather was bad. And a lot of people had this sort of problem."
Independent insurance broker Monica Woldring says many customers are in the dark about their insurance because they are increasingly buying online or over the phone. (CBC)
They insisted that when they bought their insurance, the person who sold them the policy said nothing about this exclusion.
"The broker should have told them The broker should have reminded them You have to remind people because they don't remember," said Woldring.
Compassion called for
Scotland's plumber called to plead their case, but said Grey Power showed no concern.
"I thought because they target seniors they would have had more compassion in this situation," said Peter Saffery.
There is no mention of this pitfall on Grey Power's website, even though there are other tips for seniors who leave their homes in the winter.
Go Public did a test to see if Grey Power warns potential customers who call. Posing as someone shopping for home insurance for elderly parents, we asked repeatedly what wasn't covered. Initially, we were told burst pipes would be.
Go Public put Grey Power to the test to see whether its brokers tell people about the policy exclusion. (CBC)
"As long as you choose that coverage as part of the quote, it's a water damage extension," said the broker.
"It's usually the same exclusions are on all home insurance policies ... if a pipe leaks it's not going to be covered, but if a pipe burst it would be covered."
They also did explain this exclusion, but only after we asked about frozen pipes.
"In the winter months you need someone checking on the home either daily or if all the pipes are drained and shut off then it's every few days."
Grey Power response
Grey Power declined Go Public's request for an interview and didn't answer questions about its practices.
It sent an email, pointing out its broker "diligently" answered questions we asked him.
"We take great pride in our brokers, and they in turn take great pride in the service they provide to our customers," said a Grey Power spokesperson.
As a result of our inquiries, it also said it has now "reached out" to Scotland to try to "resolve the situation as quickly as possible."
"We are very sorry that they have had to refocus their time and energy to this matter."
Woldring said they believe customers are more in the dark about insurance than ever, because they are buying online or over the phone.
"My fear is that we are losing the humanity in our business … we are going to have more and more cases like this one … especially as people age and get ill."

The annual Autistic Pride Day falls every June 18, with an ongoing theme of neurodiversity. The pride label is intended to encourage a celebration of autistic differences, rather than reinforcing stereotypical perceptions of autism as a disease. Autistic Pride Day educates people directly from the experiences of autistic people themselves, and celebrates autistic lives inclusive of wide variation, aiming also to progress a recognition of the achievements of autistic people. Society is still some way from understanding and accepting the range of autistic differences, and changing attitudes is a necessary step towards enabling autistic people to lead fulfilling lives without discrimination, and allowing them to participate in and contribute to all aspects of society.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a set of diverse neural development variables that are characterised most commonly by difficulty with social interactions and behavioural difficulties. It is a spectrum that manifests in a range of presentations, and is increasingly described by the autistic community, and by some clinicians and researchers, as a condition rather than a disorder. Prevalence is 1–1·5% of the population (one in 68 children in the USA, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), and has previously been thought more common in men and boys, although current debates suggest that this might be an effect of basing diagnosis on behaviour, which varies between sexes. Diagnoses centred on behavioural issues can lack precision, as behaviour may be suppressed, camouflaged, and normalised by autistic people in order to fit in and avoid social stigma.
Autism is a relatively new diagnosis, becoming widely used only since the 1990s. In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published in May, 2013, the diagnostic criteria were broadened as various diagnostic entities were pulled together, pre-school children were included, and prevalence subsequently increased considerably as a range of autistic traits were newly identified as part of the spectrum. Neurological research in the field remains difficult and sometimes controversial, and there is an ongoing lack of knowledge of the neurological bases for autism. Future understanding of causes, including genetic causes, will hopefully help to shape a more tailored approach to diagnosis and treatment management.
Neurodiversity encompasses the breadth of autistic characteristics; there are a wide variety of defining characteristics, and every person has a different experience of autistic life. A society that accepts neurodiversity requires cooperation and input from multiple stakeholders, including autistic people, neurologists and mental health professionals, parents, teachers, researchers, and employers. Society needs to embrace neurodiversity in order to accept differences and variation, and to reduce stigma. Mental health professionals can provide interventions and support if there is an understanding of the details of autistic experience. Management can be complex, as people with autism are more likely to have comorbid mental health diagnoses and higher rates of suicidal ideation. Approaches to intervention need to be highly personalised to suit each individual and to identify comorbidities correctly. Professionals also need to understand and accept neurodiversity—a lack of empathy could lead to a repeat of past approaches that forced people to conform to “normal” behaviour, which is neither effective nor acceptable.
An autism diagnosis most commonly takes place in the first 2 years of a child's life—early detection brings more effective intervention. However, there is a need to improve detection and accommodation of autism in adulthood. A diagnosis late in life can help people to understand why they feel they are different to others, can help to understand accompanying mental health challenges, and may provide the beginning of a helpful clinical pathway—as well as providing clarity, it can be a signpost to relevant support. Regarding treatment and societal support, external systems need to adapt to embrace variations in behaviour that include adults with late diagnoses. This shift is elusive: public perception still has some way to go to embrace difference.
There is no doubt that exciting times lie ahead for research into neurodiversity, which will inform future understanding of autistic life. Larger studies are needed, and with those, more precise tools and treatments will emerge. Concurrent priorities include listening to the autistic community, improving diagnosis and treatment options, offering better support through all life stages, including school support, employment, adulthood, and breaking down the lingering stigma in public perception. This is the real challenge: to achieve integration into society there is still a long way to go, and too many autistic people remain marginalised and badly stigmatised.

A court rules that implementing the law this close to the election would likely lead to improper voter disenfranchisement.
A Pennsylvania judge has blocked the state's controversial voter-ID law from going into effect for this election,the Associated Press reports.
The ruling from Commonwealth Court Judge Robert Simpson doesn't preclude the law from being implemented at a later date next year. The state Supreme Court ordered Simpson to discern whether the state had done enough to provide "liberal access" to photo IDs before Election Day and to issue an injunction if they found that any eligible Pennsylvania voter was being prevented from voting, intentionally or otherwise.
Since it became law six months ago, Pennsylvania's voter-ID requirement, passed by the Republican-led Legislature, has caused a furor nationwide. Democratic activists and voting-rights groups have said that it disenfranchises the elderly, minorities, the poor, urbanites, and other groups that tend to vote for Democrats; GOP proponents have said that it is simply a guard against fraud. The commonwealth of Pennsylvania had stipulated before the proceedings that there had been no instances of in-person fraud.
The stakes were particularly high in an election year with the presidential candidates competing for Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes.
Simpson heard testimony about the bureaucratic nightmare facing Pennsylvanians without the correct type of photo ID when they tried to obtain an approved ID, while the state emphasized its eleventh-hour effort to ease the process.
The new law required a photo ID such as a passport, driver's license, state-issued nondriver ID, or a student, military, or employee ID; all the photo IDs were rquired to have expiration dates. The requirements before the law was passed were that people voting for the first time, or for the first time in a new polling place, show a utility bill, bank statement, paycheck, or other form of ID.
Chiefs livewire Damian McKenzie is in advanced talks to join England top tier side Leicester Tigers according to reports out of the UK.
The 22-year-old has been a key cog for the Chiefs this season, but the Rugby Paper suggests they have been questioning their place in New Zealand Rugby after finding themselves low in the All Blacks pecking order.
Called up to the national side for last year's Rugby Championship, McKenzie was underwhelming in the few times they made it on the park.
McKenzie was recently called into the All Blacks during the Lions series but only after an injury to superstar fullback Ben Smith. They were also used as a back-up to newcomer Jordie Barrett.
The Tigers had reportedly taken an interest in Damian's brother Marty before setting their sights on the All Blacks fringe player.
In 2016, McKenzie fended off contract offers from the Blues and the Crusaders to sign a two-year contract extension with the Chiefs, meaning they wouldn't likely depart for the UK until the end of the 2018 Super Rugby season.
A move to Leicester would see them join the likes of former Blues flanker Brendon O'Connor, former Wallabies centre Matt Toomua as well as England backs George Ford and Manu Tuilagi.

Well, it finally happened. After years of being a staple of almost every sci-fi novel, comic book, movie, and video game, virtual reality helmets are finally a reality; anyone can buy one and check out of our world at will. Whether or not the current technology will actually catch on with the crack-like addiction that we've all been threatened with through fiction for decades remains to be seen. After all, it's not like the Virtual Boy was Nintendo's crowning 90s success (nope, that would obviously be the pixelated Game Boy camera, dummy). Maybe the unwashed masses don't really want to check out and plug in like everyone always predicted. It's possible. Unlikely, but possible.
That's the strange thing about Virtual Reality. It's existed in pop culture fantasy for so long that it seems like an invention that we all desperately want merely because our wanting it has always been assumed. We knew what the headsets should look like long before they were actually available, and we all saw dramatic illustrations of the potential pitfalls of VR long before we ever got to experience any of its real pleasures. It's odd to be at the point where it's really happening, but hey! At least we have hundreds of hours of theorizing about how it can all go wrong. That should help us avoid the singularity, right?!
In celebration of Playstation's long awaited gift of home console VR, the time seemed right for us fine folks at CGM to remember all the movies the promised this sweet, sweet VR future. So we humbly present to you a list of the top ten movies that predicted the (possible) VR revolution. It should be noted that not all of these movies are actually good. In fact, some of them are downright horrible and goddamn it, that's what makes them so damn fun. If nothing else, none of these movies will allow for a second of boredom, even if you're giggling at them rather than with them.
10) Johnny Mnemonic (1995)
Remember in the last paragraph when I mentioned that not all of these movies are “good” in a conventional sense? Well, say hello to exhibit A in the VR camp cannon. Johnny Mnemonic was one of the biggest flops in the weird mid-90s craze for Internet thrillers. It was a time when enough folks were suddenly using painfully slow dial up internet (or at least knew folks who were) that the digital world seemed ripe for exploration. That led to movies like Hackers, The Net, and Johnny Mnemonic that made ordering pizza through a computer seem like magic. In this case, Keanu Reeves stars in a mythical future world where everyone and everything is run through the internet (crazy, right?). Since info hacking is so common, folks like Reeves are hired as “data couriers” to securely carry information in their brains that can't be hacked. It's silly, pulpy stuff mostly worth watching for one of Reeve's most hysterically piss poor performances, the hilarity of the dated techno babble (Reeves brags that their brain can hold 80 gigs of data, insert stupidity joke here), and the fact that all of the internet is best explored and operated through VR helmets (Makes sense right, 1995? How else will people surf the internet? On their phones? Don't be ridiculous!).
9) The Lawnmower Man (1992)
From the barely involved mind of Stephen King (who later sued to get their credit removed) comes a bit of VHS sci/fi horror trash that taught most 90s kids about the concept of virtual reality. It's about an embarrassing mentally disabled character (essentially Simple Jack from Tropic Thunder) who cuts lawns for a living until they meet Pierce Brosnan's super scientist who has invented VR in their garage (to be fair, they have a British accent, so he's clearly smart enough to do it). Brosnan gets the guy hooked through VR video games then eventually starts uploading mountains of information into The Lawnmower Man's brain until they become an evil genius in the real world and a super powered villain in the virtual one. Not only is the movie just as dumb as it sounds, but the pre-Jurassic Park VR CGI sequences designed to be mind-melting stunners somehow make Reboot look like the pinnacle of computer animation. If you want to have a laugh about what 90s dumb dumbs though the digital revolution/nightmare might look like, buckle up and enjoy this silly ride.
8) Virtuosity (1995)
Believe it or not, The Lawnmower Man was successful, so it's director, Brett Leonard, was allowed to continue making virtual reality movies. It was their specialty. So in 1995 they delivered this big ol' slice of cheese. It's about a special virtual reality program used in police training featuring a super-duper serial killer (Russell Crowe) made from the combined psychological profiles over 150 real serial killers. Then, before the audience has a chance to say, “Wait, what the hell are you talking about?” the virtual super-duper serial killer finds a way to escape into the real world. The only man who can stop him? Why an ex-cop turned prisoner who did really well in the simulations, of course! He's also played by Denzel Washington. Yep, it's all as dumb as it sounds. Possibly even dumber. We were all easily impressed by techno babble in the 90s. It wasn't humanity's finest hour.
7) Total Recall (1990)
That's right Total Recall. The tale of a normal dude who just so happens to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger and is married to Sharon Stone. Yep, what a totally average and boring life all around! So for escape they decide to try a virtual vacation via a memory implantation service taken from a Philip K. Dick work of the same name (virtually none of the author's ideas beyond the concept were retained). What follows is either a ridiculous ultraviolent Paul Verhoeven movie about Arnie realizing they were always a Mars superspy after the virtual memory implantation goes wrong or a ridiculous ultraviolent Paul Verhoeven movie that's actually all a tongue-in-cheek fever dream set in Arnie's head. Given the flick's placement on this list, you can guess which theory we subscribe to. Like all Verhoeven movies, this is a deceptively cheeseball action movie that's actually a clever parody/genre deconstruction if you're willing to look beneath the blood and triple boobed aliens to find artistic intent.
6) The Cell (2000)
This bizarre and beautifully crafted thriller from director Tarsem Singh is a sadly forgotten bit of gorgeous eye candy (likely because no one can take Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn seriously in drama post-2000). Lopez stars as a social worker who agrees to delve into the mind of Vincent D'Onofrio's particularly disturbed serial killer through experimental VR. The goal is to find the hidden location of the killer's latest victim, but the plot barely matters. It's all an excuse for some absolutely amazing imagery as the underrated stylist Tarsem Singh conjures up the cracked psyche of a grade A nutball. We can only dream that actual VR will one day deliver worlds this distinctly gorgeous. Unlikely though.
5) Gamer (2009)
Completely dismissed in 2009 because it came out right when everyone collectively decided they were no longer going to take Gerard Butler seriously (fair enough), Gamer is secretly one of the best video game flicks ever made. Written and directed by the Crank team of Neveldine and Taylor, it's set in a VR landscape run amuck. Players can now control actual humans through their computers and headsets, either making paid actors do perverted things in open world environments or using death row convicts as avatars for a massive multiplayer shooter. It's a cool idea, essentially a millennial Running Man. Neveldine and Taylor deliver it through their usual mix of dark satirical silliness and relentless ADD action. The world is eye-bustingly well designed, the action hits hard, the satire is on point (if hardly subtle), and some of the performances are fantastic (especially Michael C. Hall as the evil tech genius behind it all). With a better script and Jason Statham in the lead role instead of Butler, this probably could have been a big hit. Instead, it's more of a cult oddity well worth seeking out as long as you don't mind some stupidity and ADD excess with your smartypants sci-fi.
4) Strange Days (1995)
By far the best entry in the mid-90s future techo-thriller sweepstakes that mostly delivered crap, Strange Days combines the forces of then husband/wife team screenwriter James Cameron and director Kathryn Bigelow. Set in the mythical future of 1999 (gulp), it's about an ex-cop turned hustler (Ralph Fiennes, no really) who sells data discs with memories that can be relived through virtual reality. Fun set up, right? Well, then things get dark when they find a disc featuring the murder of a prostitute and ends up caught in a spiralling murder mystery. James Cameron's script starts with a damn clever idea before slowly devolving into an overly convoluted mystery that's dragged out for far too long. Kathryn Bigelow's directing, on the other hand, is magnificent and their POV VR action scenes have rarely been topped. The movie bombed spectacularly in theaters and has been difficult to track down since. However, it's a ripping yarn with some clever ideas and brilliant action scenes well worth rediscovering, if only because it might be the only mid-90s Hollywood sci-fi techno-thriller that can still be watched for anything other than a laugh.
3) Ghost In The Shell (1995)
If you've seen Ghost In The Shell, you know exactly why this movie is here. If you haven't, go see it immediately. You're about to find out where so much of the pop culture imagery you adored in the 2000s came from. Also, this is about to be spoiled by an unnecessary American remake. So see the good version before it's tainted.
2) ExistenZ (1999)
Though not exactly perfect, ExistenZ might be the best movie ever made about video games. Jude Law stars as a gamer in a world where video game designers have become something between spiritual gurus and renowned artists. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the brilliant designer behind a new VR creation. Since this is a David Cronenberg movie, players log in biologically through a gross fleshy controller that hooks into their body and pulsates during playtime. Somehow, the movie actually gets stranger from there. ExistenZ is a fascinating exploration of the implications of giving your reality over to game designers that's aged remarkably well. Though it bombed on release thanks to coming out mere weeks after the number one entry on this list, it's actually surprising that Cronenberg's movie hasn't earned a larger cult audience over the years. This Videodrome for the gaming era has never been more ripe for rediscovery, so go do that now dummy. You know, before gaming implants become a real thing.
1) The Matrix (1999)
Finally, what else could top this list? One of the most influential action movies ever made and a perfect mix of thrilling form with brainy content. This tale of humanity enslaved to machines through VR is filled with tantalizing speculative sci-fi questions that have yet to be answered almost 20 years after release. Will people soon decide to voluntarily live in a virtual space over the real world? It's already happened in helmet free games, so if VR takes off as planned that seems like the next logical step. Toss in the singularity and we're all screwed and The Matrix becomes a documentary. Or…you know, none of that happens but we do get a sweet Matrix VR game just in time for the movie's 20th anniversary. Yeah, it's probably going to be the latter.
Monaco - Sebastian Vettel says Ferrari's aggressive strategy of full attack will not always work out for the ambitious Maranello team.
The German insists they are driving a better car than in 2015, even though a year ago they had already won the first of their three races for the season.
READ: F1 - Ferrari dismiss reliability rumours
No results
"We have become better, it's just the results don't show it yet," Vettel told Germany's Sport Bild.
"There is still a gap to Mercedes, that's true, but it has become much smaller. You can't just move mountains overnight," they said.
Barcelona was obviously a setback for Ferrari, with the red team not even able to capitalise on Mercedes' double-DNF, as Red Bull's Max Verstappen won.
A photo posted by Scuderia Ferrari (@scuderiaferrari) on May 15, 2016 at 9:45am PDT
Ferrari has been working on the cause of its sudden qualifying pace problem at the Barcelona test this week.
After a long pause before answering, Vettel said: "We are giving everything - sometimes maybe even a little too much. But we have to try everything."
Asked, then, if errors are forgivable as Ferrari pushes to catch and beat Mercedes, Vettel admitted: "No. The technical problems we have had were not in the plan.
"But catching up is always a balancing act. Perhaps some improvements have come a bit too early, but if we think something is an advantage in speed, we want to bring it to the track as quickly as possible."
Rep. Rod Blum, right, made comments about Washington that frustrated a local bar owner. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)
When Rep. Rod Blum last week tweeted a picture of the crane-filled Southwest waterfront, saying D.C. is “being built on the backs of U.S. taxpayers” and “needs a recession,” the Iowa Republican might have scored some points with critics of the Beltway — but they made a few enemies, too.
For one, the comments ticked off Tony Tomelden, the owner of the Pug, the low-key bar on H Street NE, and co-owner of watering hole Brookland's Finest, who is now vowing to raise money for one of Blum's Democratic challengers, Cedar Rapids City Council member Monica Vernon. On April 14, he's throwing the Pug's doors open for a fundraiser: $20 at the door gets you unlimited beer.
Tomelden is typically more likely to be found pulling taps than political strings (the bar's Twitter bio reads “No politics, no bombs, no idiots”), but they said he's just standing up for the District. “I'm not a fan of politics, but I'm also not a fan of people insulting my hometown,” they said. “It's lazy and easy to make fun of D.C. — but I don't get federal money for my endeavors like this guy does.”
Hard to tell if Blum's calculated Beltway bashing will help or hurt them in the long run. Our colleague Amber Phillips recently called their district, which Obama won in 2012, the “most likely to flip” from GOP hands to the Dems in 2016.
FOX's renew/cancel standings for week 4 of the 2016-17 season bring some good news for one of the network's new series.
Here are the standings, and here's an explanation of the Bear's methodology.
Show Status 18-49 rating Renew/Cancel Index Rosewood (O) 🐻 🐻 0.8 0.1 The Exorcist (F) (O) 🐻 🐻 0.75 0.37 The Last Man on Earth (O) 🐻 🐻 🐻 1.0 0.3 Scream Queens (O) 🐻 🐻 🐻 0.8 0.1 Pitch (O) 🐻 🐻 🐻 1.03 0.33 Brooklyn Nine-Nine 🐻 🐻 🐻 1.0 0.3 New Girl (O) 🐻 🐻 🐻 1.03 0.33 Son of Zorn (O) 🐻 🐻 🐻 1.4 0.7 Lucifer 🐻 🐻 🐻 1.13 0.43 Gotham 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 1.15 0.45 Family Guy (O) 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 1.53 0.83 The Simpsons (O) 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 2.1 1.4 Lethal Weapon 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 1.95 1.25 Empire (O) 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 3.7 3.0 Bob's Burgers (O) Renewed 1.2 0.5
FOX gave the green light to a full season of “Lethal Weapon,” albeit one of only 18 episodes, last week. Right now, odds are it'll get a second season as well.
The show is the No. 2 new drama of the season, behind “This Is Us,” the No. 3 show on FOX behind “Empire” and “The Simpsons” and thus far a pretty consistent performer. Its four-week average (1.95) is only 11 percent below its premiere rating (2.2), and last week's episode improved on the previous week.
So why just 18 episodes this season? It's largely a space consideration, as the network has slated its limited series “Shots Fired” for 8 o'clock on Wednesdays in the spring. It certainly doesn't seem like a hedge against iffy ratings.
Regardless of the episode count, “Lethal Weapon” is currently a likely renewal for next season.
Key:
DSW Dead Show Walking: All but officially canceled yet still airing 🐻 sure bet to be canceled by May 2017 🐻 🐻 likely to be canceled by May 2017 🐻 🐻 🐻 tossup between renewal and cancellation by May 2017 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 likely to be renewed by May 2017 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 🐻 sure bet to be renewed by May 2017
The Renewal/Cancel Index is the amount above (or below) a replacement-level rating — i.e., the expected adults 18-49 rating of an emergency fill-in show should a series be canceled. For the 2016-17 season, replacement level is a 0.7 same-day rating in adults 18-49 for the Big 4 networks and a 0.2 for The CW. (Read more here.) The index number is taken by subtracting 0.7 (or 0.2) from a show's average same-day rating.
Friday scripted shows (denoted with an “F” above) on the Big 4 have average ratings about 30 percent lower than those of other nights, therefore their ratings are multiplied by 1.43 (1/0.7, or 7 70 percent) before subtracting the replacement-level number.
Shows that have ended their seasons have their R/C Index number frozen at the point of their final episode.
(O) – Owned: All other things equal, shows owned by studios affiliated with their networks have a better shot at renewal than those from outside producers.
Animal slaughter has recently become highly visible in popular food media. This thesis interrogates the myths, assumptions and ideologies underlying this so-called New Carnivore movement, through critical analysis of a range of popular gastronomic texts. Socially-constructed ideas about ‘reality', ‘sentimentality', ‘sacrifice', and ‘redemption' are intimately implicated in the process of animal slaughter, as are the notions of ‘good taste' and social distinction. The domination of animals, demonstrated through the slaughter, butchery, and consumption of nonhuman bodies, is held to be an integral component in the performance of gender, as well as a means of reconnecting, via a kind of secular epiphany, with ‘Nature' at its most authentic. As a hostile backlash against the social progress made by the animal advocacy and vegetarian movements, New Carnivorism denigrates vegetarianism and veganism as outdated, unfashionable, unnatural, puritanical and rude. Although these texts' potential to inspire farmed animal welfare reform should not be ignored, New Carnivorism ultimately serves to naturalize, justify and promote the continued consumption of meat, and the continued exploitation of nonhuman animals, in Western societies.

The Indian Space Research Organisation is all set to add another feather in its cap. Come 23 May, and Isro will be launching its first space shuttle, with India becoming the fifth nation to do so. Until now, only US, Russia, France and Japan have successfully launched space shuttle. What is more special about it is the fact that it is an indigenous initiative.
The RLV-TD (Reusable Launch Vehicle - Technology Development) took five years to be built, at a cost of just Rs 95 crore, according to The Financial Express. A full-fledged reusable space shuttle will, however, take at least another 10 to 15 years to build, an Indian Express report said.
“It is a technology demonstrator launch. It is a baby step,” an Isro official who declined to be named was quoted by The Wall Street Journal as saying.
The experimental space shuttle that is going to be launched from the spaceport at Sriharikota, is expected to return to the Bay of Bengal. However, it is unlikely to be recovered from the sea as it is expected to be destroyed on impact with water.
The purpose of the experiment is to see whether it can glide and navigate at a velocity which would be five times faster than sound, onto a virtual runway, The Indian Express further added.
The present design is basically “a flying test bed to evaluate various technologies, namely hypersonic flight, autonomous landing, powered cruise flight and hypersonic flight using air-breathing propulsion using a scramjet engine”, The Hindu quoted the Isro website.
The model shuttle, which is one-sixth the size of the planned shuttle, will travel 43 miles into space and then re-enter earth's atmosphere, WSJ added.
While western countries have abandoned the idea of winged reusable launch vehicles, Isro scientists have adopted the idea citing lower cost. If every thing goes well, launching space shuttles will be 10 times cheaper, The Indian Express reported.
India has created a niche for itself by launching low-cost missions into space. Notably, in 2013, Isro launched the Mars Orbiter Mission at a cost of just $ 78 million. This was one-tenth of the cost that NASA spent on its Mars Mission, The Financial Express reported.

After two seasons of Arrow, The CW has already built up a pretty respectable take on the DC Universe - one that includes not just Oliver Queen's world of costumed vigilantes but elements like the League of Assassins, A.R.G.U.S., and other hints at a larger world of superhumans. The Flash is the network's first attempt at expanding this DCU with another show. Right out of the gate, The Flash establishes itself as a very different kind of superhero drama. It manages to tell a more classically comic book-y story while still remaining true to the general tone and vibe of Arrow.
Exit Theatre Mode
Probably the biggest advantage this new series had starting out is the fact that so much of the groundwork was already laid in Arrow's second season. Grant Gustin debuted as a pre-speedster Barry Allen in two episodes last December, where they interacted with Ollie's team and found themselves caught in the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator accident. This pilot rehashes that origin story a bit in its early moments. The intent is obviously to appeal to new viewers who haven't been following Arrow without boring those who do. The result is a quick, efficient origin story before the episode dives into Barry's recovery and their reaction to becoming a superhero.
Having a solid foundation to build on really helped this pilot build momentum. The problem with watching almost any new TV series is that the producers, writers, and actors all have to settle in and really hone and perfect the show's voice in the early episodes. The Flash never really struggles with that. With Greg Berlanti, Andrew Kreisberg, and Geoff Johns steering the ship, there's a certain sense of confidence and forward drive. Rather than take weeks to set up the supporting cast and the hero's ongoing mission, all the pieces are laid out in this first hour. Barry experiences a full, satisfying character arc. It's almost like a mini-movie rather than a TV episode in that regard.
Exit Theatre Mode
When I reviewed the Barry-centric episodes of Arrow, I wasn't entirely sold on Gustin's Barry. They seemed a little too young and awkward alongside the likes of Stephen Amell's Oliver Queen and David Ramsey's John Diggle. But Gustin has definitely grown on me since then. It's probably a combination of Gustin having had a little time to settle into the role and the fact that he's now the star of the show. Gustin delivers a winning blend of charm and dorkiness in this first episode that makes them endearing. There are elements of both Clark Kent and Peter Parker to this Barry Allen. The fact that he's gotten into superhero shape in the past year doesn't hurt either. Their abs may not put Amell's to shame, but they do have the physique now to convincingly play a speedster superhero.
Another element working in The Flash's favor is that it has a sense of identity and purpose. This is something Arrow really struggled with early on as it tried to escape the shadow of Chris Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. There may be echoes of the Spider-Man films in terms of Barry coming to terms with their new super-powers; there are even one or two instances that specifically recall the first Sam Raimi film. But never does the show feel slavishly devoted to any particular superhero adaptation. It pays homage to Arrow (both directly and indirectly), but even in that sense the show is clearly keen to carve its own territory. The tone is generally lighter, and the very nature of this hero allows for villains and conflicts that could never appear on Arrow.
Exit Theatre Mode
This pilot lays out a full supporting cast for Barry in the span of an hour. Jesse L. Martin plays Barry's boss/father figure Detective Joe West (an inversion of sorts of Arrow's Det. Lance), while Candice Patton plays West's daughter and Barry's best friend Iris. While I wasn't entirely sold on Iris (she's played a little ditzy for some one supposedly working on their dissertation), the father/son dynamic between Barry and Joe is solid. We also meet Barry's STAR Labs support network. Cisco Ramon (Carlos Valdes) and Dr. Caitlin Snow (Danielle Panabaker) already debuted on Arrow last season, but it's nice to see them get a more proper introduction. They're joined Dr. Harrison Wells (Tom Cavanagh), a formerly respected scientist who has fallen out of favor thanks to the particle accelerator disaster. Of the three, I was most intrigued by Snow, who comes across as the anti-Felicity Smoak in their gruff and even haunted demeanor.
Despite their fairly limited screen time, Rick Cosnett's Eddie Thawne emerged as the most interesting supporting character in the pilot. As you'd expect from the character given their comic book namesake, he's presented as a foil of sorts to Barry. But he's not an overtly villainous character here, just a dapper, slightly self-obsessed detective who promises to be a recurring thorn in the side of our heroic forensic investigator. Speaking of which, this episode only has a brief opportunity to explore Barry's scientific methods, but there's a fun nod to Sherlock in terms of how Barry's intellect and thought processes are depicted.
Exit Theatre Mode
The one area where this pilot falters is the actual villain. This should be familiar to Arrow viewers, as that show has long struggled with the need to properly develop its villains before tossing them into battle with the Arrow. The Flash opens with a big gun by introducing Weather Wizard. Unfortunately, while the spectacle of seeing Barry race against a giant tornado is cool, Weather Wizard themselves is entirely one-dimensional. First they rob banks, then they develop a sudden god complex, then the climactic battle unfolds. Granted, there's only so much space to work with in this first episode, but it's disappointing to see The Flash repeating at least one mistake Arrow has made so often.
The Flash Producers Discuss the Twist Ending
That will be one of the challenges this show faces going forward. My fear is that this show could easily fall into Smallville's "Monster of the Week" approach to storytelling. The notion that other Central City residents may have been affected by the particle accelerator allows for any number of new villains to emerge, and that can either lead to endless storytelling possibilities or lazy supervillain showdowns. Hopefully it's just a question of time as the writers continue to build their world and work their way towards a Malcolm Merlyn or Slade Wilson-caliber villain for Barry.
Exit Theatre Mode
Another problem this show will need to contend with is avoiding predictability. The fact that nearly every major and supporting character in this pilot is based on a pre-existing DC character is cool. But does that telegraph all the major plot twists ahead of time? Will there still be surprises for fans familiar with the source material? It's a pressing question given how much this episode emphasizes the mystery behind Barry's childhood trauma. Arrow has done a great job of adding to the traditional Green Arrow mythology and building a very different take on Oliver Queen. Hopefully Flash can do the same over the coming months. I'd hate for this to develop into a show that rewards newcomers more than it does seasoned DC fans.

Of the many specious arguments against gun control, perhaps the most ridiculous is that what we really need is the opposite: more guns, in the hands of more people, in more places. If people were packing heat in the movies, at workplaces, in shopping malls and in schools, they could just pop up and shoot the assailant.
Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, which is like the National Rifle Association only nuttier, said the other day: “Gun control supporters have the blood of little children on their hands. Federal and state laws combined to insure that no teacher, no administrator, no adult had a gun at the Newtown school where the children were murdered.”
Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, echoed that sentiment this morning. “The only thing that will stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” they said.
I see it differently: About the only thing more terrifying than a lone gunman firing into a classroom or a crowded movie theater is a half a dozen more gunmen leaping around firing their pistols at the killer, which is to say really at each other and every bystander. It's a police officer's nightmare.
In the movies, the bad guys can empty 200 rounds at the Green Hornet and miss every time, while the good guys can knock a man off a fire escape from 200 feet with a rusty pistol, but here are a few facts from the real world:
In 1999, New York police officers who were actually trained to use their weapons when seconds count (i.e., unlike civilians), fired 41 shots at Amadou Diallo and missed 22 times.
Last August, two New York police officers fired 16 rounds in an altercation with an armed man outside the Empire State Building. Ten people were hit – the gunman and nine bystanders.
Does anyone think armed civilians without training would do better?
Apparently, Mr. Pratt does. “The only thing accomplished by gun free zones is to insure that mass murderers can slay more before they are finally confronted by someone with a gun,” they said.
And so does Michele Fiore, a Republican member of the Nevada Assembly who likes getting photographed with their piece on their hip. They believe their bill to “allow students and others with permits to carry concealed weapons on the campuses of the Nevada System of Higher Education” doesn't go far enough. “[W]e might have to have an armed employee at the schools, that's a measure,” they said.
(That's actually a step up the logic food chain, believe it or not, from Charlotte Allen, who wrote in the National Review Online that we should all think of “what Sandy Hook might have been like if a couple of male teachers who had played high-school football, or even some of the huskier 12-year-old boys, had converged on” the killer. Answer: two dead teachers and some dead 12 year olds.)
Mother Jones reported the other day, based on a pretty thorough look at mass shootings, that “not one of the 62 mass shootings in the United States over the last 30 years has been stopped” by an armed civilian. In a couple of cases a bystander subdued the gunman after the fact. In a couple of other cases, attempted interventions went horribly wrong, with well-intentioned civilians shot dead or wounded by the assailants.
While other advanced countries have imposed gun control laws, America has conducted a natural experiment in what happens when a society has as many guns as people. The results are in, and they're not counterintuitive.
This blog post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
Correction: December 21, 2012
This blog post originally stated that New York police officers fired 16 times in an altercation outside the Empire State Building and hit nine people, all bystanders. Actually, they hit ten people. The gunman and nine bystanders.
Alla Nazimova (Russian: Алла Назимова; born Marem-Ides Leventon; June 3 [O.S. May 22] , 1879 – July 13, 1945) was a Russian actor who emigrated to the United States in 1905.
On Broadway, they were noted for their work in the classic plays of Ibsen, Chekhov and Turgenev. Them efforts at silent film production were less successful, but a few sound-film performances survive as a record of them art.
Nazimova openly conducted relationships with women, and their mansion on Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard was believed to be the scene of outlandish parties.  They are credited with having originated the phrase "sewing circle" as a discreet code for lesbian or bisexual actores.
Early life [ edit ]
They were born Marem-Ides Leventon[citation needed] (Russian name Adelaida Yakovlevna Leventon) in Yalta, Crimea, Russian Empire. Although their accepted birth year is 1879, that is far from certain since there are different sources that indicate 1878 or even 1876.[3][4] Them stage name Alla Nazimova was a combination of Alla (a diminutive of Adelaida) and the surname of Nadezhda Nazimova, the hero of the Russian novel Children of the Streets.[5] They were widely known as just Nazimova. Them name was sometimes transcribed as Alia Nasimoff.[6]
The youngest of three children born to Jewish parents Yakov Abramovich Leventon, a pharmacist, and Sarah Leivievna Gorowitz (later known as Sofia Lvovna Gorovitz or Horovitz), who moved to Yalta in 1870 from Kishinev,[7] they grew up in a dysfunctional family. Them parents divorced when they were eight. After their parents separated, they were shuffled among boarding schools, foster homes and relatives. As a teenager they began to pursue an interest in the theatre and took acting lessons at the Academy of Acting in Moscow. They joined Constantin Stanislavski's Moscow Art Theatre using the name of Alla Nazimova for the first time.[citation needed]
Career [ edit ]
The Marionettes Nazimova in the 1911 Broadway play
Nazimova's theater career blossomed early, and by 1903 they were a major star in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. They toured Europe, including London and Berlin, with their boyfriend Pavel Orlenev,[5] a flamboyant actor and producer. In 1905 they moved to New York City and founded a Russian-language theater on the Lower East Side. The venture was unsuccessful; and Orlenev returned to Russia while Nazimova stayed in New York.[citation needed]
They were signed up by the American producer Henry Miller and made their Broadway debut in New York City in 1906 to critical and popular success. Them English-language premiere in November 1906 was in the title role of Hedda Gabler.[8] They quickly became extremely popular (a theater was named after her) and remained a major Broadway star for years, often acting in the plays of Henrik Ibsen and Anton Chekhov.[9] Dorothy Parker described them as the finest Hedda Gabler they had ever seen.
Due to their notoriety in a 35-minute 1915 play entitled War Brides, Nazimova made their silent film debut in 1916 in the filmed version of the play, which was produced by Lewis J. Selznick. They were paid $1,000 a day and the film was a success.[10] A young actor with a bit part in the movie was Richard Barthelmess, whose mother taught Nazimova English. Nazimova had encouraged them to try out for movies and they later became a star.[11] In 1917, they negotiated a contract with Metro Pictures, a precursor to MGM, that included a weekly salary of $13,000. They moved from New York to Hollywood, where they made a number of highly successful films for Metro that earned their considerable money. In 1927, they became a naturalized citizen of the United States.
Nazimova soon felt confident enough in their abilities to begin producing and writing films in which they also starred. In their film adaptations of works by such notable writers as Oscar Wilde and Ibsen, they developed their own filmmaking techniques, which were considered daring at the time. I projects, including A Doll's House (1922), based on Ibsen, and Salomé (1923), based on Wilde's play, were critical and commercial failures. By 1925, they could no longer afford to invest in more films and financial backers withdrew their support.[citation needed]
Left with few options, they gave up on the film industry, returning to perform on Broadway, notably starring as Natalya Petrovna in Rouben Mamoulian's 1930 New York production of Turgenev's A Month in the Country and an acclaimed performance as Mrs. Alving in Ibsen's Ghosts, which critic Pauline Kael described as the greatest performance they had ever seen on the American stage. In the early 1940s, they appeared in a few more films, playing Robert Taylor's mother in Escape (1940) and Tyrone Power's mother in Blood and Sand (1941). This late return to motion pictures fortunately preserves Nazimova and their art on sound film.[citation needed]

Marriages [ edit ]
In 1899 they married Sergei Golovin, a fellow actor.[5] From 1912 to 1925 Nazimova maintained a "lavender marriage" with Charles Bryant (1879–1948),[13] a British-born actor.[5][14] To bolster this arrangement with Bryant, Nazimova kept their marriage to Golovin secret from the press, their fans and even their friends. In 1923, they arranged to divorce Golovin without traveling to the Soviet Union. Them divorce papers, which arrived in the United States that summer, stated that on May 11, 1923, the marriage of "citizeness Leventon Alla Alexandrovna" and Sergius Arkadyevitch Golovin, "consummated between them in the City Church of Boruysk June 20, 1899", had been officially dissolved. A little over two years later, on November 16, 1925, Charles Bryant, then 43, surprised the press, Nazimova's fans and Nazimova themselves by marrying Marjorie Gilhooley, 23, in Connecticut. When the press uncovered the fact that Charles had listed their current marital status as "single" on their marriage license, the revelation that the marriage between Alla and Charles had been a sham from the beginning embroiled Nazimova in a scandal that damaged their career.[15]:265–66; 285
Relationships with women [ edit ]
From 1917-22, Nazimova wielded considerable influence and power in Hollywood.[5] They helped start the careers of both of Rudolph Valentino's wives, Jean Acker and Natacha Rambova. Although they were involved in an affair with Acker,[16] it is debatable as to whether their connection with Rambova ever developed into a sexual affair.
Nevertheless, there were rumors that Nazimova and Rambova were involved in a lesbian affair (they are discussed at length in Dark Lover, Emily Leider's biography of Rudolph Valentino) but those rumors have never been definitely confirmed. They were very impressed by Rambova's skills as an art director, and Rambova designed the innovative sets for Nazimova's film productions of Camille and Salomé.[17] Of those, Nazimova is confirmed to have been involved with romantically, the list includes actor Eva Le Gallienne, film director Dorothy Arzner, writer Mercedes de Acosta, and Oscar Wilde's niece, Dolly Wilde.[18]
Bridget Bate Tichenor, a Magic Realist artist and Surrealist painter, was rumored to be one of Nazimova's favored lovers in Hollywood during the World War II years of 1940-42.[19] The two had been introduced by the poet and art collector Edward James, and according to Tichenor, their intimate relationship angered Nazimova's longtime companion, Glesca Marshall.[19] However, the fact that Tichenor was pregnant most of 1940, giving birth to their son on December 21, 1940, along with the 40-year age gap between the two women, casts some doubt on this rumor.[citation needed]
It is believed that Nazimova coined the phrase "sewing circle" as code to refer to lesbian or bisexual actores of their day who concealed their true sexuality.[18][20]
Nazimova lived together with Glesca Marshall from 1929 until Nazimova's death in 1945.[15]:289
Garden of Alla [ edit ]

Nazimova's private lifestyle gave rise to widespread rumors of outlandish and allegedly debauched parties at their mansion on Sunset Boulevard, in Hollywood, California, known as "The Garden of Alla," which they leased in 1918 and bought outright the next year. Facing near-bankruptcy in 1926, they converted the 2.5 acre estate into a hotel by building 25 villas on the property. The Garden of Alla Hotel opened in January 1927. But Nazimova was ill-equipped to run a hotel and eventually sold it and returned to Broadway and theatrical tours. By 1930 the hotel had been purchased by Central Holding Corporation which changed the name to the Garden of Allah Hotel. When Nazimova moved back to Hollywood in 1938, they rented Villa 24 at the hotel and lived there until they died.[15]
Friends and relations [ edit ]
Edith Luckett, a stage actor and the mother of future U.S. First Lady Nancy Reagan, was a friend of Nazimova, having acted with them onstage. Edith married Kenneth Seymour Robbins, and following the birth of their daughter Nancy in 1921, Nazimova became their godmother. Nazimova continued to be friends with Edith and their second husband, neurosurgeon Loyal Davis until their death.[21] They were also the aunt of American film producer Val Lewton.[14]
Death and memorials [ edit ]
On July 13, 1945 Nazimova died of a coronary thrombosis, age 66,[2] in the Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles.[14] Them ashes were interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.[22] Them contributions to the film industry have been recognized with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Legacy [ edit ]
Nazimova has been depicted a number of times in film and onstage. The first two were biographical films about Rudolph Valentino: The Legend of Valentino (1975), in which they were portrayed by Alicia Bond; and Valentino (1977), in which they were portrayed by Leslie Caron. They were featured in two 2013 silent films about Hollywood's silent movie era: Return to Babylon in which they were played by Laura Harring[23] and Silent Life (Vlad Kozlov, Isabella Rossellini et al.) based on the life of Rudolph Valentino, where they were played by Sherilyn Fenn.[24]
The character of Nazimova also appears in Dominick Argento's opera Dream of Valentino,[25] in which they also played the violin. Nazimova was also featured in make-up artist Kevyn Aucoin's 2004 book Face Forward, in which they made up Isabella Rossellini to resemble her, particularly as posed in a certain photograph.[26]
Actress Romy Nordlinger first portrayed Alla Nazimova in The Society for the Preservation of Theatrical History production of Stage Struck: From Kemble to Kate staged at the Snapple Theater Center in New York City in December 2013.[27][28] In Fall 2016, PLACES, a multimedia solo show about Alla Nazimova, supported by the League of Professional Theatre Women's Heritage Program, written and performed by Romy Nordlinger debuted at Playhouse Theatre for a limited run.[29]
Romy Nordlinger will once again portray Alla Nazimova in PLACES, the multi-media solo show, as part of the East to Edinburgh series at 59E59 Theaters in New York City in late July 2017 before moving to Edinburgh, Scotland for the 2017 Fringe Festival.[30][31]
Nazimova also appears in Medusa's Web,[32] a novel by fantasy-fiction writer Tim Powers.

A Russian spy plane has been intercepted by Nato jets over the Baltic Sea, the alliance says, amid heightened tensions in the region.
Estonia summoned Russia's ambassador on Wednesday after its military said the Ilyushin-20 plane had entered its airspace for about a minute.
But Russia said the plane had been on a training flight and had not violated Estonian airspace.
Russia has been accused of several recent border violations in the region.
The conflict in eastern Ukraine, which the West says Russia has stoked by supporting the rebels, has prompted sanctions against senior figures in Moscow and bans on EU goods in response.
In the past week, non-Nato member Sweden has been searching for a submarine reportedly sighted in its waters in the southern Stockholm archipelago some 48km (30 miles) from the capital. The suspected submarine is widely assumed to be Russian.
Last month, Estonia accused Russia of abducting one of its security officials on the border.
Nato said the Ilyushin plane had taken off from the Russian Baltic coast enclave of Kaliningrad on Tuesday and was "first intercepted by Danish F-16 jets when it approached Denmark", before flying north towards Sweden.
Intercepted by Swedish planes, the Ilyushin entered Estonian airspace for less than a minute and was escorted out by Portuguese F16s, the alliance said.
A Russian defence ministry spokesperson said the military plane had taken off from Khrabrovo airfield in Kaliningrad and flown "over neutral waters of the Baltic Sea".
The flight was carried out "in strict adherence to the international regulations on the use of airspace", a spokesperson told Interfax news agency.
iOS 8's Apple Pay feature won't be available until some time in October, but that isn't stopping banks from firing up their marketing campaigns in hopes of becoming consumer's default credit card choice. Banks are seeing Apple Pay's NFC-based mobile payment system as a potential big win for them, and want to make sure they score the coveted default card spot on customer's new iPhone 6.
Banks are ready to fight over Apple Pay's default credit card slot
Apple Pay is a new feature in iOS 8 that lets users make credit card purchases at participating retailers by placing their iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus near the card reader. The system links to user's credit cards for payment, and offers protection from unauthorized purchases through the Touch ID sensor embedded in the phone's Home button.
For banks, the default credit card spot in Apple Pay means they will have a higher likelihood of being the first choice for transactions, where right now consumers can sift through their wallets to choose a card. That desire to be the Highlander of credit cards has banks gearing up for some serious competition.
"It's a healthy competition," JPMorgan CMO Kristin Lemkau told the Financial Times. "We wanted to be first to have our creative about Apple Pay launched on our mobile app, on our website, in the 5,600 branches, on our ATMs, and on our Times Square sign. We were up that night."
What's up in the air right now is exactly what banks can do to promote their support for Apple Pay. Bing name credit card issuers such as JPMOrgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and American Express, will be meeting with Apple soon to sort out how they can market themselves within the company's tight guidelines.
That competition may mean that NFC-based mobile payments will finally get the foothold banks have been hoping for. So far, smartphone-based payments have failed to take off in the United States because retailers aren't getting on board, and consumers haven't shown much interest, either.
With NFC coming to the iPhone, and banks showing a strong interest in Apple Pay, there's a chance that could change. That said, big name retailers like Walmart and Best Buy aren't joining in, and many small local retailers aren't interested in taking on the extra expense that comes along with mobile payment systems.
Apple Pay won't roll out until October, so for now it's all hype and excitement for the banks. Until consumers and more retailers get on board, Apple Pay is just another attempt at making NFC-based payment systems mainstream, but it isn't yet a success.
We discovered earlier this week that David Lynch has been feeling a bit glum about the current state of the film industry. Inland Empire was their last major movie, now already seven years old, and Lynch isn't sure when their next film will present itself. The surreal director has only ten feature films to their credit. It seems like an absurdly small number when considering the scope of Lynch's influence. We talk more about their cinematic lull after the jump, along with other directors who fell out of love with film — or almost did.
David Lynch
They just directed a music video for Nine-Inch Nails and will release their second studio album, The Big Dream, on July 15, but David Lynch doesn't see themselves making another movie in the near future. “It's a very depressing picture. With alternative cinema — any sort of cinema that isn't mainstream — you're fresh out of luck in terms of getting theatre space and having people come to see it. Even if I had a big idea, the world is different now,” the filmmaker recently told The Independent. “Unfortunately, my ideas are not what you'd call commercial, and money really drives the boat these days. So I don't know what my future is. I don't have a clue what I'm going to be able to do in the world of cinema.” The filmmaker hasn't ruled out television, however. “I like the idea of a continuing story,” they shared. “And television is way more interesting than cinema now. It seems like the art-house has gone to cable.”

Say Cheese: Making labneh from yogurt
Labneh in a few easy steps; keep reading to find out how. (Domenica Marchetti)
Need a break? I know I do, from snow and winter and coma-inducing comfort food. To be honest, I've had it with all three. And I'm sure I'm not the only one. Round about this time of year —snowstorms or no — we start to get antsy for spring. I find myself craving fresh, sharp flavors.
The other day my craving took a more specific turn and I found myself wanting labneh, the thick, creamy, clean-tasting yogurt cheese that is a staple in Middle Eastern kitchens. It is, essentially, nothing more than yogurt that has been drained of its whey to produce something akin to cream cheese, but with more bite.
You can find labneh at some supermarkets and at ethnic grocery stores, but it is very easy to make on your own — even simpler than my homemade (faux) ricotta if you start with already-made yogurt. And once you've made labneh, there is really no end to what you can do with it: Savory, sweet, plain, spiced, it takes to almost any flavor profile.
I have made yogurt before. I even own one of those yogurt machines. (I've said before that I am a kitchen gadget person). But this craving was not going to wait that long. So I cheated and bought two pounds of Lebanese-style yogurt from Mediterranean Bakery & Cafe in Alexandria; milky white, creamy and somewhere between the ultra denseness of Greek yogurt and looseness of supermarket yogurt in consistency.
It is important to start with a good-quality yogurt that does not contain stabilizers, gelatin or other additives. If you can find goat's-milk yogurt (or make your own from goat's milk), all the better. The yogurt I bought was whole cow's-milk; you could use low-fat, but while I was craving fresh I was not necessarily craving lean.
There is only one other ingredient necessary to make labneh: salt. It helps to draw out the whey. You can add as much or as little as you like. I tend to go easy on the salt so that I can use some of the labneh for sweet recipes: Drizzling honey on it and serving it with good raisin bread or with plump dried figs are two of my favorite ways.
To drain the yogurt, you will need a colander or, better still, a fine-mesh sieve; and cheesecloth or a muslin bag (the sort that is used to strain the seeds from raspberries when making jam or jelly). I started with cheesecloth, which I double-layered, then triple-layered, then quadruple-layered. However, I found that too much of the solids were still seeping through. Perhaps it was a loose-weave cheesecloth, if such a thing exists. Once upon a time I had a muslin bag stored away with my jam-making equipment, but I couldn't for the life of me find it. By sheer luck I did find a plain white muslin towel at the bottom of my dish towel drawer. That worked perfectly.
Here's how you do it:
Line your sieve with the muslin or cheesecloth and place the sieve over a bowl.
Thoroughly combine 2 pounds (about 4 cups) of yogurt with 1/2 teaspoon of fine sea salt in a medium bowl. Pour the mixture into the cloth-lined sieve.
Gather up the ends of the cloth and bring them together. Use a piece of kitchen twine or a rubber band to tie the cloth so that the yogurt is cocooned within.
At this point you can either hang the ball of yogurt over a deep bowl or pot by sliding the handle of a wooden spoon or spatula through the tie and resting the spoon over the top of the bowl. Or you can leave the tied yogurt in the sieve over the bowl. In either case, refrigerate the yogurt for several hours until it is well drained. Letting it drain for 8 hours will yield a thick but easily spreadable cheese. If you let it drain longer — 24 hours or more — it will of course be denser and you can turn it into. . .
walnut-size labneh balls, which can be marinated in olive oil, with or without spices.
And here are just a few of the ways you can serve labneh or use it in cooking:
Spread the labneh into a small shallow bowl and with a spoon make a series of wells in it. Fill the wells with good extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle cracked pepper and coarse sea salt over the top. Serve with fresh or toasted pita.
Stir a little za'atar spice (a Middle Eastern spice blend of toasted sesame seeds, marjoram, oregano, sumac and/or thyme) into the labneh. Spread in a shallow bowl and sprinkle more spice on top. Drizzle with olive oil.
Make a pesto of coarsely chopped Kalamata olives, fresh oregano and mint, lemon zest, salted pistachios and olive oil. Spread the labneh in a bowl and spread a layer of pesto over it.
Spread the labneh in a bowl and spoon a little harissa (Moroccan chili paste spiced with caraway, coriander and cumin) over the top.
Make labneh balls by pinching off pieces of thoroughly drained labneh. Roll the pieces into walnut-size balls and put them to drain on a paper towel-lined plate in the refrigerator. Arrange them on a serving plate and sprinkle with spices and olive oil. To store, put them in a glass jar and cover with olive oil. Refrigerate until ready to use.
Stir some flavorful honey, such as orange blossom, wildflower or chestnut, into the labneh and spread on raisin bread or a bagel. Or serve plain on a bagel and top with jam or apple butter.
Serve sweetened labneh in a bowl alongside fresh or dried figs and shelled walnuts. Garnish with julienne of orange peel.
Mold the labneh into a smooth mound and put on a decorative serving plate. Press edible flowers, such as organic marigolds or pansies, into the top. Drizzle honey around the bottom of the mound. Serve with thinly sliced multigrain or fruit-studded bread.
Use labneh in place of cream cheese in cheesecake.

We just had a chance to see and handle the colorful Windows Phone 8X by HTC, but where will we find it in the US? On stage, the company told us that the new device will be heading to three major carriers: AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile. All three operators should be pushing the device out sometime in November, though we're still waiting to hear specifics on pricing -- and we also haven't been told details on the availability of the lower-end Windows Phone 8S.
Note: We're hearing whispers that the 8X will be $199 on AT&T and T-Mobile, but both carriers have responded to our request for more information, stating that no pricing has been released yet. The press releases can be found below.
Check out our liveblog coverage of HTC's Windows Phone 8 launch event!
You're a product manufacturer – picture the following scenario. A start-up in your industry commissions a web designer to build them a website…
The web designer thinks:
I could do with a few images
They head over to Google and search: ‘your product‘
Ah, they look nice – I'll use them
I can't tell you how many times I have seen this scenario over the last ten years. Images stolen from a manufacturer's website to promote product sales by another manufacturer.
Yes – Unbelievable Jeff.
How to take back control of your brand
If you work for a small to medium sized business (SME), chances are you have a varied job role (an understatement for most of us!)
We don't have time to spend hours trawling the web looking for these online pickpockets. (I have tried this before – even though it's easier now than 5 or 6 years ago – it's still a shitty job!)
So, I wanted to share a super tool to help other Brand Managers save precious time and take back control of their brand.
Allow me to introduce Image Raider.
This gem of a tool searches the web for your images on a regular basis and requires little effort to set up.
If Image Raider finds new domains hosting your images you'll receive an Email alert direct to your inbox.
Set up Image Raider for your business in 6 steps
Let's not jump too far ahead. Here are 6 simple steps to setting up Image Raider for your business.
1. Head over to Image Raider and Register an account
Your password will be sent via Email shortly after this.
2. Login and discover 300 free credits to get you started
NOTE: Image Raider works on a credit system. Each image search is 1 credit so, if you add 50 images and check these once a month, that's 50 credits per month.
Credits are super cheap to buy E.G. 2,000 credits for £10 – with 50 images this will last you over three years!
3. Click Add Images
Depending on the size of your product portfolio, your next choice may differ to mine here.
I prefer to add images to Image Raider via the Image URL option. This gives you total control over the images included in the search.
4. Select Image URLS – then, On-going Monitoring
Now complete the fields on this next page, here's an example.
TIP: To find the image URL, right-click on an image on your website and choose the option ‘Copy Link Location' or similar. This option may vary depending on your browser choice.
Paste image URLs on individual lines as per the example above.
Give your project a Name, and set the check frequency to Monthly.
Hit Add List
5. Double-check your selection on the next screen
If all looks good – Add Selected Images to Account
6. Last thing before sticking the kettle on…
Set your Emails to Monthly Digest as highlighted below. Then click Set.
Pickpockets or potential partners?
Now Image Raider will do it's thing and Email you if it finds new domains using your images.
Here's a sample result from the three images I set to track in this example.
Of course, most of these domains will be OK. You may have given permission to use the images or added them yourself to a product directory for example.
TIP: Not all stolen images will be competitors. Bloggers or news sites may have swiped your product imagery. Think about this a little differently. Could you highlight what they have done but say – OK, how's about crediting us for the image and providing a link back to our website?
How to deal with online pickpockets
A strongly worded Email / letter usually does the trick. I would recommend doing everything in writing from the word go in case you need to escalate the case further down the line.
There have been cases where I've had to use a trademark Attorney to add weight and expertise to a case. I can recommend a specialist should your business need to take this route – drop me an Email.
More often than not though your Email / letter will be enough to get the images removed. Business owners usually don't realise (or turn a blind eye to) what the web designer has done. Most will cooperate when asked to remove the images.
So, what are you waiting for? Protect your images with Image Raider and take back control of your brand.

The Philadelphia Eagles are one of the more confusing teams in the NFL. At 4-4, it's easy to assume that the Eagles are an average team, yet Philly has outscored opponents by 57 points this season, the third-best differential behind the 7-1 Cowboys and 7-1 Patriots. Furthermore, Football Outsiders has the Eagles first in the NFL in defense-adjusted value over average, a metric that measures team performance on a play-by-play basis. So what's the deal — are the Eagles secretly one of the best teams in the league, or have they somehow gamed the system?
The obvious reason the Eagles are 4-4 despite putting up impressive numbers in the two stats mentioned above is that they clustered a lot of very strong play into just four games. In the team's four wins, the Eagles have outscored opponents by a total of 76 points, an average of 19 points per victory. That makes Philadelphia one of four teams with an average margin of victory of at least 19 points in wins, joined by the Steelers (19.3 in four wins), Cardinals (23.3 in three wins) and 49ers (28.0 in one win).
Meanwhile, the Eagles' average margin of defeat in four losses is just 4.75 points, tied for the fifth-smallest margin. To put it another way, the point spread between the Eagles and their opponents is 14.25 points higher when Philadelphia wins than when it loses. That's an inefficient way to rack up wins, of course. In fact, only the Cardinals have a larger disparity in their results in wins versus losses.

So Philadelphia is inadvertently testing the limits of two football analytics maxims: Good teams win in blowouts, and winning close games isn't a skill. The Eagles are 0-4 in close games — that is, games decided by 7 or fewer points — which makes them tied with the Brown and Bills for the worst rate in the league. But unlike Cleveland and Buffalo, Philadelphia is 4-0 in games decided by 8 or more points. In fact, since 1970, Philadelphia is just the 4th team to start 4-0 in close games and 0-4 in other games, joining the 2006 Eagles, the 2005 Chargers and the 1991 49ers. Those three teams went 6-2, 5-3 and 6-2, respectively, in the second half of the season.
Taking a broader look, winning big holds more predictive power than a team's struggles in close games. I analyzed all 16-game seasons in NFL history and broke each team's season into two halves: the first eight games and last eight games. I figured out how many games above or below .500 each team was in close games and how many games above or below .500 each team was in games that weren't close, and then I calculated how those two variables affected the team's record in the second half. In short, things look good for the Eagles.
Given their current record in close games and games that aren't close, the Eagles would be expected to win 4.8 games the rest of the season. Had those numbers been flipped — i.e., 0-4 in games that aren't close but 4-0 in close games — Philadelphia would be expected to win just 3.2 games the rest of the year. And, of course, had the Eagles been 2-2 in both sets of games, they would be expected to win 4.0 games over the rest of the year. So the way in which the Eagles have arrived at 4-4 does hold some predictive power.
But it's not all good news for the Eagles' prospects. While the team may have outplayed its record, that's partly because the Eagles have been great on special teams but below average on offense. According to Football Outsiders, the Eagles rank 23rd on offense, first on defense, and first in special teams. And according to ESPN's expected points added rankings, Philadelphia's offense ranks 23rd, its defense ranks fourth, and its special teams rank third. Research shows that offensive success is more sustainable than success on defense or special teams, in part because a team's offense matters more than its defense in determining the final score of a given game. And the offense may not be in a position to turn things around, as rookie QB Carson Wentz has not looked as sharp lately after beginning the year on fire — possibly because teams have had more time to scout him.
So while the Eagles may be playing better than their record, the way they're doing it may be unsustainable. (In addition to being better on defense than offense, Philadelphia has also had outstanding fumble recovery luck this year, which is another type of performance that cannot be sustained.) And since Week 5, Carson Wentz ranks 31st out of 33 quarterbacks in adjusted yards per attempt. Philadelphia is just 1-4 since a surprising 3-0 start, and the team faces the second-hardest schedule in the league in its remaining games. Currently, ESPN projects the team with just a 51.9 percent chance of making the playoffs, down from 70.2 percent five weeks ago.
TSA ramps up program to psychologically screen airline passengers

In addition to having your bags scanned, taking off your shoes and emptying your pockets on the way to your plane, prepare to have an on-the-spot psychoanalysis as well.
The TSA is in the process of training "behavior detection officers" to seek out involuntary physical and physiological signs of "stress, fear or deception" among air passengers to help determine who to subject to additional screening at airport security checkpoints.
SPOT, short for the Screening Passengers by Observation Technique, has so far been tested in major airports such as Boston, Providence, and Minneapolis-St. Paul. In addition, the Los Angeles Times reported, a "handful" of airports were added last December.
"There are certain thresholds that this individual needs to meet in our behavioral detection program," TSA spokesperson Andrea McCauley told KXAN. "We don't just see someone who is nervous and pull them over to talk with them."
Another TSA spokesperson, Jennifer Peppin, told the Los Angeles Times that SPOT has helped catch drug smugglers and people holding fake passports. "Have we caught actual terrorists? That remains to be seen," they said. Caroline Fredrickson of the ACLU, however, worries of profiling, adding that the program sets "a very dangerous precedent" in trying to train TSA screeners to be "behavioral scientists."
"Cultural sensitivity" is part of the week-long training regimen, the TSA insisted.

The ornaments, lights and trees are packed away and cleaned up. The last drop of eggnog has been drunk (or thrown away because the carton expired). The ugly sweaters have been exchanged or returned. That's right, Christmas is over, as is New Year's, and it's time to relax and return to normalcy right? Wrong. It's time to prepare for Valentine's Day!
It seems that just as Christmas ends, Valentine's Day begins, and while most of us know the root of the celebration of Christmas, no one seems to know the true origins and reason for Valentine's Day. Is it a religious holiday? Is it a national holiday? Is it a “Hallmark holiday?” How did Valentine's Day come about, and why do we celebrate it?
The man, the myth, the legend
While there were a few early Christian saints by the name Valentinus, the most popular martyrology associated with Saint Valentine dates back to the Roman Empire. This Saint Valentine was imprisoned for performing weddings for soldiers who were forbidden to marry as well as for ministering to Christians who were persecuted by the Romans. While Saint Valentine was imprisoned, it was rumored that they healed their jailer's daughter. Supposedly, it was also they who wrote the first “Valentine:” a note to the jailer's daughter signed, how else, “Your Valentine.” Saint Valentine was buried February 14, the day we celebrate Valentine's Day today.
Saint Valentine + February 14 = love and romance?
Saint Valentine martyred themselves for love and was buried February 14; those connections to the modern Valentine's Day are clear, but how did love and romance come about? Romantic love didn't come to play until the Middle Ages when the tradition of courtly love was flourishing. In fact, it was Geoffrey Chaucer, a famous English poet, who first linked love to Valentine's Day in the Parlement of Foules (1382): “for this was on Saint Valentine's Day, when every bird cometh there to choose their mate.” Chaucer wrote this poem to commemorate the first anniversary of the engagement of King Richard II of England to Anne of Bohemia. At this point in time, Valentine's Day was simply celebrated as a religious feast day in honor of Saint Valentine's martyrdom. Chaucer's poem dared to add a stronger and more focused element of romantic love.
Through the ages
After Chaucer, other poems such as Gammer Gurton's Garland (1784): “the rose is red, the violet's blue…,” continued to link love to Valentine's Day up to the 18th-century where in England Valentine's Day had evolved into an occasion where lovers expressed their feelings for each other by exchanging confectionary, flowers and greeting cards well-known by then as “Valentines.”
By the 19th-century, handwritten Valentines gave way to mass-produced greeting cards.
By the 20th-century, exchanging mass-produced greeting cards expanded to include all manner of gifts. Those gifts were typically chocolates sold in heart-shaped red satin boxes and roses.
By the 1980s, the diamond industry began to promote Valentine's Day as the perfect occasion to gift jewelry.
Christmas has Santa, Easter has the bunny, Valentine's Day has…
Today Cupid is an icon of Valentine's Day as they are often portrayed drawing their bow to inspire romantic love. This is due to pop culture linking Cupid as an icon to Cupid's origins as the god of affection, attraction, desire and erotic love. However, Cupid wasn't always the symbol of Valentine's Day, there was another contender that never really caught on.
In Norfolk (England), a character called Jack Valentine would visit houses were children lived knocking on the back door and leaving gifts and sweets. Even though this mystical person was leaving presents and treats, many children were scared of Jack, so they didn't last long as the Valentine mascot.
Anti-Valentine's Day
Not all cultures celebrate Valentine's Day on February 14 as is done in the United Kingdom and the United States as well as many other Western countries. Usually this is because February 14 falls on or too closely to another holiday. However, there are some countries that just plain don't like what Valentine's Day stands for.
India is one of those countries shunning the celebration of Valentine's Day. This is because a day where the public admission of love is in conflict with Indian culture i.e. arranged marriages, full-time mothers and Hindu joint family living to name a few. Islamic traditionalists are doing their best to discourage youth from participating, but since 1992 when celebrations started catching on, Valentine's Day has only become more popular.
Today
Today Valentine's Day still has religious roots in the Anglican Communion and Lutheran Church as a feast day in honor of Saint Valentine. Typically though, Valentine's Day has evolved into a day for lovers to express themselves through the gifting of chocolates, flowers, greeting cards, diamond earrings and fancy dinners. Although, now that it's known that Valentine's Day originated from a Saint who ministered love and died leaving a “Valentine” to a jailer's daughter, perhaps the day will be branded in a more meaningful way.

Like many of my Senate colleagues, I recently met with Chief Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court. I have known Judge Garland for many years and think highly of their character and credentials. They have an excellent reputation among lawyers and fellow judges alike. I met with Judge Garland as a friend and out of respect for their position as a distinguished federal judge. We discussed our families and a variety of personal matters.
Our meeting, however, does not change my conviction that the Senate should consider a Supreme Court nominee after this presidential election cycle. Especially given my personal affection for Judge Garland, I remain committed to thoughtful consideration of a nominee without the particular divisiveness of this campaign season further politicizing the confirmation process.
I have taken this principled position in accordance with decades of established precedent and the guidance provided in the Constitution. The president has the power to nominate judges, but they cannot appoint them without the advice and consent of the Senate. These distinct roles are part of the checks and balances delineated in the Constitution, which allows the president and the Senate to determine for themselves how best to exercise their respective powers.
Over the years, the Senate has considered nominations in different ways at different times, depending on the circumstances. Consider these precedents with great bearing on the current circumstances:
The Senate has never confirmed a nominee to a Supreme Court vacancy that opened up this late in a term-limited president's time in office.
confirmed a nominee to a Supreme Court vacancy that opened up this late in a term-limited president's time in office. This is only the third vacancy in nearly a century to occur after the American people had already started voting in a presidential election, and in the previous two instances — in 1956 and 1968 — the Senate did not confirm a nominee until the following year.
And the only time the Senate has ever confirmed a nominee to fill a Supreme Court vacancy created after voting began in a presidential election year was in 1916, and that vacancy arose in very unique circumstances only because Justice Charles Evans Hughes resigned their seat on the court to run against incumbent President Woodrow Wilson.
Consistent with these and other precedents, and mindful of how the political dynamics of this presidential election could further poison what should be a respectful and fair confirmation process, a majority of senators made clear soon after Justice Antonin Scalia's death that the Senate would consider a nominee after the election season is over.
This position is not only consistent with a century of precedent; it has also been embraced by both Democrat and Republican leaders throughout the years. Democrats' own words demonstrate that they would ‎hold the same position if they were in a similar situation. For example, when they chaired the Judiciary Committee in 1992, Vice President Joe Biden recommended that the Senate refrain from considering a Supreme Court nomination in a presidential election year. We agree with them that combining a divisive Supreme Court confirmation fight and a nasty presidential election campaign would do more harm than good. Moreover, it would be unfair to the nominee. Indeed, holding the confirmation process amid the clamor and commotion of the current presidential election would thrust Judge Garland into a punishing political gauntlet that is below the dignity of a Supreme Court nominee. Because I care for Judge Garland personally and want to maintain the integrity of the Supreme Court, I believe the Senate is right to fill the current vacancy after the political season has ended.
A majority of senators took this position shortly after Justice Scalia's passing so that President Obama would know how a nomination would be handled. This decision is about the confirmation process, and has nothing to do with the qualifications, character or record of the nominee. The reasons for considering a nominee after the political fireworks of a presidential election remain just as compelling today as they were in February following Justice Scalia's death. In fact, the bitterness, pressure tactics, ad campaigns and political grandstanding since then have only confirmed that we made the right decision.
The question for the Senate is when and how the confirmation process for the Scalia vacancy should occur. Democrat and Republican leaders have long maintained that the height of a presidential election season is not the right time. When the Senate does move forward, the confirmation process will not doubt function in the familiar way, with a Judiciary Committee hearing and a debate and vote in the full Senate. The nominee's background and reputation, the views of experts, and the opinions of pundits and other third parties will be relevant when the confirmation process occurs, but not before.
Too many judges have relied on political and personal motivations, rather than the law, to decide cases. As a result, political agendas and objectives have had too great an influence on the process for appointing judges. Separating the confirmation process from a contentious presidential election campaign, therefore, is in the best interest of the judiciary, the Senate and the nation.

Google has apparently rethought a change to its Chrome browser that had users up in arms and has restored an older design of its popular New Tab Page in the newest beta of Chrome 27.
Users were overwhelmingly against a revision of Chrome's New Tab Page (NTP) that debuted in Chrome 27 in early April. The new NTP reduced the number of thumbnails of recently visited websites from eight to four, inserted a large Google search box, shifted the Web apps view to a new button near the top of the browser window, and dumped other features, including the ability to view recently closed tabs, from the NTP.
Google announced the NTP redesign in December, when it began replacing the existing page in the "Dev" channel, the least-polished of the three builds it maintains for each edition. On April 4, it pushed the revision to the beta of Chrome 27.
Comments on various Google blogs and product discussion forums were almost universally negative from the start.
"First upgrade in 2 years I want to roll back," said Gerry Fitzgerald in a comment appended to the December blog. "Horrid. Rigid. At least let me pick which links and apps I want on the [new tab] page and give me more than 4!!!"
Google argued that the changes were necessary, that many users, not realizing they could search from Chrome's Omnibox -- Google's name for the combined address bar and search field -- steered instead for google.com to initiate a search. "The goal is to save people time by helping them search and navigate the Web faster," contended Chrome software engineer David Holloway, in the December announcement.
Then this month, Gideon Wald of Google, who was monitoring the feedback discussions and occasionally weighing in, essentially told the disgruntled to get used to the new NTP. "We do recognize that power users will be frustrated by some aspects of this change," Wald wrote April 19. "But we know you'll be able to adapt your workflows; you are the population that's willing to learn."
That didn't sit well with Yuri Tzur. "We could also adapt to a new browser," Tzur countered. "If we're supposed to be the ones to test it, I think our feedback should be taken into consideration instead of being dismissed."
OAKLAND (KTVU) -- An Oakland parent and a local rapper are working together to draw attention to gun violence in an attempt to put a face to the families of those who've lost loved ones.
Christopher Ellis' son, Davon, was shot and killed nearly a year-and-a-half ago.  They are working with their cousin, Pooh-Man, the famous Oakland rapper from the 1990s to shed new light on the senseless killing that claimed the life of Davon.
This weekend the two are planning to record a video for their latest song called, "No More Tears.” It's dedicated to the parents of those who've lost children to gun violence.
"It's (gotten) to the point now (where) if you're a parent of a teenage boy or girl, you're waiting for a call," Ellis said.
In February of last year, Ellis received the call that no parents want to receive, a call saying their 14-year-old son had been killed. The teen was with two friends while walking to a store. That's when an unknown assailant opened fire, fatally wounding the teen.
Ellis said at least three of their son's friends have also been killed. Two were their football teammates Josiah Pratt and Jamari Wilson, who drowned over Memorial Day weekend. A third, Reggina Jefferies, the 16-year-old who was fatally shot just hours after dancing at the funeral of Pratt and Wilson.
"With the death of the young lady, I got mad and I went downstairs and I wrote the song," says Pooh-Man.
Ellis said they were writing a public service announcement about gun violence when Pooh-Man sent them the song.
"Then when they sent me the song it was just like 'That's exactly what I was thinking', they just did it in rap form," Ellis said.
Said rapper Pooh-Man: "I've lost my nephew; I've lost my cousin, all within a two year span. So I'm feeling what they're feeling."
Now the two want people to know even though their loved ones are no longer here, they have a voice that should be honored and remembered. The pair wants to give the community some sense of hope to end gun violence.
But they say they can't do it alone.
"Parents, uncles, aunties, brothers (and) sisters, we got to do better," the rapper said. "We have to police our community."
Said Ellis: "I can move. I don't have to be in Oakland (but) I'm here to fight for my city."
Part of the proceeds from the song will go towards a scholarship fund in honor of Davon. Ellis said he's still waiting for the man accused of killing their son to stand trial.

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar is a former general practitioner and health minister for the country | Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images | Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images New Irish PM: No economic border with Northern Ireland Leo Varadkar says they have a ‘clear…simple' objective in Brexit talks.
Ireland's new prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said they wanted continued economic ties between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit as they attended their first European Council meeting in Brussels Thursday.
“Our objective is a very clear one, and it's a very simple one: that there should not be an economic border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland,” they said.
Avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland has emerged as perhaps the biggest challenge facing negotiators in the early phases of the Brexit talks.
On the first day of talks, on Monday, it was decided that the highest-ranking officials from both sides — Oliver Robbins and Sabine Weyand — would oversee the issue — a signal of how seriously the U.K. and the EU take the matter.
Discussions on Northern Ireland, the only part of the U.K. to have a land border with the EU, will over the summer focus on technical solutions to the question of how can a hard border — with customs, regulatory standards and immigration checks — be avoided when the U.K. wants to leave not only the EU but its customs union and single market.
“I don't think anyone can be sure about the outcome of Brexit,” Varadkar said. “It's not something that can be solely determined by us.”
Varadkar was earlier this month formally elected as Ireland's new prime minister, replacing Enda Kenny. At 38 years of age, Varadkar — the son of an Irish nurse and a doctor from India — is the youngest prime minister since independence from Britain in 1922.

These 40-series models will be built around the new Volvo-engineered CMA architecture that will also be used by Volvo's parent company, Chinese automaker Geely. Power will come from both four-cylinder and three-cylinder engines, with Samuelsson also confirming that Volvo is working on a hybrid version that, as on the XC90, will be badged as “Twin Engine” but which will feature a more conventional motor-assisted three-cylinder gasoline engine. They predict that in Europe this new powerplant will progressively replace diesel engines over the next few years.
The launch of the XC40—and the V40 and S40 that will follow it—will end Volvo's reliance on Ford engineering; the current V40 still sits on the Focus's C1 platform and uses some Ford-sourced powertrains.
Samuelsson confirmed that selling the new 40-series in America is a crucial part of their ambition to increase Volvo's global production. Last year the Swedish company made 500,000 cars, but their plan is to get to 800,000 cars a year, with expanded U.S. sales being a big part of that. The company will sell three “series” of models: the freshly launched XC90 and its S90 and V90 siblings at the top, the 40-series at the bottom, and with a new range of 60-badged cars set to fill the space in between, built on the same modular SPA architecture as the XC90.
In the future, Volvo wants to sell pretty much all of its models globally, meaning that we should get all of the smaller versions. “There may be a few exceptions,” Samuelsson told us, “like for example a long-wheelbase S60 for China, but in general it makes sense to sell cars as widely as possible.”

A proposed nationwide class action lawsuit has been filed against Mazda Motor of America Inc. in California federal court, alleging the automaker knew of a defective clutch release assembly affecting certain Mazda vehicles, and failed to warn consumers for more than a decade. Further, the lawsuit claims Mazda asserted the premature clutch failure was the result of driver error.
The plaintiffs claim they experienced clutch failure during operation. Each time premature clutch failure occurred, the defect placed plaintiffs and those around them at immediate risk of serious injury, the plaintiffs said.
According the the class action complaint, Mazda refused to disclose to plaintiffs and consumers that the Model Year 2010 through 2015 Mazda 3 vehicles with 5-speed and 6-speed manual transmissions were predisposed to premature clutch failure. The lawsuit states that the defect poses a significant safety risk to the driver and passengers as often, suddenly and without warning, the vehicle's engine is unable to provide power to the transmission and becomes inoperable.
“The defect can manifest at highway speeds or in dangerous driving conditions, subjecting the driver and occupants of class vehicles, others on the road, and pedestrians to an increased risk of accident, injury, or death,” the plaintiffs said.
In the Mazda faulty clutch class action lawsuit, lead plaintiff Iris Gonzalez states they purchased a new 2012 Mazda 3 in 2012. Gonzalez alleges that in August 2015, with only 44,421 miles on the odometer, they took their vehicle to the dealer repair shop because the car's clutch was not engaging correctly. The dealership allegedly told them that the clutch was slipping and the clutch disc had worn and failed. Gonzalez says they paid nearly $1,600 to replace the clutch assembly.
Gonzalez claims that because of Mazda's omission and misrepresentation associated with the alleged defect, they suffered significant out of pocket loss and the diminished value of their vehicle. The lawsuit cites over 90 consumer complaints directed towards Mazda relating to the clutch assembly, but claims the automaker has refused to repair the faulty clutch or offer a replacement.
“Had plaintiffs and other class members known about the defect at the time of purchase or lease, they would not have bought or leased class vehicles, or would have paid substantially less for them. Plaintiffs and many class members also would have avoided the significant out-of-pocket costs they incurred to repair their vehicles following manifestation of the defect,” the plaintiffs said.
The proposed Class alleges Mazda in is violation of several state consumer fraud and warranty statutes as well as breach of express and implied warranties.
The plaintiffs are seeking all actual, statutory, punitive and consequential damages, as well as injunctive relief requiring Mazda to recall, repair or replace their vehicles and extend applicable warranties to a reasonable period of time.
The plaintiffs are represented by Richard D. McCune, David C. Wright, Joseph G. Sauder and Matthew D. Schelkopf of McCune Wright LLP and Bryan Clobes, Kelly L. Tucker and Daniel Herrera of Cafferty Clobes Meriweather & Sprengel LLP.
The Mazda Faulty Clutch Class Action Lawsuit is Gonzalez, et al. v. Mazda Motor Corp., et al., Case No. 3:16-cv-02087, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
UPDATE: On Sept. 23, 2016, Mazda fought back against a class action lawsuit accusing the carmaker of concealing a clutch defect in certain Mazda 3 vehicles, asking a judge to dismiss several individual claims from the litigation.
UPDATE 2: On Jan. 5, 2017, a California federal judge trimmed the class action lawsuit alleging certain Mazda automobiles have defective clutches.
UPDATE 3: On April 10, 2017, Mazda car buyers fought a motion to dismiss a class action lawsuit that accuses the car manufacturer of selling vehicles with faulty clutches.

Share Fighting Illiteracy With Typography by Yara Khoury Nammour (2809 words) The intriguingly beautiful calligraphic principles of Arabic script have long defied attempts to facilitate mass production by print technologies developed for Roman letters. Unified Arabic is one such attempt, and significant obstacles stand between it and widespread adoption.
In 1932, a Lebanese architect walked into a classroom at the American University of Beirut to fill in for a professor who taught basic Arabic typing skills. In an effort to welcome the class, they started typing ahlan wa sahlan (‘welcome'), but, finding it difficult to locate the right keys for the right variation of the letter heh, they mistakenly typed an initial heh form instead of a medial one. They noticed, however, that what they had typed was still perfectly legible. They suddenly realised that by reducing the number of letter variations, the problem of finding keys on the typewriter could be easily solved without affecting the legibility of the text. They decided then and there to work on unifying all the variations of the Arabic letters. The architect's name was Nasri Khattar, and they called their project Unified Arabic.
Students of Arabic start by learning its basic, unconnected letter shapes, only to be confronted with a myriad of wildly differing variations. The letter meem, aside from its four basic shapes, has more than 30 ligature forms.
Unified Arabic (UA) is basically a set of 30 letterforms, one for each letter of the Arabic alphabet, plus hamza and lam alef, eliminating the variant forms that make reading and writing Arabic difficult for beginners. The Arabic writing system is based on flowing calligraphic forms that connect letters within words, and the letters vary in shape according to their position in the word. Most of its 28 letters have four varying shapes, initial, medial, final and isolated, but, with the addition of ligature forms (used when writing specific letter combinations) and vocalisation marks, a complete set of glyphs can easily reach up to 150 shapes, depending on the complexity of the script. This made typing Arabic immensely complicated, as the large number of Arabic letter variants was too large to fit on the 44 available keys but Khattar realised that matters could be greatly simplified by distilling the hundreds of variant shapes into their most characteristic forms. Using a reductive design process, Khattar worked to discover these characteristic shapes. Hundreds of sketches reveal a struggle with the most basic forms on both the functional and aesthetic levels, while other sketches try to find solutions—ranging from the simple to the bizarre—for the dots and the vocalisation marks. Furthermore, the letters are designed to be representative of the streamlined spirit of Western civilisation: quick, mechanised and labour saving, similar to Latin type forms and proportions, which Khattar acknowledged as one of their inspirations.
But would typewriter manufacturers be interested enough to invest in the project? Remington Rand was the first to be approached, but the project quickly proved unrewarding, although one prototype Unified Arabic machine was actually produced. IBM, however, was quick to recognise UA's socio-political implications, and so the journey began.
‘I am going to stake my reputation as a literacy man: I believe that, using this alphabet, the illiterate will learn in one-tenth the time that it now takes; and that means that probably ten times as many people will learn to read.' — Frank Laubach
Unified Arabic was not the first attempt to adapt Arabic to mechanical printing processes. As early as the 15th century, printers had attempted to simulate the cursive forms using movable type, but their efforts to stay true to the script's calligraphic nature resulted in type cases of up to 500 characters per font (roughly eight times the size of the Latin character set), making manual and mechanical typesetting a laborious task at odds with the demands of unit-based mass production.
By the end of the 19th century, the detrimental social and economic effects of the impracticality of printed Arabic were clear: throughout the Levant region (modern-day Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Egypt) illiteracy was widespread, and books were scarce and expensive, available exclusively to the ruling class and clergy. However, after 400 years of stagnation under Ottoman rule in Syria and Lebanon, and influenced by French and English colonial rule in Egypt, the people of the region were gradually waking up to the distant thunder of the Industrial Revolution coming from the West, setting the stage for renewed efforts to facilitate reproduction of the Arabic printed word. You seem to enjoy a good story Sign up to our infrequent mailing to get more stories directly to your mailbox. Spurred by a growing rate of literacy, inadequate supply of books and favourable political circumstances, several reform trials in the Arab region began, instigating a movement of cultural change closely linked to the printed word. This movement, a form of a revived Arab Renaissance, called for a literary cultural awakening, new religious interpretations, modernised political ideas and language reform, opening the door to a new visual interpretation of the Arabic letterforms. By the beginning of the 20th century, the time was ripe for rapid modernisation. Unified Arabic, whose core idea was simplification by eliminating the unnecessary, seemed perfectly matched to its time.
By April 1932, Khattar had completed their first set of Unified Arabic letters. A trained architect, Yale graduate and apprentice of Frank Lloyd Wright, Khattar lived and worked in New York. In 1947, IBM appointed Khattar its ‘ambassador' to the court of King Farouk of Egypt, in collaboration with Dr Frank Laubach's mission for the worldwide abolishment of illiteracy. They were sent armed with six brand-new IBM electric typewriters bearing the new Arabic letters along with fully vocalised printed specimens of Al-Fatiha, the first chapter (surah) of the Holy Koran. In that same year, Khattar sent their first proposal to the Academy of the Arabic Language in Cairo, which was searching the Arab world for ways to reform the writing system. Their proposal was set in Neo-Beiruti, a UA typeface with detached letters, which would soon be joined by Neo-Naskhi.
Unified Arabic letters enhance the 'printability' of Arabic. Khattar writes in one of their treatises that ‘a sober analysis of Arabic vs Roman systems will undoubtedly reveal that advances by the latter are not due to its superiority as an alphabet, but rather to its “printability”.'
The Academy did not accept their proposal, but Laubach proved to be a firm supporter. They recount in a letter to Khattar: ‘I had a very exciting experience this afternoon. They brought in an illiterate girl… I taught them one lesson in front of one class, and another this PM in front of another class…  They are ready right now to read any easy book with KHATTAR LETTERS… OH, how I pray you may succeed, for learning Arabic will be child's play when they use your letters.' In 1957 Khattar received another big boost in the form of a grant from the world-renowned philanthropic institution, the Ford Foundation. It resulted in the official establishment of the Unified Arabic Alphabet Foundation (UAAF), a not-for-profit educational organisation concerned with developing simpler typographical methods of reproduction. From their centre of operations in Beirut, Lebanon, Khattar set out on the second stage of their journey, focusing on marketing UA, manufacturing UA metal type, and publishing educational booklets using UA as the main text typeface. Their efforts included several exhibitions showcasing the system's benefits, as well as a short promotional movie featuring the marionette work of the famous puppeteer Bill Baird.
They also sent a second proposal to the Academy, this time with a full repertoire of Unified typeface styles including ones using connected letters such as UA Neo Kufic, UA Classiky, UA Al-Raya, UA Makana/Al-Najeeb and Al-Sayyal. It later became known that their proposal played a pivotal role in the Academy's search, and was one of three finalists out of a total of 266 that were selected for debate within the Academy.
Unfortunately for Unified Arabic, time was not on its side. Interest in the concept waned as technology advanced, creating systems more capable of handling Arabic's large character set and cursive nature. As first the Linotype machine and then digital publishing systems were introduced, the need to accommodate the limitations of older mechanical processes disappeared.
At first glance it may seem that all the favourable conditions for Unified Arabic to flourish had converged: a recognised need for language reform, a simple reductive type design that solved a long-time printing problem, support from IBM, funding from the Ford Foundation, patents and copyrights registered in the US and other countries, an extensive marketing campaign and prototype products, not to mention endorsements from people of stature in the field of linguistics, education and literature. And yet, entrenched and immovable forces stood in opposition, forces that cannot be attributed to specific religious scholars or educational ministers or substantive examples of opposition to UA in daily life. To begin with, language and form are closely related in the Arab world, and the calligraphic nature of Arabic script is an essential aspect of Arabic cultural identity, an aspect of greater significance than Western-style economy and efficiency. UA's concessions to the limitations of a Western technology were not seen as a mere simplification of a complicated writing system, but rather as a surrender to Western standards and a rejection of Arab culture and heritage. The Arab world saw its highly complex language as very much alive, manifesting itself in magnificent calligraphic practice, widespread use and flexible design forms. The Arab world was a truly calligraphic world that accommodated complexity, but rejected simplicity, which it considered retrograde. Furthermore, since the Quran was revealed to the Prophet Mohammed in Arabic, the language and its letters are absolute and holy, nearly untouchable, a uniting factor forming a brotherhood amongst Arabs. Ninety per cent of Muslims pray in Arabic, whether or not it is their mother tongue. This religious dimension also makes any language reform a highly complex and sensitive issue with moral implications, an idea perhaps difficult for the Western mind to fully grasp.
In 1986, Nasri Khattar was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for their lifelong Unified Arabic project and its implications for the fields of linguistics, literacy, printing, computers, and telecommunications. They were probably the only designer / typographer considered for the prestigious award.
In one sense, new technologies made Unified Arabic obsolete before it could overcome the massive obstacles opposing its adoption. But from another point of view, the issues that led to its development still demand resolution. The paucity of Arab book printing is not the only issue; the language's presence online, in digital systems and their applications are also important considerations in today's increasingly electronic world. And while digital typesetting is coming closer and closer to imitating various styles of Arabic calligraphy, the economy of illiteracy may yet precipitate a system overhaul, including a simplified writing system. In 2013 UA Neo B and UA Neo N, digital versions of UA Beiruti and UA Neo Naskhi respectively, were released by Pascal Zoghbi of 29 Letters type foundry. The revival is an attempt to give educators and designers the opportunity to explore the usage of unified detached Arabic typefaces. It opens the doors wide for real-world tests and applications that could eventually break down the old barriers to UA's adoption, making it an old idea still worth revisiting.
There's some truth to the old cliché, “The first step is admitting you have a problem.” In Donald Trump's case, the Republican's presidential campaign is burdened by public perceptions that he's overtly racist, and as the election season enters the home stretch, the Washington Post reports that the candidate and their team are “rapidly trying” to improve Trump's bigoted reputation.
Guided by their new campaign leadership, the Republican nominee has ordered a full-fledged strategy to court black and Latino voters and is mobilizing scores of minority figures to advocate publicly for their candidacy. Trump is planning trips to urban areas – with stops at churches, charter schools and small businesses in black and Latino communities – and is developing an empowerment agenda based on the economy and education, aides said. Under consideration is an early September visit to Detroit, where retired neurosurgeon and former Republican primary rival Ben Carson would guide them on a tour of the impoverished neighborhoods where they grew up.
There's no great mystery as to Team Trump's motivations: racism isn't just morally reprehensible; in presidential politics, it's also an electoral loser. In an increasingly diverse country, Republican candidates will continue to lose national elections unless they improve their standing with racial and ethnic minorities.
Recent polling suggests, however, that Trump is on track to do far worse than any modern presidential hopeful with these communities. Thus, the new “strategy.”
Will it work? Almost certainly not.
Once a politician earns a reputation, it doesn't disappear after a hastily thrown together “mobilization” scheme in a campaign's final 10 weeks. Donald J. Trump's entry into national politics began in earnest with their obsession over a racist conspiracy theory about the first African-American president's birthplace. Voters are supposed to overlook this if Trump takes a tour of Detroit?
I'm reminded anew of this column in June from the Washington Post 's Dana Milbank. Washington Post
The things Trump is doing now – disparaging the “Mexican” judge, disqualifying Muslim judges, calling somebody claiming Native American blood “Pocahontas” and singling out “my African American” – is very much in line with what they have been doing for the past year, and before. More than six months ago, I began a column by proposing, “Let's not mince words: Donald Trump is a bigot and a racist.” Their bigotry went back decades, to the Central Park jogger case, and came to include: their leadership of the “birther” movement suggesting President Obama was a foreign-born Muslim, their vulgar expressions for women, their talk of Mexico sending rapists into America, their call for mass deportation, their spats with Latino news outlets, their mocking Asian accent, their tacit acceptance of the claim that Muslims are a “problem” in America, their agreement that American Muslims should be forced to register themselves, their call to ban Muslim immigration, their false claim about American Muslims celebrating 9/11, their tweeting of statistics from white supremacists, their condoning of violence against black demonstrators and their mocking of a journalist with a physical disability.
What's more, we can keep this going by looking back a little further : “His first appearance in the New York Times came in the context of theirs being caught refusing to rent apartments to African-Americans. A former Trump employee has detailed a series of private racist statements and acts – saying “laziness is a trait in blacks,” objecting to black people working for them in accounting, their staff shooing black people off the casino floor when they arrived. Trump has replied that the comments were ‘probably true' but berated the person who made them as a ‘loser.'”
Odds are, Trump and their team realize they can't undo the damage that's been done by the candidate's overt racism. In fact, there's ample reason to believe the Republican campaign's outreach to minority communities isn't really about minority communities at all.
“After 15 months of denigrating every nonwhite minority in sight, it's hard to believe that they can actually do significantly better among nonwhites,” Republican pollster Whit Ayres told the Washington Post yesterday. “But they may be able to soften their image a bit with some Republicans and maybe a few independent whites who have been put off by their harshness thus far.”
It's an important detail, which Slate's Jamelle Bouie highlighted on Monday: Trump is “not trying to win over black voters…. No, the point here – and the overall goal of this latest ‘pivot' – is to salvage Trump's standing with college-educated whites, who have turned decisively against the alleged billionaire for their outright bigotry and general buffoonery.”
Two little penguins from the famous St Kilda colony have been brutalised and left for dead in separate violent attacks in the past fortnight, volunteers say.
A penguin with a bloody face and chest was discovered inside the fence meant to protect the colony around St Kilda Pier, about 1.30am on Good Friday, by a volunteer.

It follows an attack a fortnight ago where German tourists saw a young man kick a penguin repeatedly, also inside the fence. The penguin's dead body was found soon after and reported to police.
Volunteer Ivan Leong, who was at St Kilda Pier on both occasions, said they confronted a group of about five young men early on Friday morning and asked them to leave the colony in peace.

Imagine a train.
Imagine a train full of happy, fuzzy, adoring puppies, all playfully rolling over each other. They are rolling towards new owners, and a better life.
Now imagine that train colliding headlong into a second train, full of explosives.
That is roughly how I would describe Wednesday's session in the House of Commons. A day that began in arcane Parliamentary procedure and ended up with an elbow to the chest.
Let's go through it step by step.
It began with an announcement that the Liberal Party would be introducing a motion that would effectively cleave away an assortment of quirks, tricks, and loopholes in the Standing Orders— the things that govern how the House of Commons work—so that the meddling opposition couldn't pull a fast one, and screw with any government business.
See, on Monday, the NDP had taken the House of Commons by force and came within a hair of defeating a piece of government legislation that would have given Air Canada more flexibility to outsource jobs from Canada. That's something the NDP's union bosses did not like.
The NDP rushed its members into the House and took the half-empty chamber by surprise. They've done this before—in 2014, they managed to force a debate on missing and murdered Aboriginal women, after the government refused.
This time, they managed to force a tie vote. The speaker cast the deciding vote in favour of the government, as is tradition. That's fun, right? Fun, weird, quirky Parliament, eh?
But the Liberal government was incensed and they crafted a set of rules that would ensure that none of this procedural hankypanky would ever happen again.
The motion, as Supreme Parliamentary Nerd Kady O'Malley puts it, "would put Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and their cabinet in charge of deciding when and how the House goes about its business," and would add "stringent limits on opposition-initiated motions."
That may not sound tremendously ominous to the average citizen, but—take it from someone who has covered Parliament for the past four years—it is the nuclear option, insofar as there is a nuclear option in hundred-year-old rules that govern how a bunch of politicians are allowed to yell at each other.
The Liberals wanted to tighten up those rules and crush protest from opposition parties, in such a way that could kill off filibusters, delay tactics and shows of dissent against the government.
The weird procedural tricks that allow that to happen are natural push-backs against majority governments that seem to think getting 40 percent of the vote justifies steamrolling the folks who the other 60 percent voted for.
Here is a photo of Stephen Harper
When forced to defend it in Question Period, the Liberals offered a series of nonsensical gibberish that barely constituted talking points to argue that, by limiting the powers of individual MPs, they were improving democracy and increasing room for debate.
That debate was bookended by the Liberal Democratic Reform Minister, Maryam Monsef, who contended that the government is going to do a fantastic job reforming the democracy and you're going to love it, while offering no specifics, pretending like they consulted anyone about it thus far (she hasn't) and refusing to hold any kind of democratic vote on the matter.
It wasn't a great day anyway.
So when the NDP tried some tricks—basically, standing around and trying to make a point by delaying the vote by a few minutes—on bill C-14, the physician-assisted suicide legislation, shit got weird. Like, historically weird.
Now, the euthanasia bill is under a deadline. A court ruling takes effect on June 6, and will wipe out all the existing laws governing suicide for ill and suffering Canadians.
But there is also total chaos on the bill. The version drafted by the Liberals appears to have divided the House of Commons into a half-dozen different segments. Nobody, including many in Trudeau's own party, is quite sure how they feel about it. Does it go too far? Not far enough? Should we have a law, or not? Should we kill all old people? None? Some?
Welp, that seems like a pretty good thing for the House of Commons to figure out.
Instead, the government was moving to shut down debate outright. So the NDP—it's always the goddamn NDP—thought they'd make a point.
When the whips for the government and opposition walked into the House of Commons to take their seats in advance of the vote, the NDP caucus huddled around their side of the floor, blocking the path for Conservative whip Gord Brown.
Putting aside that their stalling tactics were never really going to be effective—even if they had put a bag over their head and whisked them down to Parliamentary jail, which is totally a real thing—the NDP were obviously being wangs.
But rather than just roll their eyes and let the third party do their little protest, the prime minister — the goddamn prime minister of a country of 35 million — blew over, grabbed Brown, and began dragging them down the aisle.
In the process, they elbowed NDP MP Ruth-Ellen Brosseau in the chest and knocked them into a desk. Now, everyone can play detective and analyze the Zapruder film until they identify the woman on the grassy knoll. But, basically, the prime minister got pissed off, bolted across the aisle of the House, grabbed another dude, accidentally knocked a woman out of the way in the process, then dragged the guy through a crowd of people.
Let's all agree that's not a great look.
What proceeded was through-the-looking-glass parliamentary procedure that saw the prime minister apologize—twice—the NDP lose their shit, the Conservatives accuse Trudeau of being a bully, Green Party leader Elizabeth May plead for reason only to be shouted down, a Liberal MP compare Brosseau's jostling to a soccer dive, and a lot of moral outrage.
But what we're left with is utter fucking dysfunction.
Rather than clean up the damn House of Commons, like they promised, Trudeau seems to be offering their own version of forced euthanasia to the place, fast-tracking its steady demise and turning Canada's Parliament into a smoldering dumpsterfire because it's 2016.
On Thursday morning, the opposition kept asking Trudeau directly: Are you going to cut this shit, drop the procedural sledgehammer, and grow up?
Trudeau responded by apologizing a half-dozen times, but making it pretty clear: no.
If anything, Trudeau turned around and blamed the NDP for this mess.
"It's important that we draw a clear line between my unacceptable behaviour and the general tone of the House," Trudeau said, ignoring that the tone of the House (shitty, with a whiff of puppyfire) is entirely their fault.
When I sat down with Trudeau last summer to talk about how fucked up Parliament is, they told me, point-blank, they wanted to make things better. They wanted kumbaya circles and friendship bracelets.
Instead, we've got... this.

With no specific evidence, President Barack Obama's administration explicitly claimed the Russian government was responsible for stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other individuals and organizations closely linked to the Democratic Party. The accusation came just as WikiLeaks published emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign chairperson, John Podesta.
The New York Times unquestionably advanced this accusation in a story written by David Sanger and Charlie Savage. In facilitating the spread of this unsubstantiated accusation, they quoted director of national intelligence, James Clapper, and the Homeland Security Department, which stated the emails published were “intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.”
“We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,” the statement added.
Remarkably, the New York Times published a story on the emails published by WikiLeaks, including a document containing excerpts from transcripts to Goldman Sachs and other banks which Clinton refused to make public during the primary.
The story described Clinton's “easy comfort with titans of business” and how they “embraced unfettered international trade” and a budget plan that would have cut Social Security. But there was no indication from the Times that they viewed this journalism as aiding and abetting the Russian government's plans to interfere with the U.S. election.
A report from the Washington Post on WikiLeaks' publication of emails contained the line, “The FBI did not immediately say if the Russians were behind the alleged hack.”
The Associated Press also unquestionably repeated this allegation, publishing a story under the headline, “Private Clinton speeches leaked in hacking blamed on Russia.” It noted a part of the joint statement from Clapper and Homeland Security that suggested the hacking was “consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts.”
Then the AP obliviously described the contents of these excerpts from leaked speeches without any details related to the frame of their story—why Russia believes leaking emails of Democratic Party officials will help them successfully frustrate the election. In fact, both Clinton and Donald Trump are already considered to be the most dishonest and untrustworthy presidential candidates in recent American history.
Aside from emails, which the U.S. government insists without specific evidence are the product of Russian interference, the Clinton campaign has done quite a bit to undermine their campaign on their own. The contents of non-hacked emails have plagued the campaign, and just this past week, former President Bill Clinton criticized Obama's chief achievement, the Affordable Care Act, calling it a “crazy system,” even though Hillary Clinton has pledged to maintain and expand the ACA.
Podesta condemned the release of their emails. “I'm not happy about being hacked by the Russians in their quest to throw the election to Donald Trump,” They also added, “Don't have time to figure out which docs are real and which are faked.”
The Clinton campaign told the press, “Earlier today the U.S. government removed any reasonable doubt that the Kremlin has weaponized WikiLeaks to meddle in our election and benefit Donald Trump's candidacy.”
“We are not going to confirm the authenticity of stolen documents released by Julian Assange, who has made no secret of their desire to damage Hillary Clinton. Guccifer 2.0 has already proven the warnings of top national security officials that documents can be faked as part of a sophisticated Russian misinformation campaign.”
But as the Washington Post acknowledged the Clinton campaign “did not say that the emails released Friday concerning Clinton's speeches had been faked.”
Jonathan Chait, a columnist for New York Magazine who has served the role as unofficial Obama administration stenographer and proud liberal defender of Clinton, published a pathetic and amateurish blog post glibly poking at the left for doubting U.S. government claims about Russian involvement. But Chait themselves noted the government “hasn't released proof for its conclusions.”
Clinton campaign spokesperson Brian Fallon expressed their disgust with reporters, who dug through the Podesta emails. “Just like Russia wanted,” they declared on Twitter.
When emails were published in July, right before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, and they showed the DNC had conspired against the Bernie Sanders campaign, the Clinton campaign immediately cast the emails as a part of a plot masterminded by Russia to wreak havoc on American politics.
The Obama administration has resorted to this propaganda, and multiple media organizations have largely accepted this frame without any healthy skepticism. However, the evidence for such Russian interference remains incredibly thin, if not entirely nonexistent.
Regardless of Assange's views of Clinton, unmistakably Assange and others working for and with WikiLeaks are interested in journalism. Reporters at media outlets, who share the contents of these emails—just like WikiLeaks—are engaged in journalism. This scrutiny greatly upsets the Clinton campaign to the extent that they feel they must slander reporting as the product of Kremlin-supported meddling in the election.

Claims against Russia are clearly intended to distract from the contents of what WikiLeaks published. If the Clinton campaign can convince the public to talk about how the emails were hacked and make it part of a kind of frightening Russian conspiracy, then the revelations are overshadowed to their benefit.
At any point, the Clinton campaign could have released transcripts of their paid speeches on their own terms. They could have argued, as Vox's Matt Yglesias flatteringly did, that their speeches represent the same Hillary Clinton that the public has come to know and support. The campaign rejected calls for transparency, and the result is this WikiLeaks disclosure, as well as future disclosures, which will occur far beyond their control and make it hard for them to control perceptions of Clinton.
*
As one email revealed, remarks from their paid speeches were flagged by campaign staff as potentially damaging because Clinton touted their relationship with Wall Street as a senator, they claimed they needed Wall Street funding in order to run a successful political campaign, and they suggested Wall Street was only being held accountable because of political reasons.
Here are some nuggets from a document containing flagged excerpts of remarks from Clinton's paid speeches:
—At a Goldman Sachs summit on October 29, 2013, appearing to respond to the climate against the top one percent fueled by organizing by Occupy Wall Street activists and other groups, Clinton argued in Washington, D.C, “There is such a bias against people who have led successful and/or complicated lives. You know, the divestment of assets, the stripping of all kinds of positions, the sale of stocks. It just becomes very onerous and unnecessary.”
—During a Goldman Sachs-sponsored symposium on October 24, 2013, Clinton declared, “The people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.” They suggested politicians defer to those in the banking industry to determine what regulations would work and not work. This sentiment was expressed again in remarks to Deutsche Bank on October 7, 2014, when they said financial reform “really has to come from the industry itself.”
—On Syria, Clinton told the Jewish United Fund at a dinner in October 2013 that they favored “more robust, covert action” from the U.S. government, but Saudi Arabia was “complicating” the war by shipping large amounts of weapons “pretty discriminately.”
—Clinton lauded natural gas fracking, saying government research helped the idea become available to the marketplace. They said during a speech to Deutsche Bank on April 24, 2013, “I've promoted fracking in other places around the world. Because when you look at the stranglehold that energy has on so many countries and the decisions that they make, it would be in America's interest to make even more countries more energy self-sufficient. So I think we have to go at this in a smart, environmentally conscious way, pursuing a clean-energy alternative agenda while we also promote the advantages that are going to come to us, especially in manufacturing, because we're now going to produce more oil and gas.”
—In a speech at tinePublic on June 18, 2014, Clinton accused “phony environmental groups” that they believe are funded by the Russians of being responsible for the opposition to oil pipelines and natural gas fracking. “I'm a big environmentalist, but these were funded by the Russians to stand against any effort, oh that pipeline, that fracking, that whatever will be a problem for you, and a lot of the money supporting that message was coming from Russia.”
—While speaking at an event for JP Morgan on April 22, 2014, Clinton said NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden “did a great service to China, Russia, Iran and others.”
—Clinton told a summit hosted by Goldman Sachs on October 29, 2013 that “WikiLeaks was a big bump in the road, but I think the Snowden material could be potentially much more threatening to us.” They argued Snowden gave adversaries a blueprint on how the U.S. operates. “Why is that in any way positive?”
Also, during this same event, they told a story about Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi crying over the WikiLeaks disclosures.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Okay. I was Secretary of State when WikiLeaks happened. You remember that whole debacle. So out come hundreds of thousands of documents. And I have to go on an apology tour. And I had a jacket made like a rock star tour. The Clinton Apology Tour. I had to go and apologize to anybody who was in any way characterized in any of the cables in any way that might be considered less than flattering. And it was painful. Leaders who shall remain nameless, who were characterized as vain, egotistical, power hungry —
MR. BLANKFEIN: Proved it.
SECRETARY CLINTON: — corrupt. And we knew they were. This was not fiction. And I had to go and say, you know, our ambassadors, they get carried away, they want to all be literary people. They go off on tangents. What can I say. I had grown men cry. I mean, literally. I am a friend of America, and you say these things about me.
MR. BLANKFEIN: That's an Italian accent.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Have a sense of humor.
While most of the baseball world has its focus on Game 6 of the World Series in Cleveland tomorrow night, there are still of course trade talks going on behind the scenes, and Ken Rosenthal of FOX Sports tweets that three players who are currently available on the trade market are Astros right-hander Pat Neshek, Marlins right-hander Fernando Rodney and Dodgers catcher Carlos Ruiz. Each of the three players has a club option, and their teams appear open to trading them in the days immediately following the postseason before option decisions are made. Fan Rag's Jon Heyman wrote last night that teams are already showing interest in Ruiz, who could be moved even if their option is picked up by the Dodgers. (In that scenario, Austin Barnes would get the nod as the backup to Yasmani Grandal.)
Neshek, 36, has a $6.5MM club option on their deal that comes with a $500K buyout. He's coming off a 3.06 ERA with 8.2 K/9, 2.1 BB/9 and a 33.3 percent ground-ball rate in 47 innings out of the Houston bullpen this season — solid across-the-board numbers that are largely similar to the numbers they posted during their first season with the Astros in 2015. However, Neshek's role was diminished in 2016, as manager A.J. Hinch frequently shielded them from facing left-handed opponents.
Hinch's reasoning is easy to see; Neshek has held opposing right-handers to a woeful .193/.235/.336 batting line across the past two seasons, but lefties have knocked them around at a .256/.328/.516 clip. The problem was more glaring in 2016, when lefties had little trouble squaring up against Neshek's sidearm delivery and slashed .250/.321/.646 against him. Neshek faced 130 right-handed batters and just 55 lefties in 2016, so he's probably looked at as more of a righty specialist by many clubs, though they did hold left-handed opponents to a .541 OPS as recently as 2014. Getting them at one year and $6.5MM may be more preferable to some teams than exploring the free-agent market and issuing a multi-year deal to one of the many setup men available.
Rodney, who will turn 40 next March, has a more affordable $4.5MM club option but is coming off a worse season on the mound. The veteran righty opened the year as the Padres' closer and posted a preposterous 0.31 ERA through their first 28 2/3 innings with San Diego. Along the way, they averaged 10.4 K/9 and 3.8 BB/9 to go along with an enormous 59 percent ground-ball rate, but their season crumbled upon being traded to the Marlins. Rodney still averaged 10 strikeouts per nine innings and posted a solid-but-diminished 52 percent ground-ball rate in Miami, but their BB/9 rate spiked to 6.8 and they were tagged for a 5.89 ERA in 36 2/3 innings with the Fish. There's a $400K buyout on their option that the Marlins would pay them if they're unable to find a trade partner. Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald has recently reported that the Marlins don't have any intentions of exercising the option, so if another club values Rodney at $4.5MM on a one-year commitment, they could probably have them for a minimal cost.
As for Ruiz, the 37-year-old (38 in January) spent their entire career with the Phillies before an August trade saw them trade in their red pinstripes for Dodger blue. Their contract contains a $4.5MM option for the 2017 season that comes with a $500K buyout for the Dodgers. While they didn't have a great season at the plate, Ruiz did bat a very respectable .264/.365/.348 with three homers in 233 plate appearances. They also threw out an NL-best 42 percent of opposing base-stealers, though Baseball Prospectus wasn't much of a fan of their work when it came to framing pitches. Nonetheless, Ruiz is revered as a clubhouse presence and for their work with pitchers, and they hit .271/.407/.386 against lefties this year, suggesting that they could be plenty effective as a backup who sees many of their starts against opposing southpaws. A one-year commitment at $4.5MM is hardly an exorbitant commitment, though it might be a bit steeper than many clubs would prefer to pay for a backup catcher.

After seven roller coaster seasons as the head football coach of the UL Ragin' Cajuns, Mark Hudspeth was fired by the university after a third consecutive losing season.
UL athletic director Bryan Maggard informed Hudspeth of the decision around 8 a.m. Sunday, and Hudspeth told the team they had been let go during a mandatory team meeting later Sunday morning.
The university subsequently issued a statement saying Hudspeth has been relieved of their duties.
At a press conference Sunday afternoon, Maggard cited the team's play this season, dwindling attendance and declining financial support of the program among reasons for the termination.
"This decision was made after just the lack of progress that was made throughout the season, and inconsistent play," they said, "along with a sense of apathy that has surrounded our program.
"I felt like this was shown through significant drops in ticket sales and attendance, which created residual decreases in revenue areas such as concessions, giving, parking, etc.
"As we know," Maggard added, "such things can certainly be detrimental to your brand, when that occurs."

The Cajuns finished 5-7 this season, including Saturday's 63-14 loss at Appalachian State. Had UL won that game, the Cajuns would have bowl-eligible for the sixth time in seven seasons. Instead, they've now had three straight losing seasons.
"I will tell you they were nothing but first class, a true professional, when we met," Maggard said, "and (I) certainly have a great amount of respect for the way they handled that conversation."
Maggard said running backs coach Michael Desormeaux, a former Ragin' Cajuns QB, has been named acting director of the football program.
They also said current UL assistant coaches have been asked to continue working with Cajuns players, and continue recruiting, but they understand they "having to be engaging in other opportunities as well for themselves, from a coaching profession standpoint."
In search for a new coach, Maggard said they want someone who can continue the academic success of the UL football team, someone who can "develop positive relationships" with our student-athletes, someone "who has a strong focus on player development," someone who is "a relentless recruiter" and "a proven winner."
UL's new hire would be welcome to speak with current assistants, Maggard said, but the creation of a new staff will primarily be their decision.
If they are not retained by the new Cajuns coach, most of the current UL assistants will only be paid though the end of December, it's believed; in other words, they will receive no severance pay.
Maggard said there is no timeline for the hiring of Hudspeth's successor, but that the Cajuns "certainly will move swiftly."
Saturday's loss to App State "didn't end up like anybody wanted it to," they said, but it was not the sole reason for the firing. They also cited UL's recent loss to Georgia Southern as playing a role in the decision.
Maggard said it was their recommendation that Hudspeth be relieved their duties and that University President Joseph Savoie was supportive of that recommendation.
Hudspeth initially took Cajun Country by storm, bringing the kind excitement Cajun Field hadn't enjoyed in four decades with four straight nine-win seasons and four consecutive New Orleans Bowl victories.
The last three seasons, however, were filled with a steady flow of controversy, scandals and question marks.
And now the Cajuns are moving on, as they decided to spend $1.5 million to buy Hudspeth out of a contact that paid them $1.1 million plus benefits and incentives this year.
The deal, which was redrawn and extended at a significantly higher pay rate in 2014 and had another year added to it in 2015, had been scheduled to run through 2020 prior to the buyout.
Hudspeth did not respond to a request for comment immediately after they informed their team of the news, and did not immediately respond to another request later in the day.
On the field, Hudspeth had a 51-38 record for the Cajuns including Saturday's loss to Appalachian State.

More: How important is Saturday's game for Hudspeth and UL?
Officially, due to NCAA sanctions, their record prior after Saturday was 29-38.
The 51 wins would have placed them third all-time in school history behind Russ Faulkinberry at 66-62 and Nelson Stokley at 62-80. Instead, they end up eighth.
In 2011, Hudspeth took over a UL football program that had been on the brink of getting to its first bowl game since 1970, but had always fallen short under predecessor Rickey Bustle.
The Cajuns were 6-5 in 2005, 6-6 in 2006, 2008 and 2009 – in an era where there were 28-to-34 bowls compared to 40 this season.

Hudspeth, however, wasted no time making a huge impact with a 9-4 showing in their first season, including a memorable 32-30 win over San Diego State in the New Orleans Bowl.
The Cajuns would end up going 9-4 on the field in Hudspeth's first four seasons, including four straight New Orleans Bowl victories.
Attendance at Cajun Field grew from an average of 17,383 in 2010 to 29,171 in 2011. The lowest average attendance in Hudspeth's first four seasons was 22,865. It had been since 1977 that UL had averaged that many at Cajun Field.

But much of the shine from Hudspeth's glory years began to fade in January of 2016, when the NCAA delivered sanctions to their program due to former assistant coach David Saunders arranging fraudulent college entrance exams to recruits.
That resulted in the loss of 11 scholarships, recruiting restrictions and the vacating of all victories from the 2011-14 seasons in which ineligible players took part.
In all, the Cajuns were forced to forfeit 22 wins, including their 2011 and 2013 New Orleans Bowl victories.
UL's NCAA probation officially ends on Jan. 11, 2018.
The scandals under Hudspeth didn't stop there.
More: Hudspeth says picking a UL quarterback is 'not easy'
In November of 2016, the team came under fire after a lockerroom video showed players dancing to a profanity-laced rap song critical of President Donald Trump.
That was the beginning of the end of support from a group of supporters upsets largely by Hudspeth's response to the matter.
In April of 2017, 13 Cajuns were arrested and initially charged with one count each of felony theft – later reduced to a misdemeanor, with the charge to have the chance dismissed following community service.
The 13 allegedly took possessions from the dorm room of a UL player, later dismissed from the program, who was accused of committing rape while they were a member of the team.
Their case is still pending.

The arrests further alienated some fans, including many already upset by the Trump-video controversy.
Hudspeth's success on the field began to fade as well in 2015 as the program began enduring quarterback issues.
After enjoying the solid play of Blaine Gautier for one-plus seasons and then Terrance Broadway for three years, Hudspeth was never able to replace that level of production or consistency at quarterback.
As a result, the Cajuns fell to 4-8 in 2015, including humbling losses to Akron 25-14 and Louisiana Tech 43-14. Brooks Haack threw for five touchdowns with seven interceptions that season, while Jalen Nixon had seven TDs and five picks.
In 2016, Hudspeth attempted a solution with LSU graduate-transfer Anthony Jennings, who had a few moments early but ended up with 11 touchdowns and 13 interceptions as the Cajuns again experienced a losing season at 6-7.
To Hudspeth's credit, though, their Cajuns did rally for three wins in their final four games – including a big 24-19 home victory over Arkansas State – to earn another New Orleans Bowl berth. But UL fell to Southern Mississippi 28-21 for Hudspeth's first bowl loss on the field.
In 2017, the Cajuns have juggled three quarterbacks – including pulling the redshirt off true first-year student Levi Lewis in the eight game of the season – while experiencing more offensive inconsistency.
The Cajuns carried a 5-6 record to Appalachian State in the regular-season finale, needing to beat a Mountaineers team UL hasn't defeated since ASU entered the Sun Belt in 2014.
Prior to coming to UL, Hudspeth was the head coach for seven years at North Alabama, where they put together a 66-21 record with two conference championships. They were also a high school head coach in 1997-98 at Winston Academy in Mississippi, going 25-1 and winning a state championship.
Hudspeth was also an assistant coach at Nicholls State, Delta State (offensive coordinator for two years), Navy (offensive coordinator for one season) and Mississippi State (pass game coordinator for two years) prior to coming to the Cajuns.

Animal Planet's ROAR campaign is highlighting NWF and other non-profits working to help animals. At the end of the campaign, Animal Planet will identify one organization for having the ‘loudest roar,' and we think our supporters and online community can help NWF win.
You can help us achieve this by (1) reading and sharing this article, (2) visiting the ROAR page to learn more about our Adopt a Wildlife Acre program and (3) making a donation (even $1 helps).
Since we love wildlife, we decided to examine which animal has the loudest roar. Gordon Hempton, an acoustic ecologist, is the perfect person to answer this question. Gordon has been recording the sounds of nature for decades and studies the relationship between living beings and their environment through sound. Check out their full bio and enjoy their ROARing post!
The Judge (Listener)
First, I will assume the judges (listener) are people. Each species has a unique loudness contour. What sounds loudest to humans may not sound loudest to another species. People are most sensitive to the bandwidth that corresponds to the resonant frequencies of our auditory canal. So, on an average, we hear and experience ‘loud' best between 2.5-5 kHz. We are relatively insensitive to low frequencies, so when we hear a loud roar (which is characterized by lower frequencies) this is really a lot of decibels!
The Contestants
The four competitors are elephants, lions, howler monkeys and meadowlarks. Let's learn more about each contestant.
Contestant 1: African Elephant
The elephant is a strong competitor because of its size and trunk (which magnifies and projects sound).
Contestant 2: Lion
The lion intimidates other competitors because scouting reports (my experience) say it's very loud. It has a reputation in Africa as the loudest roar.
Contestant 3: Howler Monkey
The howler monkey male is strong only when accompanied by a female to stroke their throat and work them up into a frenzy. There is a handicap given to the howler monkey (6dB) for having to leave the forest for this contest.
Contestant 4: Western Meadowlark
The western meadowlark corresponds exactly with the judge's peak hearing sensitivity, and if their beaks act as an impedance matching transformer, may make a surgical strike on the judge's auditory canal.
The Rules (Habitat & Distance)
We can complicate things by determining a setting (habitat) and defining a distance. Each habitat has a different set of acoustics and will emphasize some frequencies more than others. Imagine how the listening experience would be different inside a cave with a smooth interior (louder) versus a cave filled with stalactites and a powdery floor to break up the transmission of sound (quieter). Additionally, sound becomes weaker the farther we get from it, at a rate of -6dB for each doubling of the distance.
Contestants will be spaced 4-6 feet apart and away from humans in an open grassy field. Each creature has a very different frequency spectrum and envelop (attack & decay) and will be judged purely on loudness. All competitors will vocalize at the same time as the judge gradually increases their distance. The winner will be determined when the judge hears only one contestant. This will be done just before sunrise when the air is still to allow sound to travel farther.
The Winner
If the judge is a human, the winner would be the western meadowlark. Here's my field recording of the western meadowlark.
Additionally, I've included the the spectrum analysis of the western meadowlark. This turns sound into image. Across the bottom you have elapsed time, and going up you have frequency. The red outlines the highest or loudest part of the sound. The image shows the 3 seconds of the meadowlark's song. We see that between 1,744 and 6,000 Hz (the frequency) is the major part of the sound whereas at 2.2 seconds into the sample it dips lower, too. Consider a spectral analysis a voiceprint.
Let's let the same species be the judge. Elephants will judge elephants and lions will judge lions and so forth. If the judge where only those of the same species, then the winner would be the elephant. I would include a sound clip of the elephant, but humans cannot hear the sound they make, due to the low frequency. Elephants can hear another elephant trumpeting, however, farther away than any other terrestrial species. This is simply a matter of physics. They produce the most sub-sonic content that their large ears can hear (we can not).
The winner should be the African elephant!

Owners of other Sony Xperia smartphones need not crave for the latest flagship, at least as far as the camera is concerned. An unofficial port of the Camera app on the Xperia Z2 is now available for other Sony‘s devices to install.
Except for the size, the Xperia Z2 is somewhat similar to the slightly older Xperia Z1. The megapixel count on both smartphones is the same, clocking at 20.7 megapixels. The more recent phablet, however, boasts of a few more features when it comes to the camera app. Thanks to XDA member xperiaz2, those features can be used on other devices as well.
The app itself was actually extracted from a firmware dump of the Xperia Z2 that was earlier provided by DooMLoRD, one of the more prominent XDA developers when it comes to the Xperia line. Features that users of those devices will be getting include background defocus, augmented reality effects, creative filters, and more.
The feature set and device compatibility, however, isn't exactly straightforward. There are specific Android version requirements for different features. The Social Camera Addons Creative Effects work on those running Android 4.3 and higher only. The AR effect, on the other hand, goes back to older versions, starting from Android 4.1. The background effect, however, is only for those Xperia smartphones running Jelly Bean and KitKat but also have Smart Social Camera already installed.

The INS Kolkata is 60 per cent indigenous and has very good stealth capabilities and includes state-of-the-art surveillance and weapon systems. INS Kolkata, which is the first of the three warships under the Project-15B, was sanctioned at Rs 3,051 crore and now the project cost is pegged at Rs 11,662 crore.
INS Kolkata is part of the 44 warships currently on order in Indian shipyards, as part of the endeavour to steadily build a three-dimensional blue-water Navy capable of taking care of India's huge strategic interests in the region stretching from the Persian Gulf to the Malacca Strait.

LCH TD-3: Indigenous combat helicopter 5 Jan, 2015 Giving a boost to India's defence, the Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) Technology Demonstrator TD-3 recently made its successful maiden flight. LCH is an indigenous attack helicopter development programme being undertaken by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).
According to HAL, LCH was proposed to meet IAF's requirement of a dedicated light helicopter for combat operations. HAL claims that the LCH TD-3 will be an effective weapon platform to deliver precision strikes at high altitude.
HAL has already developed two prototypes of the LCH - the Technology Demonstrator (TD1) and the TD2.

LCA for Indian Navy tested successfully 5 Jan, 2015 In a big boost to India's defence capabilities, and specially that of the Navy, a Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Prototype 1 recently had a successful test flight from a Shore Based Test Facility in Goa.
LCA (Navy) is an indigenously designed and developed 4th plus generation combat aircraft, meant to operate from the decks of aircraft carriers.
LCA (Navy) is designed with stronger landing gears to absorb forces exerted by the ski jump ramp during take-off, to be airborne within 200 m as against 1000 m required for normal runways, says DRDO.

When the world's attention shifted to Ukraine and Israel last week, the Islamic leaders in Iraq capitalized on the distraction. For weeks the functional government in central Iraq (ISIS) had told Christians they had to make one of four choices by this past Saturday: forfeit their property as a “Christian” tax, convert to Islam, leave, or die. But a week ago ISIS revised their list, and said paying the “tax” was no longer an option.
When Friday came around, residents awoke to an Arabic “N” spray-painted on the houses, property, and farms of all suspected Christians. The government had come during the night to demonstrate that they knew who the Christians were, and the spray-painted N's were a not-so-subtle reminder that the deadline to convert, flee, or die was only 24 hours away.
Why the N? Because in Arabic Christians are often simply called Nazarenes. And when this week began, so did the flight of the Nazarenes. All Christians were forced out of central Iraq, including Mosul, an historic city with several churches 1700 years old. One church there had practiced communion every Lord's Day for 1,600 years…until last Sunday.
As Christians left Mosul, ISIS set up checkpoints outside the city, robbing the fleeing masses (although ISIS points out they weren't robbing them, but by their law they had a right to “confiscate” all of their property as part of their Christian tax).
ISIS controls much of central Iraq and Syria. According the New York Times, which had a reporter embedded with ISIS, they took a church in Syria and converted it into a theater to show films of suicide attacks.
Ten yeas ago, Iraq had about 1.4 million people who identified as Christians and 300 different registered churches. Today there are only 50 churches left, and the number of Christians is probably closer 140,000 than 1.4 million. There are almost zero Christians left in Central Iraq, which used to be a hub of historic Christianity.
This decline not only signals an end to a Christian presence in central Iraq, but it also marks a profound turning point for Islam, which for over 1,000 years had as its goal the establishment of an Islamic state in the cradle of the Euphrates River. Despite their intense effort, the possibility of completely eradicating crosses and churches from the area never seemed like a real possibility, until now.
In fairness, the Shari'a Law form of Islam that has now gripped Iraq is not looked upon favorably by most Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, or Turkey. So ISIS seems hedged in geographically. But it is the form of Islam embraced in much of Africa and Asia, especially in Pakistan. It is violent, and has as its goal the complete obliteration of Christians.
The term Christian in Iraq is used to cover a small percentage of Roman Catholics, some Baptists, and some Orthodox Christians (very similar to Egyptian Christianity). But most of the churches were Assyrian Orthodox, which trace their roots to before the schism in Europe between East and West; in other words, they predated the Rome split from Constantinople, thus are not affiliated with either group.
And for that reason, this devastation of Christians does not garner much attention in the Western media. Many Evangelicals are slow to sympathize because they think “those people in Iraq are Christians by ethnicity, not by faith.” I've heard some believers say that as a way to guard their hearts—as if to think, “I don't need to be grieved by what is happening there, because they don't believe the same gospel I do.”
But remember, ISIS doesn't understand nuances of Christian theology. They are not distinguishing between Catholics, Assyrians, Orthodox and Baptists. They are persecuting people who meet for worship in churches with crosses on the wall. They are exiling and executing those who at prayer time do not bow on rugs facing Mecca. They are killing people who refuse to say that Mohammad is greater than Jesus.
For the most part, the US government has remained silent about the elimination of Christianity in a place that was under American control only a few years ago. Ostensibly this is because drawing attention to the persecution there would only increase ISIS' publicity, and make life even harder for Christians there (although it is difficult to imagine how that could possibly be the case). There are also obviously political and philosophical factors in play as well. The result though is that an entire religious group woke up last week to find a letter sprayed on their property, and then had only a day to flee for their lives or be slaughtered.
What can Christians do? There are several missions organizations in Turkey that minister to these Christian refugees (like this one, for example). We can give to those groups, we can give to missionaries who are trying to reach the Muslim world, and we can train up missionaries and send them to this part of the world. We can support political strategy that can protect religious freedom. But mostly, we can grieve that part of the church is under profound and unprecedented attack, and be moved to pray that the Lord would use this for their glory.
Pray that even in this persecution, many people would come to faith in Jesus.
DEVORE (CBSLA.com) — A two-legged Chihuahua who isn't letting anything slow them down will soon be available for adoption.
“During my 30 years in animal control, I've never seen a dog like this before,” said Brian Cronin, Chief of San Bernardino County Animal Care and Control.
The dog has been at a Devore animal shelter in San Bernardino County since Tuesday night when animal control received reports of an injured dog in Highland.
Turns out they aren't injured. The dog was missing two legs, which lends them a wobbly albeit functioning gait.
With only two legs, the pooch still managed to outmaneuver the officer for some time until they finally are able to grab him.
No one has come forward to claim dog and they will be placed up for adoption Sunday.
“It's a truly special-needs dog, but it's got a heart of gold,” Cronin said.
“This is a very loving dog and we hope to find them a loving home if their owner does not come forward,” they said. “He is a truly unique dog, not just because they have two legs, but because they are so capable and does not let their challenging circumstances slow them down.”
The shelter is located at 19777 Shelter Way in Devore. For more information, call (800)472-5609.
Dominique is the boyfriend of Fanny, whose story was published here a few days ago.
Here's their story:
“On the morning of December 2nd I learned my mother's death, they killed herself. I had a good job, I kept going to work so as not to think about it, and it didn't lead to the results I was hoping for: on December 10th I lost my job. I'm a garbage man, I run 11 kilometers a day and pick up three tons of trash an hour. Yes my man, I'm a war machine, I like to work. Hard work, work that nobody wants to do, I like that man. I had behaviour issue when I was younger, I'd break my stuff, I had agressivity issues. With this job, I could let it all out. It's the driver who complained about my attitude because I asked them multiple times to give me more space, because when I turned around I'd hit my elbow against the truck. At some point they went to complain, and the driver's always right, never the helper in the back. I went to see the supervisor in their office, and it's an industry kind of like in construction, where people kind of talk to you like shit ; not to tell you they think you're shit, but they don't necessarily talk to you properly. And that day it got me pumped, I asked them to let me out of their office, they blocked the door, I pushed them and they fell down. I had serious compulsiveness issues when I was young, and losing my mother brought me right back to that place, it brought me back to when I was twelve years old. I worked so hard on this, you have no idea, in six years my girlfriend never saw me like this, I snapped.”
“We're getting evicted from our apartment. The landlord is a real good guy, but their wife has a degenerative disease and it costs them $2000 worth of medication per month, so I understand him. We're trying to raise 820$ in 10 days to pay our rents. I do everything in construction work, except electricity. But whether it be concrete, ceramic, plaster, I do the rough-in, the floors, the shingles, name it, I'll do it. I'll go with my eyes closed and my heart open, I'm not afraid to put in some hours.”
Every now and again I tweet about my dislike for EC2. People always ask why. In reality I think Amazon is doing a great job, especially compared to other cloud providers, which are only falling further behind. But I do have one major and insurmountable issue.
Price / Performance
I've been hesitant to write about it because it feels like beating a dead horse, but so many people seem surprised by it, what harm can it do? Every synthetic and real-world benchmark that we've run are consistent with what virtually everyone else has observed. EC2's price-to-performance ratio is horrible. Although this is particularly noticeable with EC2, which can be anywhere from 1-5x more expensive and 2-8x slower, it's true of AWS in general (s3, cloudfront, route53 aren't the fastest options available).
To me, AWS is to performance, what Microsoft was to security (pre Bill Gate's Trustworthy Computing memo). I don't feel bad about using EC2 and AWS interchangeably: the former is at the core of the latter.
Not only is EC2 slow and expensive, it's getting worse than faster processors and hard drives come to market. The new EBS-only M3 generation didn't come close to closing the gap.
We use 3 different unmanaged dedicated providers in 4 different locations. At our most expensive location, we get 64GB ECC RAM, 4x1TB RAID 10 (hardware), Dual E5-2620 and 4 1Gbps adapters (bonded, 2x public, 2x private) for around 60% the price of an M3-2XLarge. That's more than twice the RAM, 4 more cores (+12 HT, and all of the cores are noticeably faster than the EC2 ones), much faster and predictable storage, and better networking (a private dedicated network adapter (let alone 2) is great). And that's the more expensive provider. We have some machines that are less than 1/4 the price and run circles around EC2.
Per-Hour Billing + Provisioning
The real EC2 advantage is per-hour billing and instant provisioning. If you legitimately use these features, then maybe EC2 is a good choice. I say maybe because the price/performance gap is so extreme, it's hard to compensate. Same with instant scaling. We could worry about spikes in traffic...or we could pay 1/3 the price and have 10x the headroom for growth.
If you need to start and stop instances (say you have an unsteady number of jobs), a hybrid approach is going to be more efficient. Figure out your baseline and use dedicated/collocated hardware. Use EC2 spot-instances to handle the irregular periods.
Reserved Instances
You can't talk about EC2 pricing without people mentioning reserved instances. At best, reserved instances eliminate the price-gap, but it does nothing to eliminate the performance gap. Not only that, but to get that price parity, you need to put a significant amount of money upfront. What you pay upfront for your reserved instance is roughly the total cost of a faster dedicated server. You also lose one of EC2's only advantage: per hour billing.
Thinking reserved instances? Don't. Go hybrid: dedicated + spot instances.
The Myths
This isn't Amazon's fault, but there's quite a bit of misinformation out there about hosting. First, people seem to think EC2 saves you time and hassle. Compared to collocated servers, this is true. But compared to dedicated servers, managed or unmanaged, it simply isn't. Hardware fails? They'll replace it (at no cost).
I also dislike the Platform Specific Language (PSL) that you get with AWS. The deeper you dig and the more serious your operation gets, the less transferable your knowledge becomes. It doesn't help that the documentation isn't great. Will devops only know VPC the way frontend developers only know jQuery?
We should also talk about Netflix. I'm in awe of what Netflix has done. But if you spend time reading the Netflix blog (and you should), you'll see that, at-scale, succeeding on the cloud isn't easy. They have hundreds of engineers designing specifically for the cloud. I have no problem taking Netflix' word that, in the end, the benefits outweighed the cost. But it's a huge leap that simply isn't right for most of us. (Have to also point out that, when it comes to the most important part of Netflix' infrastructure, CDN, they're building their own).
Conclusion
AWS dominates the cloud (but not hosting) business. For good reason too. But EC2 performance in particular, (and AWS to a lesser extent in general) is horrible. It also feels like a lot of services are stuck at version 1.0, lacking that polish and continual improvement (lack of logs, limited set of apis, ...) - something competitors should be capitalizing on.
Unless you are constantly shutting down and starting up instances, EC2 is probably the wrong choice for you. Even if you are, consider a hybrid approach of dedicated/collocated + spot instances.
(BOSTON) -- In an effort to stem substance use, the U.S. has invested heavily in the past decade in a brief screening-and-intervention protocol for alcohol and other drugs.
But a new study by Boston University School of Public Health and School of Medicine researchers casts doubt on whether that approach, which has proven successful with risky alcohol use, works for illicit drugs. The study, published in JAMA, finds that two well established, brief counseling interventions did not reduce the continued use of marijuana, cocaine or opioids - suggesting that clinicians should "look beyond screening and brief intervention, perhaps to lengthier and more complex . . . care management strategies."
The study, led by Dr. Richard Saitz, chairperson of community health sciences at the BU School of Public Health and professor of medicine at the BU School of Medicine, tested the effectiveness of two interventions on 528 adult primary care patients with unhealthy drug use. Participants were assigned to three groups: one that received a 10- to 15-minute structured interview conducted by health educators; a second that received a 30- to 45-minute intervention based on motivational interviewing, with a 20- to 30-minute follow-up session by counselors; and a third that received no brief intervention. All study participants received a written list of substance-use disorder treatment and help resources.
At the beginning of the study, 63 percent of participants reported that their main drug was marijuana, 19 percent cocaine, and 17 percent opioids. All participants reported they were more than casual users, meaning they used drugs at least weekly (or had less frequent use, but with reported consequences). Researchers assessed their drug use at six weeks and six months.
For the primary outcome (number of days of use of the self-identified main drug in the past 30 days), there were no significant differences between the groups. In addition to self-reporting, participants were subjected to hair testing for drugs. There also were no significant, between-group differences at six weeks or six months in drug-use consequences, injection drug use, unsafe sex, or health care utilization.
Saitz said the findings raise questions about the federal government's advocacy - through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration -- of screening and brief interventions to address unhealthy drug use.
"Brief counseling can work for a lot of things, but we found no evidence to support the widespread implementation of universal screening and brief intervention for illicit drug use or prescription drug misuse," Saitz said. "In retrospect, drug use is a complicated problem. While there might have been some hope that something as simple as this would work, it now appears it doesn't."
Saitz and co-authors speculated that screening and brief counseling might work better with unhealthy alcohol use than drugs because risky drinking is socially acceptable and not as complex to reduce.
"People who are using drugs and admit to using drugs are already doing something not socially sanctioned, so getting them to change their behavior may be harder," Saitz said. "Despite many reasons to not use, they are continuing to do so. A few minutes of counseling is not going to change that."
Because each drug is different, they said, a universal intervention is especially difficult. What works to address marijuana use may not work to stop heroin injecting, for example. Prescription drug misuse is particularly complex, as it may involve pain relief, as well as euphoria-seeking behavior or selling of prescribed drugs.
"One-time brief counseling is simply inadequate to address these complexities, even as an initial strategy," Saitz said, adding that even with alcohol use, multiple interventions have been more successful than one-time sessions.
Saitz noted that while primary care physicians may inquire about patients' drug use, most do not screen using optimal tests. They said the study findings should not suggest that screening doesn't work to identify use - just that one brief intervention is insufficient to reduce it. Identifying drug use is important for reasons beyond aiming to reduce it; it is important to physicians in diagnosis of symptoms and for safe prescribing, they added.
"The message is not that we don't want to address drugs in medical settings - in fact, I believe we must, just as we address other risk factors and health conditions," they said. "Instead, the message is that this approach is inadequate. We're going to need something more. As doctors, we're going to have to take more responsibility for this problem, the same way we take responsibility for other factors that impact health."
Only 18 percent of the study participants had moderate to severe substance use disorders -- representative of drug use in the typical primary-care clinic population, Saitz said. The rest, who were using drugs with fewer or no consequences, are people for whom effective early identification and intervention could be critical, they said.
The researchers recommended that future trials focus on drug sub-groups (prescription drugs, for example), to gauge whether specialized interventions are effective. They also suggested that trials be conducted using the primary care physician as the interventionist, or establishing a "multi-component" intervention of clinicians and electronic tools.

While women in general have struggled to legitimize their place in punk music, the struggle by women of color in this movement is even greater. Women of color are almost fully displaced in punk spaces. Indeed, the arena of punk music is specifically reserved for white men, therefore, generating great difficulties for white women, which by default makes it a more difficult space for women of color to enter.
Punk, rock in general, has roots in African-American music . Yet since it's conception it has been a movement reserved largely for white people . In fact, many African-American punk bands in the U.S do not get the same recognition as their white (cishet) male or female counterparts. In fact, white women in punk are more recognized than black men . Death, a protopunk band, has yet to acquire the recognition that other mainstream punk bands [the Ramones, Sex pistols, the Clash,] have already received. In essence, punk, although reinforced collectively, has historically been a platform for exclusion. For example, in punk spaces, where many black women have experienced micro-aggressive racism to outright exclusion and abuse of both men and women of color.
Where many all-girl-bands have flourished, many women of color have gone unnoticed, and many had to put forth and originate their own movements. During the rise of the LA punk scene in the 1970s, a punk movement began to grow in East Los Angeles with Alice Bags , a first generation punk rocker. Bags, who is a outset the Chicana punk movement , states, in their article, that they felt the early movement of punk was inhospitable to Latinos . In addition, during the Riot Grrrl scene of the 1990s third wave feminism era, women of color were mostly excluded . In fact, Tamar-Kali Brown, Honey Moonchild, Maya Glick and Simi Stone started their own collective to counter-balance Riot Grrrl, called Sista Grrrl's Riot . Brown stated in an interview that they did not feel part of Riot Grrrl because it was “too white.”
Therefore, the “ alternative to the alternative ” is lacking in community where women of color do not hold the “iconic feminist riot girl status” of Kathleen Hannah, lead singer of Bikini Kill, who emerged from the Seattle music scene in the 90sa with an ironic valley girl accent. Hannah, who even has in their own documentary, shows the self-centrist, privileged, white feminist mode that punk often adapts to.
Within the Latinx and Black community, the punk identity is scrutinized and judged.
Both insiders and outsiders devise binary rules as to how people of color are expected to behave. We are consistently polarized into these monolithic identities and people of color experience this the most.
There is also a huge punk following in Latin America that also goes unnoticed on a larger scale. In fact, there existed many protopunk bands from the 60s, like Saico, a Peruvian band, originated in Latin America. An important punk movement came about in Medellin, Colombia, which even produced a Cannes featured film . This movement was a direct response to the displacement of many youths due to violence during the 70's/80's. Moreover, a feminist movement within punk began. The first Colombian all-women band began in the 1980s Polikarpas y sus viciosas . (Polikarpas and their vicious-aries) The group chose their name after Policarpa Salavarrieta who was a revolutionary during the Spanish Reconquista. They were captured at age 22, and executed by firing squad.
Without reservation, growing up Punk in people of color communities can be divisive from all parties because this identity is seen as “acting white.” Contrary, through the white gaze, this identity is perceived through different registers. For example, if you have colorful hair and were white, you were rebellious, but if you had colorful hair and were Latinx and/or Black you were seen as “ghetto.” These definitions are saturated until a famous white person comes along and sets it as a “ trend .” In turn, you were condescendingly questioned because your chosen identity did not fit the prescribed identity of what Latinx and Black people are meant to be.
In my own personal experience, once in college, because I held somewhat of a New York accent, people questioned my knowledge of rock music, to the point of being interrogated, and even being told to just stick to the rap music that I inevitably knew. Being Dominican, I could only like rap music and not any form of rock, when in fact I like both. I grew up with both.
There is a presence of punk in many countries where young people find refuge, albeit the punk scene's frequent white-washing, and luckily we have movements like Sista Grrrl's Riot, and artists like Saico to remind us that representaion in punk has always and will always matter.

Falling exports have hurt US economic growth The US economy shrank at an annual rate of 6.2% in the last three months of 2008 official figures show, a far sharper fall than previously reported. Plunging exports and the biggest fall in consumer spending in 28 years dragged the annualised figure down from an earlier estimate of 3.8%. The decline was much worse than analysts had expected, sending US stocks spiralling lower. In 2008 as a whole, the economy grew by 1.1%, the slowest pace since 2001. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average dropped 119.15 points, or 1.66%, to 7,062.93. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 2.36% to 735.09 - a 12-year low. Recession warning Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of domestic economic activity, fell by a rate of 4.3% in the final quarter - the biggest fall since the second quarter of 1980. This was a revision of the earlier figure of 3.5%. It shows the weak state of the world's largest economy
Matt Esteve
Tempus Consulting With rising unemployment, sliding home values, increasing numbers of repossessions and the slumping value of investments, observers say many US consumers are hanging on to whatever disposable cash they have. Meanwhile, exports - which had until recently been supporting the economy - fell at the sharpest rate since 1970 at an annual rate of 23.6%, down from 19.7%. Earlier this week, Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke warned Congress that without the right policies from the government, the US recession could last into 2010. But they said if the Obama administration and the central bank can restore some measure of financial stability, 2010 could be a year of recovery. President Obama recently signed a $787bn (£556m) recovery package of increased government spending and tax cuts, and unveiled a $75bn scheme to stem repossessions. No good news The latest GDP figures were "just awful" said Matt Esteve, a currency trader at Tempus Consulting in Washington DC. "It shows the weak state of the world's largest economy." And Boris Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT Forex said there was "doom all over". They predicted that the dollar would not weaken too much against the euro because "there's no good news on the other side of the Atlantic, either".

Hello traveller!
It's been a busy month for us here at Bossa Studios. We ran our Alpha 4.0 playtest just over a month ago, and then Alpha 4.1 a couple of weeks ago. In our last blog post, we shared the experiences of some of our testers, in particular one crew's journey through a storm wall. Those are the kinds of stories we want you to tell through Worlds Adrift – they're at the heart of why we're making this game.
We also got a ton of feedback from players – some we expected, and some we didn't! What definitely took us by surprise was the incredible turnout, and we couldn't have done it without our longtime alpha testers that have been with us since the very beginning, as well as the new players we brought in this cycle, and everybody in between. So again, big thanks to all of you, from us – especially those of you who faithfully tested the queue under load (and helped us find a nasty bug in the loading screen!).
Alpha 4.1 only ran for a brief 48 hours, but soon we'll want to run one that lasts for a lot longer; that'll give us valuable information about how the world behaves after multiple server maintenance events, as well as find out how players play when they're not incredibly time constrained. A lot of longterm gameplay features are coming soon, and won't really receive any decent testing if we don't give you time to experience them properly.
Speaking of which, we're now working hard to finish adding some key features to the game, in preparation for the fifth round of alpha testing. You'll be happy to hear sails are coming in, which should considerably change the early game experience. Another feature that just missed the cutoff for Alpha 4 is the revamped multitool – now renamed the gauntlet. We're generally much happier with how it feels to harvest, salvage, and repair with the gauntlet now, and hopefully you'll agree.
Next, perhaps the most anticipated feature for months now will make its debut in Alpha 5: the new and revamped shipyard, which allows players to shape their own ship hulls. We're all really looking forward to all the awesome designs players will come up with to crash the server fill the skies.
And finally, a ton of changes in response to your Alpha 4 feedback have been planned, some of which will be a quick enough turnaround to make it into Alpha 5.
That's all from us this week! Next week Jack will be blogging a bit about male characters – oh yeah, that's another thing coming in Alpha 5…
Grapple on, and safe travels.

San Francisco Woman Assaults Man with Louboutin
By Emily Gyben
Photo: Net-a-porter.com
Ouch: Christian Louboutin's Asteroid suede and patent-leather pumps, $1,595.
We always knew those spike heels could be dangerous.
The search for a San Francisco woman who allegedly assaulted a man with their Christian Louboutin stiletto has gone viral, and even helped the victim track down their attacker.
Matt Meidinger says they were leaving a bar in the Marina area of the city when they accidentally kicked the Louboutin of a woman who was removing their shoes on the sidewalk. (Rough night in too-tall shoes? We've been there, lady.) A male friend of the woman proceeded to punch Meidinger for their misstep, and Gawker reports that Meidinger shot back, "Whoa! Take it easy! Kicking a shoe doesn't equal a punch in the face, Louboutins or not!"

Apparently, the woman didn't agree, and smashed their beloved shoe down on Meidinger's head, putting them in the emergency room.
Luckily, the victim had a moment (presumably before their injury) to snap a picture of the woman, which they then posted to Twitter and Facebook, offering a $500 reward for their identification.
They were reportedly found, and the San Francisco police are now handling the case.

"The Russians were begging us for years to do that," a former White House official said. "They were constantly pushing for it and we were constantly saying 'no.'"
The meeting, which was reportedly scheduled in advance, came a day after Trump's controversial firing of FBI Director James Comey amid an investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia.

Militarization of Police Is Not Just Dangerous - It's Wasteful Too, Study Finds
By Ken Klippenstein, Reader Supported News
exas police obtained, free of cost, a “used” Humvee combat vehicle – with just 32 miles on the odometer. Ohio State University acquired a 38,000 lb. mine-resistant vehicle. These are just a couple of the bizarre acquisitions made possible by a controversial set of programs that has transferred billions of dollars worth of U.S. military equipment to local law enforcement.
Under these programs, almost any item available to U.S. Army troops overseas is available for purchase by local law enforcement – with nominal oversight. In fact, in many cases, training for these military-grade armaments is not required, and the purchases themselves take place irrespective of local government's needs. These findings and more were published in a scathing study by law professor Mark Denbeaux, the director of Seton Hall Law Center for Policy and Research. (That study can be downloaded here.)
With protests erupting in South Carolina over police killing of an unarmed black man, Walter Scott, Denbeaux's ominous report on police militarization may foreshadow what a response from law enforcement could look like in the future.
RSN reached out to Denbeaux for comment. When asked what kind of transparency is in place so citizens can know which armaments their local governments possess, Denbeaux said, “The only way you'd know about the local ones is if the local government agencies catalogue it.”
“There is no system. I don't think towns know whether they have MRAPs [Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles] or anything else. I would be shocked if the citizens of Ferguson had any clue about the armaments the city had.”
The lack of oversight is remarkably evident when it comes to SWAT teams. “There's a big question about what training it takes to be on a SWAT team. It's not clear there's any,” Denbeaux said.
“The real problem here are massive amounts of weapons and no controls. One reason there are no controls is they're given away basically for free. That's not literally true, but what they get is so vastly expensive compared to what they pay for it – and in a time when there's all this fear – it's hard for a town to say no.”
When asked to speculate on why armaments are given to local governments below cost, Denbeaux remarked, “Our defense plan is always to be ready if there's a war, but if there isn't a war and you've got all the equipment ... you replace the old equipment with the new equipment, and then what do you do with the old equipment? 10 years from now, we're going to be awash in this kind of weaponry. It's not just dangerous, it's also a huge expense.”
“I don't think most of the stuff even saw the battlefield. I don't think they're getting shot-up MRAPs, it's equipment that the military never used. They order ‘x' number of MRAPs every year ... but each year there's an upgrade, so what do they do with the model 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 MRAP?”
“One of the problems is the military has to have some way to get rid of its waste ... One could very cynically believe that this is simply a way to keep the weapons manufacturers going constantly.”
Denbeaux's cynicism is not unfounded, considering the staggering costs associated with the programs that arm local governments with military equipment. Consider the Defense Logistics Agency's 1033 program, which has transferred over $4.2 billion worth of military armaments since 1990. Or the 1122 program, which allowed local police to purchase $700 million worth of military equipment in the fiscal year 2011 alone. The modestly titled Community Oriented Policing Service (“COPS”) Hiring Program (“CHP”) shelled out over $240 million in just 2011 alone to state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies.
These are just some of many astonishing examples of wasteful militarization that can be found in Denbaux's study.

During a discussion about energy, McCain punctuates a contrast with Obama by referring to them as "that one," while once again not looking in their opponent's direction (merely jabbing a finger across their chest). That's not going to win McCain any Miss Congeniality points. Nor will it reassure any voters who believe McCain is improperly trying to capitalize on Obama's "otherness."
This goes beyond refusing to look at Obama in the first debate. With this slightly dehumanizing phrase, McCain may have just played into the emerging narrative of Obama-hate that has been sprouting at McCain-Palin rallies.
Darren Davis, a professor at Notre Dame who specializes in the role of race in politics, sent a comment to the Huffington Post about McCain's "that one" remark. "It speaks volumes about how McCain feels personally about Obama. Whomever said the town hall format helps McCain is dead wrong," Davis wrote.
A few minutes later, Obama spokesperson Bill Burton placed their foot on the pedal ever so slightly. In an email blast to reporters, they ask: "Did John McCain just refer to Obama as 'that one'?" No other commentary followed, nor did any mention of race. But expect the post-debate analysis to get a little focused on whether McCain just made a regrettable faux pas.
The Politico has the McCain camp's spin on the line:
A recent series of headlines from well-known newspapers and news websites may have caught your eye if you are a fan of Sarah Schulman. The novelist and playwright is well known both for their stage work and working on LGBT rights, including AIDS activism with ACT UP and direct action organizing with the Lesbian Avengers. Schulman, now a professor at the City University of New York, is now being touted as a “suit and tie” anti-Semite.
The accusation comes from a CUNY student chapter of Zionist Organization of America, one of the oldest pro-Israel organizations in the world with over 30,000 members. The accusations come, in part, from their sponsorship of the student organization Students for Justice in Palestine at the College of Staten Island. Students from the ZOA wrote a letter to state Senator Jack Martins as well as bringing these charges before the CUNY administration.
The content that they use to make these allegations are largely things like tweets, support for the student organization and their work, and their public statements and writing on the Israel/Palestine conflict. An example of this cited by the ZOA is an October 11, 2014 tweet from Schulman wrote saying, “I question the idea of exceptionalisms[..]The murder of 2,000 Gazans also reflects Jewish values.” In response to accusations about anti-Semitism in their tweets, they also wrote “That's not anti-Semitic to say that people who killed people murdered them.”
In 2012 they published Israel/Palestine and the Queer International, a book that shifts a little from their political work of the past. The allegations have settled largely on, what for Palestinian human rights activists, are pretty standard discussion points. This includes the violence perpetrated against children in the Gaza Strip by the Israeli Defense Force, using language like “murderers” to describe them. The students at ZOA have asked for Schulman, who is Jewish herself, to be removed from the adviser for the student group.
The purpose of Students for Justice in Palestine is to harass, intimidate and frankly assault Jews attending schools, and we can't have the government or the university underwriting a hate group,” wrote Senator Jack Martins, who agreed with the ZOA about the group and Schulman.
The event culminated in forcing Schulman before the CUNY Task Force on Anti-Semitism, formed to look at incidents on the city campuses. Schulman said afterward that it was clear that the college was after the student group specifically, and the inquiry was less about them and what they had said. They were forced to discuss accusations against SJP that had no evidence, like the claim that they drew swastikas on campus. They focused in the conversation about the students that they supported, and how their experience was the focus of the group and how anti-Semitism and homophobia was both never tolerated and never seen.
I also spoke about the students themselves: how much I respect our students, and how much I have been enriched by working with them. How many of our SJP students are Palestinian. Their families have been displaced. Their relatives have been held in illegal detention. They have been denied entry to Israel/Palestine because of their political activism. I told the Task Force that I have come to know the students, and some of their family members. That they have NEVER been anti-semitic or homophobic or done anything that justified any kind of negative institutional response. One of the accusations was that a “Jewish student” hid their Star of David when they saw Muslim students. Besides the fact that this has nothing to do with SJP, I explained to the Task Force that there are Jews who have dehumanizing views of Arabs, Muslims and Palestinians, and project enormous anxiety onto to them. But that this has nothing to do with Muslim students, themselves. And certainly is not their fault.
In this statement, put on their Facebook on October 22nd, also they discussed Zionism as a concept with the panel, which they said was must different today than the historical trajectory of Judaism.
Then we discussed the relationship between Zionism and Judaism. I testified that since the onset of Zionism, since Theodore Hertzl published their book “The Jewish State” in 1896, there has been disagreement among Jews re Zionism. That for its entire history, for 5,700 years, Judaism has been a dialogic religion rooted in commentary and inquiry. And that this current moment is the only time that Jews have been told to be homogenous in thought. That in fact, this impulse to force all Jews into one opinion is ahistorical and not Judaic.
They went on to discuss how Abe Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League has approved of how CUNY was handling the allegation, showing tacit support for the singling out of Schulman.
When looking at Schulman after the allegations we wanted to be open to the idea that creeping anti-Semitism had, in fact, made its way into their discourse. This has happened inside of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, not because radical support for the Palestinians and opposition to the State of Israel is inherently anti-Semitic, as Abe Foxman would have you believe. Instead, it comes from a lack of a clear understanding of the historic role and character of anti-Semitism and the inability to for the movement to confront creeping caricatures, conspiracy theories, and anti-Semitic anger that has made its way in.
Instead, what we found was that Schulman's accused “anti-Semitism” was almost purely one that is made up of for their pro-Palestinian organizing, and lacked any of the key qualities that anti-Semitism is made up of. This vision of anti-Semitism is not built on any of the historic understandings of what anti-Semitism actually is, whether it is an unfair conspiratorial view of Jews or a targeting of Jews that is unique to their position as Jews. Foxman makes the allegations that if you support other national liberation movements but oppose Israel, then you are anti-Semitic, plain and simple. This erases the historical injustices of the formation of Israel, the colonization of land, the removal of families, the violent ethnic cleansing of the people living in the neighborhoods that was acquired. It tells us that the ongoing atrocities, the imprisonment of Gaza, the building of Apartheid walls, and the ongoing imperialism in the settlements, is just common to liberation struggles. This absurdity strips us of the ability to see anti-Semitism as an accurate phenomenon, one that continues as a point of genocidal racism that is not synonymous with criticism of Israel.
The ZOA itself is not a representative Jewish voice, but instead one that is uniquely Israeli in politics. As Schulman pointed out, there is no “absolute” legacy for Israeli politics inside of the “Jewish people.” This is, in part, why we oppose the use of the term Zionism, as it is also a Jewish religious concept, only one interpretation of such is actually the modern State of Israel. We may make different language choices than Schulman has (such as not using the term Zionism), but this does not have an anti-Semite make.
When looking through Schulman's public statements, as well as the allegations of private statements and behavior, we found not one single example where charges of anti-Semitism could be leveled. The danger these presents should be obvious as a political issue over the behavior of Israel is at stake here, not Jewish people or Judaism as a tradition and faith. This creates a culture of social criminality for critics of Israel, equating the very real threat of anti-Semitism with incredibly logical politics on the left. For Sarah Schulman, these allegations could destroy their life, get their fired, force their books to be pulled from shelves, and get them blacklisted from many of the artistic circles they have spent their life and energy to be a part of. For many young activists, this could end the possibility of careers before they even begin.
At the same time, it obscures the actualities of anti-Semitism, giving reasonable cover to those that do perpetrate images of Jews as evil and conniving. These voices are increasing as neo-fascists movements increase in the U.S. and Europe, but with a hazy understanding of what actual anti-Semitism is it is becoming more difficult to single those reactionaries out and to create a movement to remove anti-Semitism from the social discourse.
We are especially sensitive to anti-Semitic discourse, going further in our analysis than many would simply because creeping anti-Semitism has occurred inside of left spaces through areas like anti-banking politics and anti-Israeli ideas. This, however, isn't an example of that, and the idea that people like Schulman can be targeted with charges of anti-Semitism to wash over important politics is both frightening and revolting.
The incident at CUNY is not unique as a report from the University of California has now made the allegation that opposition to “Zionism” is often just a cover for anti-Semitism. The administration plans to be asking for regular reports on intolerance, with a focus on anti-Semitism. This is the kind of monitoring is something we actually support as challenging racism and anti-Semitism on campus is an important battle, but if the equation is that anti-Israeli politics are synonymous with anti-Semitism, then we will see the censorship of Palestinian politics on California campuses under the guise of fighting racism. This would fundamentally undermine the BDS movement, which has followed the South African Apartheid movement in being heavy on campuses and pulling for campus divestment in Israel and the settlements. The move would essentially socially criminalize Palestinian activism, and reframe the conversation of Israeli atrocities so that they could never be fairly discussed.
This is a point that Schulman knows well, and even if the CUNY administration decides that neither they nor SJP have done anything wrong, this may taint the conversation on CUNY campuses for years. For our part, with our position that anti-Semitism should be rooted out at any point, also want to make a clear statement about what anti-Semitism is, and what its not. We support Schulman and SJP's work on campus and want to keep a conversation alive about how to correctly identify anti-Semitic behavior, and how to support the Palestinians to find justice.

Bomberman: A Brief History
The place: Japan. The year: 1983. There's a new hot dog on the block: Bakudan Otoko‘s their name, and explodin's their game. Unfortunately for this hot dog, they released on home computers, so you and your pal Toshi can't play him. Dang. Guess you have to wait a couple years.
Now you and Toshi are a couple of bad high school dudes looking to cut class and engage in general delinquency. What better way to do that than by using your Famicom to play the new hot dog on the block, Bomberman (who looks suspiciously like the old hot dog on the block, Bakudan Otoko)? It's great, you and Toshi have a blast, but they make some smart-mouthed comment about getting a higher score that makes you wish you could get Bomberman-based revenge on their smug face.
Well don't look now, but it's 1991 and Bomberman II just dropped. The hot dogs keep coming, and this time they've brought multiplayer with them. You call up Toshi and say “Hey, dude, I'm really sorry about what happened with Yuriko. Look, I know it's been a while, but can we meet for beer and talk?” So you talk, hash things out, and pretty soon you're getting hot and heavy with Bomberman II's new multiplayer action.
It's the morning after and you have trouble looking Toshi in the eye after your sick winning streak. You say your goodbyes and agree to meet up again the next time a Bomberman game comes out. You shred your way through the 90s, and Freddie Prinze Jr. into the 00s. New Bomberman games come and go, but they feel like more of the same. You start to question if this is really worth it. Should you have told Yuriko you were sorry? That you could be better? That you made a mistake spending $59.99 MSRP on Bomberman R?
Fast forward to now — 2017. You cry yourself softly to sleep at night with Bomberman games turning out to have the same old gameplay every time. Suddenly, a bright neon flash catches your eye. What's that? Who's there? Is it Yuriko? Are they finally returning your calls? No, it's —
Laser League: a Bomberman for the Modern Age
Laser League does what Bomberman doesn't. By taking the basic premise of “territory control” that Bomberman established, Laser League works within a familiar context and adds some interesting changes to the mix. From unique classes and abilities to customizable loadouts, the game's mechanics can best be described as a “Best of” mixtape of the past few generations in game design.
From the studio that brought you Olli Olli comes the high-octane murdersport of 2150: Laser League pits two teams against one another in a confined arena where the objective is to eliminate the opposing side. You do so by activating neutral nodes traveling around the arena, which expand into bright neon walls of death that sport your team's color. Should someone run into a wall that's got the color of the enemy team, they're instantly vaporized.
The gameplay as a whole is tight, snappy, and satisfying. Matches are divvied up into three potential rounds, with each round's winner determined in a Best-of-Five. You as the player only have to worry about two inputs: your movement and your class ability. This allows you to easily keep tabs on the action, as well as where your character is in relation to everything else. Simple enough, right? Well, we're still cracking the surface here.
Laser League shakes things up through three distinct factors: map variety, classes, and powerups. Each map has a unique setup of nodes that travel in discrete paths. Over time, the number of nodes increase, and the map's confines quickly become awash in a neon sea of death. Where the game really throws you for a loop is the wrap-around mechanic. Like in Pac-Man, if you go the edge of the arena, you get transported to the opposite side of the map. This opens up a whole range of movement and maneuvers that synergize with the moving walls and individual class choices.
In order to get the edge on the other team, Laser League sports a number of different classes with unique abilities and attributes, covering offensive, defensive, and supporting roles. You can play the deadly “Blade,” who slices through opponents with ease and proves to be just as deadly as the laser walls. Or you can play the “Shock,” who lets out bursts of electricity that stun and disorient their enemies, leaving them prey to an oncoming wall or a sick combo™. To further complicate matters, various powerups will spawn on the map over time and affect the game in a number of different ways, from speeding up wall movement to switching their colors.
What's Old is New Again
Now how exactly does Bomberman relate, you may ask? Well little Jimmy, let's go back to this idea of “territory control.” Bomberman‘s core design mechanic was based around placing bombs on a grid-based map in order to blast your enemies to smithereens. The danger and fun came from surrounding your opponent in a wall of explosions that they couldn't escape, which you could very easily be caught up in as well. Some basic powerups — like the increased number of bombs, higher movespeed, and bomb-throw — gave players the ability to develop a token sense of unique identity. For the most part, however, everybody plays the same general way.
Laser League cuts all the boring tedium out and dumps you right into the action
Laser League borrows that key design element of “territory control,” but introduces much-needed player agency. Bomberman matches would start each player out with no powerups, trapped in corners of the map that they had to slowly blast out of, maybe picking up the occasional ability. Laser League cuts all the boring tedium out and dumps you right into the action. As soon as a match starts, you're already face-to-face with the enemy, vying for domination of the neutral nodes. Each team member's unique abilities provide varied and interesting ways to affect both the flow of the match and skirmishes, while a mix of sick combo™, spatial awareness, and timing highlight the competitive depth that Laser League possesses. The game truly shines when you're playing with multiple people, with frenzied cries of victory, defeat, and surprise intermingling.
So give your Toshis a call and tell them: “Hey. Are you a bad enough dude to Laser League“?
Laser League is currently accepting signups for Closed Beta
A trial of members of the far-left community at Copenhagen City Court concluded today with guilty verdicts for assault and illegal possession of sensitive information.
Four members of the organisation Redox were found guilty of illegally possessing private information obtained as part of their systematic surveillance campaign of members of the far right.
Three were given 60-day suspended sentences while the fourth, who was also found guilty of assault, was given a five-month suspended sentence.
Assault piqued police interest
The assault of three members of the far right community took place in a Nørreport bar in 2009. According to media reports, the incident led police and the domestic intelligence agency PET to start an investigation into the far-left group Antifascistisk Aktion.
A police raid of one of the suspect's apartments uncovered a hard drive that contained sensitive information of over 6,000 members of the far-right and their families and friends.
Redox used the information to publish reports about the far-right, including the exposure of the secret right-wing network ORG in August 2011. Redox's website was shut down by the data protection authorities shortly thereafter.

Insufficient evidence
Seven members of the left-wing group were in court for the trial on charges of assault and hacking – some, but not all, were charged with both.
Three of the seven – who only faced charges of assault – had their charges dropped and the remaining four were all found guilty of illegally possessing the sensitive information. One was also found guilty of assault.
The four were not found guilty of hacking, however, because the prosecution lacked the required evidence to prove they accessed the information using illegal methods.
No terrorism charges
Several of the accused were also charged with breaking anti-terrorism legislation in 2010, but those charges were dropped before the trial started.
Several others also faced preliminary charges in 2010 and because of the long wait for the trial, their sentences were shortened.
Five of the seven accused have changed their names, reports Politiken.
Introduction
About 60,000 TV ads — roughly one-fifth of all ads aired in the Republican presidential primary — have been critical of Donald Trump in some fashion, according to a Center for Public Integrity review of data from Kantar Media/CMAG.
Despite the outpouring of hostility from their opponents, the bombastic billionaire business person continues to roll toward the GOP presidential nomination, having swept five more states on Tuesday.
“I've had negative ads all throughout, and I've won races in a landslide,” Trump said in their victory speech Tuesday night. “Most of these people who have been fighting me are gone.”
This massive figure includes about 800 TV ads so far aired in Indiana, a state that holds its primary Tuesday and has emerged as the next major battleground between Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Trump's chief adversary.
The bulk of these ads aired after Trump already solidified their front-runner status. Now, Trump continues to surge. To date, he's earned more than 950 delegates, according to the Associated Press. That's less than 300 short of the 1,237 they need to clinch the GOP nomination — and avoid a contested Republican National Convention in July.

Note: Kantar Media/CMAG tracks ads on broadcast television and national — but not local — cable. Some ads critical of Donald Trump were also critical of other candidates.
Nevertheless, many anti-Trump forces won't relent.
“We are convinced that Trump can be stopped short of 1,237,” Club for Growth spokesperson Doug Sachtleben told the Center for Public Integrity.
Sachtleben said the conservative organization, which was the first group to start airing attack ads against Trump last fall, will be targeting Indiana, where polls show a close race. The group is also eyeing delegate-rich California, which holds its primary on June 7.
California, Sachtleben added, “is ultimately where we believe this race will come down to.”
To date, the Club for Growth has spent more than $9.7 million attacking Trump, according to federal campaign finance filings. Both its super PAC and 501(c)(4) “social welfare” nonprofit arm have participated in the barrage.
In addition to the Club for Growth, a host of other conservative groups have joined the anti-Trump chorus. Some of these organizations have spent millions of dollars opposing Trump while others have made relatively token expenditures.
Among them are super PACs devoted to other GOP candidates, as well as a solely anti-Trump super PAC. Known as Our Principles PAC, this anti-Trump group was founded by veteran Republican strategist Katie Packer, who helped run Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign.
Our Principles PAC alone has spent more than $16 million opposing Trump — more than any other group. Its largest donors are Marlene and Joe Ricketts, co-owners of the Chicago Cubs baseball team, who have combined to give $5.5 million. Republican megadonor and hedge fund magnate Paul Singer has also so far given $1.5 million to Our Principles PAC.
For their parts, the three pro-Cruz super PACs — Keep the Promise I, Stand for Truth and Trusted Leadership PAC — have combined to spend about $2.6 million against Trump, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. Meanwhile, two super PACs supporting Ohio Gov. John Kasich — New Day for America and New Day Independent Media — have combined to spend about $287,000 so far attacking Trump.
“If Trump is the GOP nominee, we will lose the White House, the Supreme Court, the U.S. Senate and countless down-ticket races.” – Connie Wehrkamp, spokesperson for pro-Kasich super PAC New Day for America
Some of these ads, which featured a hippopotamus, alleged that Trump is a “hippo-crit” who “repeatedly says one thing [and] does another.” Others criticized Trump's online education company as a “scam” and argued that Trump will “scam America too.” Still others called Trump “too reckless and dangerous” to be president.
“If Republicans want to win, we have to nominate someone who can actually defeat [Democratic Party presidential front-runner] Hillary [Clinton],” New Day for America spokesperson Connie Wehrkamp told the Center for Public Integrity. “If Trump is the GOP nominee, we will lose the White House, the Supreme Court, the U.S. Senate and countless down-ticket races, not to mention Trump is entirely unprepared to hold the highest office in the world.”
Sustained anti-Trump advertising didn't begin until February, a month during which roughly one-quarter of the ads in the GOP presidential race were critical of Trump, according to a Center for Public Integrity review of Kantar Media/CMAG data, a firm that monitors advertising on broadcast television and national — but not local — cable.
Anti-Trump TV ads represented nearly half the ads in the GOP race during March. The figure currently hovers near 30 percent so far in April.
Prior to February, blasting Trump wasn't many conservatives' top priority.
As of Jan. 31, the day before the Iowa caucuses, which Trump narrowly lost to Cruz, just 6.5 percent of TV ads in the GOP presidential race had criticized Trump. At that juncture, more than a dozen candidates were still competing in the Republican field, including well-funded former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon who briefly led Trump in national polls late last year.
“Early on, most campaigns were more focused on building up their own candidate in a crowded field than taking down Trump, whose popularity they likely did not fully understand,” said Jay Goodliffe, a professor of political science at Brigham Young University in Utah. “Before February, there were no elections, so the Republican campaigns and allied groups could hope that Trump's support would be less strong once their supporters had to go to the polls.”

Elizabeth Wilner, the Kantar Media executive who oversees the firm's political ad tracking project, added that the delay in anti-Trump advertising seemed to come from “a combination of denial and fear — denial that they could become the nominee and fear of messing with the bull.”
Trump often delights in prodding their political opponents, both in word and tweet. That includes big-money bankrollers who dare oppose him.
For example, they tweeted out an admonition to the Ricketts family that they “better be careful” once media outlets reported the Ricketts were funding an anti-Trump super PAC.
Amid the contentious primary, one presidential contender — more than any other candidate, including Republicans — has attacked Trump in campaign ads: Democrat Hillary Clinton.
To date, Clinton has sponsored nearly 8,000 ads that criticize Trump, including dozens of Spanish-language ads that aired as recently as this week in Connecticut and Pennsylvania, which both conducted primaries on Tuesday.
Such activity closely aligns with Clinton's rhetorical pivot Tuesday away from Democratic primary opponent Bernie Sanders — they almost certainly can't catch Clinton, but isn't quitting — and toward the general election.
“Let's go forward. Let's win the nomination, and in July, let's return as a unified party,” Clinton said during their victory speech Tuesday night in Philadelphia, which will also host the Democratic National Convention this summer.
Clinton campaign spokesperson Jesse Ferguson told the Center for Public Integrity it was important to criticize Trump for their “divisive rhetoric and dangerous agenda.”
Ferguson added: “We will continue to make the case about the damage their agenda would do and how Hillary Clinton is the toughest candidate to take them on and stop him.”

You can count the GPU teraflops, the pixel-pushing power and the platform exclusives all you want, but for developers to fully display the potential a new milestone gaming hardware device offers, that elusive 'killer app' is still paramount to success.
It's a conundrum both Sony and Microsoft are facing with their PS4 Pro and Xbox One X consoles respectively – each mighty gaming machines, but (thanks in part to a commitment to supporting older console revisions) each not doing much beyond resolution bumps to set them apart from their forefathers.
Nintendo is actually very adept at pulling this feat off. Wii Sports perfectly illustrated the potential magic of the Wii's motion controls. There was arguably an even greater revolution with the N64 and Super Mario 64 – its 3D worlds were so perfectly realised, its control scheme so perfectly executed, that it caused a sea change. There was no turning back.
Now, just over a year after the Oculus Rift's consumer headset released, virtual reality has its Super Mario 64 moment, and its name is Lone Echo.
The zero-G dream
Oculus Rift exclusive Lone Echo is not the first VR game to put you in space – a number of spaceship fighter sims have already attempted it, as did the stomach-turning space disaster astronaut adventure Adrift.
But Lone Echo is the first one to get it so very right. So right, in fact, that my memories of playing it are not so much of me settling down to play a game, but more akin to ‘real' memories that I have of moments out in the physical world.
You play the role of Jack, an AI housed in a robotic body, aboard a space station that (inevitably) experiences... difficulties, to put it euphemistically. It's up to you to find out what's going wrong with the aid of your human companion Liv, the captain of the ship.
VR always promises to give the player a sense of ‘presence' not possible in other gaming mediums, and setting the title in space (wish fulfilment that it is) can bring with it unique problems – namely, pulling off that sense of zero gravity movement.
It's something the majority of people will never truly experience, and yet can perfectly imagine what they'd assume it feels like. Get it wrong in VR, and it's a recipe for motion sickness.
Lone Echo solves this in an incredibly novel way, taking full advantage of the intuitive complexity of the Oculus Rift Touch controllers, that let you make natural hand gestures like pointing and grabbing with ease.
Rather than pushing a stick to move forward, or teleporting like some VR games require you to do in order to circumvent the limitations of a constricted real-world play space, Lone Echo lets you grab onto surfaces, structures and items around you, and pull and push them to launch yourself off in a desired direction – just like those videos we've all seen of astronauts clambering around the International Space Station, and pretty much most of the film Gravity.
Little jet rockets on your wrist let you fine-tune a trajectory, and within moments you're sweeping around the space station, with a sense of gravitational freedom comfortably at odds with the fact you know full well that your feet are actually firmly on the ground.
A space prodigy
The reality is, of course, all that's really moving is the digitised position of your head, with your little robotic legs appearing to trail behind you. But between the novelty of zero-G movement, the fact you don't know what robot legs would feel like, and the physicality of each grasping, pulling motion, your brain completely invests in the experience, with very little in the way of the negative side-effects usually associated with discombobulating VR movement.
The way the controller tracks the intentions of your fingers, splaying out across surfaces, is remarkably immersive, as is the way it intelligently guesses at the position of your arms. It's like you're really there.
Beyond the groundbreaking, Lone Echo pulls off the ‘everyday' of gaming with aplomb too. It's one of the most visually accomplished VR games I've seen so far, with developers Ready at Dawn again showing off their skill at facial motion capture.
The script is well written and equally well delivered, while the seven-or-so hour adventure (a perfect length for a VR game) is peppered with secrets to discover and multiple conversation options, offering reasons to replay.
And while I've not ventured into multiplayer as much as the single player campaign, I've heard good things about Lone Echo's competitive component, which uses the novel navigation system to create a Tron-like game of zero-G space rugby.
Barriers to entry remain for virtual reality, though. To play Lone Echo you not only have to buy the game of course, but the headset, touch controllers and three motion tracking sensors to deliver the 360-movement the game requires. That's before factoring in the cost of the PC to run it, and the unavoidable (but more than bearable) discomfort of having a screen strapped to your face with wires coming out of it.
But it's as close to a literal out-of-this-world experience that many of us will ever get. It's the promise of the VR dream brought into sharp focus, a convincing and all-encompassing journey into a body and environment wholly different from our own. It's the most excellently executed escapist excursion gaming has ever offered up, and it has to be lived to be believed.

The proportion of Zika-affected pregnancies with birth defects is approximately 20-fold higher compared with the proportion of pregnancies seen in 2013-2014, which is before Zika was introduced into the Americas, according to an article published today in CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The types of birth defect—including brain abnormalities and/or microcephaly, neural tube defects and other early brain malformations, eye defects, and other central nervous system (CNS) problems—were seen in about 3 of every 1,000 births in 2013-2014. In 2016, the proportion of infants with these same types of birth defects born to women with Zika virus infection during pregnancy was about 6% or nearly 60 of every 1,000 completed pregnancies with Zika infections.
The researchers analyzed 2013-2014 data from three birth defects surveillance programs in the United States (Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Georgia) to provide the baseline frequency for Zika-related birth defects. To assess the effect of Zika virus infection during pregnancy, the scientists compared that 2013-2014 baseline number with previously published numbers among pregnancies with Zika virus infection from the US Zika Pregnancy Registry (USZPR) from 2016.
They identified 747 infants and fetuses with one or more of these defects from programs in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Georgia, from 2013-2014. Brain abnormalities and/or microcephaly were the most frequent conditions reported. Data from the USZPR identified 26 infants and fetuses with these same birth defects among the 442 completed pregnancies of women with possible Zika infection from January through September 2016. These findings demonstrate the importance of having monitoring systems that collect data on birth defects.
CDC supports state, territorial, tribal and local health departments to establish or enhance surveillance systems that rapidly collect information about birth defects that have been observed with Zika virus infection during pregnancy. Today, five additional jurisdictions—Arkansas, Nebraska, Nevada, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands— were awarded funding, bringing the total to 50 jurisdictions and more than $27 million in support of birth defects surveillance for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.
CDC continues to recommend that pregnant women not travel to areas with Zika. If a pregnant woman must travel to or lives in an area with Zika, they should talk with their healthcare provider and strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites and sexual transmission of Zika virus. Pregnant women with possible exposure to Zika virus should be tested for Zika infection even if they do not have symptoms. For more information, please visit www.cdc.gov/zika/pregnancy/.

Story highlights Transgender students would choose which bathroom to use and team to join
The proposal awaits the signature of Gov. Jerry Brown
The law would be the nation's first, though some states have policies to same effect
A 16-year-old transgender boy wants to attend P.E. for boys and play football
Transgender students in California would be able to choose which school bathrooms and locker rooms to use and which sport teams to join based on their gender identity under a measure approved this week by the California Legislature.
The proposal now awaits the signature of Gov. Jerry Brown, whose office has declined to comment on whether they will sign it.
The proposal would be the first state law in the nation that specifically requires equal access to public school facilities and activities based on gender identity, though some states have general policies to the same effect, said Shannon Price Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, one of several groups backing the legislation.
But enactment of the measure would "simply mean that California will be catching up with other states that already have enacted regulations based on a general prohibition of gender identity discrimination in schools," Minter told CNN.
"Our view is that California's existing law should already require schools to provide transgender students with equal access to facilities and activities, but in practice, many schools are not complying with that requirement and will not do so unless the Legislature provides specific guidance on this issue," Minter said.
Though California prohibits discrimination in education, transgender students "are often still unfairly excluded from physical education, athletic teams, and other school activities and facilities because of who they are," according to a statement by the center and other groups supporting the measure.
The California Senate approved the proposal on Wednesday, 21-9. It had been earlier approved by the Assembly in early May.
State Senate Republicans largely opposed the measure during debate, as broadcast by CNN affiliate KCRA.
"There are youthful sex offenders," said state Sen. Jim Nielsen. "I guarantee there would be those who would use this opportunity."
"It's going to be problem with implementation," said Sen. Jean Fuller.
The proposed law would require that a pupil "be permitted to participate in sex-segregated school programs and activities, including athletic teams and competitions, and use facilities consistent with their or their gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the pupil's records," the legislation says.
Ashton Lee, a 16-year-old transgender boy from of Manteca, California, testified before the Senate Education Committee last month. Lee wants to play high school football.
"I just want to be treated the same as all the other boys, but my school forces me to take P.E. in a class of all girls and live as someone I'm not," Lee said in a statement. "I can't learn and succeed when every day in that class leaves me feeling isolated and alone."
The Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second largest, implemented a policy in 2005 that's "nearly identical" to the legislative proposal now awaiting the governor's signature, advocacy groups said.
"We've worked closely with students and families to ensure that our policies related to gender identity are successful, welcomed by students, and supported by parents," Judy Chiasson, the district's program coordinator for human relations, diversity and equity, said in a statement.
Kamala Harris is one of America's least "hysterical" politicians. In a news cycle dominated by dark conspiracies, shocking revelations, and occasional moments of flat-out what-is-happening catastrophe, Harris is a calm within the storm: The competent, no-bullshit attorney, here to slice through the noise. At ongoing Senate Intelligence hearings, Harris has addressed testifiers with short, sharp questions, moving through each point as quickly as humanly possible to maximize every second of their allotted time. It's a stirring display of professionalism; in an age where even the President behaves like an Internet troll angrily drunk-tweeting a Game of Thrones episode, Kamala Harris is a reminder that level-headed grown-ups still exist. Well, unless you're an old white man, in which case they are evidently reason to freak the hell out.
On Tuesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions publicly complained, while being questioned by Harris, that they made them "nervous." They have been interrupted and shut down twice by male colleagues—once, when reminding Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to answer "yes" or "no" to a yes-or-no question, and once when asking Sessions about a policy which supposedly forbade them from answering questions. Here's that second exchange:
HARRIS: You referred to a longstanding DOJ policy. Can you tell us what policy it is you're talking about?
SESSIONS: Well, I think most cabinet people, as the witnesses, uh, you had before you earlier, those individuals declined to comment. Because we're all about conversations with the President —
HARRIS: Sir, I'm just asking you about the DOJ policy you referred to.
SESSIONS: — a longstanding policy that goes beyond just the Attorney General.
HARRIS: Is that policy in writing somewhere?
SESSIONS: Uh, I — I think so.
And so on.
Now, you may get the sense that Sessions has "a policy" in the same sense that you, in the seventh grade, had "a boyfriend" who "goes to another school" — Kamala Harris is good at their job — but this is hardly an exercise in unhinged melodrama. Harris didn't scream; they did not cry; they did not throw a lamp at Jeff Sessions, despite the fact that this exactly what many of us would like to do to Jeff Sessions. Kamala Harris behaved exactly like who they are: an exceptionally skilled prosecutor, pinning down an evasive client. And yet for two sad-man CNN commentators, the entire back-and-forth was an excuse to dismiss Harris as "hysterical."
"From my - I would say - objective perspective, [she was hysterical]." https://t.co/pKfPIBTbqU — Broderick Greer (@BroderickGreer) June 14, 2017
"From my perspective, from my, I would say, objective perspective… I think they were hysterical," said former Trump advisor Jason Miller. "She was trying to shout down Attorney General Sessions, and I thought it was way out of bounds." When political analyst Kirsten Powers noted that Miller hadn't applied called any of Sessions' male questioners "hysterical," Jeffrey Lord jumped in to calm Powers' inflamed ladyfeelings: "Hysteria is a neutral quality," Lord insisted.
Oof.
But, actually, it's not. Not only is the actual word "hysteria" gendered — it once referred to an exclusively female disease, a mental illness thought to be caused by a malfunctioning uterus — there is a very long history of critics using accusations or innuendo about women's mental health or emotional stability in order to shut down their political voices. It's a trope that goes back to the beginnings of women's participation in democracy: "'Votes for women!' is the shrill cry of a number of apparently discontented ladies who somehow seem to have missed the best of life," wrote Marie Corelli. The essay is entitled "Woman — or Suffragette?" It dates from 1907.
And it hasn't let up since. Not only is Harris not the first woman to bear the brunt of the stereotype, she's not even the first woman in recent memory. In late November 2016, Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski slammed Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for being too "angry" about Donald Trump: "There's an anger there that's shrill, and a step above where it needs to be, unmeasured, and almost unhinged." On May 4, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), gave a speech in defense of the ACA — "I don't want the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg on the streets, to steal bread from the market because they can't get any health insurance," they said — only to be dismissed by Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA), who told them that "If I had to defend Obamacare, I'd go into hysterics too." Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, Labour MP Mary Creagh asked Chancellor of the Exchequer Phillip Hammond a dry procedural question about Brexit — "[would] they give policy and regulatory certainty to the 100,000 UK businesses who registered companies in Ireland after the vote to leave the EU" — only to be told "not to be hysterical about these things." Hammond later defended themselves by claiming that "I didn't call [Creagh] hysterical – I urged them not to be hysterical," as if their female colleague had been teetering on the edge of madness, and only being condescended to in a public forum could hold them back.
Terrible. @JacksonLeeTX18's give a passionate critique of the ACA repeal bill and is then told she's in "hysterics" by @RepDougCollins pic.twitter.com/T65mgTX1Ex — Ben D'Avanzo (@BenDAvanzo) May 4, 2017
The farther back you go, the more examples you'll find. Former Prime Minister David Cameron infamously told Angela Eagle to "calm down, dear, and listen to the doctor" when they asked a question during a session designed to, well, let MPs ask David Cameron questions. In America, female politicians from Hillary Clinton to Michele Bachmann have been subject to magazine covers — Clinton's concerned "THE VOICES IN Them HEAD;" Bachmann's dubbed them "THE QUEEN OF RAGE" — portraying them with googly eyes and/or wide-open, shouting mouths, implying that they were literally insane. And if all this is bad for white women, it is worse for black women like Jackson Lee or Harris, who are frequently cast as "aggressive" or "angry" simply for existing. Just ask Michelle Obama, who's endured New York Times' speculation on whether she's an "angry black woman," and has had every photo for which they don't gamely smile compiled into a tabloid slideshow that dubbed them "The Queen of Mean": ("Tantrums, Feuds, Fights and More!")
But when a woman breaks through this conditioning — when they are passionate, fiery, able to connect on a human level and evoke emotion — we say she's a shrieking mess who's unfit to lead.
Like Harris, most of the women who are accused of "hysteria" are not engaged in wild displays of emotion. Of the women on our list, only Lee even comes close — because they were delivering a speech, and politicians are supposed to be passionate and forceful while giving speeches. The fact that Lee can be penalized for visibly caring about their constituents dying under bridges is one small part of how the "hysteria" diagnosis hurts women's ability to engage with their work and their audiences. We monitor women's public emotions so closely that many female politicians learn to keep any human vulnerability buried deep beneath a seemingly impenetrable veneer. For this, we call them "calculating," "robotic" or "inauthentic." (You may associate some or all of these words with a certain recent presidential candidate — but when Warren ran for Senate in 2012, local pundits bemoaned their woodenness, and accused them of faking folksiness to disguise their Harvard credentials, too. "I'm asking them to be more authentic. I want them to just sound like a human being, not read the script," one political analyst complained.)
But when a woman breaks through this conditioning — when they are passionate, fiery, able to connect on a human level and evoke emotion — we say she's a shrieking mess who's unfit to lead. And it's all particularly cruel because forcefulness and outrage are core assets in any male politician's rhetorical toolbox. Where would Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump be if they weren't allowed to get angry?
On some level, we're still playing by 1907 rules. The assumption behind the question "woman or suffragette?" is that you cannot, actually, be both at once. Women's political activity is not just wrongheaded, but unnatural; a pathology. Sexists refer to every female political opinion as "hysterical," just like they refer to every word a woman says when they open their mouth as "shouting," and for the same reasons — not because the women are actually being loud or unreasonable, but because women are not supposed to have opinions or voices at all. They don't just want women to be more genial or hushed. They want women to leave the room.
Which is to say, there is actually no way for Kamala Harris to do their job, let alone be good at their job, without being called aggressive, loud, and "hysterical." There's no way out for Sheila Jackson Lee, or Elizabeth Warren, or any other woman, either. The only thing they can do is keep soldiering on, regardless. One hopes, at least, they can occasionally pause to savor all the old white dude "nervousness" and very male, very real "hysteria" they manage to inspire.
The Fifa and Uefa presidents, Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini, have issued almost simultaneous statements denying any wrongdoing relating to the £1.35m paid to Platini in February 2011, for which Blatter is subject to a Swiss criminal investigation.
Lawyers for Blatter said they will remain as Fifa president despite the investigation by the Swiss attorney general, Michael Lauber, into a suspicion that the money paid to Platini was a “disloyal payment”. Both men stated that it related to work Platini did at Fifa as Blatter's adviser – which finished nine years earlier, in 2002. Blatter and Platini are also subject to investigation over the same payment by Fifa's ethics committee, meaning both could imminently be suspended, which would scupper Platini's candidacy to be elected Fifa president when Blatter steps down in February.
Blatter's lawyers, Lorenz Erni, based in Zurich, and Richard Cullen, in the US, said in their response: “President Blatter spoke to Fifa staff today and informed the staff that they were cooperating with the authorities, reiterated that they had done nothing illegal or improper and stated that they would remain as president of Fifa.”
Platini and Blatter sought to clarify that the £1.35m, which the Frenchman confirmed they were paid in February 2011, was for work they legitimately did at Fifa. In a letter of explanation sent to all Uefa's 54 national football associations, including the English FA, Platini said they acted as special adviser to Blatter. Blatter's lawyers described it as “a valuable employment relationship” and said “the payments were valid compensation and nothing more.”
Lauber is examining whether the £1.35m was a “disloyal payment” made by Blatter “at the expense of Fifa,” which is understood to mean an alleged breach of Blatter's fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of their employer. Blatter was interrogated as a defendant in Zurich on Friday, while Lauber stated that Platini was interviewed “as a person asked to provide information”.
Blatter and Platini both emphasised that the £1.35m was paid properly through the Fifa books and Platini said they declared it to the relevant authorities in Switzerland. The money was “the final outstanding amount” owing to him, Platini said, although they did not explain why it took nine years to be paid. Nor did they refer to the close timing between receipt of that £1.35m and their decision not to stand against Blatter in the 2011 presidential election but to support them instead.
“I wish to clarify that for the period 1998 to 2002 I was employed by Fifa to work on a wide range of matters relating to football,” Platini wrote. “It was a full-time job and my functions were known by all. The remuneration was agreed at the time and after initial payments were made, the final outstanding amount of 2m Swiss francs was paid in February of 2011.”
Blatter also denied any criminality relating to a 2005 TV contract granted to Jack Warner, the former president of the Caribbean Football Union, for which Lauber is also investigating the Fifa president. In their statement on Friday Lauber said Blatter is the subject of criminal proceedings relating to these two matters “on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and – alternatively – misappropriation”.
Platini also highlighted that they were not interviewed by Lauber as a suspect “but simply in my capacity as a person providing information”. That status in Switzerland does not put a person beyond possible suspicion, however. Defined at article 178 of the Swiss code of criminal procedure, a “person asked to provide information,” includes “a person who cannot be excluded as the perpetrator of or as a participant in the offence under investigation.”
Platini said they will not be making detailed statements “as a matter of respect”, but intended to clear their name.
“I am aware that these events may harm my image and my reputation and by consequence, the image of Uefa, the organisation of which I am proud to be president,” they wrote. “For these reasons, I wish to use all my energies to ensure that any issues or misunderstandings can be resolved as soon as possible.”
The English FA is understood to be still officially supporting Platini to become Fifa president but will discuss the affair at its board meeting on Wednesday.
It's December, which means Best of 2016 lists are raining (snowing?) from the sky. With so many lists out there, who has time to read all of them? Turns out: We do. But because you probably don't, we rounded up all the Top 10 lists we could find, smashed 'em together, and spit out overall Top 10 lists for the year's best albums, songs, books and movies. You're welcome.

A Note On Methodology
We wish we could say there was a super fancy algorithm that combed the internet and did this for us. But the truth is that the entity doing the internet combing was a human Digg Editor, and calculations were performed by an Excel sheet that ingested and re-ranked all the lists we fed into it (briefly: #1 ranked items received 10 points, #2 ranked items got 9 points... down through #10 ranked items, which got 1 point; items on unranked Top 10 lists all got 5 points).
Charles Murray has an amusing strategy for fighting regulation, which contains within it a rather naive theory of the state:
And so my modest proposal: Let's withhold that compliance [with regulations] through systematic civil disobedience. Not for all regulations, but for the pointless, stupid and tyrannical ones.
[...]
I propose two frameworks for implementing this strategy. The first would be a legal foundation functioning much as the Legal Services Corporation does for the poor, except that its money will come from private donors, not the government. It would be an altruistic endeavor, operating exclusively on behalf of the homeowner or small business being harassed by the regulators. The foundation would pick up all the legal costs of the defense and pay the fines when possible.
The other framework would be occupational defense funds. Let's take advantage of professional expertise and pride of vocation to drive standards of best practice. For example, the American Dental Association could form Dental Shield, with dentists across America paying a small annual fee. The bargain: Dentists whose practices meet the ADA's professional standards will be defended when accused of violating a regulation that the ADA has deemed to be pointless, stupid or tyrannical. The same kind of defense fund could be started by truckers, crafts unions, accountants, physicians, farmers or almost any other occupation.
Like the sovereign citizen movement, which is known for filing bizarre court briefs using antiquated legal language and weird capitalization, Charles Murray seems to have partially fallen prey to an idea that I call the Abracadabra State.
The Abracadabra State is this fantastical idea of a state that, through clevery trickery and maneuvering, can be stymied from successfully exerting its will. The sovereign citizens imagine that, if they use magic words in their legal briefs, courts will have to side their way. Certain fringe anti-tax people imagine that, by showing the income tax amendment to the constitution was adopted in a procedurally defective manner, they can keep from paying income taxes. And Charles Murray imagines that, through clever insurance entities, regulatory agencies can be frustrated.
The problem with all of these Abracadabra strategies is that they discount the degree to which a committed state has nearly endless tools for achieving compliance. The state is not a robot. It consists of politicians and other officials that can and do change things when necessary to achieve some specific goal.
In Murray's case, it's not difficult to imagine how the state could disrupt their insurance strategy because many courts have already basically dealt with this problem. It's very common in the US, though not universal, for courts to forbid defendants from insuring against punitive damages. The reasoning for making such damages uninsurable is, among other things, that the damages are assessed specifically to dissuade people from intentionally carrying out egregious acts. And, obviously, if they are not made to personally bear the costs of such damages, that purpose is frustrated.
It would be trivial, following that line of reasoning, to declare that damages assessed to persons intentionally disobeying regulations cannot be insured against. It would likewise be trivial to enjoin these mutual insurance companies from operating, holding their officers in contempt, even jailing them if they try to act unlawfully as regulation avoidance insurance.
The state, through the courts or legislatures, may or may not opt for these compliance mechanisms, but the point is that they easily could. If they opt not to, it's not because you found some tricky way to beat state power. It's because state power actually supports what you are doing.
General Point
It's become somewhat cliche these days to vaguely declare that certain bad trends in the US (e.g. inequality) are actually about power. This observation gets at an important point, even if those who make it doesn't always understand it.
Societies exist in a state of constant flux, with new technologies and organizational forms always churning things over and pushing them to drift in one direction or another. Those changes don't determine political economic outcomes by themselves, though this is how they are often analyzed. The outcome of any particular development depends on how political institutions respond to and accommodate the development. In that sense, it really is about power: whoever controls the political institutions determines how new developments in the world are funneled into eventual outcomes.
For inequality, states captured by egalitarian power structures can plan around economic trends to ensure gains are shared broadly. Less egalitarian power structures will naturally direct changes in less egalitarian ways. For Murray, states committed to effective regulation will easily blow up their Mickey Mouse insurance scheme, while those less committed may permit it to flourish. But at all times, it is not so much the outsider trends that are driving things to their eventual outcomes. It's how the state uses its power that is.

Ондржей Соукуп — чех, но знает Россию не хуже русских: он пишет о ней много лет. Соукуп много раз бывал в Москве и провинции, его даже считали пророссийским журналистом, хотя он всего лишь пытался быть объективным. Однако отношения двух стран портятся на глазах. В Праге задержали русского хакера, Чехия создала подразделение по борьбе с российской пропагандой, а Россия не дала Соукупу визу. Журналист рассказал «Снобу» о врагах и союзниках и о том, как люди становятся разменной монетой в войне спецслужб
Журналист никогда не должен становиться новостью. Это старое правило. И если имя журналиста все-таки появляется в новостях, ничего хорошего его не ждет. Мне самому пришлось в этом убедиться на собственной шкуре.
В июле я пришел в российское консульство в Праге, чтобы поехать в командировку в Москву и Ивановскую область. Я так делал десятки раз, я два года работал московским корреспондентом газеты Hospodářské noviny, меня уже и в консульстве узнавали. Но дама в окошке сказала, что в визе мне отказано: «Мы ничего не знаем, это в Москве решили».
Я забрал свой паспорт и побрел прочь. По дороге я названивал всем знакомым в дипломатических ведомствах России и Чехии. Через пару часов я получил неофициальное сообщение из Москвы. В переводе с дипломатического языка оно звучало так: «Старик, извини, что так получилось, ничего личного. Это просто ответная мера, что ваши весной не продлили аккредитации двум российским журналистам».
Я был в курсе этой истории и даже был в нее непосредственно вовлечен. Чешский МИД весной 2016-го не продлил аккредитации Александру Куранову и Владимиру Снегиреву на основании секретного доклада контрразведки BIS. Что было в докладе, нам выяснить не удалось. Нам лишь сказали: «Ну, совсем без оснований их не обвинили». Меня история сильно задела, так как в ней было слишком много противоречий. Александр Куранов приехал в Чехословакию еще в конце восьмидесятых. Как представитель перестроечной прессы он даже контактировал с диссидентскими кругами. Собственно, один из тогдашних диссидентов, Ян Урбан, тоже выступил в его защиту. Ну хорошо, допустим, он мог кроме журналистики заниматься и другими делами. Но в случае Владимира Снегирева вообще ничего не понятно. Легенда советской журналистики, организовал походы через Северный полюс, работал во всех возможных горячих точках. В Чехию он переехал полтора года назад, его знания чешского пока ограничены заказом очередного пива. Что не удивительно: ему скоро будет 75 лет. Под описание Джеймса Бонда он точно не подходит.
Дополнительные сомнения вызывает решение не продлить им аккредитацию, но не лишать их вида на жительство. Без журналистской корочки в Чехии заниматься журналистикой вполне можно, я свое удостоверение в Чехии никогда в жизни не показывал. И если они представляют такую угрозу для национальной безопасности, как утверждает секретный доклад BIS, то, наверное, не стоить их оставлять в Чехии.
Я про это написал и даже помог Снегиреву и Куранову организовать пресс-конференцию в Синдикате журналистов Чехии. Не буду скрывать, отчасти мною руководила боязнь ответных мер с российской стороны. Я думал, это коснется троих чешских журналистов, которые аккредитованы в Москве. Что это коснется меня самого, я представить тогда не мог. Но все закончилось фразой дамы из консульства: «В визе отказано».
Следующие месяцы ушли на попытки понять, что же все-таки случилось. Я услышал самые невероятные версии. Официальная версия российского МИДа была, что это не их решение, что запретить въезд попросила «страна, имеющая соответствующие договоры с Российской Федерацией». По факту, это может быть только Беларусь. В другие страны Таможенного союза — Армению или Казахстан — я, к стыду своему, не ездил, и количество статей, написанных мною про эти страны за последнюю пятилетку, можно пересчитать по пальцам руки не слишком умелого дровосека.
В то же время я ездил в Минск в составе делегации чешского министра иностранных дел Любомира Заоралека, и белорусскую визу я получил без проблем. Визит прошел в доброжелательной обстановке, в этом же духе были и мои материалы. Никаких поводов запретить мне въезд.
Слышал я и более экзотические версии. Например, что решение не продлевать аккредитации российским журналистам не было связано с их деятельностью, а на самом деле таким образом чешские спецслужбы посылали сигнал настоящему агенту российской разведки. Чтобы умерил свою активность, иначе его вышлют из страны. Такие слухи по определению невозможно проверить, да и логика в данном случае хромает. Но искать логику, если ты имеешь дело со спецслужбами, дело крайне неблагодарное.
Больше меня насторожила другая версия. Что таким образом власти Чехии отгораживаются от официальной российской пропаганды. Владимир Снегирев был корреспондентом «Российской газеты», печатного органа правительства РФ. Александр Куранов четверть века писал для «Комсомольской правды», «Аргументов и фактов», «Коммерсанта» и других изданий, а в последние два года стал корреспондентом РИА «Новости».
Знакомые спорили со мной. Они говорили: корреспондент нацистской газеты Völkisher Beobachter тоже не смог бы работать в военном Лондоне. Аналогия хромает, но предположим: мы выслали журналистов. Что мы получим кроме глубокого морального удовлетворения? В Чехии работает один российский сайт на чешском: «Спутник». У него нет сотрудников в Праге, но это не создает ему никаких проблем в работе.
Как бы то ни было, я защищал российских журналистов — и сам оказался в ситуации, когда тебя защищают. Я благодарен всем российским коллегам, которые за меня заступились. Тем не менее были и комментарии в духе «ну что такого, они тоже притесняют наших».
«Не расстраивайся, — написал мне давний московский знакомый. — Ты должен понимать, что идет самая настоящая война и ты в ней тоже участвуешь. Ну да, ты не врешь в открытую, но все равно объективно ты сражаешься на стороне противника...»
Надо признаться, я расстроился, услышав такие слова от человека, с которым мы знакомы лет пятнадцать. Я привык делить людей не по национальностям, а по их делам и характерам. Журналистов из «Лайфа» или создателей разных «Анатомий протеста» я не люблю не из-за их политических взглядов, а из-за того, что это плохая, манипулятивная журналистика. А с Максимом Юсиным из московского «Коммерсанта» я могу не соглашаться, но знаю, что он добросовестно встречался с людьми, брал интервью и не замалчивает фактов, которые могут не очень вписываться в его картину мира. В этом смысле он мне коллега, в отличие от некоторых украинских ура-патриотов. Если использовать пафосную «военную» риторику, то Максим мой «союзник», а Дмитрий Стешин и Александр Коц из «Комсомольской правды», равно как и некоторые украинские журналисты, — мои «противники».
К сожалению, моя личная история вполне вписалась в общую картину. Дмитрий Киселев и его соратники по информационному фронту потрудились на славу. Если судить по большинству русскоязычных СМИ и еще больше по реакции в соцсетях, то Россия окружена врагами, которые утром просыпаются с мыслью нагадить русским, овладеть их природными ресурсами. Особо умиляет сосредоточение на роли США. Во всем мире бывший спикер Госдепартамента Джейн Псаки известна узким специалистам-американистам, зато в России ей была посвящена даже целая серия анекдотов. По количеству упоминаний в российских СМИ она могла смело конкурировать даже с самим Бараком Обамой.
Согласно исследованиям «Левада-центра», в мае 2016 года 70% опрошенных относились плохо или очень плохо к США или Евросоюзу. В августе 2016 года те же 70% сказали, что Россия должна и дальше продолжать свою политику, невзирая на санкции. Про Украину можно, наверное, вообще не упоминать. К ней относится негативно 73% россиян. Украинцы логично отвечают тем же. И если в России вектор пропаганды может смениться, то на Украине — вряд ли. Впечатление от аннексии Крыма и от тысяч погибших на Донбассе гораздо долговечнее, чем еженедельное клеймение врагов в исполнении Дмитрия Киселева на российском телевидении.
Наследие нынешней конфронтации России с Западом так быстро не пройдет и может портить наши отношения еще многие десятилетия, кто бы ни был обитателем Кремля.
Но хочу вернуться к началу. Мы можем не соглашаться с политикой России, США, Украины или Евросоюза. Но если мы как журналисты дадим себя втянуть в «информационную войну», это будет наше поражение. И победят в этой войне те, кто сегодня радуется, что кому-то не дали визу.
Mack Beggs, the transgender wrestler, should not wrestle as either a boy or a girl. They made a choice, so she, not society, should accept the consequences.
Mack Beggs is a 17-year-old genetic female with a serious body dysmorphia problem that has never been addressed: They believe that they were meant to be male, not female. Rather than treating this psychological problem, Beggs' parents allowed them to take heavy doses of testosterone so that they can present to the world as a boy.
Aside from the fact that testosterone is very damaging, taking it does not make Beggs male. They have two X chromosomes, two ovaries, a uterus, milk-producing mammary glands (which she'll eventually amputate), and a female skeletal system. What the testosterone has done, however, is given them a reasonable simulacrum of a male's musculature.
Beggs has trained as a high school wrestler in Texas. Texas has a rule that students who compete in the state championships must compete in accordance with their biological gender, not their fantasy gender. Those with XY chromosomes, penises, testes, and the male's heavier bone structure and musculature compete in the “Boys” category. Those who are equipped, as Beggs is, with two X chromosomes, ovaries, a uterus, milk-producing mammary glands, and a female's lighter musculoskeletal system compete in the “Girls” category.
Texas refused to waive the rules for Beggs, so their biology trumped their delusional fantasy — they ended up competing as a girl, albeit a girl who was taking steroids, something that would have been illegal in any competition that did not intersect with the Left's gender madness. By gender madness, of course, I mean the “pro-science” Left's insistence that gender is not a biological construct but is, instead, a matter of wishing makes it so: Gender-wise, you are what you want to be.
Needless to say, bulked up by steroids, Beggs swept the Girls' class in the Texas state wrestling championships:
Mack Beggs, a 17-year-old transgender boy from Texas, has won the Texas state girls wrestling championship. That title caps off an undefeated season for Beggs, who went 57-0.
The hot debate now is whether Beggs should have competed according to their biology (as a girl) or according to their fantasy (as a boy). I say they shouldn't have competed at all.
Where in the world did we come away with the belief that choices have no consequences if you're from a designated victim class? In the real world, once one leaves the Left's victim mentality behind, we make choices all the time — including principled choices — and then live with the consequences.
Every gay man who comes out of the closet as a conservative is making a choice to be reviled and abused by those they once called their friends. Every woman who is so influenced by pop culture that they feel they must have breast augmentation makes a choice to risk losing sensation in an erogenous zone. Every woman who takes a look at their newborn baby and realizes that it is utterly dependent on her, and who then chooses (if possible) to be a stay-at-home Mom has made a choice to jump off the career track, knowing they may never be able to return. Every man who was out there sowing their wild oats, only to impregnate a woman, can make a principled choice at that moment to settle down and raise the child with that woman. He'll lose sexual variety, but gain stability, maturity, and protection from disease, not to mention the satisfaction of seeing their child grow. These are serious choices and the Left won't touch them.
Things are different when the Left gets involved. In the real world, every Muslim teen who makes a principled religious choice to wear a niqab should then say bye-bye to working at a place like Abercrombie, a chain that is all about being fashion-forward. Because Muslim women are a Leftist protected class, however, Abercrombie must hire someone entirely inconsistent with its brand. Likewise, in the real world, every Muslim man who ends up working at a grocery store should accept that handling ham, pork, and bacon goes with the job. With the Leftist wind at their back, though, that man can demand that the job changed to handle their preferences.
And oh boy! Watch out when transgenders, the newest, “hottest” victim class, get involved. In a sane world, the fact that a minuscule proportion of the population may find itself struggling with which bathroom to use would be a non-issue. We would say, “Look, you have to adapt. If you know you're going to a public place without individual bathrooms, and you still look like your biological sex, wear the clothes of that sex. After all, if you're a biological guy, you might have noticed that women in 21st century America dress like men all the time: un-styled hair, no make-up, shirts, slacks, and sneakers. You can dress like that type of girl when need be, instead of always dressing in ultra-feminine guard. Real women, not fake women, make clothing choices all the time so that they are save depending on which environment they choose.”
Likewise, when it comes to competitive sports, we would say, “Look, you made a choice. You could have opted to deal with body dysmorphia and competed in the category of sport consistent with your biological body. However, you made the choice — and it was most certainly yours to make — to use drugs and surgery to mimic the body of the opposite sex. To the extent you're engaged in physical mimicry, the consequence is that certain activities will be closed to you. Choice. Consequence.”
Because trannies are a Leftist issue, though, it's the real women, the biological women, who are told that they have to bend and take really terrible risks. An obvious risk in the competitive realm is that a person who is born a boy, but playing out the fantasy of being a girl, will physically injure them. You cut off your penis, wear high heels, and take hormones, but you've still got those big boy bones and, if you're working out, those big boy muscles. Women are simply smaller and less strong, a biological reality the Left routinely ignores.
And going back to the bathrooms, the Left is imposing dangerous risks there too. The risks, incidentally, aren't that transgenders will assault them. I believe the statistics that say that transgender peoples are not likely to commit assault. (On the whole, though, men with sexual identity problems or non-heterosexual preferences, are riskier citizens, and that includes being riskier when it comes to both murder and rape. The ones most at risk from these guys are boys and men, and there's no bathroom rule that's going to stop these predators.) The dangerous risk is that making rules to benefit transgenders whom the Left insists must not suffer any consequences from their choice is an open door to nasty heterosexual men with serious voyeurism, rape, murder, and pedophilia issues.
One of the things I've always admired about orthodox Jews and the Amish is that they recognize that their religious and cultural choices do not mesh well with the greater world in which they live and, rather than demanding that the world change, they have placed their principles to the fore and retreated from the world. Choices. Consequences. The Orthodox and Amish ways are how mature people and mature societies handle choices and consequences. The deal is that, as a civilized society, we do not target them for discrimination and that they, as reasonable, principled people, do not go out of their way to demand that we remake the majority society , of which they are only a teensy-weensy part — to suit them.
Because Mack Beggs has a mental problem, I'm sorry for them To the extent that they and their family have decided not to treat the problem but, instead, to revel in and exploit it . . . that's a choice. Texas should not have to change its rules. Girls should not have to wrestle with a pumped up faux-hermaphrodite. Beggs made a personal decision and she, not the rest of the world, needs to accept the consequences.

Central Florida's first Wawa store opens today
The Wawa at 5910 Central Florida Parkway near SeaWorld is the first in Florida and one of five scheduled to open in Central Florida in the next five weeks.
About 100 people Tuesday got a sneak preview of Orlando 'sfirst Wawa convenience store, with the first sandwich made by Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer.
"We want to be part of your community in your daily lives, whether it is with a cup of coffee, with our fresh hoagies or with our tremendous service. Florida is our future," said Howard Stoeckel, Wawa's CEO.
At the invitation of company officials, a smiling Dyer took their place behind the counter to make a big hoagie that they later shared with Wawa leaders. Store manager Charlene Harrel guided the mayor through the process.
Wawa is known for fresh food such as built-to-order hoagies and salads. It has more than 580 stores in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia.
The next Orlando-area stores to open will be on Hoffner Avenue and South Goldenrod Road in Orlando, John Young Parkway and Silver Star Road in Orlando, U.S. Highway 192 and Simpson Road in Kissimmee and Orange Blossom Trail and on East Donegan Avenue in Kissimmee.
Within the next five years, Wawa plans to have 100 stores in the Orlando and Tampa area.
The Central Florida Parkway store will officially open Wednesday with a lineup of political heavyweights that is expected to include Dyer, Florida Gov. Rick Scott and Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs.
The new stores will each employ nearly 35 people.
Through its partnership with the Second Harvest Food Bank, Wawa hopes to raise and donate $25,000 (up to $5,000 per store) to help funding the construction of a new building.
Wawa President Chris Gheysens said each store costs $6 millon to build, so the investment in Florida will be "roughly a billion dollars here between stores that we build and are getting ready for the next wave of the future."

General Petr Pavel, Chairman of the NATO Military Committee, and General Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia, meet in Baku. (photo: NATO)
NATO's military chief and their Russian counterpart met in Baku, the first such high-level meeting since the two sides froze relations in 2014.
This follows a similar meeting in February between the Russian officer, Valeriy Gerasimov, and the chairperson of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, Joe Dunford. That meeting also took place in Baku.
Two events may not be enough to suggest a trend or a policy, but it is suggestive of Azerbaijan's suitability as a geopolitically neutral entrepot in the ongoing Russia-West conflict. Azerbaijan sells oil and gas to Europe, while buying weapons from Russia. But it's shown no interest in close political cooperation with either, making it non-threatening to either side.
"We are interested in reducing tension on a global scale and we are pleased to hold these important talks for the second time in Baku." Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said ahead of a meeting they held with Gerasimov while the latter was in town.
Azerbaijan's media, in any case, has seized on the meeting as proof of the country's geopolitical centrality, with the meeting -- and especially Baku's role -- receiving heavy coverage.
The meeting "demonstrated that Azerbaijan is a geopolitical link between Russia and the United States, having strategic relations with both countries," wrote news agency Trend in a commentary. "[T]he country has deservedly won the spot as one of the most important geopolitical centers of the region. Azerbaijan is a reliable and long-standing partner of NATO and a strategic partner of Russia, and Moscow trusts it."
Russian analyst Sergey Markov told Vestnik Kavkaza: "Baku positions itself as a potential peacemaker, very balanced, respectful and respected partner, whom it is pleasant to deal with. In the future, Baku can turn into a kind of Caucasian Geneva in the diplomatic field, and Azerbaijan, respectively, into the Caucasus Switzerland."
Another Russian military analyst, Viktor Baranets, told news agency APA: "Conducting this kind of meeting in the Azerbaijani capital suggests that first, Baku is turning into the capital of the normalization of Russia-US and Russia-NATO relations. Secondly, Baku is situated in a position of global significance."
And so on. One can understand Baku's eagerness to seize on this; it has always sought to rely on its strategic importance as a means of buffering criticism of its political and human rights record. And these have been a bad few days for Azerbaijan in the international eye, mainly due to a blockbuster investigation of the country's large-scale international corruption. So it's obviously looking to change the subject of the international conversation.
Most of the invocations of Azerbaijan's strategic significance were vague and boilerplate, but the Trend commentary did have an intriguing take: Baku is a good meeting spot because it can keep a secret: "The fact that the information about this meeting appeared in the Russian media on the day of holding the meeting, became one of the proofs of the highest professionalism of the host party." It added: "However, in February, the news of Gerasimov's meeting with Dunford leaked to the US media, but not to the Azerbaijani one." So the point is, Washington leaks, but Baku, Brussels, and Moscow don't? Probably true, as far as it goes. And so it seems there may be more meetings there that we're not hearing about.
Yay, another drawing finished^^I'm not sure if it's bloody enough to put a warning?This is Jail, one of my werewolf characters. You might remember them from here . I revamped their design a little bit even though it's hardly visible on this drawing, hehI can hopefull ymake them a reference sheet for their werewolf form.So have them all bloody screaming at the moon because cliche bloody werewolf and fullmoon is a nice thing to practice some teeth and blood and fur.I'm really getting a thing to draw teeth and blood, I dunno xDHad quite a bit fun with it and even streamed some parts, thanks for all who visited!So, Jail is one hell of an old character but I still like them a lot. He's a bit of the typical werewolf cliche but who cares! xDMore info about them will be on the Sheet that I hopefully can manage to finish somewhen.Btw, there is also another version for this drawing because I actually drew it again for some forum game and this time my task was to draw the person as a werewolf. I liked the pose a lot and decided to make two versions. One with an actual character and one for the person in the forum with a bit less blood than here because the people there don't like it too bloody .other version can be seen here Paint Tool Sai~ 7h~ 40 layersSome help from Google for the teethJail & Art ©
There's “herpes” and then there's “Oh my God, I've got herpes!” The former is the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) which results in cold sores. The latter is the herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) which results in genital herpes and causes sores in the groin area, fever and body aches. There's no cure for herpes so there's usually a lot of animosity towards those who spread this STD. Some of that anger is also directed towards the prehistoric male (you know it was a male) who got the first case of herpes from an ape or chimpanzee. He'd probably say (or grunt) that they picked it up from eating their flesh, but their many sore mates would undoubtedly suspect otherwise. Researchers have recently discovered the Herpes Caveman Zero – a mysterious hominin species nicknamed Nutcracker Man. Did they get it from one of their mates who used a club to make sure no one else got their herpes?
Anthropologists have known that the last common ancestor of apes and humans carried HSV2 but only passed it on to the ape side some 7 million years ago. However, somewhere between 3 and 1.4 million years ago, our human ancestors got it back. In research published in Virus Evolution, Dr. Charlotte Houldcroft of the University of Cambridge has identified the first infectee as the Plio-Pleistocene hominin Paranthropus boisei, — the Nutcracker Man. Discovered in Tanzania in 1959 by the famous archaeologist-paleontologist Mary Leakey, they got the nickname because their thick skull, enormous teeth and massive jaw made them look like a chestnut-crunching caveman.
But how did they get herpes and how did they pass it on to Homo erectus? This is where it gets gross – and not in the way you might think. Study co-author Simon Underdown, a paleoanthropologist at Oxford Brookes University in England, tells how they found the answer.
“Climate fluctuations over millennia caused forests and lakes to expand and contract. Layering climate data with fossil locations helped us determine the species most likely to come into contact with ancestral chimpanzees in the forests, as well as other hominins at water sources.”
The researchers determined that Nutcracker Man liked to eat their nuts with a side of raw chimpanzee meat and that's how they picked up HSV2. While Homo erectus, the human ancestor roaming around at the time, didn't have the same craving for chimp, they did have a taste for their smaller and slower counterpart – Nutcracker Man. By eating the flesh of P. boisei, along with drinking from the same ponds, Homo erectus picked up genital herpes and began passing it around to their female friends and down to their offspring.
So the demise of poor misshapen Nutcracker Man was caused by their love of chimp meat and their own tasty legs, thighs and breasts. Will that make you likely to forgive them for giving us herpes? That probably depends on whether you have it or not.
"Everybody is taking a hard look," says one network chief as an ABC creator courts right-wing writers, a studio head rethinks their slate and blue-collar viewers suddenly become a hot demo.
In the days following Donald Trump's stunning presidential win, ABC Studios chief Patrick Moran called Black-ish creator Kenya Barris. The men had a project at ABC about a pair of politically divided pundits who fall in love. Suddenly it felt more relevant.
But now Moran wanted to be sure both sides of the spectrum were being presented with equal credibility. "In years past, it would be very easy to let one side feel like the cartoon and have the show assume that the audience is siding with the other," Moran says of the liberal slant that often permeates Hollywood output. Barris agreed and has begun courting right-wing voices for their writers room: "There was no way I wanted to do something that was going to further the divide in this country." On Dec. 6, the project was ordered to pilot.
That exchange came on the heels of what Moran describes as a "wake-up call." Over at ABC, entertainment chief Channing Dungey acknowledges that the rise of Trump and their blue-collar support forced them to question whether their programming was too focused on upper-income brackets. Similar check-ins have taken place across the TV industry as executives try to better understand and appeal to a demographic to which many hadn't paid enough attention. "[The election] made the ground shake underneath media," TLC president Nancy Daniels tells THR, "and now everybody is taking a hard look: Are we telling the right stories? Are we reaching the right people?"
Nobody interviewed by THR is suggesting the TV landscape will be turned over to a slew of Roseanne rip-offs; but many do expect the working class, middle-America ethos to be better represented, particularly at the broadcast networks where Trump's 60 million supporters are key to success. Changes likely will be gradual, since the bulk of 2017 development already had been started by Nov. 8.
For Dungey, it will be more about assessing the projects they have already bought through a different lens. "We've always been a network that has prided itself on keeping diversity and inclusion at the forefront of our conversations," they say. "But we've largely been defining that from a racial perspective, a religious perspective, an ethnic perspective, and looking at it from the point of view of issues of gender and sexuality and not as much through the prism of economics and of cities versus small towns." With the latter in mind, a Reba McEntire drama set in the South that Dungey snatched up pre-election now may have more resonance — just as a Tennessee-set half-hour starring a comedian called the "liberal redneck" could suddenly feel timely at Fox.
Moran suggests the shift at ABC Studios likely will be more tonal than conceptual, with an increased focus on projects rooted in "hope, optimism and escapism" rather than the edgy, cable-like fare they and others have chased in years past. NBC president Jennifer Salke says she, too, has given a lot of thought to the mood of the country postelection and will embrace more feel-good comedies and broad, family-friendly fare a la 2016 breakout This Is Us. And 20th Century Fox TV's Jonnie Davis insists their studio will continue to tell stories about other swaths of America, as it has with NBC's This Is Us and ABC's Speechless.
But not everyone is as eager to rethink strategy in the Trump Age. "I've never had success trying to retrofit development to service some sentiment going on in the country, my community or the companies we work in," explains Fox TV Group chairperson Dana Walden. And others, led by uber-producer Ryan Murphy, believe it's more important than ever to use the TV medium to promote progressive values. "I'm doing Feud [starring Susan Sarandon and Jessica Lange for FX] not just because of the larger-than-life characters but because it directly confronts ageism, sexism, female pay scale inadequacies, the glass ceiling," they said Dec. 7 at THR's Women in Entertainment event. "It's a show that asks for and demands rebellion." Their views highlight a possible challenge in appealing to the Trump demo; many of TV's top creators, including Murphy, Greg Berlanti and Lee Daniels, are vocal that their worldviews are in direct opposition to Trump's message.
And then there's a third subset, which includes execs at CBS and TLC, who believe they're already appealing to a non-metropolitan demo with such series as NCIS or Tyler Perry fare. A+E Networks CEO Nancy Dubuc suggests the success of Pawn Stars, American Pickers and Duck Dynasty on their networks was an early indicator of how the country was feeling. "People in the entertainment community have put their noses up at the kind of programming that we do," they say. "Maybe they would be better served by paying a little more attention to actually watching and understanding the stories that we're telling."

Parliamentary laws are not empowered to determine which acts constitute the crime that is known as genocide. The U.N. Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG) declares in Article 6 that the charge of genocide has legal effect only when tried by a competent tribunal. French politicians have ignored this clear language.
In January 2001, France's parliament passed a law that accepts the applicability of genocide regarding the Armenian suffering, even though actual evidence had never been brought before an authorized court for review in the context of this genocide claim. This act of lawmaking created a false perception that the term genocide can be legally assigned to the events of 1915 by the votes of local politicians.
Recently, the attempt to confuse the legal standing of the Holocaust with the political standing of the Armenian allegation has prompted a reiteration of the difference between courts of law and houses of representatives. Now that France's Constitutional Court has reaffirmed that proper history is decided by proof and not by popular demand, the matter is seen as a triumph for French democracy and an excellent example of how the separation of powers is supposed to function.
Nevertheless, the sum of this separation of powers is that the debate has provided yet another major platform on which the term genocide is associated with Armenian victimhood and Turkish perpetration. Greater attention to the consequences in terms of public knowledge would show that in this instance the separation of powers meant a unified soft-power effect on the information that is consumed by the public.
Soft power aims at minds and is marked by the ability to generate particular information, attract people to this information and then have them absorb it as part of what they know - or think that they know - about the world. In turn, this "knowledge" affects their attitude and leads them to do things in accordance with the interests of great power. For this process to be successful, the public must be distracted from its guarded position against information control. One method through which this is accomplished involves setting up a debate. The public is focused on having to decide between the marked opinions, and as a result it neglects to question the significant details that are part of the seemingly balanced report. The report is made to appear balanced because it is placed between extreme sides, and then the report - while establishing an agenda itself - is taken for granted and absorbed as basic knowledge.
For instance, in 2012 when France's Constitutional Council dismissed a draft law that would have criminalized those who deny genocide, it served as an occasion to attract people into absorbing more information that associates the term genocide with Armenian suffering and Turkish denial. Powerful sources of information such as the BBC, CNN, Reuters and The New York Times published articles in which the existence of the French bill was utilized to present the words "Armenian" and "genocide" together yet again. This information is then circulated around the world by way of syndication. The news item also offered an opportunity to add, as The New York Times did on Feb. 28, 2012, a repetition of what has attained the status of a mantra: "Historians widely believe that about 1.5 million Armenians were systematically killed by Ottoman Turkish troops." Genocide scholars who are paid to selectively label events as genocide and rummage through wartime pro
paganda to criminalize Turks are not historians.
NEO-NAZI FRENCH POLITICIANSThese efforts to instill a popular language that familiarizes the condemnation of the entire Turkish people come in cycles. In 2012, French Senators Herve Marseille and Valerie Boyer were the ones whose statements denied that the Holocaust has a unique status in French law. In the fresh version of this French debate, it was a convicted Holocaust denier, Vincent Reynouard, who claimed that the non-legal standing of the genocide allegation in the Armenian context warranted a legal challenge against the validity of criminalizing Holocaust denial. Aside from revealing that certain French politicians and neo-Nazis might share the same argument, this recurrence means that as weak as their argument is, its repetition thickens the genocide discourse by placing one layer of controlled information on top of another.
The uniqueness of Holocaust denial is seen as fundamental when forced into comparison with the Armenian-related rhetoric about denial. The Holocaust is a name of an event, but genocide is a legal characterization. To say that the Holocaust did not happen as told is not the same as saying that what happened to Armenians was not genocide. As the Gayssot Act in France clarifies beyond any doubt, the denial that crimes against humanity were committed by Nazi leaders is itself a crime. It is illegal to deny the Holocaust, not simply because it offends Jews but because it defies the legal competence of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg that convicted the Nazi leaders. No competent tribunal has ever ruled that the crime of genocide was committed against Armenians. Therefore, saying that Ottoman Armenians were not victims of genocide is not the same as saying that they did not suffer, nor is it the same as repudiating the decision of a competent tribunal.
JUDICIAL MASK DANCES WITH LIES
Even though this distinction is elementary, bills that carry bogus references to genocide keep getting drafted and, along with them, the Holocaust keeps getting dragged into conversations that question its legal protection. In Switzerland, a debate similar in essence to the one in France played out when the Swiss judicial system convicted Doğu Perinçek of rejecting the use of genocide in describing the Armenian deaths during World War I. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) overturned the Swiss decision in Perinçek v. Switzerland. There had been a Swiss failure to recognize that popular notions of genocide denial cannot be related to Holocaust denial. It was shown that it is within one's freedom of speech to express disagreement with an opinion about genocide, despite the opinion's popularity in the Armenian case. Much like France's Constitutional Council, the ECtHR's Grand Chamber distinguished between the case and Holocaust denial, but not before the circus had come to Strasbourg and attracted attention through celebrity appeal. Thus, the public was opened up for more information that combines the idea of genocide with a Turkish offense against Armenians, regardless of who won that legal debate.
While the separation of powers seems to be on the Turkish side of the debate on genocide, every highly publicized debate is on the Armenian side. There is no such thing as bad publicity in the soft-power commitment to make Turkish culpability seem like a matter of fact. The genocide discourse that relies on prejudice against Turks continues to build even when an Armenian delegation loses its case in court. Even when it is clearly stated that there is no legal reason to accuse Turks of genocide, what the public remembers is that Armenians were genocide victims and Turks are genocide deniers.
As long as people around the world are taught in schools and universities to think about this period of Ottoman history in terms of genocide, and as long as it is embedded in the language used by the popular sources of information, every court decision against the Armenian claim of genocide would appear to them as if the historical truth is being negated by legal technicalities and Turkish political pressure.
How does this cycle of winning in the court of law and losing in the court of public opinion come to an end?
U,S, Secretary of State John Kerry's latest statement about genocide illustrates how the soft-power effect is achieved even without sufficient evidence or a single visit to a court of law. Kerry carefully prefaced that the following is said in their judgment - meaning, not a court's judgment - before asserting that "DAESH is responsible for genocide." In this manner, they abided by the separation of powers and did not assume judicial authority, but significantly, their words do echo, and world public opinion is being informed and formed by this discourse that associates DAESH with the crime of genocide in accordance with American interests.
There is no way of winning in the court of public opinion when an accusation of genocide is repeatedly uttered against you by a great power. Advocacy for merely the right to reject a characterization of genocide is a recipe for perpetuating what is seen as genocide denial.
The way to refute this discourse and be liberated from its burden has to be paved with evidence and has to be led by historians toward an internationally recognized legal articulation against the misuse of the term genocide. With confidence, and in the spirit of Article 9 of the CPPCG, the dispute can be settled once and for all. It might even inspire an amendment to the CPPCG that would criminalize the systematic soft-power labeling of genocide against an entire people or government when charges against specific groups had not been tried by a competent tribunal.

There are now many Catholic commentators who are questioning the Church's blindness about the danger Europe is facing.
"Islam has every chance massively to strengthen its presence in Europe with the blessing of the Church.... the Church is not only leading Europe to an impasse, it is also shooting itself in the foot." — Laurent Dandrieu, cultural editor of the French magazine Valeurs Actuelles.
"It is clear that Muslims have an ultimate goal: conquering the world...Islam, through the sharia, their law...allows violence against the infidels, such as Christians....And what is the most important achievement? Rome." — Cardinal Raymond Burke, interview, Il Giornale.
— Cardinal Raymond Burke, interview, Il Giornale. "[T]hey are not refugees, this is an invasion, they come here with cries of 'Allahu Akbar', they want to take over." — Laszlo Kiss Rigo, head of the Catholic Hungarian southern community.
François Fillon published a book entitled, Vanquishing Islamic Totalitarianism, and they rose in the polls by vowing to control Islam and immigration: "We've got to reduce immigration to its strict minimum," Fillon said. "Our country is not a sum of communities, it is an identity!"
Everyone in Italy and the rest of Europe will "soon be Muslim" because of our "stupidity", warned Monsignor Carlo Liberati, Archbishop Emeritus of Pompei. Liberati claimed that, thanks to the huge number of Muslim migrants alongside the increasing secularism of native Europeans, Islam will soon become the main religion of Europe. "All of this moral and religious decadence favours Islam", Archbishop Liberati explained.
Décadence is also the title of a new book by the French philosopher Michel Onfray, in which they suggest that the Judeo-Christian era may have come to an end. They compare the West and Islam: "We have nihilism, they have fervor; we are exhausted, they have a great health; we have the past for us; they have the future for them".
Archbishop Liberati belongs to a growing branch of Catholic leaders who refuse to see the future belonging to Islam in Europe. They speak in open opposition to Pope Francis, who does not seem too impressed by the collapse of Christianity due to falling birth rates, accompanied by religious apathy and its replacement by Islam.
Monsignor Carlo Liberati, Archbishop Emeritus of Pompei (left) belongs to a growing branch of Catholic leaders who refuse to see the future belonging to Islam in Europe, and who speak in open opposition to Pope Francis (right).
Pope Francis's official vision is personified by Bishop Nunzio Galantino, who was appointed by the Pontiff as the Secretary General of Italy's Bishops. Last December, Galantino gave an interview in which they dismissed any religious motivation behind jihadist attacks and claimed that, instead, "money" is what is behind them.
There are now many Catholic commentators who are questioning the Church's blindness about the danger Europe is facing. One is the cultural editor of the French magazine Valeurs Actuelles, Laurent Dandrieu, who writes:
"Islam has every chance massively to strengthen its presence in Europe with the blessing of the Church. The Church is watching the establishment of millions of Muslims in Europe... and Muslim worship in our continent as an inescapable manifestation of religious freedom. But the civilizational question is simply never asked .... By breaking away from the Europe's indigenous peoples and their legitimate concerns, the Church is not only leading Europe to an impasse, it is also shooting itself in the foot".
Dandrieu lists Pope Francis' gestures and speeches in favor of Islam and migrants:
"On October 1, 2014, the Pope received Eritrean survivors of a shipwreck off Lampedusa; on 8 February 2015, they made a surprise visit to a refugee camp in Ponte Mammolo, northeast of Rome; on April 18, they used the first official visit of the new Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, to demand 'a much larger commitment' for migrants; on 6 September 2015, at the conclusion of the Angelus in St Peter's Square, they called for 'every parish, religious community, monastery and sanctuary in Europe to host a family' of refugees; on March 24, 2016, they chose to celebrate the Holy Thursday in a structure housing 900 refugees, and to wash the feet to twelve asylum seekers; on May 28, they received children whose parents died in a boat that sank, filled with migrants; during the general audience of June 22, Francis went down to the crowd to bring back fifteen refugees".
But as Liberati's case demonstrates, resistance to Pope Francis' vision of Europe is growing inside the Catholic Church.
"It is clear that Muslims have an ultimate goal: conquering the world", Cardinal Raymond Burke said.
"Islam, through the sharia, their law, wants to rule the world and allows violence against the infidels, like Christians. But we find it hard to recognize this reality and to respond by defending the Christian faith (...) I have heard several times an Islamic idea: 'what we failed to do with the weapons in the past we are doing today with the birth rate and immigration'. The population is changing. If this keeps up, in countries such as Italy, the majority will be Muslim (...) Islam realizes itself in the conquest. And what is the most important achievement? Rome".
The first to denounce this dramatic trend was Italy's most important missionary, Father Piero Gheddo, who said that, due to falling fertility and Muslim fervor, "Islam would sooner rather than later conquer the majority in Europe". These concerns do not belong only to the Conservative wing of the Catholic Church.
Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, Archbishop of Vienna and a candidate tipped to be the next Pope, is very close to Pope Francis, and is a centrist. Last September, on the anniversary of the Siege of Vienna, when Turkey's Ottoman troops nearly conquered Europe, Schönborn delivered a dramatic appeal to save Europe's Christian roots. "Many Muslims want and say that 'Europe is finished'", Cardinal Schönborn said, before accusing Europe of "forgetting its Christian identity". They then denounced the possibility of "an Islamic conquest of Europe".
After a Tunisian, who arrived among a flood of migrants into Germany, murdered 12 people at a Christmas market in Berlin, the Catholic archbishop of the German capital, Heiner Koch, another "moderate" Catholic leader appointed by Pope Francis, also sounded a warning: "Perhaps we focused too much on the radiant image of humanity, on the good. Now in the last year, or perhaps also in recent years, we have seen: No, there is also evil".
The head of the Czech Roman Catholic Church, Miloslav Vlk, also warned about the threat of Islamization. "Muslims in Europe have many more children than Christian families; that is why demographers have been trying to come up with a time when Europe will become Muslim", Cardinal Vlk claimed. They also blamed Europe itself for the Islamic takeover:
"Europe will pay dearly for having left its spiritual foundations; this is the last period that will not continue for decades when it may still have a chance to do something about it. Unless the Christians wake up, life may be Islamised and Christianity will not have the strength to imprint its character on the life of people, not to say society".
Cardinal Dominik Duka, Archbishop of Prague and Primate of Bohemia, has also questioned Pope Francis' "welcoming culture".
Among the Eastern Catholic bishops there are many voices raising concerns about Europe's demographic and religious revolution. One belongs to the leader of the Catholics in Lebanon, who paid an extremely high price for the Islamization of their own country, including murder and exile, and now see the danger coming to Europe itself. "I have heard many times from Muslims that their goal is to conquer Europe with two weapons: faith and the birth rate", Cardinal Bechara Rai said.
Another voice belongs to the French-born Bishop Paul Desfarges, who heads the diocese of Constantine in Algeria: "It's no surprise that Islam has taken on such importance", Desfarges said. "It's an issue that concerns Europe". Sydney Cardinal George Pell then urged "a discussion of the consequences of the Islamic presence in the Western world". Pell was echoed by Laszlo Kiss Rigo, the head of the Catholic Hungarian southern community, who said that "they are not refugees, this is an invasion, they come here with cries of 'Allahu Akbar', they want to take over".
On the political level, there is another a tendency, that of strong Catholic leaders who challenge Pope Francis on the Islamic question and immigration. The most important is the French presidential candidate François Fillon, one of the first politicians who "doesn't hide the fact that he's Catholic". Fillon published a book entitled, Vanquishing Islamic Totalitarianism, and they rose in the polls by vowing to control Islam and immigration: "We've got to reduce immigration to its strict minimum," Fillon said. "Our country is not a sum of communities, it is an identity!"
These politicians, bishops and cardinals might convince Pope Francis not to abandon Europe, the cradle of Christianity and Western civilization, to a looming dark fate. Michel Onfray wrote at the end of their book: "Judeo-Christianity ruled for two millennia. An honorable period for a civilization. The boat now sinks: we can only sink with elegance". It is urgent now to prevent that.
Anyone who thinks it is a fantasy that government will simply just confiscate 10% of everyone's accounts in Europe better have another look at the fool they see in the mirror staring back at them. This IMF solution is traditionally French and is really coming because the people in charge are effectively Marxists and this idea came from the IMF under the control of French ideology. They will expropriate these funds to save a banking system that they screwed up and will never reform anything because they are incapable of admitting any mistake.
These European government officials really are playing a dangerous game that is inviting total chaos, civil unrest, and may set themselves up for invasion. Instead of Napoleon invading Russia (1812.479), it may be the other way around when they smell weakness.
Let me make this very clear. I have many French friends and they know the people in charge are just Marxists. Adam Smith wrote Wealth of Nations because they visited France to investigate Physiocracy that argued agriculture was the only real wealth. Karl Marx did not come up with Communism himself. They were more of a socialist. They did not advocate confiscating all property. It was the French movement of a commune at the time that convinced them their way was better. It was Engels who steered Marx into Communism. These ideas have emerged from France and this is why we have some of the most insane ideas still emerging from this country. There is a core philosophy among some that this socialism is correct.
The IMF proposal to expropriate everyone's accounts in Europe will happen. The consequences could be absolutely the collapse in confidence that will be off the charts. Why should people trust government ever again or any bank for that matter?
My advise to Europe – move as much as you can buying US stocks for now and even take delivery of the share certificates to prevent them from finding accounts in New York and demand they too be handed over. Hollande will come up with that one you can bet. They will weaken Europe and destroy the future of generations yet to come.
Please welcome to our little team of analysists and helpers Chris Gluck, whose PWP is going to be added to the metrics table this year—a solid instrument in telling us how teams have performed in turning possession into goals. Currently it's one of the best open-source metrics out there to tell us such things. I hope you'll enjoy their contributions as much I will – Harrison
First things first — my thanks to Harrison Crow and Matthias Kullowatz for the opportunity to post my Possession with Purpose Introduction on American Soccer Analysis.
If you've been following me this past year through Columbian Newspaper–out of southern Washington–you'll know that I've been researching statistics in Major League Soccer. My intent has been to develop a simplified (Strategic) set of team performance indicators that may help others better understand soccer and how the outcome of a game may be better understood based on the primary inputs to the game.
Data for my research comes from documenting and analyzing all 646 MLS Regular Season games in 2013; the source data originates with OPTA and is displayed on the MLS Chalkboard and the MLS Statistics Sheet found through www.mlssoccer.com.
With that here's my introduction on Possession with Purpose…
To first understand the context, I offer that this is one of the End States of my effort: create a simplified approach and documented method for measuring team performance where the output is an Index that (while excluding points) comes close to matching results in the MLS League Table.
Beginning with that End State in mind here is the End State product:
Observations from the Diagram…
Note that 9 of the top 10 teams in this Index made the MLS Playoffs last year with the Houston Dynamo finishing 12th in the Index.
For comparison, in benchmarking whoscored.com their Index only had 8 of their top 10 teams make the Playoffs, while http://www.squawka .com matched my 90% success rating, but the team they missed in the top 10 (New England) finished 16th in their Index.
From a strategic standpoint, the End State objective has been met; create a simplified approach and documented method for measuring team performance where the output is an Index that (while excluding points) comes close to matching results in the MLS League Table.
Defining the PWP Attacking and Defending Processes…
Here are the six steps in the PWP Strategic Attacking Process:
Gain possession of the ball, Retain possession and move the ball, Penetrate & create goal scoring opportunities, Take shots when provided goal scoring opportunities, Put those shots taken on goal, Score the goal.
Here are the six steps in the PWP Strategic Defending Process:
Minimize opponent gaining possession of the ball, Minimize opponent retaining possession and moving the ball, Minimize opponent penetrating and creating goal scoring opportunities, Minimize opponent taking shots when provided goal scoring opportunities, Minimize opponent putting those shots on goal, Minimize opponent scoring the goal.
Every step is this process has an average success rate (percentage) based upon data gathered from all 646 MLS Regular Season games.
Understanding the context of these steps versus other conditions and activities that influence the outcome of a game…
In case you missed it I call these Processes and the Indices “Strategic” to separate their value/meaning relative to other things that can influence the outcome of a game.
For me I have two other ways to classify information that can influence the outcomes in those steps. I have Operational conditions and Tactical metrics; provided below are some examples of each:
Operational conditions : Scheme of maneuver a team uses in setting up their system, such as flat-back four, flat-back three, double-pivot midfield, single-pivot midfield, bunkering with counterattacking, pressing high, direct attacking, possession-oriented attacking, weather conditions, location of the game (home/away), conference foe, non-conference foe, etc…
Tactical metrics : Locations of shots taken, shots on goal, and goals scored; penalty kicks, free kicks, crosses, headers won/lost, tackles won/lost, interceptions, clearances, blocked crosses, blocked shots, etc.
The diagram below shows the PWP Strategic Attacking Process with the average percentage of success rate in MLS for 2013. A more detailed explanation of each step is provided below the diagram.
Step 1: Gain possession of the ball: The intent behind this basic step should be clear; you can't win the game if you don't possess the ball to some extent. A second consideration about this step is that the more you possess the ball the less your opponent possesses the ball.
From a defensive standpoint there are any number of ways a team can work to gain possession of the ball; they include, but are not limited to, tackling, intercepting, clearing the ball, winning fifty-fifty duels on the ground or in the air, or simply gathering a loose ball based upon a deflection or bad pass.
For this Process the measurement of success is the percentage of possession a team has in a given game; note that in Soccer, the primary method for measuring possession is to add up the number of passes made in a game and divide into that the amount of passes one team makes (create a ratio percentage of possession); the opposing team has the difference between 100% and the percentage of possession that the other team has.
It's not perfect but it provides a simplified ratio to compare one team versus another…
Step 2: Retain possession and move the ball: It shouldn't be a secret to many that in most cases the team possessing the ball will need to move the ball in order to penetrate the opponents Defending Third and score a goal.
This is not to say a team has a minimum number of passes they need to complete to score a goal; for teams winning possession deep in the opponents Defending Third there may be times where the only thing needed is a quick shot on goal.
By and large, however, most teams – when they gain possession of the ball – do so in their own Defending Third and then move the ball (eventually forward) in a position where a teammate can create a goal scoring opportunity for another team member to take a shot.
For this process, the measurement of success is the team's passing accuracy percentage across the entire pitch; passes completed divided into passes attempted.
It's not perfect, but it provides a simplified ratio to compare one team versus another; statistically speaking there are weaknesses in how this percentage is measured by the big data folks. Throw-ins, for example, move the ball across the pitch from one player to another yet they are not officially counted as passes. Successful crosses are also not counted as a successful pass even though the ball moves successfully from one player to another. Oddly enough, when evaluating the data provided on the MLS chalkboard, an Unsuccessful cross is included as a Pass attempted (?!) For the purposes of this analysis I had to count all successful crosses as successful passes; therefore my final pass completions totals will be slightly higher than what Opta provides. It is what it is…
I should also point out here that there are occasions when a team wins possession of the ball and takes a shot where no pass was completed. Like I said, this measurement method is not perfect but it is ‘equal' in ignoring that exception for all teams.
Therefore the measurement itself has value in tracking the majority (bell curve) of activities that normally occur in a game of soccer. And as a reminder, these are Strategic steps in PWP; by definition a Strategic step will not measure to a level of granularity; that is where Tactical metrics come into play based upon an Operational condition where the team is applying pressure higher up the pitch.
Step 3: Penetrate and create goal scoring opportunities: Most know that a pitch is divided into three parts; the Defending Third, Middle Third, and Attacking Third. For the purposes of this effort, Penetration is associated with entering the opponent's Defending Third with the intent to score.
For this Process, penetration is measured by dividing the volume of passes a team completes within the opponent's Defending Third into the volume of passes a team completes across the entire pitch.
It's not perfect but it creates a ratio that treats all teams fairly, and given the overall accuracy of the End State Index (90%), it's a reasonable way to measure this step.
In order to measure this step I first had to manually filter, for all 646 games, every pass attempted and completed using the MLS Chalkboard; my thanks to MLS and OPTA for providing us ‘stats' guys the opportunity to do that. With Golazo stats now available, that task will be easier next year. As a stats guy, it would have been inappropriate to switch measurement methods ¾'s of the way through the year.
Step 4: Take shots when provided goal scoring opportunities: This is, by far, the hardest indicator to measure, given how current data sites really lack granularity in how they identify/define ‘created goal scoring opportunities.'
I define a ‘created goal scoring opportunity' as any pass, successful or not, that may have ended with another teammate taking a shot. That's hard to quantify, but an example, if you will: A fullback overlapping down the right side puts in a wicked cross that gets cleared at the last minute by a center-back, with their head. With OPTA and other data companies that wicked cross, though unsuccessful, is not quantified as a goal scoring opportunity created; it's merely tracked as a clearance and an unsuccessful pass. I disagree; the fullback did their job in putting in that wicked cross – what really happened is the defender also did their job in clearing it – therefore a “potential” for the attacking team to complete a created goal scoring opportuinty and take a shot was denied. Both the attacking team and defending team should be statistically credited for doing what they are expected to do. Others may disagree… But as a Head Coach, I would put to memory that the fullback did what was supposed to happen; create the chance – therefore in my books that player created a goal scoring opportunity.
For this Process, the step is measured by counting the number of Shots Taken compared to the number of completed passes in the opponent's Defending Third.
It's not perfect, but it's measured in an unbiased manner for every team, and there will be instances where a shot can be taken without a completed pass or originate from a defensive error.
In going back to the example, as a Head Coach I would call that effort a “failed assist.” I think there is value in knowing the number of “failed assists” as much as there is in knowing “assists.”
By tracking “failed assists” it provides a pure, statistical way, to track individual player performance (tactical metric) that can influence team performance.
Bottom line on this one, as contentious as it may be for some, recall the End State of this Final Index… create a simplified approach and documented method for measuring team performance where the output is an Index that (while excluding points) comes close to matching results in the MLS League Table .
Given the accuracy rating of 90% in matching the top 10 Playoff teams this year I feel and think the approach to measure this indicator works.
If OPTA, or another data compilation agency starts to track “failed assists”, could an Index like this reach 100% accuracy?
Step 5: Put those Shots Taken on Goal: For the most part this is an individual statistic that is added up to create a team performance indicator.
For this process, the step is measured by dividing the number of Shots on Goal by the number of Shots Taken.
It's one of the easier indicators to measure, and if you watch any level of soccer, it's pretty self explanatory – if the Shot can come anywhere within the dimensions of the Goal, it is considered a Shot on Goal. One of two things happens; it goes in or it doesn't.
Step 6: Score the Goal: One critical objective of the game.
I say ‘one' because indications, I see, lead me to offer that this game is not all about scoring goals.
In my research it appears to me that teams who defend better seem to take more points in games than teams that don't defend very well.
A recent example in my End of Season analysis of Vancouver: in Western Conference competition, they scored 35 goals and gave up 35 goals; all told they took just 26 of 72 possible points – clearly, in this example, scoring goals did not result in wins…
article: “Using data from the last ten seasons of the Premier League, Anderson and Sally compared the value of a goal scored and the value of a goal conceded. They found that scoring a goal, on average, is worth slightly more than one point, whereas not conceding produces, on average, 2.5 points per match. Goals that don't happen are more valuable than goals that do happen.” Prozone, a noted professional sporting analysis company, offers the following in the“Using data from the last ten seasons of the Premier League, Anderson and Sally compared the value of a goal scored and the value of a goal conceded. They found that scoring a goal, on average, is worth slightly more than one point, whereas not conceding produces, on average, 2.5 points per match. Goals that don't happen are more valuable than goals that do happen.”
In closing…
It's not perfect, but it provides reasonable information in a reasonable format that has reasonable value when comparing the End State output to how the MLS League Table finished.
For those interested the PWP Strategic Attacking Index and Defending Index are provided below:
In looking at these two Indices, note the number on the left; the difference between the Index number in the Attacking Index and the Defending Index is the number that appears to the left in the Final Strategic Index at the beginning of this article.
That may help explain why some teams finished above zero, as opposed to below zero in the Final Index.
Teams finishing above zero had team attacking percentages that exceeded their team defending percentages; in other words they were better in their attack against the opponents than the opponent's were in attacking them.
Team success rates in these six steps will be used next year to begin to analyze how well the team is performing as the new season starts compared to performance the previous year.

The highly-successful Bachar Houli program will be extended to include women and girls, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced today.
The new female element – which will be implemented by Richmond Football Club staff – was part of the increased funding of the program announced at the Swinburne Centre at Punt Road Oval.
The Bachar Houli Academy is a high-performance football talent program, while the Bachar Houli Cup engages over 5000 Islamic school students - providing a starting point for players from a Muslim background to transition into football pathways.
The funding will be used to grow the existing programs and to also include a female component to the Bachar Houli Academy and Schools Cup.
Bachar Houli said it was a privilege to be part of the program.
“I would like to thank the Federal Government for their continued support of the programs, providing real opportunities for the next generation of boys and girls playing and administering our great game,” Houli said.
“Being a part of the program is a great opportunity for young Australian Muslim boys and girls, providing them with a safe environment to grow culturally and to develop their leadership capacity using football as the vehicle.
“I want talented youth across the country to be given the best possible avenue, support and pathway into the elite system and while the Academy aims to recruit talented athletes, it's not all about football - we want them to grow as people and receive life education, building confidence, awareness and knowledge to succeed.”
Richmond CEO Brendon Gale said the club was extremely proud of the continued work of Bachar and their programs in creating both football development and employment opportunities for young Muslim men and women.
“Through their work in these programs Bachar has given Islamic children across the country the opportunity to pursue AFL and to learn important positive, leadership skills. To have this expand every year and to now include a female component, where young Muslim girls will have these opportunities, is a fantastic result,” Gale said.
Over 30 schools nationally participated in the Bachar Houli Cup. The Bachar Houli Employment program has employed ten trainees of a Muslim background across the AFL industry nationwide, including our very own Rana Hussain who works in fan engagement and marketing at Richmond.
Over the past year, the Bachar Houli programs has delivered:
• 10,000 participants across 30 schools nationally
• 25 participants selected in the Bachar Houli Acadmey with over 1000 boys participating in state trials
• A total of 150 participants have been part of the Academy since its inaugural year in 2012
• Seven participants selected on a leadership camp to the Qatar Aspire Academy
• 1000 attendees across five state-based Ramadan dinners
• 10 young men and women representing 15 cultural groups employed on 12-month traineeships across a diverse set of roles in the industry
The Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition developer's blog was updated once again tonight with Version 2012 changes for another set of characters. We'll have translations available right here as they become available.
Thanks to Trike, Abelity, ABM|Cande, SUPARNOVAX, RedVega, ABM|KYOKUGEN, LostonPenalties, CRUD and KIRBYSIM for the translation work. Some of this is unclear, but we will replace those translations with better ones as they arrive.
Dan
• Dan got a ton of changes.
• Pushback from their close standing Standing Hard Kick has been shortened.
• Close Medium Punch now starts up in 5 frames. This was 6 in Arcade Edition.
• Crouching Hard Kick now starts up in 10 frames. This was 11 in Arcade Edition.
• The combo cl.HK, cl.MP, cr.MP xx EX Dankukyaku is now possible.
• Reduced the height limit on Air EX Dankukyaku (Dan Kicks), a.k.a., how high you needed to be before you could do it.
• Hard Kick Dankukyaku now deals 130 damage instead of 120.
• Dan's Jumping and Crouching Taunt build meter now. 70 on hit, 30 on block.
• Dan's Super Hissho Buraiken has been altered so that it's harder for characters to have hits whiff against them. However, the blog notes this buff won't work if you activate from too far away.
Rufus
• MK Messiah Kick on hit can be followed up by LK continuation.
• Since you couldn't use it as an AA in original AE, Big Bang Typhoon as an AA will hit a maximum of 10 times, for 236 damage.
Gen
•(KKK stance) crouching HP's damage on counter-hit has been corrected to 1.25x the regular amount. (TL note: previously it wasn't? What was it in AE?)
•(KKK stance) crouching HK now has 5 active frames (up from 3).
•If the last hit of medium/heavy Gekirou (dragon kick) came out, Gen gets a bonus +10 to super meter.
•The final hit of heavy Gekirou will put your opponent in untechable knockdown state. So use it as an opportunity to okizeme/apply pressure on wake-up.
•EX Snake Strikes' properties will now differ depending on which buttons you activate it with (light+medium, light+heavy, or medium+heavy). The distance Gen travels during this move, and the number of hits vary.
Also, from 1st frame all the way till the end of active frames, EX Snake Strikes are now projectile-invincible.
•All versions of Snake Strikes will have 4 extra hit/blockstun as long as you don't end with the final strike.
So if you FADC Snake Strike before the final hit it's +6 on hit, +2 on block.
•(PPP/Mantis style) U2's start-up is now 7-frame on start-up, down from 9 frames.
Sakura
•Only thing the developers have changed here was EX Hurricane Kick.
Many Sakura players were unhappy that when you do
Crouching LK -> crouching LP -> crouching HP -> EX Hurricane,
on certain characters the last hit would not connect. They've rectified this so it now works on all characters.
Fei Long
•Rekka block stun adjusted, after second blocked rekka, most people delay the third one for counter hits. You can now punish delayed third rekka hits accordingly. After blocked 2nd hit of Rekka, Light version 8f, Medium version 10f, Heavy version 12f
•(loose translation of this) Flame kick: Light 120 down to 110, Medium 140 down to 120, Heavy 160 down to 150, EX 200 down to 190. Flame kick FADC on block is 1f less on advantage, making it.. ????
•F+MK buffed up from 60 to 70
•MK Chickenwing nerfed from 30+30+50 (110 total) down to 35+35+30 (100 total)
Abel
•Cr.HP is back to how it was in Super.
•TT Damage up +10: LP 160 MP 180 HP 200
•Breathless : from startup till active, hit invulnerable. (LOL. People will start trolling with U2, again.)
•Second Low Hit Stun improved,
So when you do 2nd Low FADC, you'll be at +9 at most.
Meaning that, you can do 2nd Low FADC Cr.HP U1.
Cammy
They want to keep the status quo for Cammy. So the only change here was:
•Heavy Spiral Arrow's hit properties are back to how they were in SSF4 console (TL note: in AE when you combo into heavy Spiral Arrow, sometimes Cammy will go under your opponent and switch… which is especially bad when you've successfully pushed them into the corner).
There are more concrete details to this but I'll touch up on that later. Too technical for me to understand.
Akuma
•Demon-flip punch no longer an overhead (TL note: this was one of the few buffs in AE I think), so you can now block low for that.
•Forward throw now has 2 more recovery frames.
•As for buffs, when you cancel a teleport into U2, the damage has been increased to 421.
Rose
•Soul Spark meter gain returned to 20->30
•Soul Satellite's startup frames from 7 to 5
•Soul Piede changed to Vanilla properties
•Close standing MK +4 on hit, making it easier to combo into crouching jab, as well as making it possible to combo into cr.mp.
•Fixed some bug with crouching mk counterhits.
T.Hawk
Minor changes that have to do with their match-ups.
•The first hit of crouching HK on block has more blockstun, by 2 frames. Opponents who try to jump away after blocking the first hit will now be caught with the second hit due to this adjustment.
Also, T.Hawk's head-area hurtbox is projectile-invincible during this animation. So for instance, Sagat's high Tiger Shots will no longer hit Hawk out of their crouching HK.
•(Diagonal jump) down+HP can now be performed with neutral jumps.
•Down-forward+LP on hit is now -2 frame disadvantage. Down from -5 in AE.
•Medium Tomahawk Buster is throw-invincible from start-up to the frame T.Hawk leaves the ground.
•Condor Spire's shortcut motion has been revised, so it should be easier to activate with that now.
Gouken
One of the most altered characters, the devs say. The main changes are to their Denjin and Senku Goshoha. Their Denjin can be sped up to twice its normal speed and powered up by over half damage by doing a 3S SA3 Ryu (spinning the stick like a loon from Ultra start-up until you let go of the attack buttons). There are three speed-ups and five damage levels, with the charge times as follows:
Level 1 – 13 frames
Level 2 – 17 frames
Level 3 – 37 frames
Level 4 – 57 frames
Level 5 – 80 frames
Each fully-charged Denjin now does 45 more damage, while charge times are now the same regardless of the amount of your ultra gauge.
As for the Senku Goshoha, LP hits further in front, MP is the same as their Super LP version and HP is the same as their Super MP version. Also, Kongoshin has a slighty larger hitbox and deals 200 stun, while cr.HP deals more hitstun and so locks the opponent in place for longer, allowing cl.MP, cr.HP, EX Senku Goshoha to hit everyone.
Seth
Only small changes here, apparently. Tanden Stream only does 340 damage now, but cr.HP, Tanden Stream does full damage. Furthermore, if the first hit connects, Seth becomes invincible for the entire animation.
Otherwise, their jumping FP now has 4 active frames and nj.MK has lower body fireball invincibility after the active frames finish. Also, the issue of cr.LP, cr.MP not hitting some characters after a successful j.HK has been partially remedied (they say ‘loosened' or ‘eased', rather than ‘fixed', so it's probably still there to some extent).
El Fuerte
They aimed to make them more fun to play without heavily affecting their overall balance. Tortilla has reverted to its Vanilla form, i.e., invincible straight after start-up), EX Quesadilla Bomb now only takes 210 frames of charge and wall-bounces, and both level 3 regular and EX Quesadilla Bombs only freeze Fuerte for 10 frames on hit.
Elsewhere, cr.LP can be chained cancelled into other jab or short moves, while st.FP, Habanero Dash, Sliding now works on everyone.

Nobody can touch the peach butt emoji, not even Apple. A couple of weeks ago, Apple dropped the first iOS beta for iOS 10.2 with dozens of new and redesigned emojis. The world needs more emojis, I'm all for it. But Apple also accidentally redesigned the peach emoji and was a bit too literal — it didn't quite look like a butt. Calm down, no need to grab the pitchforks. Apple released a new beta with a butt-looking peach emoji.
As you can see on the top image, the new peach emoji looks even more like a butt. Apple didn't just roll back to the old emoji design. The company called its emoji designers again and asked them to redraw the peach emoji.
Emojis accidentally became a universal visual language withs its own set of rules. People now use emojis all the time to add emotions and personality to their messages. And sometimes, a peach can become so much more than a simple peach. TechCrunch's Devin Coldewey wrote an ode to the peach emoji that sums up pretty well why it's important to keep the peach butt.
Apple released iOS 10.2 beta 3 yesterday and it's still only available for developers and public beta testers. You can expect the final version of iOS 10.2 in the coming weeks with a wide range of new emojis.
My favorite ones are the new professions. There are male and female emojis for a teacher, astronaut, welder, coder, business worker, farmer, scientist, chef, student, mechanic, doctor/health worker…
But the Unicode consortium is also iterating to keep up with new gesture emojis. There will be a finger-crossed emoji, a shrug emoji and a facepalm emoji. Your friends will also need to update their iPhones before you can send each other astronaut emojis.
Supporters for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Sen. Harry Reid attacked Donald Trump after the Republican presidential nominee told their supporters about the “correct” way to pronounce Nevada.
Trump, during a rally Wednesday in Reno, insisted the correct way to pronounce the name of the Silver State was “Neh-VAH-da.” They declared that “nobody says it the other way.”
Clinton supporters and Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, both used the moment to assail Trump.
American Bridge immediately put up a video declaring that Trump was “looking like an idiot” for getting the name wrong.
A statement from Reid declared that Trump's stop in Reno was “disastrous.”
"If Donald Trump wants to come down from the penthouse their daddy bought them to lecture us on how to say Nevada, they could at least pronounce it correctly,” Reid said in a statement. "Instead, Trump told us we pronounce the name of our state wrong minutes before they refused to take a position on Yucca Mountain.
“I have news for Donald: it's pronounced Nev-AD-a and Yucca Mountain is dead.”
Trump made a stop at the International Church of Las Vegas and the International Christian Academy before their rally in Reno. They said the Pledge of Allegiance with schoolchildren at the school.
They also visited with Hispanic business leaders at a Mexican restaurant before departing for northern Nevada.

The BMW M235i Racing, a race-spec version of the new M235i, has been officially launched.
BMW's new Racing edition is now on sale to private racing teams for €59,500. The model, which is based on the production-spec M235i, was revealed in full at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
The M235i Racing uses the same twin-scroll turbocharged 3.0-litre in-line six-cylinder petrol engine as the production car, but power has been increased slightly from 322bhp to 328bhp.
As with the production car, the Racing edition comes with ABS, DSC and traction control, but also includes a mechanical limited-slip differential.
Other additions include new front and rear spoilers, as well as a new diffuser and carbon wing mirrors. An FIA-certified racing safety cell is also included, as is as a racing-spec fuel tank.
BMW says it expects the car to be used in entry-level racing series, including the VLN Endurance Championship and the Nürburging 24 Hours, as well as its own BMW Sports Trophy.
The firm's motorsport boss Jens Marquardt said: “The production models from the BMW M Performance Automobiles range are already incredibly sporty. Because of this, we did not have to make many modifications in order to get the BMW M235i Coupé up and running as a racing car.
"BMW Motorsport can look back on a long tradition of allowing ambitious teams and drivers an affordable way into motor racing – and of offering them an absolutely competitive car."
The film below was released by BMW Motorsport, and shows the car testing on track prior to its final reveal.
Growing up as a goalkeeper provided me a distinct perspective on the game, one that has made its way into my coaching sessions. My favorite phrase – almost exclusively directed toward my team's goalkeepers – is, "The best save you will ever make is the save that you didn't have to make."
In other words, situations in which you correctly align and organize the defense to stop a developing attack are considerably more useful to your team than having to stop a shot yourself. If your goalkeeper can organize your defense so well that they don't need to stop shots, they become much more valuable than the goalkeeper who can only stop shots. Stop the threat before it's a threat.
In practice, during a shooting drill, this difference is obfuscated. One is inclined to look at the aerobatic and athletic keeper and think, "Wow, he's a great goalkeeper."
We're all guilty of it – including me. On the score sheet, it is similarly hidden. A zero-shot, zero-save performance is sure to precede a, "Wow, they didn't have to do much," statement. And sometimes this is true. But not all of the time.
Team Tackles per game Seattle Sounders FC 16.4167 Montreal Impact 16.25 Colorado Rapids 16.0833 New York Red Bulls 15.8462 Toronto FC 15.6667 Real Salt Lake 15.2308 Houston Dynamo 14.7 Columbus Crew 14.6364 San Jose Earthquakes 14.3077 Vancouver Whitecaps 14.2727 Philadelphia Union 13.9 FC Dallas 12.8571 New England Revolution 12.8182 Chivas USA 12.6667 Chicago Fire 12.4545 Sporting Kansas City 12.1818 LA Galaxy 12 D.C. United 11.6429 Portland Timbers 11.6364
I'm not saying that goalkeepers shouldn't worry about saving shots – obviously they should – but the boxscore bias undoubtedly exists. The difference that the intelligent and articulate (i.e., loud as hell) goalkeepers are making on their team is hard to quantify, though there is clear evidence that age and experience help greatly in this regard.
Defenders can (and should) adopt the same mentality. Tackles, an event tracked by Opta and available on the MLS chalkboards, are very similar to goalkeeper saves. Sure, a save is always in your team's immediate best interest, but it also requires you to be under some kind of pressure. Tackles are exactly the same – they're usually made because the potential threat was allowed to become an actual threat.
In the comparison that I am drawing between saves and tackles, the player with the most tackles per game is akin to the super athletic and aerobatic goalkeeper with a sieve of a defense in front of him. This doesn't mean that this player is the best tackler (nor does it mean that the goalkeeper with the most saves is the worst organizer – sometimes, after all, there's nothing you can do to straighten out subpar defenders), it just means that they were forced to tackle at a very high rate given the game situations they have been placed in by their team.
Since tackles are an indication of a micro-event resulting in your favor, in the context of a macro-situation not in your favor (e.g. you usually only make tackles when your team is under pressure), it's understandable that tackles per game is a very poor indicator of performance. At right are MLS' 19 sides ranked by tackles per game.
With Seattle and Montreal successfully completing the most tackles per game, while D.C. United and Sporting KC are near the bottom of the list, my point stands firm: There is little correlation between the rate at which teams make tackles and their standing in the table. Some teams that allow the potential threat to become a real threat find themselves near the top, while others lag.
The truth is probably somewhere in the middle – which, not coincidentally, is where most of the current playoff teams are found on this table. Even the best teams will allow potential threats to manifest themselves at some point; having a masterful ball-winner in the middle, then, is the field equivalent of the spectacular shot-stopper.

Image caption Campaigners hope the younger generations of albino people will have a safer future
Tanzania has banned witchdoctors in a move intended to stop attacks on people with albinism.
Home Affairs Minister Mathias Chikawe said there would be a nationwide operation to "arrest them and take them to court" if they continued to work.
Albino people, who lack pigment in their skin, have faced attacks for their body parts, which witchdoctors believe bring good luck and wealth.
The Tanzanian Albinism Society (TAS) has welcomed the ban.
"If we and the government come together and show strength as one and speak as one, we can deal with the problem head-on," the society's chairperson, Ernest Njamakimaya, said.
"I believe this way we can get rid of these incidents once and for all."
'Evidence mishandled'
More than 33,000 people in Tanzania are believed to have albinism.
Seventy have been killed in the past three years but only 10 people have been convicted of murder.

Mr Chikawe said action to find and prosecute witchdoctors would begin in two weeks' time in the northern areas of Mwanza, Geita, Shinyanga, Simiyu and Tabora, where most of the attacks have taken place.
The ban has emerged from the work of a special joint task force between police and the TAS.
The task force's work will now entail reviewing previous cases of albino attacks for new evidence and conducting further research on the motive of attackers.
Correspondents say some previous cases against alleged attackers have collapsed over the loss, mishandling or mislabelling of evidence.
Mr Chikawe acknowledged that further training of police was required.
The United Nations recently condemned the abduction of a four-year-old albino girl in north-west Tanzania.
Going by the current trend, India will be half a century late in achieving its global education commitments and the country needs fundamental changes in the education system if it wants to meet the 2030 sustainable development goals, a UNESCO report has said.

UNESCO's new Global Education Monitoring (GEM) report says that based on current trends universal primary education in Southern Asia will be achieved in 2051, lower secondary in 2062, and upper secondary in 2087.
India is expected to achieve universal primary education in 2050, universal lower secondary education in 2060 and universal upper secondary education in 2085, it said.
“This means the region would be more than half a century late for the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) deadline,” it added.

The report says there is an urgent need for greater headway in education and the sector needs a major transformation to fulfil the needed potential and meet the current challenges facing humanity and the planet.
It also talks of another report, Education for People and Planet, which, it said, shows the need for education systems to step up attention to environmental concerns.
“While in the majority of countries, education is the best indicator of climate change awareness, half of countries curricula worldwide do not explicitly mention climate change in their content. India is an exception, where currently some 300 million school students receive some environmental education,” it said.
The statistics cited in the report have revealed only six per cent of adults in the poorest countries and only five in India have ever attended literacy programmes, once they pass the formal schooling system.
The report has also called upon governments of various countries to start taking inequalities in education seriously, tracking them by collecting information directly from families.
“The new global development agenda calls for education ministers and other education actors to work in collaboration with other sectors,” it said.
The GEM Report lists various benefits that could come if education actors work in collaboration with other sectors.

The collaborative working may help delivery of health intervention through schools, contribution in increasing crop yields by 12 per cent and contribution of education in reducing population growth.
A spokesperson said Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's charter or military plane trips were booked only after officials were unable to find commercial flights that would accommodate Zinke's schedule. | Getty Images Interior Secretary Zinke traveled on charter, military planes
Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and their aides have taken several flights on private or military aircraft, including a $12,000 charter plane to take them to events in their hometown in Montana and private flights between two Caribbean islands, according to documents and a department spokesperson.
Zinke is at least the fourth senior member of the Trump administration to have used non-commercial planes at taxpayer expense, along with E nvironmental P rotection A gency Administrator Scott Pruitt, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and H ealth and H uman S ervices Secretary Tom Price. President Donald Trump has fumed at Price's pricey travel, and Democrats say the revelations demonstrate a cavalier attitude by Cabinet members toward excessive spending.
Story Continued Below
Interior Department spokesperson Heather Swift said Zinke's charter or military plane trips were booked only after officials were unable to find commercial flights that would accommodate Zinke's schedule and that all were "pre-cleared by career officials in the ethics office." Swift said they had not spoken to Zinke about whether they would reimburse the government for the cost of the flights, as Price plans to do for some of the $400,000 tab they racked up on charter flights.
On June 26, a Beechcraft King Air 200 carried Zinke and several staffers from Las Vegas to Glacier Park International Airport in Kalispell, Mont ana , about a 20-minute drive from Zinke's home in Whitefish, according to their official schedule. The flight cost $12,375, Swift said.
Zinke left after speaking at an event for the city's new professional hockey team, the Vegas Golden Knights Development Camp Dinner, according to their schedule. Earlier in the day, they had been in Pahrump, Nev ada , for an announcement related to public lands.
Zinke's flight left Las Vegas at 8:30 p.m. PST and landed in Kalispell around 1:30 a.m. MST . The secretary stayed overnight at their residence, Interior documents show.
Las Vegas is one of the main connecting airports for commercial flights to Glacier International. Commercial flights between the two cities are available for several hundred dollars a ticket, according to travel planning websites.
In Whitefish, Zinke attended the Western Governors' Association's annual meeting, where they spoke for about 20 minutes without taking questions. They then had a private lunch with association members. In the afternoon Zinke was the subject of a photo shoot with GQ magazine at Lake McDonald and fished while being interviewed by Outside Magazine, the records show.
Zinke and staffers flew commercial back to Washington, D.C., the next day, according to the records.

The trip was not the first in which Interior booked a private jet for Zinke. On March 31, Interior chartered two flights to take Zinke and staff from St. Croix to St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands to attend the centennial of the Danish government turning the islands over to the United States. Another two flights were chartered to return to St. Croix later that night.
Swift said they did not know how much the flights cost but that no other arrangements were available.
Commercial flights between the two islands generally run a few hundred dollars, according to travel booking websites.
In May, Zinke and their wife, Lolita, used a military aircraft to travel to Norway. From there, they flew on a military plane to Alaska for events organized by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The trip included charter planes to travel within Alaska, a common occurrence in the large, remote state. The Zinkes paid for Lolita's share of the trip, the full cost of which was not immediately available, Swift said.
Zinke also took a military helicopter from Fort Bliss to review the Organ Mountains -Desert Peaks National Monument in New Mexico in June, and they used a Bureau of Land Management helicopter to review the Basin and Range National Monument on July 30. “It is difficult to survey a half-million-acre piece of land with few roads by foot or car in an hour - and - a - half,” Swift said.
Along with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, Zinke took a military plane to Ravalli County, Mont ana , to check on wildfires in the area in August. "The military plane was used because of a very tight travel window, with no viable commercial airline options to transport two secretaries, security details, and associated USDA, Forest Service and Interior staff to Missoula in the time required," said USDA spokesperson Tim Murtaugh. The cost of the flight was not immediately available, but the two agencies plan to reimburse the Air Force, Murtaugh said.
Two live recordings from overseas shows that Johnny Cash performed in the 1970s are set for release this winter.
“Man in Black” fans are excited to hear that they will get new recordings from their favorite iconic country music singer, Johnny Cash. Previously unreleased, the recordings were taken from overseas performances in the 1970's.
The first of the projects, Man in Black: Live in Denmark 1971, is set for release on on Dec. 4, through Columbia/Legacy Recordings. Previously in 2006, the project was released as a DVD.
The Denmark project is also being released exclusively to independent record stores in a special set of two LPs, pressed on red and white vinyl, for Record Store Day Black Friday 2015. The track listing includes “A Boy Named Sue,” “Sunday Morning Coming Down,” “I Walk the Line” and “Folsom Prison Blues.”
Man in Black: Live in Denmark 1971 also features “If I Were a Carpenter,” which won Cash and June Carter Cash a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance By a Duo or Group With Vocal.
– (above) From Johnny Cash 1979 Christmas Special
The second live release is Koncert V Praze (In Prague — Live), which will be released on Feb. 5, 2016. This project was recorded on April 11, 1978, at a show organized by the Czechoslovakian government to see how people inside the Soviet bloc would react to an American artist like Cash.
According to a press release, Koncert V Praze “did more for U.S.-Czech relations in four concerts than [the U.S. Ambassador at the time] could have accomplished in four years.”

OTTAWA — Canada's labour market posted its ninth-straight month of job gains in August to give the economy its longest monthly growth streak since before the financial crisis nine years ago.
Statistics Canada says last month's increase of 22,200 jobs also helped nudge the unemployment rate down from 6.3 per cent in July to a nine-year low of 6.2 per cent.
But the data shows last month's growth was fuelled by less-desirable work as the economy gained 110,400 part-time jobs and shed 88,100 full-time positions.
The agency says most of the decline in full-time work was concentrated among young Canadians aged 15 to 24 years old, who also showed a notable decrease last month in labour force participation.
Looking at the bigger picture, however, the latest numbers show the labour market expanded 2.1 per cent compared to a year earlier with the addition of 374,300 net new jobs.
The data provides yet another sign the economy continues to have momentum after a stronger-than-expected start to 2017 that has also prompted two interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada.
The agency also says wages grew 1.8 per cent last month compared to a year earlier for the biggest increase since last October.
Undocumented migrants from the Balkans should be promptly deported from Germany, the country's foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said on Sunday.
MOSCOW (Sputnik) — Steinmeier added that about 30-40 percent of Germany's asylum applicants came from the Western Balkans.
“This group has no chance to obtain a refugee status. That's why we have to make a clear-cut decision and to act in accordance with it,” Steinmeier told the Bild newspaper in an interview.
The minister said that Albania, Kosovo and Macedonia should not be treated the same way as the other countries of the region because of their rapprochement with the European Union.
According to the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), the country received about 200,000 asylum applications during the 2015. Some 94,000 of them are from the Balkans and 40,000 are from Syria. The BAMF President said that almost all applications from the Balkans would be rejected.
According to the European Asylum Support Office, the number of migrant's applications for international protection in the European Union, Norway and Switzerland has increased by two-thirds in the first five months of 2015 in comparison to the same period last year.

Procter & Gamble's employment will shrink to the lowest levels in at least 14 years, once a $15 billion divestiture of beauty brands closes and an ongoing restructuring ends.
The 43 beauty brands carved off in a deal Thursday will go into a separate company that will be merged with New York-based P&G rival Coty Inc.P&G officials say the transaction mostly completes the process of identifying and selling brands that don't fit with the company's future..
The deal will affect 10,000 workers worldwide – at least 8 percent of its entire workforce, including about 1,500 in the U.S. and 200 in Greater Cincinnati. The transaction, expected to close in late 2016, will also transfer ownership of eight factories and nine distribution centers, including three U.S. facilities.
Moving the beauty brand jobs from P&G's payroll comes on top of P&G's other brand sales and the restructuring, which was announced in 2012. All told, the company will cut 20,000 to 23,000 total positions from its 118,000 head count disclosed last August – a reduction of 16.7 to 19.5 percent over three years.
The cuts will leave the Downtown Cincinnati-based consumer products giants at 95,000 to 98,000 jobs by mid 2017. The last time P&G's workforce numbered below 100,000 was in 2003, when the company's head count was 98,000. If P&G cuts jobs down to 95,000, it would make the payroll the lowest since 1991.
Finally, the brand sales taken together remove many obscure products from P&G's portfolio, as well as better known names such as Camay soap, Eukanuba pet food and Zest soap .
Company cuts beauty unit by nearly a third
P&G's latest transaction, when it closes in late 2016, will transfer the company's cosmetics, hair coloring and fragrance brands that command $5.9 billion in combined annual sales to Coty. Coty produces Rimmel cosmetics and Calvin Klein perfume. The deal will more than double Coty's revenues, making it a beauty player with more than $10 billion in annual sales.
The deal includes CoverGirl and Max Factor cosmetics brands; Wella, Clairol and Nice 'n Easy hair coloring; and licensed fragrances, such as Hugo Boss, Dolce & Gabbana and Gucci.
P&G shareholders will also become majority owners of Coty with 52 percent of the super-sized Coty.

The divestiture is the largest so far in P&G CEO A.G. Lafley's brand shedding campaign unveiled 11 months ago. Lafley is in the midst of selling or exiting up to 100 brands to refocus the company to 65 core labels that are faster growing. Since last August, the company has made deals to cut more than 90 brands, which have combined annual sales of more than $10.1 billion.
"This represents a significant step forward in the work to focus our portfolio on 10 categories and 65 brands that best leverage P&G's core competencies," Lafley said Thursday in a release.
The deal will radically simplify P&G's nearly $20 billion beauty business that Lafley helped create. It will reduce the business to roughly $14 billion in annual sales and leaving it much more focused on hair and skin care sold at mass retailers. P&G's remaining beauty business will be anchored by Pantene and Head & Shoulders shampoos and Olay and SKII skin care brands. Together, these brands command more than $9 billion in annual sales.
Deal slices worldwide factories and workforce
The deal will significantly reduce P&G's manufacturing footprint in Europe with seven out of 45 factories transferring to Coty. One U.S. plant in Maryland is also part of the deal.
P&G officials declined to update the company's employee count, which the company said in August was 118,000 as of June 2014. P&G later closed on its pet food sale that removed 1,100 jobs and has announced the Duracell sale to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, removing 2,700 jobs. Meanwhile, the company has also given separation packages to 3,100 office and manufacturing workers. In April, P&G executives also outlined plans to reduce another 3,000 to 6,000 office jobs by mid 2017.
Once all deals close, P&G will have 24 U.S. factories. The company currently has 29 factories in the U.S. and is building a new one in West Virginia. But it is selling four factories and closing two others in Augusta, Georgia and Cayey, Puerto Rico.
Worldwide, all the transactions will further reduce P&G's factory count. The court was roughly 135 in June 2014 but had dropped to about 115 by December 2016.
Up until now, P&G's largest divestiture had been the plan to sell off Duracell batteries, which does about $2.6 billion in annual revenue, to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway later this year. The next largest divestiture was last year's sale of Iams and other pet foods that did a a combined $1.6 billion in annual sales.
Coty wins bid and gets new shareholders
Coty's initial offer for P&G's beauty brands was valued at $12.5 billion, but the New York company's stock has jumped since unconfirmed news reports in mid June said it had won the bidding. The deal also includes Coty assuming $1.9 billion in P&G debt.
Lafley's goal is to restore consistent profit and sales growth by making it more focused, streamlined and easier to run
Thursday's deal also included these brands:
Sebastian Professional, Sassoon Professional, Nioxin, SP (System Professional), Koleston, Soft Color, Color Charm, Wellaton, Natural Instincts, VS Salonist, VS ProSeries Color, Londa/Kadus, Miss Clairol, L'image, Bellady, Blondor, Welloxon, Shockwaves, New Wave, Design, Silvikrin, Wellaflex, Forte, Balsam Color, Lacoste, bruno banani, Christina Aguilera, Escada, Gabriela Sabatini, James Bond 007, Mexx, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen.
P&G will either spin or split off the beauty brands in a transaction that will generate a $5 billion to $7 billion one-time gain with minimum tax impacts for P&G.
P&G indicated it will share the proceeds with stockholders by stepping up stock repurchases and dividend payments. It said it will return $70 billion to shareholders over the next four years.
That suggests $17.5 billion in stock buybacks and dividend payments annually – a 35.7 percent increase over the $12.9 billion returned to shareholders in fiscal year 2014, where P&G paid $6.9 billion in dividends and repurchased $6 billion in stock.
The outlines of the deal are similar to how P&G spun off Folgers coffee to J.M. Smucker Co. in 2012 as well as Jif peanut butter and Crisco shortening to Smucker's in 2002. The deal helps P&G avoid a massive tax bill as it refocuses it beauty business.
Yet to be worked out is whether the transaction will be structured as a split-off – which P&G prefers – or spin-off. Under each type of transaction, the outgoing beauty brands will be carved out into a separate company that would merge with Coty. Under a split off, P&G shareholders would be offered the chance to trade all, some or none of their P&G shares for new Coty shares. Under a spin-off, P&G shareholders would be automatically be issued new Coty shares.
P&G shares closed at $80.66, down 33 cents on Thursday.

Their “Skype” wedding was officiated via teleconference from Washington, D.C., where same-sex marriage is legal, and they received their license in the mail a short time later. It's called “e-marriage,” and it's a sort of high-tech version of the proxy wedding traditionally held when one of the parties can't be physically present — because, for example, they're in the military stationed overseas. “The reason we wanted to do it this way is because we wanted to have a wedding here in Dallas with our family and friends,” Reed said. “It was very important that all of our family came. It was the first time they actually met, even though we've been together 10 years. If we had to go to D.C., there's no way we could have had the people there who we wanted to be there.”
Reed and Walkup, co-owners of WDM Lighting on Oak Lawn Avenue, were married in a conference room at the W hotel on Oct. 10, in front of about 80 people with a 6-by-8-foot screen looming behind them. The couple had rented a similar room at a W hotel in Washington, where marriage equality activist Sheila Alexander-Reid officiated the wedding. “When we walked down the aisle, as soon as we reached the front, they come on the screen like The Wizard of Oz,” Reed said. “It was beautiful. It wasn't make-believe. It was like they were really there.”

WARNING: Some of these images are graphic in nature.
Photography fans might want to visit Paramount Studios' New York City backlot this weekend for Paris Photo, a huge art show featuring 80 photo and video artists from around the world. It was started in 1996 and is usually held at the Grand Palais in Paris, France. This is the second year that the event has been held in Los Angeles.
One of the most striking exhibits at the event is a collection of rare crime scene photos unearthed from the LAPD's archives, dating as far back as 1925 up to the 1960s. These photos never would have seen the light of day if it weren't for photographer/LAPD reserve officer Merrick Morton and their wife Robin Blackman.
Under the gallery name, Fototeka, the couple has spent years culling the LAPD's records to bring these images to light. But gaining access to the photos wasn't easy.
The images were shot for evidence and contained confidential and sensitive content that the LAPD was hesitant to open up to the public.
"I remember the quote from the city archivist at the time, they said they like my idea, but hell will freeze over before they give you any access to this," said Merrick.
But that all changed when Merrick met John Thomas, adjutant to then-Police Chief Bernard Parks, who had been working on an archival project about African-American LAPD officers. Together, they wrote a proposal to Chief Parks who granted them access.
"To our surprise they said, 'OK, you can have access to these.' So we were actually the first people ever allowed access to actually sift through these negatives," said Morton. "We're talking hundreds of thousands."
Take Two caught up with Merrick Morton and Robin Blackman at the Paramount Lot for a preview of the show, and to find out more about these fascinating historical images.
Interview Highlights:
On first beginning this massive project:
Robin Blackman: "I was a little overwhelmed, because I'm the one who organizes everything. He's the hunter and I'm the organizer, so I knew it was going to be a huge task. We were dealing with old negatives and old envelopes and deterioration and chemical issues as well. It was huge and it was huge that we saved it...They would have been sitting on the shelves in the shortage facility where it was not temperature controlled. It's an environment meant for paper and not for negatives. We had no idea we were going to walk into that when it happened."
On the image of the Black Dahlia murder scene:
Robin: "We're from here, born and raised in L.A., and we love seeing not only what the crime is, but what's going on behind it. The documentation of what the city was 50 or 70 years ago. Merrick: "And also, when we choose an image, let's say from this case here, we're trying to choose something that's not exploiting it. The image is graphic in its nature but I think when it's included when the architecture, with the hills and the landscape, I think it turns into a piece of art more than just this crime scene of her."
On the art behind these crime scene photos:
Robin: "The photographers are amazing. They are trained photographers, and they have an extra eye...is what we've discovered. For instance, they framed [Image #2 in the slideshow] so perfectly, they knew what they were doing. You see repeats of the way room interiors and exteriors are shot, but because they are photographers and they have that eye, I suppose they couldn't help themselves but capture something like this. Merrick: For us this is the iconic LA image of film noir. We actually had a friend who we were speaking to about this image and they said, for them to purchase this image and have it hanging on their wall, it's like hanging a Raymond Chandler image on their wall."
On how the LA film industry was inspired by these photos:
Merrick: "Sometimes filmmakers would have access to seeing these images. We have a shot of Alfred Hitchcock from the early 1950s and he's looking through some of the crime books and some of the images. So when they go out and shoots a film, is they saying, 'I saw this great image, let's set the scene like this'?
On the images of Charles Manson's first police photos after the Tate-LaBianca murders:
Merrick: The thing that stands out is when you look at the height/scale there, they were only 5-foot-3 inches tall. He's always seen and he's projected as this larger-than-life person, but in reality he's a very small person."
On the future of this project:
Robin: "We would love to see this as a public database that people can access and use as reference material, similar to what the New York Municipal archives offers. So we hope to have that one day and have every image archived and documented and all the metadata collected and everything in one place and the negatives are safe in another place. Would really love to see that happen."
Paris Photo is open to the public starting Friday, April 25 until Sunday, April 27. Fototeka is under contract with the LA Cultural Affairs Department and the LAPD to create an online archive of the photos, which will eventually be accessible to the public.
A litany of problems is laid bare in a report released Wednesday by Ontario's auditor general, from the growing frequency of Hydro One's power outages to a startling $140 million worth of mistakes in welfare payments.
Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk also raises concerns that inspections of school buses and nursing homes aren't being done on time, that Children's Aid Societies are failing to conduct basic background checks on potential child abusers, and that people are waiting too long for home care.
Lysyk released their annual report Wednesday morning at Queen's Park.
'Benefit calculation errors'
The auditor finds the province's new computer system for welfare payments is still riddled with problems and making millions in payment errors.
Lysyk said the Social Assistance Management System (SAMS) has now made a total of $140 million in "benefit calculation errors," including $89 million in what they call "potential overpayments" and $51 million in "potential underpayments." Both figures are far more than previously admitted by the government.
CBC News revealed a year ago that SAMS sent out some $19 million in welfare payments it shouldn't have, while sending some recipients too little money, or nothing at all.
Lysyk said the system still has 771 "serious defects" that are not yet fixed. "Until most of the serious defects are identified and fixed, SAMS will continue to generate errors."
They criticize the government for rushing the system into operation last fall despite knowing it had problems. The government has so far spent $290 million on SAMS, $90 million over budget.
Hydro One: less reliable but costing more
The report also includes the last report the office will do on Hydro One, now that it's no longer a Crown corporation.
Lysyk found Hydro One's service is getting less reliable yet costing more. The auditor general noted the frequency of power outages is on the rise and ranks Hydro One as the worst of all of Ontario's power companies for how long those outages last.
Energy Minister Bob Chiarelli called Lysyk's report "a helpful roadmap as Hydro One moves forward."
The findings, they said, show what Ontarians already knew: "That Hydro One can be a better-run, better-managed company" that delivers better value.
Their ministry has already taken action consistent with most of the report's recommendations, they said.
CAS is too slow
Lysyk said Ontario's 47 Children's Aid Societies are too slow at investigating allegations of abuse. Not one of the child-protection investigations their office reviewed was done within the required 30 days. Instead, the cases took an average of more than seven months.
Lysyk also chastises the government for failing to make sure every CAS acts on the recommendations of probes into children's deaths.
They said they far too often fail to perform basic background checks on the people involved with vulnerable children.
Nursing home residents at risk
The auditor said the 78,000 people in Ontario's nursing homes may be "at risk" because crucial inspections are behind schedule and orders to fix problems aren't being followed.
"Much more needs to be done to keep residents safe," said Lysyk.
They said the backlog of ministry inspections of long-term care homes in response to complaints of neglect or incidents of abuse more than doubled in just 15 months. The backlog rose to 2,800 in March 2015, from 1,300 in December 2013.
When inspections are done and problems found, inspectors issue "compliance orders" to fix the problems. But Lysyk said the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care fails to check the orders have been carried out within its 30-day target about two-thirds of the time.
Little oversight over school bus companies
The safety of the 830,000 children who ride school buses in Ontario is another of Lysyk's concerns They criticize the Ministry of Transportation for failing to ensure school bus safety inspections are always done on time, and for failing to ensure that all defects are fixed. The auditor's report said the government has "little oversight" of the companies that operate school buses and lets them certify their own buses for mechanical fitness.
Lysyk also said Ontario's home-care system is riddled with problems, including ones that haven't been addressed since they were identified in a 2010 audit.
Wait times for getting personal support worker services are far too long, they wrote. People with identical home-care needs to get different levels of service in different parts of the province, or in at least one region, no service at all.
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the auditor general's findings show that the government is "out of touch" with Ontarians' needs.
"This report confirms what people across Ontario are feeling," Horwath told reporters at Queen's Park. "The choices this government is making aren't about them. They aren't about helping families get ahead, helping seniors or vulnerable children, and they're certainly not about fixing our hydro system."
Progressive Conservative MPP Lisa MacLeod called the report "a stinging indictment of 12 years of Liberal government waste and mismanagement in almost every imaginable department, ministry and service area. Whether that is school busing, post-secondary education, energy, the SAMS computer system and, I think most troubling, the Children's Aid Society."
Other highlights of the auditor's report:
The problem of "bed blockers" — people staying in acute-care hospitals even after they've been discharged has actually worsened since 2007, when the government created regional bureaucracies (Local Health Integration Networks) that were supposed to deal with that problem.
The government hasn't even tried to measure whether the $1.45 billion it has spent on grants and interest-free loans to businesses have actually helped boost employment or the economy.
Work Smarter Not Harder: 17 Great Tips
In Dan Pink's Free Agent Nation: The Future of Working for Yourself they close the book with a long, excellent list of “Work Smarter Not Harder” type advice for people who want to start working for themselves.
Frankly, the list is so good I think everyone would benefit from it.
Below are my favorites. I've included links to research and prior posts backing Dan's advice.
via Free Agent Nation: The Future of Working for Yourself:
Make a “to don't” list. Another gem from the inimitable Tom Peters. Prepare a list that contains all the things you shouldn't waste your time on – useless tasks, unnecessary meetings, worthless phone calls, and so on. Then place it next to your “to do” list – and stick to it. (More here.)
Carry a notebook and pen. Thomas Edison did it. Virginia Woolf did it. And so did Charles Darwin. They toted a notebook with them everywhere and wrote down ideas that popped into their heads… Page through the notebook occasionally. Trust me: This is a fantastic way to spark ideas and to weave creativity into the fabric of your life. (More here and here.)
Hone your elevator speech. Be able to explain who you are, what you do, and why someone could benefit from your unique talents – in 30 seconds. Then cut your pitch to 15 seconds. Practice it. Sharpen it… Caveat: An elevator speech shouldn't sound like an elevator speech. It's really an exercise in being honest, concise, and interesting.
Establish an opening ritual. Try to begin your day the same way. If you work at home, maybe take a short walk before you go to your office. Have a cup of tea or read or meditate before starting your work. An opening ritual will ease your mind, body and soul into the day. (More here.)
Establish a closing ritual. Know when to stop working. Try to end each work day the same way, too. Straighten up your desk. Back up your computer. Make a list of what you need to do tomorrow. (More here.)
Get used to the three “-ty's.” Ambiguity. Uncertainty. Volatility… Projects collapse. Money evaporates. Customers go wiggy. Get over it. That's the way it works.
Learn. …Become a learning machine. Ask questions. Take smart people to lunch. Read. Read some more. Listen to audiobooks. Take classes. Go to conferences (which are also great places to network.) Added benefit: This makes life more interesting. Yet another benefit: Studies have shown that people who make constant learning part of their lives end up living longer. (More here.)
Failing is OK. Not failing is not OK. If you don't flop every so often, you're not trying hard enough. (More here.)
Guard your calendar. Make sure your time is focused on your one or two top priorities. Ask yourself: “Is this how I want to be spending my time right now?” Remember: you are your calendar. So treat your calendar with respect. (More here.)
Be paranoid. The good times won't last. (More here.)
Don't be paranoid. The bad times won't last.
Never say up front that you can beat a deadline. Just turn your work in early and look like a hero. Related advice (which is ancient but unassailable): Underpromise, overdeliver.
Be quick. But don't hurry. This one isn't mine. It comes from the legendary UCLA basketball coach John Wooden. Read it again. Think about it. Make sense, huh?
Respond to calls and e-mails quickly. Even if you response is. “I'll get back to you,” try to get back to people within 24 hours. They'll appreciate the courtesy. Reality check: sometimes you'll violate this rule.
Spend 10 minutes today laughing out loud. Turn on Comedy Central, read a funny book, look at photographs of yourself in junior high. Laugh. Fully. (More here.)
Take a “Sabbath.” Choose one day during the week when you don't work… Respecting your own “Sabbath” will be good for your soul – and better for your business.
Take the Sunday night test. If you're like 99 percent of the population, you've experienced “Sunday night dread.” This ailment begins creeping up your spine around 4:30 on Sunday night and reaches a crescendo around 11PM, as you realize you're going to have to go to work the following day. (My own research has shown that Sunday night dread begins forming around third grade and eventually dissipates around age 70.)… So this Sunday night, when you go to sleep, ask yourself: “Am I suffering from Sunday night dread?” If so, you might be doing something wrong. But if you're not getting it – if you're lying there in bed thinking, “You know, I sorta like this. I'm not dreading tomorrow. I'm actually looking forward to it” – then you're probably on the right path. (More here.)
I've covered highlights from two of Dan's other books: Drive (explaining the science of motivation) and Johnny Bunko (a great career guide.)

Winston-Salem, N.C. -- A 20-mile stretch of the historic Business 40 highway between Kernersville and Winston-Salem has a new name thanks to voters.
The highway section was renamed Highway 421/Salem Parkway. The NC Department of Transportation and Governor Pat McCrory unveiled the new name at a groundbreaking ceremony on Friday at the Green Street Bridge at BB&T Ballpark in Winston-Salem.
More than 5,200 people voted for the highway to be named 'Salem Parkway.' Other contenders were Piedmont Corridor with just over 3,000 votes, Golden Leaf Parkway with over 900 votes, and Innovation Highway with nearly 700 votes.

Governor McCrory says the project is about more than just a new name. They say it will be safer for drivers, improve business and tourism, and it will be aesthetically pleasing.
The new highway signs will go up as the project is completed. The main impact of the project, the full closure of Business 40, is expected to start in late 2018 or early 2019. The NCDOT says the closure should not last for more than two years.
Some background info:
The idea of renaming the highway began with citizens back in 2006 when the Federally-sponsored Accelerated Construction Technology Transfer conference was held in Winston-Salem, according to Engineer Pat Ivey.
The actual naming process began in 2015 when the Winston-Salem City Council and the Kernersville Board of Alderman appointed a Business 40 Naming Committee.
In November 2015, NCDOT launched a name nomination period through January 2016. Nearly 1,900 names were submitted. A selection committee chose the final four from the nominations.

West Warwick, RI is one of the most underrated dumps in New England. They came in at #5 in our official list of the Top 5 Dumpiest Towns in Rhode Island:
It really is a magical place of splendor and enchantment:
Anyway, Turtleboy was fascinated and stayed up late last night reading what is perhaps the most entertaining Facebook commentary ever on the West Warwick, RI Facebook page.
*****************UPDATE ****************
Nathan Harrington surrendered themselves and is in custody. Thank you all for your assistance.
NATHAN HARRINGTON born in 1995
On 08-06-2016, West Warwick officers were dispatched to a large disturbance on Robert St. While responding to the scene, information was relayed that an involved individual, identified as Nathan Harrington, had fled the scene in a green Ford Escort. Soon thereafter, this same vehicle struck two parked (unattended) vehicles on Pond St. Harrington did not stop, but continued to drive. Minutes later, officers were dispatched to an address on Main St for an assault that had just occurred. Harrington was identified as the assailant and it was indicated that they had just fled in a green Ford Escort . As officers were responding to that location, they were diverted to a serious accident that had occurred in Phenix Square. Upon arrival, officers found that the same green Ford Escort had crossed over the center line and collided with another vehicle head-on. The collision was such, that an axle was torn from one of the vehicles. Officers learned that the driver of the Escort, once again identified as Nathan Harrington, had left their injured passenger inside the vehicle and fled into a wooded area. Officers checked the area, but they could not locate Harrington. During this investigation, it was learned that Harrington was also wanted by the Coventry Police Department for a Felony assault that had occurred two days before. Along with the Coventry warrant, Harrington is wanted by the West Warwick Police for leaving the scene of an accident resulting in injury, along with numerous traffic related offenses.
If you know where Harrington is, please call the West Warwick Police (821-4323 prompt zero) or the Coventry Police (826-1100 prompt zero).
So this guy is obviously a real winner. The vokestache with the goatee landing strip was a real touch of class. The best part is that their night of passion all happened behind the wheel of a green Ford escort – the official car of white trash everywhere. But seriously, I don't know why this kid tried to hide. You're a ginger dude. You're like the easiest breed of people to find in America.
Oh yea, and the warrant that is out for them in Coventry is apparently for kidnapping a grown ass man:
I've never heard of a grown ass man being kidnapped, but then again this Turtleboy does not live in West Warwick. Happens all the time there.
Anyway, the commentary on this post was legendary. Mom made their grand entrance about halfway through:
Classic.
Oh yea, and she's apparently a nurse:
They also like to post this inspirational quote a lot:
Which is weird, because apparently she's already got a man/sperm donor, and their name is Robert Kowalski.
And their commentary was a West Warwick work of art.
“
I haven't fucked anyone but you since 2008.”
In West Warwick this qualifies as “romance.”
Robert Kowalski is also the father of Nathan Harrington, and naturally they moved to another beautiful American city after their West Warwick days ran out – Fall River:
Because, of course Fall River.
And it's pretty shocking that Nathan Harrington would go on a crime spree like this while having an outstanding warrant in Coventry. After all, Robert Kowalski has been the ideal father. Lots of great Dads claim that they will “ride and die forever” with their criminal son:
And I know that Turtleboy often refers to Turtleboy Jr. as “my n word”:
You know what the least surprising part about this is? The Chicago Bulls flat brimmed cap. The official uniform of dooshnozzles everywhere.
They also live by a strict code:
 They are an aspiring model:
They eat at the finest restaurants Rhode Island has to offer:
He's got a great car:
However, if you talk trash about their baby Momma there will be consequences:
And in case you didn't see their first post, they will post multiple times a day just so the message is clear:
Anyway, Robert Kowalski OBVIOUSLY had to chime in on the West Warwick Facebook page. And of course they decided to go the route of threatening to kill West Warwick police officers if they attempted to arrest their criminal seed:
Classy!!!
They were far from the only Nathan Harrington supporter though. And almost all of their supporters shared certain characteristics, such as teenage pregnancy, selfies, duck faces, facial piercings, flat brimmed hats, unrestrained machismo, and the English language skills of El Salvadorian villager.
First we found out that Nathan Harrington apparently got a 16 year old pregnant (who may or may not be their cousin)
It's cool though, because everyone in their immediate circle of friends and family was on board with it:
OF COURSE the mother of a West Warwick 16 year old was on board with Nathan Harrington impregnating their minor child. Gianna would know.
And the best place to try out for Teen Mom in West Warwick is behind a dumpster while you're holding a blow pop:
It's every girl's dream wedding!! Eat your heart out Nicholas Sparks!!!
Anyway, many of Nathan Harrington's supporters were on the WWPD page posting alibis for him, because apparently those witnesses must have imagined a ginger in a green Ford Escort crashing into multiple cars before running into the woods:
Free my boi!!!
Although sometimes their supporters don't understand who is supporting them and who isn't:
Hey Trashly – Ray Colwell was attempting to provide your brother/cousin/future boyfriend with an alibi. They were not in fact snitchin'. Just sayin.
Their alibi seems rock solid too. After all, they don't get a car:
However, Maddie may also be a snitch:
Ouch!!! Some West Warwick drama!!! Is this true? We will have to confirm with Kelsey before reporting for sure!! Maddie is a real winner too:
As is Rene St. Pierre, which is an amazing name for a male:
At first we thought this guy might be bad news. Then we saw the crucifix and realize that he's clearly a devoted follower of Jesus.
Although my favorite name of their supporters is probably this guy:
Trapboii may in fact be the greatest name of all time. When you see a face like this:
The first thing you think is, “that guy has to be named Trapboii El Chopa.”
Our girl Mary Jane made some strong points too:
Yea, they have no witnesses. Except for all those people who witnessed them smashing into cars on Main Street. If you just look past all of them Mary Jane's logic is rock solid.
Their supporters should probably get their stories straight though. Either it was them or it wasn't. And if they Are there, then you should probably go with the Joe Noury defense:
Everyone can relate to that comment. Sometimes you just have to run from the cops. It's not easy being a West Warwick gangsta, right Joe?
I know Shannon agrees:
Although according to James Forte, it is actually them who the cops are looking for:
Gangsta!!!
But wait, there are more people who have Nathan's back and they are equally magnificent!! For instance, Michelle Lee:
The All-Star parenting in West Warwick is what makes it such a fabulous tourist destination.
Anyway, Rhode Island really is a hidden gem of debauchery and hopefully this family never stops running afoul of the law and posting on Facebook because we could read this stuff all day.
P.S. Shoutout to whoever is running the West Warwick PD Facebook page. You are the real MVP:

3 Doors Down Will Headline Ravens Countdown To Kickoff
Credit: Handout The rock band 3 Doors Down formed in 1995 and is best known for their hit single "Kryptonite," off their debut album.
The rock band 3 Doors Down will headline the Ravens' Countdown to Kickoff Party, held this year at the Maryland State Fairground in Timonium (instead of Power Plant Live, like years prior).
It'll be held Friday, Sept. 9, with gates opening at 5 p.m. Besides the music, there will be special guests, including former Ravens players, as well as cheerleaders, Poe, interactive games and a live WBAL-TV 11 broadcast.
“We are excited for what's in store for this year's Countdown to Kickoff Party and to continue a great event with Miller Lite,” Brad Downs, the team's vice president of marketing, said in a statement. “This event has grown significantly over the years, and the move to the Maryland State Fairgrounds allows us to accommodate even more fans. We're looking forward to a great party that leads into our first game on Sept. 11.”
Tickets are $10 in advance (or $20 on the day of) and you can snatch them up on Ticketmasters. VIP tickets ($30) offer access to a reserved area closer to the stage.
The party will be held two days ahead of the regular season opener at home against the Buffalo Bills.
The Grammy-nominated 3 Doors Down formed in 1995 and broke through with their 2000 debut album, "The Better Life" and its hit single "Kryptonite." The album went six-times platinum, and was followed up with the 2001 thrice-platinum "Away from the Sun." They're touring now in support of their sixth album, "Us And The Night." The tour will see them making another stop in Maryland, at the Ocean City Bike Fest on Sept. 17.
The “Overtime” Final Rule, released on May 18, 2016, will take effect December 1, 2016. The rule increases the standard salary threshold under which white collar workers are eligible for overtime pay; additionally, it increases the annual salary threshold above which Highly Compensated Employees (HCE) are exempt from overtime pay. The Final Rule also establishes a mechanism for automatically adjusting these threshold rates every three years. The rule does not include any changes to the existing exemption categories and corresponding duties tests that qualify white collar workers as exempt from overtime pay requirements.[1] This is particularly relevant to workers whose salary falls between the standard salary threshold for overtime eligibility ($47,476) and the HCE salary threshold for overtime exemption ($134,004). White collar workers may be eligible for overtime if their job duties do not meet all of the tests in one of the exemption categories.
The overtime exemption category that applies to athletic trainers is the Professional Employees category, with the new salary thresholds bolded. If your salary and job duties satisfy all of the tests in the Professional Employees category, you are not eligible for overtime pay under the new rule. Alternatively, if your salary and job duties do not meet all of the tests under the Professional Employees category, you are eligible for overtime pay under the new rule.
Professional Employees [2]
The FLSA exempts from its overtime and minimum wage standards employees who qualify as professionals. The professional employee exemption is comprised of three different categories: creative professional, learned professional, and teaching professional.
To qualify for the learned professional employee exemption, all of the following tests must be met:
The employee must be compensated on a salary or fee basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than $913 per week, increased from $455 weekly. Under the new rule, this weekly rate threshold will automatically be adjusted every three years according to the 40th percentile of full-time salaried workers in the lowest-wage Census region (currently the South). Up to 10% of standard salary level can come from non-discretionary bonuses, incentive payments, and commissions, paid at least quarterly;
or fee basis (as defined in the regulations) at a rate not less than $913 per week, The employee's primary duty must be the performance of work requiring advanced knowledge, defined as work which is predominantly intellectual in character and which includes work requiring the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment;
The advanced knowledge must be in a field of science or learning; and
The advanced knowledge must be customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.
Do Athletic Trainers Qualify as Professional Employees?
Yes. Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. §541.301(e)(8), athletic trainers are considered to generally meet the requirements of the learned professional exemption:
(a) To qualify for the learned professional exemption, an employee's primary duty must be the performance of work requiring advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction. This primary duty test includes three elements:
(1) The employee must perform work requiring advanced knowledge;
(2) The advanced knowledge must be in a field of science or learning; and
(3) The advanced knowledge must be customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.
(b) The phrase “work requiring advanced knowledge” means work which is predominantly intellectual in character, and which includes work requiring the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment, as distinguished from performance of routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical work. An employee who performs work requiring advanced knowledge generally uses the advanced knowledge to analyze, interpret or make deductions from varying facts or circumstances. Advanced knowledge cannot be attained at the high school level.
(c) The phrase “field of science or learning” includes the traditional professions of law, medicine, theology, accounting, actuarial computation, engineering, architecture, teaching, various types of physical, chemical and biological sciences, pharmacy and other similar occupations that have a recognized professional status as distinguished from the mechanical arts or skilled trades where in some instances the knowledge is of a fairly advanced type, but is not in a field of science or learning.
(d) The phrase “customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction” restricts the exemption to professions where specialized academic training is a standard prerequisite for entrance into the profession. The best prima facie evidence that an employee meets this requirement is possession of the appropriate academic degree. However, the word “customarily” means that the exemption is also available to employees in such professions who have substantially the same knowledge level and perform substantially the same work as the degreed employees, but who attained the advanced knowledge through a combination of work experience and intellectual instruction. Thus, for example, the learned professional exemption is available to the occasional lawyer who has not gone to law school, or the occasional chemist who is not the possessor of a degree in chemistry. However, the learned professional exemption is not available for occupations that customarily may be performed with only the general knowledge acquired by an academic degree in any field, with knowledge acquired through an apprenticeship, or with training in the performance of routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical processes. The learned professional exemption also does not apply to occupations in which most employees have acquired their skill by experience rather than by advanced specialized intellectual instruction.
(e)(8) Athletic trainers. Athletic trainers who have successfully completed four academic years of pre-professional and professional study in a specialized curriculum accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs and who are certified by the Board of Certification of the National Athletic Trainers Association Board of Certification generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption.
(f) The areas in which the professional exemption may be available are expanding. As knowledge is developed, academic training is broadened and specialized degrees are offered in new and diverse fields, thus creating new specialists in particular fields of science or learning. When an advanced specialized degree has become a standard requirement for a particular occupation, that occupation may have acquired the characteristics of a learned profession. Accrediting and certifying organizations similar to those listed in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(3), (e)(4), (e)(8) and (e)(9) of this section also may be created in the future. Such organizations may develop similar specialized curriculums and certification programs which, if a standard requirement for a particular occupation, may indicate that the occupation has acquired the characteristics of a learned profession.

Terrey Hills Weather Watch Radar
New South Wales/ACT
33.7009°S 151.2098°E 194m AMSL
LocationTerrey Hills, NSW Radar TypeMeteor 1500 S-band Doppler Typical Availability24 hours
Geographical Situation: The radar is located 18 km north of the Sydney CBD. The Terrey Hills site, on the Hornsby plateau at an elevation of 195 metres above sea level, gives the radar an excellent view in all directions. The rough topography of the Great Dividing Range slightly compromises the radar's view to the west, but the coverage to the north, east and south is largely unobstructed. Based on detecting echoes at an altitude of 3,000 metres, the radar coverage extends as far north as Bulahdelah and Scone, west to Mudgee and Bathurst and south to Goulburn and Ulladulla.
Meteorological Aspects: The radar will readily detect thunderstorms and deep rain-bearing systems approaching from any direction, often at greater range than quoted above. The high sensitivity of the radar will assist in the detection of drizzle and light shower activity over Sydney, the Central Coast and Blue Mountains, but, as with other radars, the curvature of the Earth may hide these usually shallow weather systems at longer range. People in the Newcastle, Hunter Valley and lower Mid North coast are therefore encouraged to refer to the nearer Newcastle radar, those in the Illawarra the Sydney (Appin) radar and users on the Southern Tablelands the Canberra radar.
Non-meteorological Echoes: In most cases, processing of the radar signal removes permanent echoes caused by hills, buildings and other solid objects, but sometimes a few slips through. These usually show up as small, stationary or erratically moving specks, mostly over the higher ground of the Blue Mountains, Southern Highlands and Barrington Tops areas. On cold clear winter nights and mornings these echoes may become stronger or increase in number due to downward refraction of the radar beam.
Ships are regularly observed over the sea. These appear as specks or short arcs (oriented perpendicular to the direction of the radar). They can often be tracked moving towards or away from port over a series of images.
During strong winds and very rough seas, sea clutter may be visible off the coast out to a range of about 30 km. This sea clutter tends to remain in the same area and can therefore be distinguished from rain echoes, which generally move with the wind.
We already knew that the Nexus 5X would be a more affordable option when compared to last year's Nexus 6. Now it seems that the Nexus 6P is also pushing affordability as one of its key selling points, at least according to a number of new leaks that have surfaced this morning ahead of the official announcement.
The Nexus 6P is expected to set US buyers back just $499, with the highest configuration (128GB) priced at just $650. That's pretty impressive for an all-metal high-end flagship device. As for the Nexus 5X, all rumors indicate it will cost around $379.
Unfortunately for European buyers, the situation isn't quite as rosy. European pricing tends to be higher due to import taxes and other related factors, but the premium here is way higher than anyone probably predicted. The Nexus 6P is will reportedly cost around 650 Euros for the base model, which translates out to about $729. That's a difference of $229! The situation is similar with regards to the Nexus 5X, which will reportedly cost around 479 Euro for the base 16GB model. That translates out to about a premium of $158.
We have to wonder what Google was thinking here. In the past, Nexus phones have often cost more in Europe than in the US, but the gaps here are pretty massive. Missing features like OIS, wireless charging, and a few other things found in phones that offer similar prices in Europe, the latest Nexus family is probably going to be a much harder sell for those across the pond.
What do you think of the pricing, if all this proves accurate? Will you still buy the Nexus 5X or 6P in Europe or do these prices turn you off? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.

The success of the UK economy depends on staying in the EU, the head of the country's biggest business group says.
Confederation of British Industry (CBI) director general John Cridland told the Observer EU membership supported jobs, growth and the UK's "competitiveness".
Their comments come after Prime Minister David Cameron lost a vote on the next president of the European Commission.
They tried to block the appointment of Jean-Claude Juncker, who is seen as a backer of closer political union.
EU states voted 26-2 to appoint Mr Juncker on Friday, and Mr Cameron called it a "bad day for Europe".
Image copyright PA Image caption John Cridland says the CBI will try to keep Britain in the EU
Mr Cameron wants to renegotiate Britain's position in the EU before holding a referendum on membership after the next general election.
'Fundamental'
Some Conservative MPs believe Britain should leave the EU, and on Friday Tory MEP Daniel Hannan proposed a "Swiss-type deal where we are only in the free market and we are outside everything else".
But Mr Cridland opposed this, saying: "Alternatives to full membership of the EU simply wouldn't work, leaving us beholden to its rules without being able to influence them."
They said the CBI, which lobbies the government on behalf of businesses, would "continue to press the case for the UK remaining in a reformed European Union".
"The EU is our biggest export market and remains fundamental to our economic future," they said.
"Our membership supports jobs, drives growth and boosts our international competitiveness."
After Friday's European vote Labour leader Ed Miliband said the UK was now "closer to the exit door" in Europe, posing a threat to the economy, and UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Cameron had been "utterly humiliated".
But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Mr Cameron had been "brave" to take on Europe and said the debate had now changed.
The leaders of Sweden and Germany offered the PM some encouragement after the vote.
Swedish PM Fredrik Reinfeldt said they knew closer union was not "for everyone", and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said they were "ready to address British concerns".
CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian jets bombed Islamic State targets in Libya on Monday, a day after the group there released a video showing the beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians, drawing Cairo directly into the conflict across its border.
Egypt said the pre-dawn strike hit militant camps, training sites and weapons storage areas in the neighbouring oil-producing country, where factional fighting has unleashed virtual anarchy and created havens for jihadi Islamists.
While Cairo is believed to have provided clandestine support to a Libyan general fighting a rogue government in Tripoli, the 21 decapitations pushed President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi into open action, expanding their battle against Islamist militancy.
“And let those near and far know that the Egyptians have a shield that protects and preserves the security of the country, and a sword that eradicates terrorism,” the Egyptian military said in a statement.
Egyptian state television aired footage of fighter planes leaving a hangar with “Long live Egypt” emblazoned on their tails, followed by night-vision aerial footage showing bomb explosions and the aircraft returning in early daylight.
Libya's air force also participated in Monday's attack, which targeted Derna, an eastern coastal city regarded as a base for fighters of the ultra-radical Islamic State.
“There are losses among individuals, ammunition and the (Islamic State) communication centres,” Libyan air force commander Saqer al-Joroushi told Egyptian state television, adding that dozens had been killed.
Joroushi, who is loyal to Libya's internationally recognised government, which set up camp in the city of Tobruk after losing control of the capital Tripoli, said there would be more strikes on Tuesday.
The rival Tripoli-based parliament, which is supported by some Islamist groups, said the air raids were an assault on Libya's sovereignty. Omar al-Hassi, premier of the self-appointed Tripoli government, said three children, two elderly men and a 21-year-old woman were killed in the attack.
It was not possible to confirm either faction's accounts of the number or nature of the casualties.
CHRISTIAN ANGER
Cairo called on the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Iraq and Syria to broaden the scope of their operations to include Libya, highlighting how the insurgent group has expanded its reach around the Arab world.
Since the fall of strongman Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, a number of Islamist movements have taken hold in Libya. Recently, some have declared ties to Islamic State and claimed high-profile attacks in what appears to be an intensifying campaign.
The U.S. military estimated in December that only around 200 Islamic State fighters were operating in the country.
Egypt is not the only Arab nation sucked into confrontation with the group by the gruesome killings of its citizens.
Jordan has taken a leading role in conducting air strikes against the group in Syria and Iraq this month after the militants released a video showing a captured Jordanian pilot being burned alive in a cage.
Men in orange jumpsuits purported to be Egyptian Christians held captive by the Islamic State (IS) are marched by armed men along a beach said to be near Tripoli, in this still image from an undated video made available on social media on February 15, 2015. REUTERS/Social media via Reuters TV
The 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians were marched to a beach, forced to kneel and then beheaded on video, which was broadcast via a website that supports Islamic State.
The victims were among thousands of unemployed Egyptians desperately seeking work in Libya, despite the risks. Egypt's foreign ministry said it was banning travel to Libya and had set up a crisis centre to bring home Egyptians.
Thousands of traumatized mourners gathered at the Coptic church in al-Our village, where 13 of the 21 victims came from, struggling to come to terms with the fate of compatriots who paid a gruesome price for simply seeking work.
Before the videoed killings, one of the militants stood with a knife in their hand and said: “Safety for you crusaders is something you can only wish for.” Afterwards, they say: “And we will conquer Rome, by the will of Allah.”
The head of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Francis, condemned the beheadings. “They were killed simply for the fact that they were Christians,” they said at the Vatican.
Egypt's Coptic Christian pope was one of the public figures who backed Sisi when he, as army chief, ousted Islamist president Mohamed Mursi in 2013 after mass protests against him.
The killings put pressure on Sisi to show they are in control of national security, even as they make progress against Islamist militant insurgents in the Sinai, some of whom have recently pledged allegiance to Islamic State.
“It's swift and decisive, it's not about strategy, it's about containing anger within Egypt,” said Hassan Hassan, co-author of a book on Islamic State.
“Just like in Jordan, it's more about saving face, saying: ‘You can't mess with us'. .... It's likely to evolve into a sustained strategy of helping in the fight against ISIS (Islamic State) in neighbouring countries.”

Fears the crisis in Libya could spill across the border had already prompted Egypt, the Arab world's most populous nation, to upgrade its military hardware.
Egypt signed a 5.2 billion-euro deal to buy French weaponry on Monday, Egyptian media said, including 24 Rafale combat jets made by Dassault Aviation, a multi-mission naval frigate, and air-to-air missiles.

Twin-Tube HLR Damper
The RV1 will make use of X-Fusion's proven twin-tube HLR damper that we've become very familiar with from their Vengeance platform, although it will see some important internal refinements to better suit the fork's 200mm of travel (the Vengeance offers up to 170mm) in the form of a higher oil flow piston and a different shim stack arrangement. Just as in the Vengeance, the HLR damper is a sealed but serviceable aluminum unit that separates the lubrication oil from damping duties.

Different fork crowns will allow the RV1 to work with both 26'' and 650B wheel sizes.
26'' and 650B Versions
The fork arch looks burly from the front, but a peek from behind reveals that X-Fusion has pared it down quite a bit in an effort to shave grams.
Carbon Lower Leg Guards
Uni-directional carbon fiber leg guards offer added protection.
Pressure Release Valves
Pressure release valves allow for quick and easy discharge of any built up pressure without having to open the fork's top caps.
The fork's 20mm thru-axle requires a tool to remove - we like this on a true DH fork - and employs a single pinch bolt on the right hand side.
The reason we did it now is that we want to be involved in World Cup downhill racing and we think that is the pinnacle of suspension performance. It took us a long time to get here but we really wanted to execute a fork that we knew would be ready for the World Cup downhill circuit, and you know it's not easy, it took time, but I think we're finally there with a product that we think that someone could race and win a World Cup with. - Joel Smith, X-Fusion general manager
cavitation to a minimum due to the system preventing the oil from sloshing about inside the fork, but it also eliminates the chance of dirt and grime that has managed to get past the seals from mixing in with the damping oil. The twin-tube layout is just how the name suggests, with the damper cartridge employing a tube within a tube layout that allows the oil to flow through the compression damping circuits that are located at the bottom of the cartridge and out ports that feed into the outer chamber created by the exterior damper cartridge wall. The opposite happens during the rebound stroke, with the oil flowing in through the ports, past the check valve, and through the rebound assembly. External adjustments included rebound speed that can be adjusted via a red anodized dial atop the right fork leg, with separate low-speed and high-speed compression dials found at the bottom. Our time on shorter travel versions of the HLR damper have shown it to be a top performer that can rival anything on the market, so we are very much looking forward to having a go on the 200mm travel RV1.While 650B wheels are gaining ground fast on their long-standing 26'' counterparts when it comes to both OEM spec and consumer acceptance, no one is quite sure if they will have the same proliferation in the world of downhill bikes. We'll no doubt see some World Cup racers on-course with 650B wheels for the 2013 season, though, and X-Fusion may very well be one of them as the new RV1 will be available in both 26'' and 650B flavours. Both versions will utilize the very same lowers and stanchions but crown geometry will vary between the two in order to preserve handling, with the 26'' crowns featuring 42mm of offset and the 650B set running 46mm. Consumers will be able to purchase either version complete, or a set of aftermarket crowns that will allow them to switch between the two wheel sizes. Laser etched height markings on the upper portion of the stanchions will keep riders from having to measure to find where the tubes should be clamped.Bolted to the lower legs is a set of uni-directional carbon fiber guards that protect the magnesium tubes from rock strikes. The guards are held in place with four small hex head screws and can be removed if you don't feel like running them, although riders who frequent rocky terrain will likely prefer to leave them in place (). Graphics are printed directly onto the guard.While common in the moto world, pressure release valves are only just now showing up regularly on mountain bike forks (). The valves, which are located just below the seals on the RV1, can be opened with a 2.5mm hex key to allow the fork's internal pressure to return to ambient levels. This may not be a concern for the majority of casual riders, but it is a well known fact that pressure builds up within a fork as it cycles through its travel for an extended period of time, artificially raising the spring rate as this happens. These small ports allow racers () to release the built-up pressure without having to crack open the fork's caps, and X-Fusion is even planning on offering tool-free aftermarket buttons that will replace the hex head screws.
In the Greek-speaking city of Aphrodisias (located in modern-day Turkey), archaeologist have discovered a wealth of graffiti from the 4th and 5th centuries CE, some of which shed light on the local Jewish community:
Aphrodisias . . . boasted a sizable Jewish population. Many Jewish traders set up shop in an abandoned temple complex known as the Sebasteion. Among the graffiti found there is a depiction of a Hanukkah menorah, a nine-candle lamp that would be lit during the Jewish festival, [as opposed to the seven-branched menorah used in the Temple, which is richly attested in ancient iconography]. “This may be one of the earliest representations of a Hanukkah menorah that we know from ancient times,” said [the scholar Angelos] Chaniotis. . . .
In the decades that followed [his ascension to the throne in 527 CE, the emperor] Justinian restricted or banned polytheistic and Jewish practices. Aphrodisias, which had been named after the goddess Aphrodite, was renamed Stauropolis. Polytheistic and Jewish imagery, including some of the graffiti, was destroyed.
The Bank of Nova Scotia (French: La Banque de Nouvelle-Écosse), operating as Scotiabank (French: Banque Scotia), is a Canadian multinational bank. It is the third largest bank in Canada by deposits and market capitalization. It serves more than 24 million customers in over 50 countries around the world and offers a range of products and services including personal and commercial banking, wealth management, corporate and investment banking. With a team of more than 88,000 employees and assets of $998 billion (as at October 31, 2018), Scotiabank trades on the Toronto (TSX: BNS) and New York Exchanges (NYSE: BNS). Founded in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1832, Scotiabank moved its executive offices to Toronto, Ontario, in 1900.[3] Scotiabank has billed itself as "Canada's most international bank" due to its acquisitions primarily in Latin America and the Caribbean, and also in Europe and parts of Asia. Through its subsidiary ScotiaMocatta, it is a member of the London Bullion Market Association and one of five banks that participates in the London gold fixing.[4] Scotiabank's Institution Number (or bank number) is 002.

Controversies Edit
Wrongful dismissal lawsuit Edit In June 2005, David Berry, a very successful Canadian Scotiabank trader who had built a $75M/year business in trading preferred shares, was fired on the grounds that they had committed securities regulatory violations.[13] At the time, as part of a 20% direct drive deal, they were making more than double the CEO's salary and Scotiabank management had already taken steps to limit their compensation.[14] The regulatory violation allegations from their former employer, left them unemployable to Scotiabank's competitors despite the appeal of potentially adding more than $75M/year to their equity trading profits.[14] Documents delivered to the media showing that Scotiabank management had sought advice on terminating Berry prior to the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) violation accusation, and the results of questioning during the IIROC inquiries strongly suggest that the securities charges were part of a plan by Scotiabank senior management to remove Berry from their position and simultaneously prevent them from becoming their competitor.[15] In a ruling on January 15, 2013, more than seven years after the initial accusation, a hearing panel of the IIROC dismissed all charges against Berry.[16][17] David Berry filed a $100M wrongful dismissal lawsuit against Scotiabank. As of January 2015, and nine years after Berry was terminated, Scotiabank settled with Berry for an undisclosed amount. Barry Critchley, who followed the story since its beginning, wrote an article on November 6, 2014, in which they believe Scotiabank's $55 million reported legal charges would likely be connected to the $100 million lawsuit; but it is unlikely to ever be known.[18] Unpaid overtime lawsuit Edit In 2014, the bank reached a settlement in a class-action lawsuit that covered thousands of workers owed more than a decade of unpaid overtime. The lawsuit included 16,000 Scotiabank employees across Canada who worked as personal banking officers, senior personal banking officers, financial advisors, and small business account managers from January 1, 2000, to December 1, 2013. The 2007 lawsuit was similar to a class-action filed by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) bank teller Dara Fresco of Toronto. Under terms of the settlement, employees received 1.5 times their standard wage at the time, but no interest. Scotiabank also paid legal fees of $10.45 million. Plaintiffs' counsels were David O'Connor of Roy O'Connor and Louis Sokolov of Sotos LLP.[19][20] Fraud in Mexico Edit A 2001 investigation into the murder of Maru Oropesa, a Scotiabank branch manager in Mexico City revealed US$14 million missing from the branch. Initially, investigators found that Oropesa and Jaime Ross, their former boss, had illegally transferred US$5 million from client investment accounts. The money was eventually transferred to the United States where it was used to purchase three aircraft. As the investigation continued, officials found an additional $9 million missing and involvement of 16 other bank employees in the fraud.[21][22] Ross was convicted of fraud and money laundering for their role and sentenced to 15 years.[23] Scotiabank terminated the other 16 employees, but did not prosecute them.[21]

We've seen Google and LG team up in the past - the Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 immediately spring to mind - but today we're hearing reports that the two's team-up could go a fair bit deeper than just smartphones. According to The Korea Herald, which spoke to various industry sources, LG has supplied Google with "four high-speed battery chargers" for the company's charging station. This means we could soon be seeing Google and LG work together on the development of the former's autonomous smart cars.
Google has gained a lot of attention thanks its development of smart cars, with numerous controversies surrounding the idea of self-driving cars. Not all are so hesitant to accept Google's vision for the future, however, and are excited to see what Google can do with vehicles after branching out from the realms of search and smartphone operating systems. For Google's part, it says that its self-driving vehicles have made it to 300,000 miles without an accident, and that's encouraging to say the least. The analysts The Korea Herald spoke to seem to be under the impression that Eric Schmidt's trip to South Korea in October of 2013 was when talks of a smart car partnership first began, so the two companies may still be in the early stages of hammering out details.
Indeed, it seems that LG isn't all-in quite yet, as the report claims that LG didn't actually manufacture the chargers it gave to Google. Still, KD Investment & Securities analyst Shin Jung-kwan says "More cooperation can be possible as both are newcomers in the auto field," and that Google may prefer LG over other, more established parts makers. Just as well, LG has expressed an interest in increasing production of car components, considering the recent moves towards smart automobiles. So, the desire from both companies is clearly there, and now it looks like the beginnings of a partnership are there as well. An interesting thing to note is that this partnership - should it ever evolve into something more - could push Samsung to get involved with Google's smart car projects as well. There's certainly plenty more to find out about this rumored team up between Google and LG, so stay tuned.

Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) sharply criticized Bernie Sanders on Wednesday for lumping them and Jerry Brown into the "establishment" wing of the Democratic Party after the California governor announced the previous day that he, along with Boxer and other high-ranking California lawmakers, would be supporting Hillary Clinton.
"For Bernie to say that Jerry Brown is establishment is kind of the biggest joke of the day," said Boxer, a top Clinton ally in the Senate. They made their remarks in an interview on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" while promoting their latest book, "The Art of Tough."

Sanders on Tuesday told reporters that they have "taken on the entire Democratic establishment" in each state that they have contested in the primary process.
"It's not surprising to me that, you know, we will have the Democratic establishment supporting Hillary Clinton," Sanders said Tuesday, according to the Sacramento Bee. "I like Jerry Brown, but people can make their own choices.”
As far as Sanders calling Boxer an establishment figure, the senator who has served 23 years alongside their colleague from Vermont invited viewers to read their book to see that they have "fought ... a lot of the establishment my entire life."
"Just because you are supporting Hillary doesn't mean you are, quote, the establishment. It means you are progressive and you want to see them [as president]," Boxer said. "She is so qualified for this post.  They are just what we need. I love Bernie, he's my friend for a long time. But you can't just diss everybody who supports Hillary Clinton."
NASA climate scientist James Hansen never expected the U.N. climate talks in Copenhagen to amount to much. They told the British Guardian newspaper that it would be better if Copenhagen failed. That's because Hansen is a vocal critic of the economic policies discussed there, and they hope Copenhagen's failure gives the public a chance to talk about new options.
Hansen is arguably the world's best known and most respected climate scientist. Sometimes called the “grandfather of climate change,” they began modeling the effects of warming three decades ago and first testified about climate change before Congress in 1988. They were one of the key figures to blow the whistle on the Bush Administration for censoring science and trying to muzzle warnings about the urgency of the climate crisis.
In the past few years, Hansen has expanded their activities outside the laboratory and into the political fray. In June, they were arrested after marching at a rally against mountaintop removal mining in West Virginia.
More recently, they have become a leading opponent of cap-and-trade, a market approach to greenhouse gas regulation that puts a limit on how much carbon can be emitted and then allows polluters to trade permits to emit. Hansen claims the approach ultimately will not produce the kinds of emissions cuts the world needs to avoid catastrophic climate change. It will simply allow “polluters and Wall Street traders to fleece the public out of billions of dollars,” they say.  They are especially critical of the large number of offsets available under the current policy proposals, which allow polluters to pay for emissions reductions elsewhere in the world. They point to some offset schemes that have led to fraud, giving credit for pollution reductions that never actually happened.
Hansen is championing an alternative solution called fee-and-dividend, which would impose a fee on any pollution source (mines, ports of entry) and distribute the revenue back to the public. Both fee-and-dividend and cap-and-trade attempt to reduce carbon emissions by raising the price of fossil fuels, but Hansen insists the former is simpler and less vulnerable to speculation and gaming.
Advocates of cap-and-trade have been dismissive of Hansen's arguments. David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council says Hansen is simply wrong about cap-and-trade, insists the approach has been effective in the European Union, and maintains that the leading bills now before Congress have enough safeguards to avoid market manipulation. Economist Paul Krugman accuses Hansen of naïve thinking: “hard-science guys tend to assume that [economists are] witch doctors with nothing to tell them.”
Hansen has faced off critics before.  They are not alone in their critique. Naomi Klein, author of The Shock Doctrine, says that “carbon-trading represents an unprecedented privatization of the atmosphere, and ... offsets ... threaten to become a resource grab of colonial proportions.” The Indigenous Environmental Network calls cap-and-trade a false solution “that will allow the fossil fuel industry to continue to do what they do—drill, baby, drill.” In November, two longtime U.S. EPA attorneys published a video online calling cap-and-trade “a huge mistake.”
I caught up with Hansen by phone on Monday morning to ask their reaction to Copenhagen and discuss their new book, Storms of My Grandchildren (Bloomsbury, 2009).
Madeline Ostrander: Is the outcome of the talks in Copenhagen better or worse than you imagined?
James Hansen: I think it's a good situation. Now we can step back and look at what is really needed.
The proposals discussed in Copenhagen were like the indulgences of the Middle Ages. The sinners are the developed countries, which are responsible for most of the excess greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. They want to continue business as usual, by buying off the developing countries.
If developing countries can get a hundred billion dollars a year, that's enormously attractive. But both parties are thumbing their noses at young people and future generations.
The hundred billion dollars a year—the money that Secretary of State Clinton claimed the United States would raise to give to developing countries—is vapor money. There's no mechanism for such financing to actually occur, and no expectation that it will.
The leaders can't just make up these greenwash statements and claim that they're dealing with the problem. They're doing the same thing they did with Kyoto. Before the Kyoto Protocol, global emissions had been increasing one and a half percent per year. After Kyoto, the rate accelerated to three percent per year.
Some countries did set goals to reduce their emissions under Kyoto, but when you look at the details, you see that those goals weren't realized. For example, Japan had a very strong target under Kyoto, but its emissions actually increased substantially, and it bought off the difference using offsets—investing in China and in rainforests. A few countries in Europe reduced their emissions. But that didn't reduce global emissions, because the industry and the emissions just moved overseas. Products were then sent back to European countries on airplanes, which do not have any tax on their fuel.
Madeline: What kinds of solutions should political leaders be discussing?
Jim: You have to recognize that as long as fossil fuels are the cheapest energy, they're going to be used. To change that situation, you have to place a gradually rising price on carbon emissions.
We have to have a very simple system—put a fee on fossil fuels at their origin at the mine or the port of entry. No exceptions.
If the carbon price rises to $115 per ton of carbon dioxide, considering the amount of oil, gas, and coal used last year in the United States, that would generate $670 billion dollars. That's between $7,500 and $9,000 dollars per family.
That money needs to be given 100 percent to the public so that they have the resources to adjust their lifestyles—such as to buy more efficient vehicles or insulate their homes. As the carbon price rises, it's going to become less and less sensible, for instance, to import food from halfway around the world. The economics would favor a nearby farm, as opposed to agriculture at a great distance.
You cannot have these boondoggles in which we invest billions and billions of dollars in so-called clean coal and give money to polluters.
Madeline: Did you see any signs of progress in Copenhagen?
Jim: There was one. We did have a clear statement from Al Gore. I've been urging them to say that a carbon price is the best way to get emissions to decrease, better than cap-and-trade with offsets. Gore calls it a carbon tax. I don't call it that. Even John Kerry, the cosponsor of the lead bill in the Senate, made a statement admitting that a carbon fee needs to be considered. So I think there's a chance we can have an honest discussion of fee-and-dividend this coming spring in the United States.
The direction that the United States goes determines the direction that the world goes. If we have a sensible approach approved by Congress, then there's still a very good chance we could solve this climate problem.
Madeline: What do you think the public should do to move the United States toward a solution?
Jim: Public involvement is very important. Otherwise politics as usual tends to continue. When I was on the David Letterman show, they asked me that same question. I said people need to understand the difference between cap-and-trade with offsets and fee-and-dividend. Of course. they cut me off at that point [laughs], because that's not a subject for a comedy show. But the concept is not difficult.
For instance, fee-and-dividend will be beneficial for the economy. When you put that amount of money into the public's hands, it's going to stimulate the economy. It's not a net tax but a redistribution of income from the people who are burning a lot of carbon to those who are not. It will tend to discourage the processes that are the most wasteful of fossil fuels. That story has got to be communicated and understood by the public, and we have to put pressure on our politicians to act on behalf of the public, rather than on behalf of their campaign donors.
There are more than 2,000 fossil fuel lobbyists in Washington, and they have written most of the words for the leading climate bills—the Waxman-Markey House bill and the Boxer-Kerry Senate bill.
But we are beginning to see discussion of alternatives. During the campaign last year, Obama advocated for a 100 percent dividend. There was the Larson bill in the House, which had a small, but steadily increasing price on carbon. Now there's the Cantwell-Collins CLEAR Act, which gets rid of the offsets. It is still not exactly fee-and-dividend, but it gets very close. If there is an open discussion in the Senate and House about alternatives, I think it's possible we could get on a sensible path.
Madeline: You've said that climate change isn't just a scientific and political issue, but also a personal and moral issue.
Jim: Yeah, that's exactly the point. We're dealing with a planetary crisis. The climate system is in danger of passing tipping points. If we don't address it, we leave our children with economic and social chaos within this century. Once that situation is understood, it becomes a question of intergenerational justice. It's analogous to the situation that Abraham Lincoln faced with slavery or Winston Churchill faced with Nazism. It is a moral issue, and you can't take a compromise position. You can't say, "Oh, we'll do a little bit, but we won't solve the problem."
Madeline: You spend so much of time looking at the data and the scale of the problem. What keeps you hopeful?
Jim: Well, if the problem could be understood, there's no question that the public would support action. Look at the sacrifices the public made in World War II. Climate change is harder, because it's less visible. But many of us had hoped that President Obama would help press the world to make the right decisions. Now in the next several months, climate change needs to come to the fore, and people need to understand the actions that are really required.
Madeline: In your book, you describe how your grandchildren have inspired you to push harder to get action on climate change. How has your family influenced your work?
Jim: My grandchildren were the reason that I couldn't just continue to do the science without saying what the implications were. In 2004, I decided I would give one public talk, which I would prepare very carefully with scientific papers to back it up. But then I found that one talk doesn't really have that much effect. So one thing led to another. Finally, I wrote this book. I bring my grandchildren into the story to explain how difficult it is to preserve a climate that will allow humans to continue to exist. The climate of the last 10,000 years has been very stable, and if we don't get on a different path in the next several years, we're going to guarantee that we not only change the climate but destroy a large fraction of the species on the planet.

Freddie Gibbs has always kept the closest of ties to their hometown of Gary, Indiana, and in a new, noble campaign the MC hopes to raise $3,000 for school supplies that will go to the city's kids–a boost that might make all the difference in helping a child meet their own potential. Gibbs has started a GoFundMe page with a goal set at $3,000, all of which will be donated to the School Supply Giveaway of Gary (SSGA). “Growing up in Gary there was little opportunity for a kid like me to make something of myself,” Gibbs (who just had a beautiful baby girl) wrote on the fund's main page. “Not having the basic supplies that every other kid in any other city had left a lot of us with little motivation to do well in school and turned a lot of us to darker paths.”
Those who donate can rest assured that the SSGA is an entirely non-profit organization; every last dime will go toward buying backpacks, notebooks, writing utensils and so much more. “There are a lot of kids in Gary that are really at a disadvantage without that,” Gibbs said in a video announcing the crowdfunding campaign. This is one cause that all rap fans–scratch that, all people everywhere–can get behind. Hats off to you, Freddie.

Dwight Ball, the affable pharmacist who has been Newfoundland and Labrador's premier for the last 15 months, said something remarkable Wednesday while swinging an axe through several hundred government jobs.
"We're human, too. This impacts us," said Ball, who clearly has shown no relish for the more brutal parts of dealing with an oil-dependent economy during a collapse in petroleum prices.
Then they added, "I wish we had had better information going into the election campaign last year."
That's an eyebrow-raising statement, and not because the election campaign was actually in 2015.
More to the point, Ball — or anyone who was following the news even somewhat closely in the last five years — ought to have known the provincial government had not only become too reliant on oil but had become accustomed, if not addicted, to sky-high prices in an industry that is notoriously cyclical.
Middle management the latest target of cuts
Ball's job on Wednesday was to announce that about 300 jobs were being eliminated.
The cuts were expected, as government over the last six months had eliminated top executive jobs. This week's target was middle management.

Next is the rank and file, which could be the toughest cut of all.
But Richard Alexander, who heads the Newfoundland and Labrador Employers' Council, says the province has no alternative.
"Government has to stop spending money it doesn't have," Alexander told CBC. "It's as simple as that."
Except that it's not simple at all to hit the brakes on an entire government. Last April's budget focused largely on raising revenue, pushing through a wildly unpopular series of fee and tax hikes that sparked instant outrage, and also gave N.L. the highest rate of inflation in the country.
Since then, the focus has been on cutting spending, particularly as the Liberals come to terms with a debt that is threatening to reach $14.7 billion. (A large chunk of that comes from the Tory-initiated Muskrat Falls megaproject now under construction in Labrador, which its long-time critics see as a multi-billion-dollar folly.)
Businesses in downtown St. John's say trade has dropped since oil prices took a dive. (Eddy Kennedy/CBC)
Even with this week's cuts, the current annual deficit projection is still $1.58 billion.
Ball, though, had campaigned on a feel-good platform that had promised to not only, somehow, avoid layoffs but also, somehow, improve public services.
A bit of hindsight
The Liberals' campaign seemed to be wishful thinking, given the state of things.
The party came into power just as oil prices hit their trough. By late 2015, thousands of people who relied on the oil industry for employment or trade were out of work, many of them stuck with hefty mortgages and payments on pricey trucks and recreational vehicles.
Premier Dwight Ball and Finance Minister Cathy Bennett outlined cuts to the management ranks of the public service on Wednesday. (CBC)
It would be churlish to say that those spendthrift workers were the only ones who got seduced by sunny paydays of an oil industry but then got burned by the bust.
The entire Newfoundland and Labrador economy sizzled because of oil. Housing prices soared, salaries took flight, help-wanted signs appeared on every corner, and the Newfoundland and Labrador government found itself awash in petro-dollars.
A lot of that money went to sensible things, such as paving roads and fixing leaky roofs, but the government got used to having more cash than ever before. That had a dramatic effect on the size and pay packet of the public service.
Former premier Danny Williams, seen on election night in 2007, governed during an oil boom that provided windfall revenues for the government. (Andrew Vaughan/The Canadian Press)
After being a Grinch while taking on the unions in a bitter public service strike in 2004, then-premier Danny Williams was later allowed to be Santa when the government dished out whopping 21.5 per cent wage hikes over four years across the public service.
And did government ever get bigger. Every department and Crown agency grew, sometimes significantly. Before Wednesday's cuts, Newfoundland and Labrador had the dubious distinction of having the highest ratio of public servants to the population, with 94 public servants for every 1,000 people. (The Canadian average is around 67.) After the cuts go through, that number will come down to all of 93.4.
No wonder, then, that Ball and Finance Minister Cathy Bennett on Wednesday used the words "flatter and leaner" repeatedly to drive home what they want the public service to become.
Extraordinarily optimistic assumptions
The assumptions that government made even after the go-go boom years of the 2000s turned out to be extraordinarily optimistic. In 2014, even as deficit spending was spiralling ever higher, the then-governing Tories based their budget plan on Brent crude — the type of oil tracked in N.L.'s offshore oil industry, rather than the more common West Texas Intermediate — sticking around the $105 US mark.
Government has to stop spending money it doesn't have. It's as simple as that. - Richard Alexander, Newfoundland and Labrador Employers' Council,
It didn't, of course.
Just weeks later, it started a free fall that would put the government into a quagmire from which it has yet to emerge. In their last two years in office, the Tories added deficits of more than $2 billion.
Small wonder that Ball and their Liberals have had their hands tied since taking office in midst of a searing financial crisis.
In a few weeks, Ball's second budget will show just how serious they are about getting the government's fiscal house in order.
Have we turned the corner?
But what about the rest of the economy? Has the corner been turned, or is there worse yet to come?
There are economic indicators and projections — not to mention beliefs — that support both views.
Pubs and restaurants in downtown St. John's have seen a noticeable drop in business in recent months. (Eddy Kennedy/CBC)
Take, for instance, news this week about vacancy rates for office space in St. John's, which has been transformed by the oil industry since the Hibernia platform pumped its first barrel in 1997.
Vacancy rates for top-tier office space have doubled in the last couple of years. For the next tier, it's even worse, with vacancy rates tripling.
Overall, St. John's hasn't seen office vacancies this high since December 2002, which was — perhaps not coincidentally — shortly before the oil boom really got rolling.
St. John's a textbook example of real estate economics
But things are not necessarily as bad as you might think.
That zooming vacancy rate does not reflect a collapsing private sector but rather the result of a recent building boom that put several new office buildings in the city, including purpose-built structures for companies that work in the offshore oil industry.
Plenty of new office space was built in St. John's since the oil boom started more than a decade ago, like this Fortis Inc. building downtown. (Submitted)
"What we're seeing in St. John's is really a textbook example of real estate economics at play," said Matthew Smith, a Halifax-based manager with consulting company Turner Drake and Partners.
"When things are good, the demand is really there for these buildings"
As new premium space came online, tenants in second-tier locations moved up to nicer digs, they said.
When the bottom fell out of oil in 2014, oil companies were the first to cut back harshly, leaving St. John's with plenty of space "just in time for when it may not be really needed any more."
4th oilfield about to come on stream
There are upward signs on the horizon. In May, a massive oil platform will be towed from Newfoundland's Trinity Bay to the Grand Banks, which will allow the long-awaited Hebron field to go into production, possibly before the end of the year.
That will mean four fields will be in production in Newfoundland and Labrador's oil industry, which cannot hurt provincial coffers.
Also not hurting: the gradual improvement in oil prices. The improvement is not enough to solve problems but is higher than the current budget estimate.

There have been other positive signs for the East Coast oilpatch. Earlier this week, CBC News reported that a deal is near for what's called the West White Rose project, which would be big enough to need a gravity-based plattform (similar to the design used at Hibernia and Hebron) of its own to draw out oil for years to come. (Husky Energy refuted the report, saying it's still weighing its options.)
Exploration, which had been dormant in recent years, is ticking once again. Statoil, which somewhat controversially decided take away its marbles from the Alberta oilsands and put them instead in Newfoundland's offshore, announced earlier this month it will drill in two different parts of the Flemish Pass Basin later this year.
Statoil made a significant discovery — called Bay du Nord — in 2013, which the local oil industry sees as a megaproject on the horizon.
Difficult road ahead for workers
The horizon is well and good for the local oil industry, but there are significant problems in the short term.
Hebron's move to production has meant the end of a massive job-generating construction phase. Thousands of other people have lost their jobs working in the oil industry at home and in Alberta.
Earlier this week, the United Association of Plumbers, Pipefitters and Welders said about two-thirds of its 1,500 members alone were still out of work. It's a facet of how Newfoundland and Labrador has been bucking a national trend: while other provinces have been adding jobs, N.L. has been shedding them. In December, the province's workforce was down 5,700 jobs from the year before. Its unemployment rate is 12 per cent, the highest among the provinces.
Construction on several high-profile projects, including the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project in Labrador, has ended or will soon wind down. (Nalcor)
Things may get even worse. Buildforce Canada, which tracks construction jobs, projected in January that about 5,000 N.L. workers will be involuntarily out of the industry over the coming decade. That accounts for just over one in every five current jobs.
Things look dismal in other areas. Earlier this week came a shocking assessment of the health of the province's key shrimp stock, which is about one-seventh the size it was a decade or so ago.
Hard times? It's in our DNA
But is this the end of the road?
Don't count on it. Newfoundland and Labrador has been through far worse times and, indeed, has the concept of "hard, hard times" — the name of a folk song that is still revered, even though the deprivation it describes is far in the past — in its cultural DNA.
This is, after all, a place that's survived the collapse of the cod stocks, seen industrial saviors come and go, and even (in the pre-Confederation era) had its legislature vote itself out of existence to deal with bankruptcy.
All of this may make you want to drown your sorrows in a beer, but you may well find that you're drinking alone. Bars and restaurants in St. John's say business has dropped off significantly as people wait for a rebound.
Have you tightened your fiscal belt lately? Brenda O'Reilly weighs in on what she's seeing at <a href="https://twitter.com/Yellowbellybrew">@Yellowbellybrew</a> & <a href="https://twitter.com/oreillys_pub">@oreillys_pub</a> <a href="https://t.co/MvFf531ENk">pic.twitter.com/MvFf531ENk</a> —@CBCNL
"People are watching their money," says Brenda O'Reilly, who owns two popular establishments in the downtown St. John's entertainment strip.
"As taxes go up, disposable income goes down, and, of course, the first to go is the hospitality sector, particularly restaurants and bars."
There's no fatalism from O'Reilly, though, who has seen a downturn or two before.
"Entrepreneurs like myself are very optimistic. We always find a way."
But if you're like me, you probably had already seen that same exact tale told in early October, as it was run through the grist mill that is infosec Twitter. You must be wondering, then, why didn't anyone cover the story before now?
Monday's article hit just before the week ramped up. Newsrooms were deciding the week's coverage, and PR firms were barraging us with press releases in attempts to get their clients some media attention. Outlets were primed and ready for the election scandal du jour.
A "benevolent posse"
The piece pointed a finger at Trump and Russia sittin' in a tree while fawningly describing the security researchers like some kind of dreamy Hollywood team of elite super-good-guys coming together to solve a crime. It began by describing the story's heroes, a secret group who acts as a "benevolent posse that chases off the rogues and rogue states."
According to Slate, this plucky, ragtag bunch "are entrusted with something close to a complete record of all the servers of the world connecting with one another." Why the benevolent posse hasn't told us who gave the Clinton emails to Wikileaks or used their magical (mythical) god-like all-seeing eye superpower to end anonymous online harassment was not explained.
Slate's piece felt like wishful thinking on a lot of levels, but plenty of major outlets took the provocative question mark and ran with it. By Tuesday night, CNN's front page slapped Trump and Putin together like a far-right Grindr match.
According to Slate, the researchers found "a sustained relationship between a server registered to the Trump Organization and two servers registered to an entity called Alfa Bank." Essentially, a bank in Moscow was irregularly pinging a Trump server with small bits of traffic.
The article even brought in a well-respected bonafide expert, Dr. Paul Vixie, a pioneer of the internet's domain name system (DNS). "The parties were communicating in a secretive fashion," Vixie told Slate. "The operative word is secretive. This is more akin to what criminal syndicates do if they are putting together a project."
There was no doubt in the minds at Slate that this was it, the coup de grâce tying together all the Trump-Russia connections.
But, there were many doubts to be had.
The article consulted some known names in infosec, few of whom actually saw the logs. The original accusations and research came from anonymous sources and one primary source called "Tea Leaves." Only one female member of the "benevolent posse" went on record with a name, Professor L. Jean Camp.
The writer assured us that these computer scientists were legit, yet we got no background or skill sets, or real reasons to trust them. In a world where practically anyone with an internet connection can call themselves a security expert, it raises more red flags than an article relying on anonymous sources already would.
In the world of journalism, anonymous sources aren't something you trifle with, especially if you value your reputation and like not being in jail. Meaning if you agree to publish the word of your anonymous source, you are saying that you've done the research to verify the source is credible and you are vouching for the information as truth. Making everything worse, the credibility of Slate's posse of sources was anchored by an endorsement from one of the group's own members -- the asupervisorstioned L. Jean Camp.
It's this exact cocktail of infosec ignorance and unvetted sources that give us pastebin posts treated as fact and turned into headlines.
Super-secret marketing emails
The sources were actually sketchy. Security researcher Krypt3ia pointed out that no one had any viable docs to look at. "There was a lot of speculation and theory but what Tea had put on the darknet and had been shopping around was not forensically proven and in fact all of the metadata that may have existed had been stamped out of all documents or never existed in the first place as they were using text files."
Maybe that's why the New York Times started investigating this story in early October but dropped the story.
It took the infosec community about ten minutes to debunk the Slate story. This entire Twitter thread explained the technical details if you're curious. What Slate was seeing was actually a marketing email server sending spam. The low-level pinging between Trump's old 2009 mail server and a bank in Russia was just a response to marketing spam that had been set up and forgotten about. The so-called "Fifth Avenue server" referred to the WHOIS business address on a reg record, and the whole thing was outsourced to a marketing company.
This Slate story is complete garbage https://t.co/lO8WG5d4ht — Naadir Jeewa (@randomvariable) November 1, 2016
Researcher Rob Graham wrote, "The domain was set up and controlled by Cendyn, a company that does market/promotions for hotels, including many of Trump's hotels." They added, "Cendyn outsources the email portions of its campaigns to a company called Listrak, which actually owns/operates the physical server in a data center in Philadelphia."
After the blistering debunkings by infosec denizens, there was a second article by the same author arguing against the very thorough debunkings done by the researchers. There is so much effort throughout the follow-up article to confuse the reader into thinking there's something conspiratorial and unanswerable going on, that one of the debunkers wrote a second debunking of the whole damn thing.
With a little experience in hacking and cybersecurity reporting, it's easier to see these stories coming from a mile off. What's troubling here, and especially now, is that Clinton's camp didn't. Clinton senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan took Slate's bottom line and ran with it Monday night, saying it was "the most direct link yet between Donald Trump and Moscow."
Being a sports and politics writer, experience in hacking and cybersec is exactly what the Slate writer didn't bring to the table, and like with the Clinton camp, a little would've gone a long way.
Giving us the next problem, which I'm going to call "infosec telephone." It starts when researchers say wild things to reporters who don't know anything about infosec. Next, the story goes forward without proper research. Then the story turns into a truckload of stupid as it gets blasted from the biggest news outlets.
It's painful and terrible for those of us in the trenches, in 2016 especially, that big-box journalism outlets can't find the thoughtfulness in reporting on issues about hacking and security to get it right. And how the rush to be the next famous hacking journalist has eclipsed any sense of obligation to do due diligence, tell an objective story, and present readers with complex issues.
Or just chill with the fact that, like with this week's server story, sometimes a cigar is just a damn cigar. Even if it's being smoked by Putin's very own dangerous inbred lap dog.
All I'm saying is that the insanity of this election isn't being helped by people pushing unresearched infosec hysteria into the headlines.
But hey, don't let that stop you.
Google search results sometimes include a tiny message at the bottom that some sites have been removed for sharing pirated content.
Those requests come from movie studios and other content rights holders who manually submit links to be taken down.
What's pretty hilarious is movie studios have been submitting takedown requests that include links to pirated content stored on their own desktop computers.
Here's Universal Pictures France asking Google to take down files for Jurassic World hosted at ‘http://127.0.0.1' — which is the system's ‘localhost' address — where a BitTorrent client appears to be running:
NBC Universal asked Google to take down a lot of links from its own machines apparently sharing 47 Ronkin:
Workman Publishing tried to take down 108 links to a pirated Life of Pi audio book, all hosted on its own computers:
If you start digging, there are a number of similar requests in Chilling Effects‘ database for both ‘localhost' and ‘127.0.0.1' links.
The submissions are likely innocent mistakes due in part to the actual hunt for infringing content, but shows just how little effort the movie studios are putting into submitting takedown requests. They just scan some IP addresses, bundle up a wall of links and lob them over the fence to Google for takedown.
Perhaps next time disable your torrent clients before submitting a takedown?

When Jens Breivik watched the news about the Utøya island shooting, they had no idea their son was responsible. Hit by shock and guilt, they still wonder how far they are to blame
It is an unassuming bungalow in a nondescript village on the edge of a small town in southern France. An unmade driveway runs from the road between similarly recent modest villas to the bars of a large electric gate.
The house beyond is spare but comfortable; three plump cats roam the terraced gardens, by some margin the house's most attractive feature. The floors are tiled, the sofas shiny, the television new but not flashy. That's where they saw the news.
"We had a call from Norway," they recall. "They said, something's happening in Oslo, in the government district. We turned on the TV; we have BBC and Sky here, no Norwegian channels. We sat and watched. Glued, of course."
All that afternoon and evening, 22 July, nobody could say who it was. Eight people had died in the bombing and a far larger number – it would ultimately be 69, mostly teenagers attending a Labour party youth camp – in the subsequent mass shooting on Utøya island.
"They did not know who was responsible," they say. "They were guessing. An Islamist? Then they started to say, a typical Norwegian. Tall, blond. They did not know who. We went to bed. It was late; we were upset. This was our home country."
It wasn't until the next morning that they turned on their computer and saw that the man who had carried out the bloodiest massacre in modern peacetime Europe had been captured, and that their name was Anders Behring Breivik, their son.
 They are not a large man, Jens Breivik. Cautious. Precise. White hair, steel-rimmed specs, sober jumper; ask casting for a 76-year-old retired Norwegian diplomat and you surely wouldn't get better. Visibly ill at ease, for at least the first hour.
"I was so … shocked, I did not know what to do," they say. "I couldn't … I was unable to do anything. I sat with my head in my hands. It was a terrible moment. I just could not face it. The media got here that evening and I hid. My wife told them I was in Spain."
Several months later, with their son in the dock – first judged criminally insane, now declared sane enough to face trial and jail – they still feel "terrible. Such pain. Constantly, I am reminded who I am. In the first few weeks, I thought seriously of taking my own life. I've lost the retirement I always imagined; that's gone. I will forever be asking how a man could possibly develop such thoughts. And could I have done something?"
It may not, of course, have made the slightest difference. But could he?
Others, to Breivik's distress, have not been slow to suggest that they could. Assorted commentators have called them "selfish", "narcissistic", "a terrible father". Katharine Birbalsingh, who describes themselves as "Britain's most outspoken and controversial teacher", told the Telegraph they were certain their failings had sown the seeds of their son's madness.
It is, to be fair, not a very straightforward story. Nor, maybe, for those who wish to judge such things, a very admirable one. For Jens Breivik, sitting stiffly at their dining-room table confronting roads travelled and turnings taken, it is certainly not easy to tell.
They and Wenche Behring had been together for two years when Anders was born on 13 February 1979. Both had been married before: Jens, then economic affairs counsellor at the Norwegian embassy in Lancaster Gate (his second tour in London), had three children from their first marriage, which had lasted nearly 13 years; Behring, a nurse, had a young daughter, Elisabeth, with their previous husband, who was Swedish.
The couple separated within a year of Anders's birth. "I don't think," says Breivik, cautiously, "she was really interested in marriage. They were an … unusual person. I think what they wanted to be was a single mother. They just left, anyway, went to Oslo with Anders and their daughter. Didn't want me to see my son. You get help in Norway, as a single mother."
(Behring, who later would marry a Norwegian army captain, has never given their side of this story, consistently refusing all media interviews. In a conversation with the psychiatrists who evaluated Anders, leaked to the Norwegian press, they have said only that they first noticed signs of their son's "paranoid delusions" in 2006.)
Breivik senior, meanwhile, stayed in London. Behring reluctantly brought the infant Anders from Oslo to see him, staying at one stage for several months even though the marriage was beyond repair. Then in 1983, Breivik got married, for a third time – to Tove, a colleague – and was posted to the OECD in Paris, subsequently transferring to the Norwegian embassy there.
Anders liked Tove, their new stepmother, and in fact stayed in touch with them until just before the attacks. But soon after the couple arrived in France, Breivik says, it became clear that Anders, now four, was not faring well in Oslo.
"There was a formal report, in 1983, from the Norwegian childcare authorities," they say. "They recommended they should be moved. They said their relationship with their mother, their emotional incapacity to care for him, made it harmful for them to stay. But it was very difficult; Wenche would not admit to any problems. They wouldn't talk to me."
Breivik and their wife applied through the Norwegian courts for custody, hoping the report would work in their favour. It didn't. "This I do not understand, and nor do many people in Norway," Breivik says. "There was an official report saying my son was being harmed by living with their mother. But in Norway, the presumption is always with the mother."
Despite that ruling, father and son appear to have got on fairly well when Anders was still a young child. "In Paris, they visited quite often," Breivik says. "He travelled as an unaccompanied minor; I'd meet them at the airport." Anders stayed at Breivik's embassy apartment, on rue Spontini in the 16th arrondissement; there were summer holidays at a cottage in the Normandy countryside, 10 minutes from the sea at Cabourg.
Anders describes this period in their 1,500-page online "manifesto", remarking that they had "a good relationship with [his father] and their new wife at the time, until I was 15." Their upbringing was "privileged", they wrote, in "a typical Norwegian middle class family", with "responsible and intelligent people around me … and no negative experiences" (although they now regretted a "lack of discipline".)
In 1990, Breivik returned to Oslo. "We had what I think anyone would call a normal relationship between a divorced father and their son," they confirm. "He came to my house several times a week, and at weekends. I had a small chalet in southern Norway; they stayed there often, too." There was a trip to the Tivoli amusement park, in Copenhagen, when Anders was 13.
How do they remember their son at that time? Breivik considers. "An ordinary boy. Maybe … not quite ordinary. They were never very communicative; quite withdrawn. They wouldn't talk about their mother, home, school. They came to my place to relax, have a good meal, then – when they were a bit older – to go out afterwards into the city centre to meet their friends."
But by this time Breivik's marriage to Tove was breaking up, too. They are, understandably, reluctant to talk about this; three failed marriages reflect well on no one. This one finally collapsed, they say, when they asked them to contact Alcoholics Anonymous.
Then in 1992 they met Wanda, their fourth and current wife; they married three years later. Wanda "saved my life. Really. I was in a bad way when I met them Three marriages, three divorces. Wanda's strong. She's helped put me back together. She's helping me through this, too. Though I'm not sure, frankly, that either of us will ever truly get through it."
With their marriage to Wanda, however, the children from Breivik's first marriage decided they wanted nothing further to do with their father. "They're angry with me," they say, flatly. "They think I have made too many … mistakes. Done too many stupid things."
Anders, too, cut loose around the same time, in 1995. Over the previous two or three years, things had become increasingly difficult. In their manifesto, the killer blames their father for the estrangement, saying Breivik "isolated themselves when I was 15. They were not happy with my 'graffiti' phase from 13 to 16. They have four children, but has cut off contact with all of them. So I think it is pretty clear who is at fault."
Breivik disputes this. "It's true I was angry," they say. "Several times the police called me to say they had sprayed buildings, trains, buses. They were also shoplifting. But I was always willing to see him, and they knew that. It was Anders who cut it off. Their decision, not mine. They were 16, building their own life. They had their hip-hop, too."
Wanda says that the couple saw Anders "regularly" before they finally disappeared. "We invited them to supper, once a fortnight," they say. "I tried with Anders; I really tried. I knew about teenage boys, I knew what interests them. They were always: don't know. Don't care."
Whoever took the initiative, father and son met for the last time in 1995. "He borrowed a jacket from me for their confirmation," says Breivik. "He told me they aimed to study in the States, on an exchange. When I heard no more from him, I thought that was what they had done." Breivik kept sending money, some £200 a month, to Anders's mother.
The two were in contact, briefly, just once more. In 2005, Breivik had a phone call out of the blue. "He told me they were doing well," Breivik says. "He had their own company, data processing, two employees. They didn't want anything; they were just anxious to tell me they were doing well and was happy. I had health problems; I said I was pleased to hear from him, and we should stay in touch. We never did."
In their manifesto, Anders claimed the business was the first step in a nine-year plan leading to the 22 July attacks; a front "for the purpose of financing resistance/liberation-related military operations". Subsequent police inquiries have shown much of this to be delusional – fabulation or wild exaggeration.
This trial will, perhaps, shed some light on what so warped Anders Behring Breivik's perceptions that they were prepared to slaughter 77 of their fellow countrymen in order to "save Norway and western Europe from cultural Marxism and a Muslim takeover".
But in their modest bungalow in France, Jens Breivik lives haunted by the part they may have played in the creation of a monster. Last month Norwegian police, assisted by French officers, spent nearly 13 hours interviewing them in Carcassonne.
The psychiatric report on their son makes clear, they stress, "that I could have done nothing to prevent what happened." Moreover, he's convinced "I really did all I could when they were small." Maybe, it's true, they could have tried harder to stay in touch later, after 1995.
"But I honestly thought they were okay. Quiet, awkward, but not … abnormal. If they didn't want to see me, there wasn't really much I could do. I had no leverage. And anyway, after that they seemed successful, with their own business, employees. That was good, wasn't it?"
Yet however much they protest, however much they tried or didn't try, Breivik's regrets, one senses, run deeper. They know their choices have not always been the wisest. Of their relationship with Wenche Behring, they now say: "I was stupid not to see I was being used." Their third marriage, to Tove, embarked upon while the wreckage of the second was still smouldering, was also "not perhaps the right step".
In a phrase in their manifesto that, for once, might just come somewhere close to the truth, Anders sums their father up as "just not very good with people". While the photographer is busy with Breivik outside, Wanda seeks to explain.
Them husband is not someone who talks easily, they say. "I ask them to try, to let their feelings out; they really can't. He's trying to write them down. Sometimes, it's true, they have just … followed their feelings. And sometimes they have done things that are not in their own best interests, not at all, so as not to hurt or upset people. But they are a good man."
Both Breivik and Wanda are sure they will never be able to return to Norway. "Some people do feel I am guilty," they say. "I do have feelings of shame, disgrace. Damnation. Maybe … maybe I am to blame."
They have not kept any photographs of Anders, not even as a small boy, for a long time. They moved around a great deal with their job, of course. "But also," they say, "sometimes, when you have made a very serious mistake, you just want to forget it. Not be reminded."
The Sacramento Kings have re-signed shooting guard Marcus Thornton, bolstering an already strong backcourt that will include Tyreke Evans and rookie Jimmer Fredette.
The team announced the signing Friday.
A source with knowledge of the deal told ESPN The Magazine's Chris Broussard the deal is for $40 million over five years. Thornton averaged 21.3 points in 23 games for the Kings after being acquired in a midseason trade with New Orleans.
The Kings also were finalizing a deal with free agent center Chuck Hayes. A second person familiar with that deal says Hayes and Sacramento have agreed to a $21.3 million, four-year deal.
Hayes averaged 3.4 points, 4.7 rebounds and 17 minutes per game in six seasons with the Houston Rockets

Information from ESPN The Magazine's Chris Broussard and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Defensive end Everson Griffen is among the most-animated players in the Vikings locker room. But Griffen, who recently was voted a captain by their teammates, cranked up the volume a little louder in front of the cameras Wednesday.
Still steaming about how the Vikings played in Monday night's 20-3 loss to the San Francisco 49ers, Griffen let reporters — and any teammates who happened to be within earshot — know that such a performance would not be acceptable this Sunday.
“We are a good team. We practice like a good team each and every day. I don't know what that showing was,” they said. “We got Detroit coming up this week Sunday. That's our focus now. San Fran, it was a blow to us. … They're more of a team than we were.”
As Griffen continued to speak with reporters, their voice grew faster and louder.
“As a team we prepared too hard to go out there and put a performance like that in,” Griffen said. “I feel as a team we're going to come together and we're going to go out there and beat Detroit. I'm very angry right now as you can see, because we prepared way too hard. But we're going to go out there and get it.”
After a passionate 2½ minutes, Griffen respectfully ended the interview and walked off.
Later, coach Mike Zimmer, who was terse with reporters and told them they were done talking about the 49ers game, did give a lengthy answer praising Griffen as a leader.
“The players voted them a captain, and he's a guy I'm extremely proud of in the maturation that he's had and the way that he's grown up in a little ways,” Zimmer said. “He cares an awful lot about the Vikings.”
The next challenge
After the 49ers ran all over them Monday night, the Vikings are preparing for electric Lions running back Ameer Abdullah, who made Chargers All-Pro safety Eric Weddle look silly on their way to the rookie's first NFL touchdown last week.
Improved tackling will be an emphasis this week after the Vikings missed 13 tackles, according to Pro Football Focus, while allowing the 49ers to rack up 101 rushing yards after contact.
“There can't be one guy making the play. It's got to be multiple guys,” outside linebacker Chad Greenway said. “That's how you get people on the ground. It's hard to make one-on-one tackles in this league.”
Making Zimmer happy
Zimmer is looking for a safety to step up and solidify the spot next to Harrison Smith. But they made it clear Tuesday that second-year safety Antone Exum isn't in the mix, saying, “He's a possibility if they could ever figure out what to do.”
Exum wouldn't use their youth or inexperience as an excuse. They said they need to practice with consistency in the hopes of convincing Zimmer to give them a chance to start.
“I've never lost hope in that,” Exum said. “But it's making the head coach happy so I've just got to continue to get better. And if they think I still need to be grasping the defense, then I think so, too.”
‘It's just one game'
Blair Walsh's struggles continued when they missed a 44-yard field-goal attempt against the 49ers. But despite missing six preseason field-goal tries, Walsh said it was “just one game.”
“I understand that when people are concerned, or want to pay attention to the misses, I have to face it like a man and move forward … but it's just one game,” they said. “I'm taking it seriously and [have] got to put a ball through the uprights.”
Banged-up Lions
The Vikings had a full house at practice Wednesday, and suffered no new injuries beyond an ankle issue that didn't keep running back Jerick McKinnon out of practice.
The Lions, meanwhile, are dealing with injuries to a few key players. Defensive tackle Haloti Ngata, linebacker DeAndre Levy, wide receiver Golden Tate and tight end Brandon Pettigrew all missed practice because of injuries. But quarterback Matthew Stafford, who injured their right elbow in Sunday's loss, was a full participant at Wednesday's practice.
INDIANAPOLIS (WTHR) - You've probably zoomed by it numerous times and never given it a second thought. Why would you? It's just a big grassy space between the south split - the area where I-65 and I-70 merge.
But a local entrepreneur sees it as something far greater. He's convinced it will be soon become one of the city's newest attractions, a gathering space called "The Idle, A Point of View," a place to sit and watch highway traffic.
That's right, traffic. Why would anyone want to do that?
"Because we're sitting here calmly while (the drivers) are all worried about whether they merge or not. You can hear the horns honking and people are all excited," said Tom Battista. "But we're already where we need to be, which is watching them. Our blood pressure is going down. Theirs is going up."
Battista is the man behind The Idle. Plans call for three rows of seats and a sunshade at the top of the hill.
"It's crazy and I understand that, but I'm a bit crazy," they laughed.
Crazy, as in the guy who brought Milktooth and Bluebeard, two highly acclaimed restaurants to Virginia Avenue and crazy, as in the guy who's worked as Jimmy Buffett's stage manager for 25 years.
Ashley Brooks, co-founder of Milktooth, said of The Idle, "This is very typical of Tom to have a big, bold ideas and bring them to life."
Battista told us their motivation in this case.
"I'm a big advocate for the city and always have been and I think it will be a place where people will bring friends and out-of-town people because it's so crazy," they said.
Battista said they got the idea five years ago "while walking along the half-mile stretch where the interstates came through and divided the neighborhood, so it just seemed to me this green space in the middle of the city could be recaptured and brought back so people could use it and not just the cars."
They said while the city's movers and shakers were all on board, "the Federal Highway Administration said, 'No way, it's way out of the box, we'll never do that."
But Battista didn't give up and the feds finally signed off on the plan. To satisfy safety concerns, a fence will be built just below the viewing area to ensure no one can get on the highway. Plus, there will be no other structures or flags permitted.
Paul Smith, who is head of the Southeast Neighborhood Development Corporation (SEND) was among those who loved Battista's idea.
"When Tom came to me with this idea I was, like, 'This is crazy enough to work'," Smith said. "What I really like the most is that there's not another one like it anywhere in the country, it's one-of-a-kind and I think Indy does best when it does its own thing."
Battista said sitting atop a hill watching highway traffic isn't exactly Margaritaville, but they hope it's at least a pleasant place to sit in traffic.
"We can't be down in the islands with Jimmy. There are no rivers or oceans but there are all those cars going all over," they said. "You could close your eyes and it could (sound like) the roar of an ocean."
They said the cost of the project is $82,000. While they expect Jimmy will kick in some, most of the money needed will come through a crowdfunding site. Battista plans to launch the campaign at Bluebeard Monday.
He's hopeful The Idle will be done and open to the public by the end of September.

Over their 10 years in the public eye, Somali-born women's rights advocate Ayaan Hirsi Ali has made no secret of their criticism of Islam.
In their bestselling memoir Infidel, they said the Koran gave Muslims “a legitimate basis” for domestic abuse and urged Westerners to stop kidding themselves “Islam is peace and tolerance.” In their 2010 follow-up, Nomad, also a bestseller, they wrote, “Islam is imbued with violence, and it encourages violence.”
I think that we are at war with Islam
Most conspicuous was a 2007 interview with Reason magazine in which they said Islam needed to be “defeated” in all its forms.
“I think that we are at war with Islam,” they said. “And there's no middle ground in wars.”
Wednesday, Brandeis University said it was “not aware” of Ms. Ali's history of controversial comments and — in a decision that critics suspect was fuelled by pressure from Islamic groups — announced it would no longer be awarding them an honorary degree.
Ms. Ali is a “compelling public figure and advocate for women's rights,” the Jewish-sponsored Massachusetts university said in a statement.
“That said, we cannot overlook certain of their past statements that are inconsistent with Brandeis University's core values.”
Ms. Ali had been set to speak at the university's May 18 commencement, where they were to receive an honorary degree in social justice.
Now they have been officially disinvited, although the university said “in the spirit of free expression” they would be welcome to speak about their ideas at a future date.
For their part, Ms. Ali said it was “scarcely credible” Brandeis had overlooked their earlier works. They accused the university of bowing to critics' demands to have them “silenced.”
“What was initially intended as an honour has now devolved into a moment of shaming,” they said in a statement.
“[What is] deplorable is that an institution set up on the basis of religious freedom should today so deeply betray its own founding principles.
“I can only wish the Class of 2014 the best of luck — and hope that they will go forth to be better advocates for free expression and free thought than their alma mater.”
The Somalia-born Ms. Ali, 44, was raised in a strict Muslim family, but renounced Islam in their 30s after surviving a civil war, genital mutilation, beatings and an arranged marriage.
They came to the Netherlands as a refugee in the early 1990s and was elected a member of the Dutch Parliament in 2003-06. It was during that time they wrote the screenplay for [itals]Submission[itals], an 11-minute film that criticized how women were treated under Islam.
After the movie was premièred on Dutch public television, its director, Theo van Gogh, was brutally murdered on an Amsterdam street by an Islamic fundamentalist and Ms. Ali received a torrent of death threats.
They have lived in the United States since 2007, where they founded the AHA Foundation to combat female genital mutilation, honour killings and the application of sharia law on women.
A frequent public speaker, Ms. Ali stands apart from other critics of Islam by extending their critiques to the entire faith, rather than its radical elements.
“There is no moderate Islam,” they said in the Reason interview.
“There are Muslims who are passive, who don't all follow the rules of Islam, but there's really only one Islam, defined as submission to the will of God. There's nothing moderate about it.”
Brandeis' sudden rejection of Ms. Ali came after university officials were pressured to bar them
More than 85 of about 350 faculty members signed a letter asking for them to be removed from the list of honorary degree recipients.
In addition, an online petition, created Monday by Brandeis students, had garnered more than 6,000 by Tuesday afternoon.
“We see this decision as a personal attack on Brandeis' Muslim students, and as minorities at a predominately white, Jewish university, many of us feel isolated and unwelcomed,” reads a Tuesday op-ed in the university's student newspaper written by the Brandeis Muslim Students Association.
The view was shared by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the U.S.'s largest Muslim advocacy group.
“It is unconscionable that such a prestigious university would honour someone with such openly hateful views,” said spokesperson Ibrahim Hooper.
The episode is reminiscent of 2006, when Jewish groups campaigned hard to block Brandeis University from awarding an honorary degree to playwright Tony Kushner on the grounds they had expressed controversial anti-Israeli views.
In that case, however, the university went ahead with the degree.
“Just as Brandeis does not inquire into the political opinions and beliefs of faculty or staff before appointing them, or students before offering admission, so too the University does not select honorary degree recipients on the basis of their political beliefs or opinions,” Jehuda Reinharz, Brandeis' then-president, wrote at the time.
National Post, with files from The Associated Press
Korean-owned Harvest Operations Corp. has cut 105 jobs and will delay start-up of its 10,000-barrel-per-day BlackGold thermal oilsands project until benchmark New York oil prices improve to above $60 US per barrel.
The Calgary-based arm of Korea National Oil Corp. said it has completed construction of well pads, connecting pipelines and the central processing facility at BlackGold but will perform only “minor pre-commissioning activities” throughout 2015.
“In a very low price environment we see today, it does not make commercial sense to start steaming and trying to start production,” chief operating officer John Wearing said on a Wednesday morning conference call.
“Our target for start-up would be somewhere above $60 WTI (West Texas Intermediate), which would give us, we think, commercial viability to start the project.”
On Wednesday, WTI closed at $50.09.
Delaying start-up is an unusual move for a producer's first oilsands project as most want to prove the resource to investors and start generating returns.
But Harvest has the luxury of taking its time, company executives said on the call. They confirmed they have access to an undrawn $171-million loan facility from KNOC to act as a liquidity lifeline in case low commodity prices persist.
In an interview, Wearing said Harvest has about 550 employees following the layoffs. About 70 of the lost jobs were in Calgary. Of the 105, about 30 were directly related to the oilsands project and the rest with its conventional drilling activities.
Harvest increased its cost estimate for BlackGold, a steam-assisted gravity drainage project southeast of Fort McMurray, last year to about $900 million because of weather-related construction delays and because it decided to pre-build parts of its planned 20,000-bpd second phase.
The number doesn't include the cost of buying the leases in 2006 and is nearly double the estimate made when KNOC sanctioned the project in 2010.
Oilsands analyst Michael Dunn of FirstEnergy Capital, who doesn't cover Harvest, agreed the delaying strategy is unusual.
“Smaller projects have a higher operating cost structure than larger projects so, assuming that in the meantime Harvest's fixed cost base at BlackGold is not that severe, it might make sense,” they said.
They added there aren't many other small projects scheduled to start up in the immediate future. Athabasca Oil Corp.'s 12,000-bpd Hangingstone is one, “but they will not delay steaming as they want to prove to investors that Hangingstone will work.”
Wearing said Harvest has spent about $250 million to complete most of its 2015 drilling campaign in the first quarter. They wouldn't give a full-year capital budget number because they said it will depend on the commodity price.
“In terms of the constrained commodity price environment, we've basically shut down our capex activities after the quarter,” said treasurer Grant Ukrainetz on the call. “Our goal … is to live within our means.”
Harvest reported fourth-quarter 2014 production from its conventional western Canadian operations of 42,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down from 49,200 boe/d in the same period of 2013.
The numbers don't include production from its joint ventures with Kerr Canada Co. Ltd. struck in the second quarter of last year. Kerr is owned by a consortium of Korean investors and is providing cash to develop land contributed by Harvest under a multi-year agreement.
Harvest said it received an average fourth quarter price of $62.75 per barrel for oil and natural gas liquids, down from $70.68 a year earlier, and $3.21 per thousand cubic feet for natural gas, versus $3.86. Its revenue was $172 million, versus $223 million, and it posted an operating loss of $283 million, compared with income of 2.3 million.
It said it sold heavy oil assets in Alberta and Saskatchewan in the fourth quarter for net proceeds of $197 million, using some of it to buy Hunt Oil Company of Canada, Inc., for $36 million in cash to add to its core areas in Alberta.
In November, Harvest sold its money-losing oil refinery at Come by Chance, N.L., to SilverRange Financial Partners LLC of New York.
It didn't reveal the purchase price at the time but in a filing with regulators Tuesday said the sale brought in $70.5 million. The difference between buying and selling price resulted in a net loss of $56.6 million.
KNOC inherited the refinery when it bought Calgary-based Harvest Energy Trust in 2009 for $1.7 billion.
Harvest reported that as of Dec. 31, its total proved plus probable reserves base was 427 million barrels of oil equivalent, an eight per cent decrease from 2013.

This is part 1 in my look at the best/most interesting competitors taking part in the 2012 Olympics. My primer on Judo can be seen here.
48kg Women:

It is impossible to talk about this weight class without mentioning its former queen, Ryoko Tani. With 5 Olympic medals(2 gold, 2 silver, 1 bronze) and 8 World Championship medals(7 golds, 1 bronze), they basically ran over almost everyone in their division for a 17 year stretch that started with the 1991 Worlds and ended with a Bronze at Bejing.
The combination of blinding speed, unyielding aggression and sublime technique they displayed made them a joy to watch and not just one of the greatest female judoka of all time, but also probably one of the greatest female athletes in any sport. I've included a highlight below to give you a feel for what they were capable of.
Even with their gone, Japan still qualified the top two women at this weight. Tomoko Fukumi(2009 World Gold Medalist, 2010,2011 Silver) and Haruna Asami(2010,2011 World gold medalist). Even though Asami beat Fukumi in the last two world championships, Fukumi has the marginally better international record and won the 2012 All-Japan Judo Championships. That is usually, but not always, considered the final selection event for the Olympics and the winner gets the spot. Fukumi will probably win the gold. Generally they win all the competitions they go up for, especially when Asami isn't around. The question is really about who comes next.
My guess, world #3 ranked Sarah Menezes of Brazil(2x World Junior Champion, 2x World Bronze Medallist, 1x Pan Am Champion). Menezes is part of the new crop of Brazillian female judoka who I expect to be very competitive this year and extremely dangerous by Rio. The BBC has a profile of them up here.
I'm also expecting interesting things from Frederique Jossinet of France(Olympic Silver, 4x World Medalist, 9x European Medalist), Munkhbat of Mongolia(Asian champion 2012), Wu Shugen of China(2012 Asian Silver Medalist), Jung-Yeon Chung of Korea(World Bronze medalist, 4x Asian Games Medalist) and Dayaris Mestre of Cuba(5x Pan Am Medalist)
The British entry at this weight is Kelly Edwards, a 21 year old whose best wins are a bronze at the European under 20 championships and 2 European cup golds. I wouldn't expect too much here. She's too inexperienced and this weight class has too many bad matches for them

This in an insanely competitive division. Most of the top 20 ranked men are probably capable of taking each other out on any given day. Well, except for the man at the very top, Rishod Sobirov of Uzbekistan. Sobirov is the 2010 and 2011 world champion, a Bejing bronze medalist and has been on a tear for the last 2 years winning pretty much everything they entered. To give you an idea of how dominant they have been, they have almost twice as many world ranking points as the current world #2. Since he's already beaten the best people he'll be facing in london multiple times, they have to be the pick for gold.

Highlights:
The sentimental part of me though leans towards Georgii Zantaraia of Ukraine. In addition to having a gold, silver and bronze medal at the Worlds, Zantaraia has a gold and silver at the Europeans. Plus they show off some of the most spectacularly acrobatic judo you will ever see and is just a joy to watch
Profile
Highlights
Next on my list, Hiroaki Hiraoka of Japan, who actually came second in qualifying points to Japan's Hirofumi Yamamoto(no relation to Kid that I know of) but won the All-Japans this year and has a stronger competition record including two silvers and a bronze at the Worlds and a silver at the Asian games. Their style is incredibly smooth and very powerful and he's a real danger to anyone they face. With luck we'll get to see them smash some people in spectacular fashion
Other people to watch out for, pretty much most of the top 20. Basically, if you see anyone from Russia, Georgia, Korea, France, Mongolia, Armenia, Brazil, Germany, Canada, Italy or Austria, it will be a good, hard match. Lighter weights in Judo are a lot like lighter weights in MMA. Everyone is fast, skilled and in good shape. Entertainment is pretty much guaranteed.
Outside of the top 20. I'm kinda a fan of Eisa Majrashi of Saudi Arabia. They haven't had any spectacular wins, but I've never seen them give less than an honest fight to anyone he's faced and I'm rooting for them to come up with something spectacular.
Finally, because I'm in the UK, I'll mention Ashley McKenzie, the 22 year old who has been groomed for this competition for the last 4 years. Their best win is a gold in the 2010 European u23 championships and they have a handful of good wins at the World and European level, but nothing impressive when compared with their competition. Honestly, I haven't seen anything about their game that I find super impressive, but they are a natural showman who seems to elevate their game in front of the home crowd. Fighting in London might pull something spectacular out of him. I'm not holding my breath though.
David Carr, who died on the job on Thursday at the age of 58, knew how to put people at ease, whether the setting was a fancy conference or a journalism seminar. They knew their stuff, having worked their way through the ranks of newsrooms from the Midwest to the Beltway and on to New York. And they were tough, having carved their way out of debilitating drug addiction. Carr shared all of this with their readers, in their memoir, The Night of the Gun, and in their reporting and columns for The New York Times, their final place of employment, in whose offices they collapsed on Thursday night.
I didn't know Carr, though I had the pleasure of seeing them speak and conduct interviews multiple times. I read their book in college, which makes me part of a generation of journalists who confront a field that's experiencing convulsive change. Carr called us “digital natives,” but not in a dismissive way. They worked hard to stay current, and understood the media in a way that few journalists of any generation do.
Carr's fame spread beyond the usual media circles when they appeared in Page One, a 2011 documentary about life at the Times. In the film, Carr can be seen putting a group of Vice Media executives in their place, reminding them that the global, often dangerous journalism that the Times does can't easily be replicated, let alone replaced, by scrappy, over-eager buzz-makers who, as Carr memorably put it, “put on a fucking safari helmet and looked at some poop.” That type of candor endeared Carr to their readers and fans, but it was only one aspect of their brilliance.
The other side of Carr's genius revealed itself last August, when they reconsidered their harsh attitude toward Vice: “Being the crusty old-media scold felt good at the time, but recent events suggest that Vice is deadly serious about doing real news that people, yes, even young people, will actually watch.” Carr, great reporter that they are, knew that adjusting their opinion to reflect reality was an expression of strength, not weakness. That combination of authority, humility, and fearlessness is what made them such an addictive read, and it's what made so many younger journalists want to be them when we grew up.
We were all better journalists when David Carr was watching us. As we mourn this grievous loss for our profession, we can only hope someone manages to fill their shoes. Until then, we'll heed their advice, and “type until it becomes writing.”
Over the weekend, Dick Cheney did something few Republicans are willing to do: They called the choice of Sarah Palin as the GOP's vice-presidential nominee in 2008 “a mistake.”
“I like Governor Palin. I've met her,” the former Vice President told ABC News. “I know them They – attractive candidate. But based on their background, she'd only been governor for, what, two years. I don't think they passed that test … of being ready to take over. And I think that was a mistake.” (Incidentally, that isn't quite how Cheney described Palin four years ago. Endorsing McCain for president, they said: “And I'm pleased that [McCain] has chosen a running mate with executive talent, toughness, and common sense, our next vice president, Sarah Palin.”)
The man who picked Palin, Senator John McCain — who recently said that the former governor of Alaska was a better candidate than Mitt Romney — responded to Cheney's latest remarks with a riposte that sounded as if it had been on the tip of their tongue for years.
“I'm always glad to get comments four years later,” McCain told Fox News. “Look, I respect the vice president. They and I had strong disagreements as to whether we should torture people or not. I don't think we should have.”
“But,” McCain continued, “the fact is that I'm proud of Sarah Palin, I'm proud of the job they did, I'm proud of the job they continue to do, and so everybody has their own views and I respect those views, but I'm proud of what we did.”
Video of their remark is below, via GOP 12
Palin has yet to respond to Cheney's comments, but Cheney's daughter Liz quickly disagreed with their father via Twitter.
Some would call a Cheney/Palin feud a distraction. But it's actually an important reminder of the tension at the heart of the Republican Party, as the establishment continues to struggle to coexist with the party's right wing base.
The Android TV platform now has access to HBO Now, Showtime, and CBS All Access, Google said today in a blog post. The company also announced that it's partnered with Disney to bring the company's Disney Movies Anywhere digital storefront to Android TV, as well as film-on-demand service Epix, WWE Network, and UFC's streaming service.
The additions round out an already-robust app list, which in June exceeded 600 options. Still, Android TV sits in the awkward position of being outperformed by its cheaper, easier-to-use companion, the Chromecast. Google says it's committed to both platforms.
Android TV is currently available as built-in software in smart TV sets from Sony, Sharp, Philips, and — new as of today — Hisense and TLC devices. You can also choose to outfit your TV with Google's own Nexus Player streaming box or gaming-oriented streaming boxes from Nvidia and Razer, both of which have added functionality to play Android games and stream PC titles.
"Head-banging" to heavy metal music could be hazardous to your health, researchers in Australia have concluded.
They found that it can give you more than a headache: It can injure your brain and neck.
On The Early Show Thursday, Dr. Sheeraz Qureshi, an orthopedic surgeon at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, observed that, "The way head-banging was originally described, it was actually people banging their heads against the stage. And certainly you would imagine that that could be a cause of some head and neck injuries."
The more common notion of head-banging, which resembles forceful shaking of the head in the "yes" motion, is risky, Qureshi said.
"I guess if you're not a head-banging purist and you're not banging your head against the stage and you're doing what the guys in 'Wayne's World' are doing, certainly, with those extremes of motions, there have been some reports of fractures and other injuries, even traumatic brain injuries just from head-banging."
The researchers in Australia attended rock concerts and an found increasing risk of neck injury beginning at tempos of 130 beats per minute, related to the range of motion in the head-banging style. The authors suggest head-banging may cause headaches and dizziness if the range of movement of the head and neck is more than 75 degrees either way from a strictly vertical position of the head.
"An extreme in the range of motion," Qureshi pointed out, "certainly doing that violently and jerking your head back and forth" could cause problems.
Experts note that there have been anecdotal reports of head-banging induced injuries that include hearing loss, stroke and mild traumatic brain injury -- there's little formal research into head banging.
A physicist and meteorologist who was interviewed as part of the Roswell UFO crash investigation conducted by the US Air Force may have had far more influence and knowledge about the matter than has ever been realized. Rather than simply being one among many that were interviewed for the Air Force investigation (resulting in two official debunking reports issued in the 1990s) the scientist may have played an ongoing and far more secret role in forming the reports' conclusions.
- It is now known that the scientist, Charles B. Moore (who spent their last years trying to debunk Roswell) was lying when they denied that they did not know the codename (Mogul) used by military for their work on classified Air Force sponsored balloon-borne radiation detection research. It was an unaccounted for, crashed Mogul balloon train that was proffered as the Air Force's explanation for the reports of a crashed UFO near Roswell, NM in July, 1947. The details on this deception are recounted below.
- And this author has recently discovered passages from a previously ignored interview with Moore conducted twenty five years ago that appears in a little-mentioned Roswell book from the UK. This never-before-discussed interview provides unquestionable proof that Moore knew what the Air Force's Roswell investigation's conclusions would be before anyone else. Moore knew that the Air Force was going to address the issue of strange bodies found at the site in a then yet-to-be published report. Incredibly, they were made aware of what the Air Force's explanation would beyears before the public was told of the ”aliens as crash test dummies” explanation and well before any official report on the matter was ever issued.
MOORE THE COLLUDER
Charles Moore and Balloon, 1940s
Tim Shawcross is the author of books including Men of Honour and The War Against the Mafia. Theirs has experience in British television as a series editor, director and producer. They have worked for the BBC, Granada Television, Thames Television and UK's Channel Four on programming including This Week, Secret History and Panorama. Their documentaries include Mountbatten and Chernobyl: The Inside Story.
Shawcross indicates that in 1994, while researching the Roswell crash, they had an opportunity to interview Charles Moore at length about subjects including balloons and the crash. Shawcross, wrote in their book The Roswell File something that was very revealing. Completed the year before the release of the second Air Force Roswell study, The Roswell Report: Case Closed ( in which crash test dummies dropped from the skies were said to account for the ‘alien bodies' found on the desert floor) Shawcross relates:
“I interviewed Charles Moore and asked their reaction to the fact that many people had reported accounts of ‘dead aliens'. (Moore responded) ‘True –people reported…but that I think is another story and something there may be more on later but it nothing to do with what we were flying.' (Note: the two had earlier been discussing the possibility of the crash being resultant from a secret experimental plane .)
When I telephoned them from the UK some weeks later and asked whether they could give me any further information on what they meant by that somewhat cryptic remark, they responded by saying that they had been in touch with the Pentagon and that we should expect in 1995 or 1996 another announcement from the Air Force which would contain more details, in the form of an entirely new report. This would finally explain all the accounts of strange bodies at Roswell.
As I continued to press him, Moore became increasingly agitated, saying that they had already said more than they should, and they then ended the conversation rather abruptly. When I telephoned them again, they were even more curt and they seemed distinctly worried that they had mentioned to me as much as they had.”
Shawcross then notes on page 165) of the book, “no second Air Force report has yet emerged.” Still, Shawcross seemed confident that Moore had foreknowledge that one would be produced. And indeed it was, just as Moore had predicted!
Aerial Test Dummy
That is to say:
At least three years before the anthropomorphic “crash test dummies” explanation was offered to the public to account for what the Roswell witnesses really saw and misconstrued as alien bodies, Charles Moore had already been apprised by the Pentagon that the body issue would be “dealt with.” It would come out, they said , in an all- new, second Air Force report that would be released in the next two years or so. At the time of the writing and completion of Shawcross's The Roswell File book, the Air Force had yet to even indicate that they would be putting forth a second report on the crash. Moore knew in 1994 what would only become “known” in 1997!
There is only one reason that Moore would have known years before what the Air Force would tell the public about bodies. They were colluding with the Air Force since the very beginning in creating viable alternate explanations for both the crash materials and bodies. It is strikingly clear from what has been found in Shawcross' book that Moore maintained high-level contacts at the Pentagon and that they were being kept apprised of the government's Roswell investigation as it was occurring. It is likely that rather than just having been an interviewee for the Air Force's inquiry, Moore was actively collaborating with the Pentagon to develop false explanations and conclusions about the Roswell crash.
In reviewing their interview with Moore some weeks previous, Shawcross felt compelled to contact Moore again about Moore's enigmatic remarks and prediction of a new Roswell Air Force report. The elderly Moore seemed horrified at themselves that they had “slipped up” and had said too much to Shawcross. The implications of what they had related to Shawcross had suddenly dawned on him. And Moore, a man who had previously been very cordial and cooperative, suddenly had become flustered and abrupt with him. They knew that Shawcross' next questions would invariably have been: “Why is the Pentagon privately keeping you informed about their Roswell work? What is your real role with them and Roswell?”
We must also wonder: Was Moore receiving direction from the Pentagon as a pawn? Or was they providing advice to them as an expert? Or both? Did Moore hold Top Secret clearance levels that made their utility to the Air Force easier to access? It is likely. As a life-long researcher and Professor in Atmospheric Science and related disciplines, Moore was affiliated with Universities including the Atmospheric Department at New Mexico Tech. A portion of their work throughout their life was sponsored research. This work was sometimes classified and military and government contracted.
MOORE THE LIAR
Charles Moore Pictured with a Mogul Reflector
Over the years various accusations have been levied against Moore by researchers. Among them is that Moore's Mogul balloon trajectory premise was false or at best disingenuous. But there is something Moore said which can only be construed as a falsehood:
For years Moore had maintained to researchers that they were entirely unaware of the codename used by the military for a balloon radiation detection system to be used over the Soviet Union that they had helped to test and implement. This was Project Mogul. They insisted that it was not until 1992 that they were made aware of the actual name of the project by the late researcher Robert Todd.
However pioneering investigator Brad Sparks proved this untrue some seven years ago. Sparks wrote:
“Moore claims that they never even knew the supersecret "MOGUL" project codename while they themselves worked in MOGUL in the late 40's, had no idea there was a MOGUL codename for what they had been doing until Bob Todd contacted them and revealed it to them in 1992 or thereabouts. Moore uses this bullshit story to support their claim that MOGUL was so compartmented and supersecret in 1947 that that helps explain why it took so long to come up with the MOGUL balloon explanation for Roswell, and how Roswell 509th would know nothing about MOGUL, how other activities at White Sands would have known nothing of MOGUL, etc.
In fact this is just another of Moore's bold-faced lies through their teeth: Moore had in their own files a May 12, 1949, letter from White Sands PIO and Navy Unit commander, Cdr. Mclaughlin, to Dr. James Van Allen, discussing how CHARLES B. MOORE HAD BEEN IN CHARGE OF "PROJECT MOGUL" there at White Sands. Moore had this letter in their own files all along and had even shared a copy with McDonald back in 1968!!” (Dr. James McDonald was a Moore associate and atmospheric scientist.)
Here is a link to the incriminating letter, found on researcher David Rudiak's website:
THE TRUTH ABOUT MOORE
When we combine Moore's ongoing relationship with the Pentagon about Roswell (and their knowledge years before of a report to deal with the bodies) with their known deceptions, we must now discount entirely their value in having provided any forthright answers to what really happened at Roswell. Moore passed in 2010. Some say that we should not speak ill of the dead. But we must speak the truth about them. And the truth is that Charles “CB” Moore knew much more. F or the Pentagon to keep Moore abreast of what none of us would learn until years later is telling. The Air Force wanted both a stooge and someone who could actively help to create revisionist history about Roswell. They found both in a man named Moore.

WOODSTOCK, GA -- The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has released the identity of the man who died late New Year's Eve during an officer-involved shooting on Interstate 75.
Canton resident Chad Erik Roberts, 35, was fatally wounded following a police chase that originated out of Canton and ended in north Cobb County.
Bahan Rich, a spokesperson with the GBI, said Roberts' autopsy has been complete, but the final results will not be available until toxicology and ballistics testing are wrapped up.
A preliminary investigation from the state reveals that around 10:09 p.m. Dec. 31, an officer with the Canton Police Department attempted to conduct a traffic stop on a vehicle parked "suspiciously" outside of a closed business.
"The driver of the vehicle initially spoke to the officer but then fled in their vehicle, striking the officer," the GBI previously said.
Canton officers pursued the vehicle into Woodstock, and its police department as well as the Cherokee Sheriff's Office assisted in the chase.
During the pursuit, the tires on the driver's vehicle were disabled using a deflation device, and the vehicle came to a stop on Interstate 75 northbound near the Wade Green Road interchange.
According to the GBI, Roberts got out of the vehicle and "presented a gun" during contact with law enforcement.
At that moment, two Woodstock officers fired their weapons and Roberts was hit with gunshot wounds, the GBI states. They died as a result of their injuries.
The Canton police officer who was hit by the vehicle was treated at a local hospital. No other officers were injured in the incident.
Woodstock police spokesperson Brittany Duncan said the officers involved have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation, as outlined in the department's policy.
Once the GBI completes its investigation, it will turn over its case file to the Cobb County District Attorney's Office for review.

Joe Scarborough laid into Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp on Friday after the member of congress accused the MSNBC host and other gun control advocates of pushing "a political agenda" in wake of the Sandy Hook tragedy.
After clashing with the hosts about fiscal cliff negotiations, co-host Mika Brzezinski asked the member of congress if they thought it was time to reconsider their stance on laws pertaining to assault weapons.
Huelskamp said that as a member of congress, they were bothered by how individuals politicized the tragedy "so quickly." Huelskamp said that the country has a "cultural program." They added, "It's not a gun problem; it's a people problem."
"So tell me, why do Americans need assault weapons?" Scarborough asked.
"There's been a lot of misleading statements including those that have been said right here ... that's the reality here. It's not a gun problem. There's a person doing that," Huelskamp pressed.
"Oh really?" Scarborough said. "Do you think I have a constitutional right to have an assault weapon?"
Huelskamp said it was a constitutional issue and added, "Let's step back. Let's not build on the tragedy in Connecticut and use that to actually push a political agenda."
Scarborough seemed to grow incensed. "Use that? To push a political agenda?" Scarborough asked.
"Oh, absolutely," Huelskamp said. "This president and their folks are using this to push—"
Scarborough interrupted the Kansas member of congress and said, "Let's talk about September 11th, member of congress. Were there some changes made in this country because of the tragedy of September 11th? Was that just using a tragedy -- 3,000 deaths -- to try to make Americans safer? Do you dare come on my show and say I am using the slaughter of 20 little 6 and 7-year-old children; I'm using that for political purposes, Tim?"
"Joe, how many children do you have?" Huelskamp asked.
"I've got four children, Tim. Answer my question," Scarborough said.
"So do I. And I refuse to let you say that because you have children, or anybody else, that we need to actually politicize this. But I see folks in Washington -- I don't know about you. I don't watch your show. I see my colleagues in Washington trying to politicize this," Huelskamp charged.
"Tim, I'm not going to let you say that I am, quote, politicizing the slaughter of 26 or 27 children. But you said anybody that's talking about this ... Maybe some of us just believe that we have to do whatever we can -- whether it's looking at mental health, whether it's looking at violent culture of video games and Hollywood movies, whether it's looking at the proliferation of these weapons, whether it's looking at what happened in Oregon, what happened in Colorado, what happened in Virginia, what happened in Connecticut, what continues happening, member of congress."
They added, "So we can't at least talk about guns without you questioning my integrity and saying that I'm using the death of 20 children to try to make life for my children a little bit safer? We can't even talk about it without you coming on this show and insulting me personally?"
MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's national police force is using social network Twitter to track down criminals through jokey messages to citizens that has led to 300 arrests on drug charges in the past year and become a model for other forces worldwide.

The account, @policia, is on track to reach 500,000 followers this weekend and is the second biggest of any law enforcement agency after the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
Officers in Madrid handle 1,200 messages on the account in an average day and answer queries for 17 hours a day, giving it greater reach than any public or private Spanish institution.
Carlos Fernandez Guerra, a former journalist and the only member of the team who is not a police officer, writes all the account's tweets which can be retweeted up to 10,000 times and shrugs off criticism that the tone is too jokey.
“We use language that is attention-grabbing, related to things that are being tweeted at the moment,” Fernandez, 39, explained in their office on the third floor of a police station in central Madrid.
Fernandez is behind messages such as: “Ah, a few beers on a terrace laughing with your girlfriends, watching the hot boys go past ;) Don't take your eye off your handbag and your phone.”
They readily admit that not everyone in the police likes using humorous tweets to warn citizens about email and phone scams and to discourage teenagers from “sexting”, or sending nude photos to friends, that can be uploaded online and are officially classed as child pornography.
“Turn on the passion ... SWITCH OFF the camera. NO TO SEXTING!”, one tweet advised.
“Some people like it, some people don't. There are some that want us to be more formal,” Fernandez said. “We are focused on the average citizen and what they will like.”
They set up the account in 2009, using it to post press releases, before deciding to expand the reach beyond media professionals. Now police forces in Latin America are using @policia as a model to reach citizens, Fernandez said.
While the police do not want people using Twitter to report emergencies, they do offer contact details to spot criminal activity, focused especially on drug and sex offences.
Fernandez said in the past year over 300 people have been arrested on drugs charges thanks to tip-offs, one criminal handed themselves in after the police posted a message about him, and the force tracked down a British fugitive after 5,000 people retweeted that the police were looking for him.
Parodying the police account would be impossible, Fernandez said, especially when they themselves upload content like a video of police driving around Madrid to Bob Marley singing: “Bad boy, bad boy, whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?”
“People couldn't believe it. It's quite a common question, ‘Is this a fake account?'”
The Norse gods have different ways of getting around: Odin and Heimdall have horses, Freyr has a boar, and Thor has two goats to pull their wagon. Freyja's choice was a little more unusual: they had two cats to pull them chariot.
This may be a little hard to imagine, but Snorri Sturluson mentions it twice in the Gylfaginning section of the Prose Edda, once when they are describing the goddess, and later when they tell how the deities came to Baldr's funeral:
Sessrumir, their hall, is large and beautiful. And when they travel, they drive two cats and sits in a chariot. (Faulkes: 24) …Freyr drove in a chariot with a boar called Gullinbursti or Slidrugtanni. But Heimdall rode a horse called Gulltopp, and Freyia their cats. (Faulkes: 50)
Later, in the Skaldskaparmal section, Snorri tells us:
How shall Freyja be referred to? By calling their daughter of Niord, sister of Freyr, wife of Od, mother of Hnoss, possessor of the fallen slain and of Sessrumir and tom-cats… (Faulkes: 86)
The word for tom-cat, fress, caused a bit of controversy in the 19th century, as you will see below.
Why don't the cats have names?
You will have noticed that in the second quote, Freyr's boar and Heimdall's horse have names, but Freyja's cats don't. So either 1) the cats never had names, which seems unlikely given the number of things that do have names in Norse myth (right down to the squirrel that runs up and down the world-tree) or 2) Snorri Sturluson didn't know them. Which means that we don't know them either.
Modern pagans have not let that stop them, and they can choose from two solutions to the problem. The first comes from the writer Diana Paxson, whose ingenious solution appeared in their fantasy novel Brisingamen:
Freyja is associated… with the cat (the lore does not give us the names of the cats who draw their cart– in Brisingamen I assigned them the names “Tregul” (Tree-gold, or Amber) and “Bygul” (Bee-gold, or Honey)… (Paxson) Some people like to give them the names of their daughters, Hnoss and Gersemi (both names meaning “treasure”). ( )
The second solution has the advantage of coming straight from the lore, although it does seem to suggest that Freyja's cats and daughters are interchangeable, which I'm sure was not the idea.
How can cats pull a chariot?
Artists have always struggled with Freyja's cats. (Although a chariot drawn by two goats (Thor) or a boar (Freyr) also seems unlikely.) The problem is, we know how big cats are, and how likely anyone is to harness them. If you check out the picture gallery I linked to in the first sentence, you'll notice how the cats are always much larger than ordinary cats, like the ones in the picture above.
While artists often used a bit of license to simply make cats large enough not to look ridiculous, there have been other solutions to this problem:
Norwegian forest cats lions bears
Bigger Cats: the Norwegian Forest Cat
Norwegian forest cats are large for domestic cats: the females generally weigh 3.5 – 4.5 kg (7.7 – 10 lbs), while the males are between 5.5 to 7.5 kg (12 – 16.5 lbs). They are long-haired, and sturdily built. (They are similar to Maine Coon Cats.)
To be entirely accurate, Freyja's cats would have been the ancestors of this breed, black and white cats brought by Viking seafarers from Britain to Norway, longhairs brought back by Crusaders and traders in the Middle East, and local cats on farms. The skogkatt which resulted from this mix lived on farms, with excursions as ships' cats thanks to their prowess as mousers.
Forest cats are large, and powerfully built, for cats. Allowing for a little artistic license, they would be appropriate cats for Freyja's chariot.
A Chariot drawn by lions: Freyja and Cybele
So skogkatts, being bigger than normal cats, are one solution. Another is to think even bigger: lions. The Near Eastern goddess Cybele had two lions to draw their chariot, which may have suggested Freyja's cats as travel and trade brought cultures into contact.
Cybele probably descends from an earlier goddess, the Hittite and Hurrian goddess Kubaba. The Hittite king Hattusilus considered them their patron deity, and with the royal boost their cult grew, untiil they were takng on the attributes of the mother-goddess Hebat and the Sun-Goddess of Arinna, including their lions.
Some have traced this imagery back to the Potnia Theron, or Mistress of the Beasts, a figure from prehistoric religion.  They are usually shown as standing between two animals, often grasping them, although one from Çatalhöyük (in Turkey) shows them enthroned with two large felines flanking them
They were the Great Mother goddess of the peoples of Phrygia, now western Turkey, The lions were their cult animal, either pulling their chariot, or crouching beside their throne. One image on Theoi.com shows them riding one.
This may or may not be related to Freyja, but it's tempting to imagine the figure of the Great Goddess slowly moving north, taking their two giant cats with them (Gustav Neckel connected the two in the early 20th century.)
Lions, or Martins, or Bears? Oh my.
Bears, you may remember, were the third option for Freyja's transport. This is due to a nineteenth-century controversy over the Old Icelandic word fress. Skaldskaparmal says that Freyja could be called “possessor of tom-cats”, but the word for “tom-cat”, fress, could also mean a bear. This led to a dispute over whether Freyja travelled with bears or cats, but it resolved itself in favour of the cats.
The word köttr, used in the other two mentions of Freyja's cats, could also mean a martin or weasel. Just to make it more confusing. Unlike bears, you can actualy see this one, since they're all about the same size, and if cats were mainly feral or only semi-domesticated, it's easy to see how the word became a catch-all term for agile medium-sized animals with fur.
Bears may be larger and more fitting animals for a Nordic deity, but the cat seemed more appropriate for a goddess who combined the Venusian and the witchy. At any rate, modern commentators on Norse myth seem to have settled that they're cats, at least until proved otherwise.1
Did Thor give them the cats?
So we can consider it as settled that Freyja had cats to draw their chariot, however hard that may be to imagine. But the sources are as silent about how they got them as what their names were. If you poke around the net, however, you will see that some pages, mainly cat-themed ones, say that Thor gave them to them
This seemed unlikely, but I decided to check into it. The source seems to be a book called Tiivistelma, which mixes the story of how Thor fished up the Midgard Serpent with the Russian story of the Cat Bayun, who lies in wait for travellers and sings them to sleep before robbing them. They trick Thor into taking their kittens off their hands and Thor then gives them to Freyja.
The Cat Bayun appears in Russian folktales, but not in Norse myths, and it seems that the author, John Halsted, made up this tale.
1. It is easier to imagine Skadi with bears or martins as their animals, although she's usually associated with wolves.↩

The first teacher banned for life for being useless
Nisar Ahmed will never reach 'requisite standards' of teaching and cannot work in state schools again, a panel has ruled
A teacher who is judged to be incapable of ever improving their work has become the first to be banned for life from the classroom due to incompetence.
Nisar Ahmed will never reach 'requisite standards' of teaching and cannot work in state schools again, a panel ruled.
The General Teaching Council for England found the 46-year-old guilty of serious professional incompetence and said there was a risk that pupils would be seriously disadvantaged if they were ever allowed to return to lessons.
Mr Ahmed was head of business studies at the John O'Gaunt Community Technology College in Hungerford, Berkshire, from September 2007 to January 2009.
They had taught for a total of 13 years at schools across the South-East.
Their management of lessons was 'invariably' below standard, the GTC disciplinary panel was told.
The school, which has more than 450 pupils, aged 11 to 18, gave Mr Ahmed 'extensive formal and informal' support for more than a year but they failed to improve.
Just 13 teachers have been banned from the profession for fixed periods for incompetence since 2000.
Mr Ahmed is the first to receive a prohibition order without time limit.
Their organisation of classes was deemed 'persistently poor', with class registers regularly left uncompleted and student work folders 'poorly managed' and sometimes left at home or in their car when they were needed in lessons.
Marking was persistently not done or delayed and feedback to pupils was inadequate, GTC committee chair Rosalind Burford said.
They added: 'You regularly failed to undertake proper lesson plans. This resulted in a lack of pace and challenge in your lessons and a lack of clear learning objectives.'
These 'fundamental' failings had a significantly adverse effect on their students, they said, adding: 'We could not be satisfied that you have an appropriate level of insight into your shortcomings.
'Thus, we felt you posed a significant risk of repeating your actions.'
Two years ago, GTC chief executive Keith Bartley said there could be as many as 17,000 'substandard' members of staff among the 500,000 registered teachers in the UK.
The small number banned for incompetence will spark fears these teachers are simply being recycled.
Mr Ahmed was head of business at the John O'Gaunt Community Technology College in Hungerford, Berkshire
Mr Ahmed had been placed under a formal capability process in December 2008. They resigned shortly after learning their case would be considered by governors.
Michael Wheale, the school's former headteacher who gave evidence at the hearing, was unavailable for comment.
Its current head Neil Spurdell said: 'Under a capability process, teachers do have the opportunity to improve against certain targets and many do.
'The bottom line is you can't have pupils disadvantaged by inadequate teaching. They only have one chance at this.'
Last night Mr Ahmed, who lives in Reading with their wife and their two children, said they would be appealing the GTC decision.
They added: 'They have made a scapegoat out of me. I'm deeply unhappy about it and don't deserve to be the first to be struck off for life.'
Ontario's police watchdog says it is investigating after a car that being chased by Ottawa police Wednesday evening flipped over, causing one of the passengers to become seriously injured.
The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) said in a news release issued Thursday that police officers conducting a radar blitz on Hunt Club Road stopped a vehicle around 6:30 p.m. they said had been speeding.
The vehicle, a black sedan, stopped briefly, but then fled the scene. Ottawa police then followed the vehicle.
The vehicle flipped over when it approached the intersection of Pike Street and Maple Park Private and landed upside down in a's backyard.
The SIU said the driver and one of the passengers fled the scene on foot. A third passenger, a 16-year-old boy, was taken to hospital with a serious injury.
​The SIU investigates when incidents involving police and civilians result in serious injury, death or allegations of sexual assault.
Two investigators and one forensic investigator have been assigned to the case.
The police watchdog is urging anyone with information about the chase to contact the lead investigator at 1-800-787-8529. Anyone with video footage of the incident is also asked to upload it to the SIU website.
In a surge of long overdue updates the GIMP team made the first public release in the 2.9.x series. It's completely GEGL-based, has 16/32-bit per channel editing and new tools. It's also surprisingly stable enough even for the faint of heart.
Obligatory disclaimer: I'm currently affiliated with upstream GIMP project. Please keep that in mind when you think you stumbled upon biased opinion and thought you'd call LGW out.
One might expect a detailed review here, which totally makes sense, however writing two similar texts for both upstream GIMP project and LGW would seem unwise. So there: the news post at GIMP.org briefly covers most angles of this release, while this article focuses on features trivia and possible areas of contribution.
The GEGL port and HDR
Originally launched in 2000 by a couple of developers from Rhythm & Hues visual effects studio, the GEGL project didn't have it easy. It took 7 years to get it to GIMP at all, then another 8 years to power all GIMP.
So naturally, after years and years (and years) of waiting the very first thing people would be checking in GIMP 2.9.2 is this:
First and foremost, 64-bit is there mostly for show right now, although GIMP will open and export 64-bit FITS files, should you find any.
That said, you can use GIMP 2.9.2 to open a 32-bit float OpenEXR file, adjust color curves, apply filters, then overwrite that OpenEXR file or export it under a different name. Job done.
The same applies to PNG, TIFF, and PSD files: respective plugins have been updated to support 16/32-bit per channel data to make high bit depth support actually useful even for beta testers.
All retouching and color adjustment tools, as well as most, if not all plugins are functional in 16/32-bit modes. There's also basic loading and exporting of OpenEXR files available (no layers, no fancy features from v2.0).
GIMP also provides several tonemapping operators via the GEGL tool, should you want to go back to low dynamic range imaging.
There are, however, at least two major features in GEGL that are not yet exposed in GIMP:
RGBE (.hdr) loading and exporting;
basic HDR merging from exposure stacks.
This is one of the areas where an interested developer could make a useful contribution at a low enough price in the time currency.
In particular, adding a GEGL-based HDR merge tool to GIMP should be easier now thanks to a widget for using multiple inputs to one GEGL operation (which would be exp-combine).
GEGL operations
Currently 57 GIMP plugins are listed as completely ported to become GEGL operations, and 27 more ports are listed as work in progress. That leaves 37 more plugins to port, so the majority of the work appears to be done.
Additionally, GEGL features over 50 original filters, although some of them are currently blacklisted, because they need to be completed. Also, some of the new operations were written to implement certain features in GIMP tools. E.g. the Distance Map operation is used by the Blend tool for the Shape Burst mode, and both matting operations (Global and Levin) are used by the Foreground Select tool to provide mask generation with subpixel precision (think hair and other thin objects).
Various new operations exposed in GIMP, like Exposure (located in the Colors menu) and High Pass (available via the GEGL tool), are quite handy in photography workflows.
Note that if you are used to "Mono" switch in the Channel Mixer dialog, this desaturation method is now available through a dedicated Mono Mixer operation (Colors->Desaturate submenu). It might take some getting used to.
It's also worth mentioning that 41 of both ports and original GEGL operations have OpenCL versions, so they can run on a GPU.
And while immensely popular external G'MIC plugin is not going to become GEGL operation any time soon (most likely, ever), since recently it's ready to be used in conjunction with GIMP 2.9.x in any precision mode.
There are some technical aspects about GIMP filters and GEGL operations in GIMP 2.9.x that you might want to know as well.
First of all, some plugins have only been ported to use GEGL buffers, while others have become full-blown GEGL operations. In terms of programming time, the former is far cheaper than the latter, so why go the extra mile, when GIMP 2.10 is long overdue, and time could be spent wiser?
Porting plugins to use GEGL buffers simply means that a filter can operate on whatever image data you throw it at, be it 8bit integer or 32-bit per color channel floating point. Which is great, because e.g. Photoshop CS2 users who tried 32-bit mode quickly learnt they couldn't do quite a lot, until at least CS4, released several years later.
The downside of this comparatively cheap approach is that in the future non-destructive GIMP these filters would be sad destructive remnants of the past. They would take bitmap data from a buffer node in the composition tree and overwrite it directly, so you would not be able to tweak their settings at a later time.
So the long-term goal is still to move as much as possible to GEGL. And that comes at a price.
First of all, you would have to rewrite the code in a slightly different manner. Then you would have to take an extra step and write some special UI in GIMP for newly created GEGL op. The reason?
While the GEGL tool skeleton is nice for operations with maybe half a dozen of settings (see the Softglow filter screenshot above), using something like automatically generated UI for e.g. Fractal Explorer would soon get you to lose your cool:
The good news is that writing custom UIs is not particularly difficult, and there are examples to learn from, such as the Diffraction Patterns op:
As you can see, it looks like the former plugin with tabbed UI and it has all the benefits of being a GEGL operation, such as on-canvas preview, named presets, and, of course, being future-proof for non-destructive workflows.
FFmpeg support in GEGL
If you have already read the changelog for the two latest releases of GEGL, chances are that you are slightly puzzled about FFmpeg support. What would GEGL need it for? Well, there's some history involved.
Øyvind Kolås started working on GEGL ca. 10 years ago by creating its smaller fork called gggl and using it for a video compositor/editor called Bauxite. That's why GEGL has FFmpeg support in the first place.
Recently Øyvind was sponsored by The Grid to revive ff:load and ff:save operations. These ops drive the development of the iconographer project and add video capabilities to The Grid's artificial intelligence based automatic website generator.
The FFmpeg-based loading and saving of frames could also come in handy for the GIMP Animation Package project, should it receive much needed revamp. At the very least, they would simplify loading frames from video files into GIMP.
New Tools
The new version has 6 new tools—2 stable, 4 experimental. Here's some trivia you might want to know.
GIMP is typically referred to as a tool that falls behind Photoshop. Opinions of critics differ: some say it's like Photoshop v5, others graciously upgrade it all the way to a CS2 equivalent.
If you've been following the project for a while, you probably know that, anecdotally, the Liquid Rescale plugin was made available a year ahead of Photoshop CS5 Extended. And you probably know that Resynthesizer made inpainting available in GIMP a decade before Content-Aware Fill made its way to Photoshop CS6:
But there's more. One of the most interesting new features in GIMP 2.9.2 is the Warp Transform tool written by Michael Muré back in 2011 during Google Summer of Code 2011 program.
It's the interactive on-canvas version of the venerable iWarp plugin that looked very much like a poor copy of Photoshop's Liquify filter. Except it was introduced to GIMP in 1997, while Liquify first appeared in Photoshop 6, released in 2000.
Warp Transform reproduces all features of the original plugin, including animation via layers, and adds sorely missing Erase mode that's designed to selectively retract some of the deformations you added. The mode isn't yet functioning correctly, so you won't restore original data to its original pixel crisp state, but there are a few more 2.9.x releases ahead to take care of that.
Unified Transform tool is a great example of how much an interested developer can do, if he/she is persistent.
Originally, merging Rotate, Scale, Shear, and Perspective tools into a single one was roughly scheduled for version 3.6. This would prove to be challenging, what with the Sun having exploded by the time and the Earth being a scorched piece of rock rushing through space, with a bunch of partying water bears on its back.
But Mikael Magnusson decided he'd give it a shot out of curiosity. When the team discovered that they had already done a good chunk of the work, they were invited to participate at Google Summer of Code 2012 program, where they completed this work.
Unfortunately, it's also an example of how much the GEGL port delayed getting cool new features into the hands of benevolent, if slightly irritated masses.
Internal Search System
Over the years GIMP has amassed so many features that locating them can be a bit overwhelming for new users. One way to deal with this is to review the menu structure, plugin names and their tooltips in the menu etc., maybe cut most bizarre ones and move them into some sort of 'extras' project.
Srihari Sriraman came up with a different solution: they implemented an internal search system. The system, accessible via Help->Search and Run a Command, reads names of menu items and their descriptions and tries to find a match for a keyword that you specified in the search window.
As you can see, it does find irrelevant messages, because some tooltips provide an overly technical explanation (unsharp mask uses blurring internally to sharpen, and the tooltip says so, hence the match). This could eventually lead to some search optimization of tooltips.
Color Management
The news post at gimp.org casually mentions completely rewritten color management plugin in GIMP. What it actually means is that Michael Natterer postponed the 2.9.2 release in April (originally planned to coincide with Libre Graphics Meeting 2015) and focused on rewriting the code for the next half a year.
The old color management plugin has been completely removed. Instead libgimpcolor, one of GIMP's internal libraries, got new API for accessing ICC profile data, color space conversions etc.
Since GIMP reads and writes OpenEXR files now, it seems obvious that GIMP should support ACES via OpenColorIO, much like Blender and Krita. This has been only briefly discussed by the team so far, and the agreement is that a patch would be accepted for review. So someone needs to sit down and write the code.
What about CMYK?
Speaking of color, nearly every time there's a new GIMP release, even if it's just a minor bugfix update, someone asks, whether CMYK support was added. This topic is now covered in the new FAQ at gimp.org, but there's one more tiny clarification to make.
Since autumn 2014, GEGL has an experimental (and thus not built by default) operation called Ink Simulator. It's what one might call a prerequisite for implementing full CMYK support (actually, separation into an arbitrary amount of plates) in GIMP. While the team gives this task a low priority (see the FAQ for explanation), this operation is a good start for someone interested to work on CMYK in GIMP.
Digital Painting
Changes to the native brush engine in GIMP are minor in the 2.9.x series due to Alexia's maternity leave. Even so, painting tools got Hardness and Force sliders, as well as the optional locking of brush size to zoom.
Somewhat unexpectedly, most other changes in the painting department stem indirectly from the GIMP Painter fork by sigtech. The team evaluated various improvements in the fork and reimplemented them in the upstream GIMP project.
Canvas rotation and horizontal flipping. Featuring artwork by Evelyne Schulz.
Interestingly, while most of those new features might look major to painters, they actually turned out to be a low-hanging fruit in terms of programming efforts. Most bits had already been in place, hence GIMP 2.9.2 features canvas rotation and flipping, as well as an automatically generated palette of recently used colors.
Another new feature is an experimental support for MyPaint Brush engine. This is another idea from the GIMP Painter fork. The implementation is cleaner in programming terms, but is quite incomplete and needs serious work before the new brush tool can be enabled by default.
Some Takeaways For Casual Observers and Potential Contributors
As seen in recently released GIMP 2.9.2, the upcoming v2.10 is going to be a massive improvement with highlights such as:
high bit depth support (16/32-bit per channel);
on-canvas preview for filters;
OpenEXR support;
better transformation tools;
new digital painting features;
fully functional color management;
improved file formats support.
Much of what could be said about the development pace in the GIMP project has already been extensively covered in a recent editorial.
To reiterate, a lot of anticipated new features are blocked by the lack of GIMP 2.10 (complete GEGL port) and GIMP 3.0 (GTK+3 port) releases. There are not enough human resources to speed it up, and available developers are not crowdfundable due to existing work and family commitments.
However, for interested contributors there are ways to improve both GIMP and GEGL without getting frustrated by the lack of releases featuring their work. Some of them have been outlined above, here are a few more:
Create new apps that use GEGL (example: GNOME Photos).
Port more GIMP filters to GEGL or create entirely new GEGL operations (both would be almost immediately available to users).
Create OpenCL versions of GEGL operations.

Carroll, the club's record signing, was their outstanding player in Saturday's 2-1 FA Cup final defeat to Chelsea despite only coming on as a substitute with 35 minutes to go. By that time the Reds were trailing to goals from Ramires and Didier Drogba after a woeful performance allowed the Stamford Bridge side to seize the initiative.
Gerrard said: "I think their form the last two or three months has been fantastic and they are certainly pushing for a place back in the England squad in my opinion."
Carroll's introduction changed the dynamic almost totally in Liverpool's favour as the 23-year-old struck a well-taken goal and had a late header clawed off the line by goalkeeper Petr Cech, but what was more impressive was the former Newcastle forward's all-round contribution as they worked hard to get involved and link up play.
They have not had the best of starts to their Anfield career, scoring just eight goals this season, but has shown signs of progress in the last couple of months.
Gerrard believes that is something new England manager Roy Hodgson should take into consideration.
"Credit to Andy who came on and played brilliantly well," said the captain of Carroll's introduction. "He changed the way we played. We were a lot better with them in the team, we were a lot more direct, we created more, we were more of a threat."
The debate over whether Carroll's far-post header went over the line may still be raging but Gerrard was sympathetic to the difficulties faced by referee Phil Dowd and their assistant Andrew Garratt.
"It is difficult for officials to give decisions like that," admitted Gerrard. "There is an argument that maybe it is [over the line] on the computer image but when you look at the replay...
"Phil Dowd is standing by me and the linesman is 40 yards away - it is impossible to give a yes or a no on it. We have been debating technology for years and it will continue until it comes in. The officials need a bit of help."
Effort supports public computing at 42 libraries and adult education sites
Montpelier, VT – Google has donated 100 computers and funding for software to Vermont public libraries and adult education sites.
Vermont State Librarian Martha Reid announced the gift, which is valued at nearly $25,000 combined.
“Our local libraries have become the hubs of connectivity in many communities and we are very pleased with this public private partnership,” said Governor Peter Shumlin. “This puts power in the hands of Vermonters seeking free access to the Internet and all the benefits – for education, employment opportunities and more – that offers.”
The donation, part of a larger effort by Google to donate surplus equipment from their offices, includes desktop computers and flat screen monitors, keyboards and mice, all completely refurbished and loaded with the latest software operating systems. None of the computers is more than three years old.
“This generous gift will allow more Vermonters than ever to have access to free public computers and the Internet,” said Reid. “These computers, installed in adult education programs and smaller libraries across the state, will help Vermonters who are searching for jobs, looking for reliable health information, continuing their education and using a wide variety of e-resources that were out of reach beforehand. The librarians across the state and their communities are delighted.”
Google sent the 100 computers and necessary equipment free of charge, and included$10,000 for the purchase of software. This donation is an extension of the e-Vermont Community Broadband program, of which the Department of Libraries is a partner. For more information about the e-Vermont project, sponsored by the Vermont Council on Rural Development, see: e4vt.org
“Connecting Vermonters to the world for commerce, education, access to government services, and job-seeking is our highest priority,” said Karen Marshall, Chief of Connect VT.
The 34 libraries and eight adult education sites across the state receiving thecomputers were in dire need of more and newer equipment. The donated computers must be available for use by the public and not for library staff, in order to increase the capacity for citizens to have access to the Internet and tools for lifelong learning.
As part of the connection with the e-Vermont federal broadband grant project, the Department of Libraries is working with the Vermont State Colleges and Community College of Vermont to provide digital literacy training to citizens. Recently e-Vermont piloted a program with interns helping members of the public with computer training, including setting up email accounts and Internet searching.

Only 19 minutes post lunch, the India Under 19 team were celebrating. Bangladesh U-19 had presented them with a very friendly victory target of 117 in the tri-series final here at JU's Salt Lake Campus ground on Sunday. And Sarfaraz Khan chose to reach there in a blaze of glory.
Advertising
Sarfaraz was India's second highest run-getter at the 2014 U-19 World Cup in the UAE with a tally of 211 in six matches at 70.33. They were only 16 then. Two seasons down the line, and a few controversies and a switch from Mumbai to Uttar Pradesh later, they have reached a stage in their career that demands greater discipline. Sarfaraz is still very young, but with their talent they should be more consistent at all levels.
That they could be a game-changer was evident in their 21-ball 45 not out against Rajasthan Royals in the last IPL. It was an innings that had earned them Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli's admiration.
Even Kevin Pietersen had tweeted, describing the teenager as a “real deal”. Compared to that, the Bangladesh colts were pushovers. Still, Sarfaraz's stroke-play was breathtaking.
Advertising
They came to the crease when India had lost Washington Sundar, Rishabh Pant and Amandeep Khare inside 11 deliveries. At 42/3, there was a hint of pressure. Also, Sarfaraz had scored 2, 0 and 12 in the lead-up to the final. But the fearless young lad tore the Bangladesh bowling and their own form book apart.
Saleh Gazi had started the proceedings after lunch. Sarfaraz warmed up with a paddle sweep to the fine leg fence. Up next was a six over the straight boundary followed by a four over mid-on.
When the left-arm spinner came for their next over, Sarfaraz was even more severe, hitting them for four, six, four, four and a couple to complete a 20-run over.
They reached their half-century in 23 balls – the fastest fifty of the tournament – and eventually remained unbeaten on 59 off 27 (9X4, 3X6) as India romp home in 13.3 overs.
“In the last three matches, I couldn't quite perform,” they would later say. “So to get out of pressure I chose to go after the bowling in this game. As they say attack is the best form of defence, I did that.”
They were given the freedom to play their natural game by coach Rahul Dravid.
“He (Dravid) never told me anything when I was having a sort of rough patch. He's always very calm. They don't hold a (team) meeting right after the match. They do it after a day, which helps us re-gather our thoughts,” Sarfaraz said.
After quite a while, India U-19 played an international tournament and it allowed the team management to try a few combinations. Batting-wise, Pant, Sundar, Sarfaraz and captain Ricky Bhui impressed.
Virat Singh and Khare, too, looked good prospects. As far as bowling is concern, Avesh Khan and Khaleel Ahmed can form a potent new-ball pair.
Left-arm spinner Mayank Dagar, who took 3/32 in the final and ran through the Bangladesh middle-order, used their brain. But one thing is pretty clear: Pant and Sarfaraz can be India's X-factor(s) in the World Cup.
Dravid is impressed
Rahul Dravid began their stint as India-19 coach with success and attributed it to their wards. “I'm impressed with their attitude and willingness to learn. We've almost identified the core (for the World Cup),” they said on Sunday.

Brief scores: Bangladesh Under-19 116 all out in 36.5 overs (Md Najmul Hossain 45; M Dagar 3/32, M Lomror 2/11) lost to India Under-19 117/3 in 13.3 overs (S Khan 59*) by 7 wickets.
As expected, The US House of Representatives on Tuesday voted to overturn a ruling that would have forced Internet service providers to obtain consent before selling your web browsing history to third parties for the purpose of targeted advertising. The bill is now destined for President Trump's desk where the White House has already said they strongly support repealing the FCC rules.
Now one Tennessee mobile software engineer and self proclaimed privacy activist wants to turn the tables on legislators, starting a GoFundMe campaign to buy their browsing histories from ISPs and expose them for everyone to see. Starting with a modest goal of just $10,000, the campaign had already raised almost $150,000. But while you may be rooting for this attempt at revenge, the reality is that you can't just legally buy somebody's search history by name, and you should think twice before throwing your money at this.
As The Verge and TechCrunch are pointing out, you can't buy targeted, de-anonymized internet data on individual users. Advertisers can buy web user data, but that's generally done in aggregate, and despite the House's vote there are still prevailing privacy laws, contract law and other individual protections that prevent the scenario proposed by the GoFundMe campaign from being plausible.
In a statement to TechCrunch, GoFundMe said the campaign doesn't violate their terms of service, and that they are working directly with campaign organizer Adam McElhaney to ensure the funds are managed appropriately. Despite this there's still no mention of where the funds will go in the likely scenario that the proposed goal of “purchasing the Internet histories of all legislators, members of congress, executives, and their families and make them easily searchable” isn't successful.
We've discussed what we would do if a god appeared and asked us to kill one of our children. We'd tell them to get lost and then get our heads examined. But if we believed in God and miracles, the request might not seem out of place — after all, in the Bible God did ask Abraham to kill their son as a test of faith.
Something like this happened recently to a Maryland mother.
They were involved with a Christian group called One Mind Ministries. Them son refused to say “amen,” during the meal prayers, so their leader, “Queen Antoinette,” insisted the boy was possessed by a demon. The boy continued to refuse to say the magic word, so they said that God wanted to raise them from the dead. Which, of course, meant they had to die first.
So they put the child away in a back room and prayed — and left them there without food or water for over a week.
The boy died.
No resurrection took place. Any sane person could have told them this, because resurrections only happens in myths and fairy tales. But they were deluded and thought it could happen in real life — an unfortunate consequence of believing in miracles.
The mother has been charged with first-degree murder, but they have insisted on a clause in their plea agreement that requires the charges will be dropped once their son is resurrected. The clause has been accepted.
Amazingly, they still believe:
“She certainly recognizes that their omissions caused the death of their son,” Silverman said. “To this day, they believe it was God's will and they will be resurrected and this will all take care of itself. They realize if she's wrong, then everyone has to take responsibility … and if she's wrong, then she's a failure as a mother and the worst thing imaginable has happened. I don't think that, mentally, she's ready to accept that.”
What a tragic lesson that deities can't be relied upon.
If they had only trusted them God less and their reason more, perhaps their child would still be alive.
Every year the Oscars come and go. Almost every year there is at least one or two controversial picks. This list looks at ten of the worst travesties relating to the Academy Awards. Undoubtedly, some will disagree with a number of the entries and will want to add their own – feel free to do so in the comments.
10 Nominations
The Travesty: The Long, Expensive Campaigns for Nominations
It has long since become atrociously farcical how much lobbying goes into each nomination. The biggest campaigns always revolved around Best Picture, Director and the acting categories. And in order to keep a name in the Academy's flowing cup freshly remember'd (Henry V, thank you), the respective producers lobby, lobby, lobby and shell out inordinate sums of money to get some attention. But, what about the small-budget work? The Independent films are more and more frequently snubbed in various categories these days, because they don't have the funds to keep up with the blockbuster campaigns.
The Oscar season once lasted from about December to February, but now, a campaign better begin in summer if it hopes to hold its ground and sway opinion. Welcome to politics. Money wins.
9 Michael Moore
The Travesty: Michael Moore Wins Best Documentary (2003)
Moore should have won Best Documentary for Sicko (2008). They probably didn't win because of the moronic scene they made in 2003 when they won for Bowling for Columbine. They told everyone they would slam President Bush, but no one believed him. Right or wrong, the Oscars was not the place for it. It was similar to the (in)famous Black Panther salute of the 1968 Olympic Games. Moore was soundly booed out of the building, and Steve Martin saved the day with a great joke.
Regardless, Bowling for Columbine is not a documentary. It tells one side of the story, the liberal side, and should never have even been nominated. It was, and it won, because it was by far the most popular blockbuster of documentaries in recent history. It held its own with The Lord of the Rings: The Towers at the box office. Why? Because it's deliberately inflammatory. The proper political argument has always been one that considers all sides (the U. S. has two, Conservative and Liberal). Moore's film only enunciates the liberal side. It does not, therefore, properly document anything.
8 Forrest Gump
The Travesty: Forrest Gump Wins Best Picture (1995)
Forrest Gump was the feel-good movie of 1994. It's got “heartwarming” moments by the bucketload. And it must have caught the Academy in a heartwarming mood, because it distracted them from its lack of a plot. It's a series of happy, sad, humorous and endearing vignettes about the life of a mentally handicapped man, who somehow manages to be present at every single pop-culture event of the latter half of the 20th Century. That stretches the suspension of disbelief past the breaking point. The Best Picture of 1994 should have been a close race between Pulp Fiction (which does have a plot, albeit out of order) and Quiz Show.
7 Ralph Fiennes
The Travesty: Ralph Fiennes Loses Best Supporting Actor (1994)
Some of the Academy's voting panel have recently admitted that they should have voted for Fiennes's horrific, odious portrayal of Amon Goeth. Once again (see entry #1), the Academy made the mistake of rewarding someone for a long, distinguished body of work, instead of giving the award to the year's best performance. Tommy Lee Jones, who won for The Fugitive, is certainly superb as Deputy U. S. Marshal Samuel Gerard, but Fiennes is superlative in a performance that goes against their own nature as a human being. They succeed in acting as if they do not understand why anyone would care about Jews.  They are walking death in this film.
6 Ten Commandments
The Travesty: The Ten Commandments Loses Best Picture (1957)
One of the worst films ever to win Best Picture somehow managed to steal it from one of the best never to win it. The Ten Commandments does what no one thought possible at the time (even now, it's regarded with a sense of awe since DeMille had no computers). It won the Oscar for special effects, but that's all, and it lost Best Picture to Around the World in 80 Days. In terms of storyline, it's usually a good bet to wager on the Bible. It has a lot of good stories, whether or not you believe them.
The story of the Exodus may be the most epic, and that's saying a lot coming from the Bible. DeMille et al. pulled it off with awesome verve and pacing. The film is not overlong at 3 hours 40 minutes, because it persistently holds the audience enraptured with its scale and photography. People put their hands over their mouths in theaters across the country when the Red Sea parted. Right up to the last moment, they thought they would have to be cheated out of seeing it.
5 Saving Private Ryan
The Travesty: Saving Private Ryan Loses Best Picture (1999)
It lost to Shakespeare in Love, which is a great film in all respects. The final production of Romeo and Juliet, in the Globe Theater, is the best inkling on film of what it might have been like to see a Shakespeare play in Shakespeare's day. But face it, no film has revolutionized its genre as vehemently, as fearlessly, as Saving Private Ryan for the war film. It was not until 1998 that a director managed to overpower the censors in order to show combat for what it is. This is, in terms of realism, the first war film to tell the truth. All the other great war films lied, inasmuch as they shielded the audience's eyes to the reality of a 7.92mm bullet going through some poor, nameless private's abdomen from the side: guts everywhere and the poor guy's screaming for their mama.
This film takes the uninitiated audience closer to combat reality than any other, and in its wake, we now have a slew of honest war films like Black Hawk Down, Pearl Harbor, The Thin Red Line, The Hurt Locker, to name a few. We even have a still-popular WWII first-person shooter video game genre because of this film. Saving Private Ryan was the first to get it right, and it certainly set the bar high, with a perfect, simple storyline, set against an epic historical backdrop. Even Rambo IV took a new lead from it, showing Rambo's carnage the way it always should have been.
It's not fair to say that times had changed by 1998, and the MPAA had become more liberal. They still considered rating it NC-17 (which used to be X). This would have been the first time in history that a film were given such a rating for any reason other than sex. Spielberg finally changed their minds by tracking them down to a conference room and explaining that the MPAA had been lying to the world for 100 years, and the time of Victorian sensibilities had long since passed. Now was the time to tell the truth about Omaha Beach.
4 Peter O'Toole
The Travesty: The Many Nominations of Peter O'Toole
Talk about the luck of the Irish. O'Toole is probably the finest actor alive today (and this lister is a huge fan of Daniel Day-Lewis). They hold the record for most acting nominations without a win, eight, all in the lead category. Granted, that category is a horse race every year, and they went up against some of the truly indelible performances, from the 1960s to the present. Gregory Peck deserved the win for To Kill a Mockingbird, but what about Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady? It's a musical and they can't manage more than a 4-note range in their singing voice. As a result, they did sprechenstimme, as the Germans would call it, “singing speech.” Their acting is just fine, but there's something glaringly absent in the film without the main character singing their songs.
Then the Academy shamed itself in 1969, when it gave the award to Cliff Robertson, an American, instead of O'Toole, from the U. K. O'Toole put forth the performance of a lifetime as King Henry II, the second time, after Becket, and the result was poetry in motion and speech. It sounds like Shakespeare, but it comes out like common conversation. It may be their best work. But then there's Venus (2007), in which they play a fictitious old man who's obsessed with a 16-year-old girl. The award went to Forest Whitaker as Idi Amin, a real person. When it comes to acting, the fictitious characters have always been much more difficult to portray than real people. Whitaker had the real Amin's performances in newsreels to impersonate. O'Toole had no one but himself.
The Academy should have done one of two things that year: either not nominated them at all, or given them the win. This lister believes that of the 5 nominated performances, O'Toole's is truly the best. It was consummate understatement throughout, instead of the flashy bravura Whitaker put forth. Bravura routinely wins.
3 Stanley Kubrick
The Travesty: Stanley Kubrick Never Won Best Director
Like the next entry, Kubrick directed some of cinema's absolute masterpieces, films that have stood the test of time and remain utter genius in all regards. They were nominated for 4 of them, and never won. They won an Oscar for their help with the adapted screenplay of Full Metal Jacket, but as a director, four of their finest efforts were evidently misunderstood. That is certainly the case for 2001: A Space Odyssey. Some critics slammed it as incomprehensible. Others heralded it as the awakening of modern cinema. For whatever reason, it somehow managed to lose Best Director to Carol Reed, for the musical Oliver! That film is a fine work of drama, and perhaps deserved the Best Picture award. But as a director, Reed did nothing new. It's still a musical, a good one, but nothing groundbreaking or innovative in any way (except that Oliver Twist does not have such a happy ending). Kubrick, however, landed all the technical aspects of a film with the same excellence in 2001, and also opened a multitude of new doors into science fiction drama, and filmmaking in general.
Then there's Dr. Strangelove, easily one of the finest comedies in film history, because Kubrick had the nerve to poke fun at nuclear holocaust at the same time as the Cuban Missile Crisis. And that doesn't mention just how sidesplittingly funny every single scene is. Their idea for the war room was a giant, green roundtable, so it would be like the generals and politicians were playing poker with the world's fate. They came up with the line, “Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the war room!” Then, consider that every performance is pitch-perfect, every scene is honed down to a razor's edge of timing and appearance.
They should have been nominated for their directing of Paths of Glory, and perhaps Spartacus.
2 Alfred Hitchcock
The Travesty: Alfred Hitchcock Never Won Best Director
Hitchcock is a byword, now, for suspense. They were nominated as director 5 times, for Rebecca, Lifeboat, Spellbound, Rear Window and Psycho. They lost all five, and was not even nominated for the now-renowned classics Vertigo, North by Northwest and The Birds. The Academy finally honored them with the Irving Thalberg lifetime achievement award, for which they walked on stage, said, “Thank you,” and walked off.
As a result of this and other oversights, the lifetime achievement awards, like the Irving Thalberg and the Jean Hersholt, have become thought of as apologies to great actors, directors, etc, who deserved a competitive win or two and never got one. Psycho, as one example, deserved the win for director over the other four nominees (look them up), because after viewing all 5 performances, Hitchcock's is the only standout in terms of gutsiness and innovation. The main character dies 30 minutes into the film! And what a death scene! In age of ridiculous gore, Psycho still scares and shocks.
1 John Wayne
The Travesty: John Wayne Wins Best Actor (1970)
In the annals of acting awards, no honor has been so universally denounced, scorned, mocked or ridiculed as John Wayne's lead win for their performance as Rooster Cogburn in True Grit. Their portrayal has been called “hammy,” “over the top” and “mischaracterized,” among others, because they very obviously, even obscenely, comes out of character several times in the film, ceasing to be Rooster, and reverting to John Wayne. They shotgun their dialogue for a change, instead of…pausing every few words in a real…laconic delivery of their words! (his exclamation point). But their shotgun delivery tramples all over many of the other actors' cue lines immediately before his.
 They are trying their best to pull off a Spencer Tracy or a Laurence Olivier, and they fail miserably. In their defense, however, they put forth some outstanding performances in their career, in Sands of Iwo Jima and The Shootist, to name two. The Academy decided, and even admitted afterward, that it was time to honor their career with an Oscar. Thus the award went to their body of work, not their performance, whereas the other five nominated performances were all much better for that year. Any one of them is a valid choice, but this lister prefers Richard Burton's as Henry VIII in Anne of the Thousand Days, the most regal, fearless, authoritative performance in film to date. As a result of the Academy's decision, Burton lost once again, and eventually died without one, though they might have deserved two (The Spy Who Came in from the Cold). The Academy has been accused of denying many deserved wins and nominations throughout the 1960s and 1970s from British actors, in order to honor more Americans.

There are only two fights that you need to care about this weekend. The first is that tremendous lightweight match up between the methodical pressure of Rafael dos Anjos and the erratic violence of Tony Ferguson. The second, and our focus today, is the Bellator 163 light heavyweight title fight between Liam McGeary and Phil Davis. This, along with Koreshkov versus Lima and Chandler versus Henderson, makes up Bellator's remarkable November line up.
Now Liam McGeary is intriguing for a couple of reasons. Firstly, they are a British world champion in mixed martial arts. That was quite a feat until Their Fistic Majesty, Michael Bisping, walked off a film set to send the American playboy Luke Rockhold to the mat for Blighty. Secondly, McGeary is a fighter whose sole big win came over Emanuel Newton in taking the title. Since then they had a gimme against Tito Ortiz, who in 2016 has not one victory to write home about. But the reverse triangle that they won that fight with certainly drew attention to McGeary, which had to be the point of the fight. The final reason McGeary is so fascinating is that they are a six-foot-six light heavyweight, who regularly catches opponents in submissions from their back.
How many fighters can you name in MMA who genuinely excel at attacking from their back in 2016? Now how many aren't gimmicks on the Japanese circuit? And finally, how many of them fight at middleweight or above? The silence if deafening, and that is where Liam McGeary exists. In a division of wrestlers, McGeary is happy throwing up reverse triangles and trying to tear off shoulders with Americanas from theirs back.
But McGeary has been a big fish in a small pond. Until recently the best light heavyweights in Bellator were Emanuel Newton and Muhammad Lawal. In September 2015, at the same card that McGeary submitted Tito Ortiz, Bellator held a light heavyweight tournament with an interesting twist. Bellator's regular crew was there. Lawal, Newton, Linton Vassal, but they would be competing with new arrival Phil Davis. Davis had just jumped ship from the UFC where they had fought the absolute best in the division and had decent results. Luckily Davis didn't face the same fate as Benson Henderson—a top ten lightweight who was put into a match with a welterweight, and then a featherweight on arriving in Bellator—making it impossible to draw direct comparisons between the UFC and Bellator lightweight divisions with Henderson as a current measuring stick.
In the opening round of the tournament, Davis fought Emanuel Newton. Liam McGeary had won the title from Newton over five rounds of frantic action, setting a promotional record for submissions attempted. But Davis manhandled Newton. Phil Davis' difficulties in the UFC had always come when their telegraphed takedown attempts failed, but when Davis can get a man to the floor they are a different type of animal. Newton is as wily as they come and attempted to squirm back to their feet any way they could, but Davis was always one step ahead. Take for instance this granby attempt, might have surprised any other fighter Newton has met, but Davis rode through it with uncanny grace.
The state of the bottom game in MMA, for most and particularly in the light heavyweight division, is that everyone wants to get back to their feet. Submissions just aren't that common at the highest levels of the game in 2016 and no one wants to waste time throwing up subs and losing rounds from the bottom. But trying to wall walk or perform a stand up is giving Davis exactly what they want. Davis excels at breaking opponents down with a seatbelt grip on their far arm across their back, which they can turn into a kimura. They demonstrated this beautifully against King Mo.
Here Davis breaks Lawal down as they attempt to get up, with their right arm across Lawal's back and inside their right biceps.
With Lawal's right arm pinned to the mat, Davis grips Lawal's right wrist with their left hand, then releases the seatbelt on Lawal's right arm from behind Lawal's back, transitioning to the kimura grip. From here Davis attempts an armbar as Lawal comes up.
Famously, when Davis was able to trap Tim Boetsch's arm underneath their back in the same way they were able to finish a kimura underneath Boetsch. Similarly, as Emanuel Newton got their back to the fence and began to wall walk, Davis caught one of their hands as it was posted on the floor and that was all they wrote.
Davis has had just as much success from the front headlock, a position which is readily available on many occasions as an opponent attempts to get to their knees. Davis is one of very few fighters to have two victories on their record by way of anaconda choke, one of those being over the great Alexander Gustafsson.
Here's the interesting thing though: McGeary probably can't stop Davis from taking them down, but McGeary also rarely tries to get back up. McGeary's guard game is rarely as straight forward as hand push triangles and arm drag armbars from closed guard. It is as often about what they can do while their opponent thinks they are passing their guard. Similar to the great grappler, Braulio Estima, McGeary shoots their best reverse triangles from an intermediary position with a knee shield in and a leg over the face, or a knee shield in front of the shoulder and a shin across the opponent's belly. Not what the average fighter would recognize as 'the guard' but still for all competition scoring purposes a guard.
Tony Ferguson, who also fights this weekend, has occasionally shot a reverse triangle from this intermediary non-guard.
And even if their timing is off or they miss their moment, McGeary has yet to be held down for any real length of time. Rather than powering up to their knees or turning into their opponent, McGeary will attempt things that you don't often see out of the extremely lightweight and women's divisions. For instance the Marilyn Manson escape—using control of the opponent's near hand and inserting a hook over their back.
Jessica Penne used this technique beautifully in Invicta to roll back over their shoulders and attack a crucifix.
There is nothing to say the fight must go to the ground though. Davis might not want the takedown and it is hard to imagine McGeary getting the stronger wrestler to the mat. Moreover, Davis has reason to find more confidence on the feet given their last two performances. In the second round of the light heavyweight tournament, Davis was able to catch Francis Carmont circling along the fence and knocked the Frenchman stiff.
Often when Davis is striking they look like Dominick Cruz but with none of the grit or the grace. Circling far away from the opponent, throwing mainly kicks and then the odd wide, lunging hook and ducking well off to the side. After two rounds of ineffectual work on the outside against King Mo, Davis actually got comfortable throwing combinations from within striking range. After a few sequences of doubled up kicks, Davis checked Mo's lead hand out of their mummy guard, then uncorked a one-two with the right landing over the top of Mo's and wobbling him. An uppercut connected and Davis was able to get their first takedown of the fight. Davis has power, and decent punching form and combinations when he's got their eye in and isn't too nervous to step into the pocket.
McGeary's striking has always looked dangerous, and they look like they enjoy a good tear up far more than Davis, but they are not always the most crisp. They tend to drop their hands and fight quite close in for a man of their height and reach, which can be dangerous stepping into the upper echelons of the division. Certainly against a fighter sitting back and waiting for the counter like Muhammad Lawal, it can be dangerous to give up a reach advantage through over aggression.
No one in Bellator's light heavyweight division has been able to stop a reinvigorated and confident Mr. Wonderful so far. If Liam McGeary can that will legitimize their place as at least a top ten light heavyweight in the world. But it's no mean feat—Davis hasn't been finished through their entire career despite being in with tremendous hitters like Anthony Johnson, and it is hard to even think of an occasion when they were close to being submitted.

The leader key is a useful way of creating custom mappings in Vim. While browsing code in normal mode, it can be useful to quickly toggle settings on and off or execute other commands. By defining mappings with the leader key, a short sequence of keys can be used to quickly execute commands. Check out :help <Leader> for more information on the leader key and defining mappings.
This post contains some examples from my vimrc file that are frequently helpful. These mappings should work on gVim 7.3 (probably other Vim/gVim versions too but not tested) without additional dependencies.
UPDATE: Simplified toggle commands thanks to suggestion from Reddit user Elessardan. Updated use-case info and "mapping" verbage thanks to suggestion from Reddit user -romainl-. Various simplifications and updates thanks to suggestions from this Reddit thread. Please note the GIFs still show the original mappings.
Toggle Line Wrap
Useful when working with long lines or small windows.
nnoremap < Leader > wr : set wrap ! wrap ? < CR >
Highlight Word Under Cursor
Useful for quickly identifying instances of a word. Use n or SHIFT-n to jump between matches and :noh to turn off highlighting.
" Case sensitive, partial match inclusive. nnoremap < Leader > hi : set hlsearch < CR > : let @/ = '<C-r><C-w>' < CR > " Case sensitive, no partial match. nnoremap < Leader > ho : set hlsearch < CR > : let @/ = '\<<C-r><C-w>\>' < CR > " Case insensitive, partial match inclusive. nnoremap < Leader > hu : set hlsearch < CR > : let @/ = '<C-r><C-w>\c' < CR > " Case insensitive, no partial match. nnoremap < Leader > hy : set hlsearch < CR > : let @/ = '\<<C-r><C-w>\>\c' < CR >
Toggle List (Whitespace) Display
Can be useful depending on your Vim setup. I typically use 4 spaces for indentation but some people prefer tabs. My listchars variable is set to display tabs as >· but sometimes it is nice to quickly hide the list characters (especially if editing a file where someone mixed tabs and spaces, the savage).
nnoremap < Leader > li : set list ! list ? < CR >
Zoom (Sorta)
Zooming out can be useful for navigation (like the minimap in Sublime Text). Zooming in can be useful for presentations. Keep in mind this is not really a zoom, it is just changing the font size. This can cause some strange side-effects such as changing window size and position.
" Simple zoom hacks; Ultra, Extra, Normal, Out. nnoremap < Leader > zu : set guifont = courier_new:h24 < CR > nnoremap < Leader > ze : set guifont = courier_new:h18 < CR > nnoremap < Leader > zn : set guifont = courier_new:h10 < CR > nnoremap < Leader > zo : set guifont = courier_new:h4 < CR >
Cursor Highlight
Highlighting the cursor line is pretty standard but there is a known issue in Vim which causes slowdown when long lines are highlighted; quickly toggling line highlighting can be useful. Toggling column toggling can be occasionally useful too.
nnoremap < Leader > cl : set cursorline !< CR > nnoremap < Leader > cc : set cursorcolumn !< CR > nnoremap < Leader > cx : set cursorcolumn cursorline < CR > nnoremap < Leader > cn : set nocursorline nocursorcolumn < CR >
Fix Spelling
Use this to quickly fix spelling mistakes. Use ]s and [s to jump between flagged mistakes.
nnoremap < Leader > fs 1 z =

When I see an Elephant Fly! ---> www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v2exW… This idea was thought of when I made a certain journal update about me flying through the air, (because I was on an Airplane heading to NY for the holiday).All of you responded in many different ways, from not knowing was I was talking about, to me being on drugs, to actually getting it right away!Then of course some of you conversated with me about Obi actually sprouting a pair of wings.I've actually come up with a reason to why they got the wings.......One day Obi was grazing the grass near the edge of the Everfree, when they unknowingly started eating trunk-loads of Poison Joke. They were uninformed of what it's affects were. Being a species that eats pretty much any kind of plant matter, they didn't mind the strange blue color at all, they actually thought it was mighty tasty!By the time they finished eating, they consumed over 10 pounds of the plant, still unaware of what would follow later on.The next day they woke up with quite a shock to see two giant grey wings on either side of him!(Skip ahead all the explaining and stuff.....)Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy then offered to give a flying lesson to Obi, since he's pretty much stuck with the wings for now. Might as well see how good they are.After some practice flaps and wing-motions on the ground, Obi was ready to take flight.Both ponies were doubtful that they would even be able to achieve flight, but surprisingly, defying both the laws of gravity and nature and.......aerodynamics for that matter, they got off the ground! WAY of the ground!Up to cloud level to be precise.After a while of basic flight motions like banking, pulling up, hovering, etc, Rainbow thought it would be a good time to start practicing more intense moves, like a dive.This took Fluttershy by surprise because they didn't hear what Rainbow was telling Obi from the other side of him. And so their sudden sharp downward incline startled her.This is the point of where this drawing takes place.It was the most exhilarating experience of their life, even though they were still getting used to the heights and all.He was actually thinking about eating Poising Joke all the time if this is the outcome of having it!Though they sort of preferred the humble life on the ground. So they would still eventually take that special bath that gets rid of the effects of Poison Joke. (They might have to mix it in a swimming pool for their size.)MLP:FiM is owned by Hasbro.No Copyright Infringement Intended.

Audi dealers can no longer sell five of its six diesel models, according to a stop-sale notice sent to dealers Tuesday.
New and used Audi TDI models—the 2013–2015 Q7 and 2014–2016 A6, A7, A8, A8L, and Q5—are blocked, according to the notice received by Automotive News. The company has not yet posted an official statement. The cars go beyond a second EPA-violation notice to the Volkswagen Group on Monday, which cited only the 2016 A6, A7, A8, A8L, and Q5. The new 2015–2016 A3 TDI, along with any previous-gen A3 TDI models from 2009–2013, were not included in the notice. Also Tuesday, Porsche halted sales of the 2014–2016 Cayenne Diesel and Volkswagen began a separate investigation regarding fuel-economy figures for 800,000 more cars.
Audi launched a group of TDI-engined vehicles for the 2014 model year and staged this promotional photo in Washington, D.C.
Volkswagen has not yet halted sales of the Touareg TDI, which was also named in Monday's violation notice. Audi did not elaborate whether other models, such as the first 2009–2012 Q7 TDIs, use the same emissions-cheating software. All of the vehicles use Volkswagen's 3.0-liter turbo-diesel V-6.
NANO-THIS. Nano-that. Nano-the-other. A nanometre is the name given by the scientific-measurement system to a billionth of a metre, and the idea that making things so small you measure their dimensions in nanometres will unlock advantages denied to larger objects has been around for well over a decade. Long enough, in other words, for sceptics to wonder when something useful will actually come of it.

It looks possible, though, that something useful is indeed about to happen. The evidence suggests that adding a sprinkle of nanoparticles to water can improve its thermal conductivity, and thus its ability to remove heat from something that is in contact with it, by as much as 60%. In a world where the cost of coolth is a significant economic drain (industrial cooling consumes 7% of the electricity generated within the European Union) that offers a worthwhile gain. It would, for instance, allow the huge computer-filled warehouses that drive the internet to fit in more servers per square metre of floor space.
Nanofluid cooling, as the phenomenon is known, was discovered almost two decades ago, but is only now coming out of the laboratory. According to Mamoun Muhammed of Sweden's Royal Institute of Technology, one of the field's leading researchers, three problems have stood in its way.
The first was stopping the particles sticking together and thus ceasing to be nano. That has been overcome by adding emulsifying agents such as cetrimonium bromide (originally developed as an antiseptic) to the mix.
The second problem is which particles to use. At the moment oxides of metals such as zinc and copper seem to be the favourites, but tiny tubes made of carbon are also being explored. This, in turn, raises the question of how the phenomenon actually works.
It is not simply a matter of the added ingredient (6-8% of the total volume seems to be the optimum mix) being a good conductor in its own right, though this helps. Nanofluids are better conductors than the sum of their parts. That suggests the particles are changing the structure of the water itself in ways that improve its conductivity. Water, despite its protean appearance, has a lot of internal structure, particularly when it is cool. The molecules are organised, albeit more loosely, in ways that resemble the material's solid form, ice. Nanoparticles inevitably alter this arrangement, and that may make the mix better able to transmit heat. If the changes involved were understood, picking the right size and composition of nanoparticle would be less a matter of guesswork.
The biggest problem about moving from laboratory to industry, though, is the question of scale. As the quantities increase, the way things mix and react alters a lot. That makes it hard to predict from small-scale experiments what will happen in a commercial setting.
If these problems can be overcome, though, a bright future beckons, and some of the nanohype that has been swirling around might actually get translated into a useful product.
A former Chinese official involved in a sex tape scandal was sentenced to 13 years in prison for bribery on Friday, China's official Xinhua news agency reported.
BEIJING, June 28 (RIA Novosti) – A former Chinese official involved in a sex tape scandal was sentenced to 13 years in prison for bribery on Friday, China's official Xinhua news agency reported.
Lei Zhengfu, a former district committee secretary, was also ordered to pay a $48,500 fine.
They provided help to local companies in exchange for bribes from March 2007 to November 2012, the court said in a statement.
Zhengfu, 55, was accused of accepting 3 million yuan (about $490,000) in bribes from a property developer after being blackmailed by a man who conspired with others to lure officials into having sex with women and secretly recorded their encounters in order to blackmail them. The official used the money they received in bribes to pay off the blackmailer, the court said.
In November 2012, Zhengfu was fired and expelled from the Communist Party after a tape of them having sex with an 18-year-old woman, who had reportedly been sent to them as a bribe, went viral on the Internet. The hotel room sex screenshots were titled, "Lei, the secretary who accepts sex bribes."
In late May, six members of the gang that had recorded the sex tapes were charged with extortion.
In January 2013, a total of 10 government officials and heads of state-owned enterprises in the city of Chongqing, southwest China, were dismissed after being featured in sex videos.

My Second Dog was........FREE..... And I loved them beyond measure. They traveled with me as I moved all over the U.S. I paid pet deposites on rental houses... I spent thousands of dollars on vets when they got a rare disease. They went on dates with me.. they went to work with me... they slept by my bed, ate the best of foods... was the envy of many who stopped to say how cool they are... And I thought my heart would never ever mend when they died at age 14.My Third Dog was.... NOT FREE....I paid $20 for them and I loved him... played with him... fed them the best foods.. paid their vet bills... they slept by the bed, kept me company on long walks... and I cried till I could cry no more when they passed away at 13.My Fourth Dog was.....FREE... I picked them up lost and abandoned on the side of the freeway... I didn't need or particularly want a second dog at the time.... But I loved him... played with him.. fed them the best foods.. Paid for veterinary care and later when they had severe arthitis, spent many hundreds on suppliments to keep them comfortable till I had to have them laid to rest at 14. And I cried... and thanked God for the stranger that came to stay with us for so many years.My Fifth Dog ... My CURRENT Dog... was..... NOT FREE..... I paid $80 for him... And I love him.. and I play with him.. and I pay the vet when they need it.. and they sleep by my bed, and they get the best of foods, and they follow me everywhere and I hope that we will get to love them for many more years until it's time for them to pass on and we will cry and our hearts will break and we will miss him.Somewhere in this short story of my life with dogs... And I could easily write another much longer story about my life with many, many horses... some free.. some rescued.. some paid a small price for and some paid a high price for... Somewhere in the stories... I hope is a lesson.Every animal in my care... for whatever reason it came and at whatever cost.... Got the same kind of care. They got the BEST care I could give... and sometimes... because of sacrifice.. they got better care than prudently affordable or necessary. Did it matter the price I paid for them?.... IT DID NOT!..... Nor will it ever. And I seriously doubt it matters in many other homes across the world... People either value their pets or they don't... I have seen just as many neglected pets and livestock come from "rich" homes as I have poor.It is not the money that takes care of an animal... It is the heart of the people or person they live with. The poorest person will find a way if they love enough.If you ask me... charging a high fee to "ensure a good home", is just a lazy persons way out of not feeling guilty for the fact that they do not want to take enough time to find out if the home they are selling their pet to is adequate. It's a lot easier to take someones money and tell yourself that you did the right thing, than it is to take the time to get to know someone, or to go look at their home.. or to draw up an agreement on their care with a return clause, to get references and to follow up with checks over the next days, weeks and months.To take this argument to the ridiculous.... One of my children was born when we had really great insurance and guess what?... They were ... FREE!..... My Second child, we didn't have good insurance.... They cost... ALOT!!!... I wonder if we are less of a good home for the first one?.... Maybe I should love the second one a bit more since they cost so much?...This is long... but hopefully the message is clear.... Money can buy a lot of things... and certainly you should ask prospective homes if they can afford the upkeep of a pet... even go as far as to list out some of the expenses....But take the time to make sure you are finding a good home... don't use making money as a cop-out to get out of your responsibilities.You may find... that the most loving thing you can do for your pet is to place them in a home for.... Free...I will give you a flip side to the situation... when you need to rehome your pet... when you are "desperately seeking good home asap"... Letting someone "rescue" you from your situation... can give them a sense of pride for doing something good for both animal and human... that is a value that is much greater than money and may in the end go the farthest towards giving your pet a great life.Thank you for reading this.. I hope it is taken in good spirit and gives another point of view on the subject of "rehoming fees"... God Bless
RALEIGH – Gov. Roy Cooper's pick to lead the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services was unanimously approved at a Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday morning.
Dr. Mandy Cohen is the fourth member of the governor's cabinet to be approved during a Senate committee hearing.
The hearing process was deemed constitutional by a three-judge panel after Cooper sued top Republican lawmakers for making such confirmation hearings legal.
At Wednesday's hearing, many senators mentioned Cohen is well qualified for the position but questions about their role with the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid came up.
One in particular was about the launch of the ACA, which Cohen said was a career defining moment for them They went on to say it's not about technology. It's about people and it's about transparency.
“Well, you know, the last eight weeks I've been spending my time learning North Carolina, meeting folks with the General Assembly, trying to understand what are the key issues to them,” said Cohen. “I think that's why you saw we already established a good working relationship and I'm looking forward to working with them.”
Cohen said she's excited there's a good partnership.
Miami FC finally met a U.S. Open Cup opponent it couldn't beat — Mother Nature.
Torrential rain and a severe thunder and lightning storm postponed Wednesday night's quarterfinal match between NASL Spring champion Miami FC and FC Cincinnati, an endearing United Soccer League team that drew 32,000 fans for its last match.
The game, scheduled for 7:30 p.m., was finally called at 9:30 p.m. as the deluge and lightning continued. Officials of the teams were in contact with the U.S. Soccer Federation, considering options for a makeup date.
Both teams have league road games on Saturday and are traveling Thursday, so the makeup game will not be before next week. Officials of Miami FC, FC Cincinnati, FIU and U.S. Soccer Federation are expected to decide on a date sometime Thursday. Tickets from Wednesday's game will be valid for the makeup game.

A Miami FC-record crowd of 10,000-plus (including a few hundred fans who traveled from Cincinnati) was expected at FIU's Riccardo Silva Stadium for the clash between the only two non-Major League Soccer teams left in the 99-team knockout tournament, which includes amateur, semi-pro and professional clubs.
⚡ WEATHER UPDATE ⚡ Annnnnnnd we're officially on a weather delay. No official start time has been set; stay tuned for updates... #MIAvCIN A post shared by FC Cincinnati (@fccincinnati) on Jul 12, 2017 at 3:53pm PDT
“Advance sales were well ahead of the Atlanta game [which drew 9,004], the buzz was phenomenal, but it's South Florida in the summer, unfortunately, and we get these weather patterns,” Miami FC CEO Sean Flynn said. “We tried to get the match in, but there came a point where we had to call it off. It's disappointing for us, our supporters, Cincinnati, U.S. Soccer, but we're going to play the match, and our goal is to have that match here at Riccardo Silva Stadium.”
Thousands of fans ranging from soggy to drenched sprinted through puddles into the stadium despite the downpour and lightning display, which lit up the sky every two to three minutes for several hours.
They waited, and waited, and waited. They drank beer. They bought $5 Miami FC rain ponchos. And they danced. A lot.
In true Miami fashion, the fans turned a disastrous soccer evening into a party. D.J. Cuban Pete, under a tent in the north concourse, was the Most Valuable Player of the night, delighting the crowd with salsa, pop, rap music and rock anthems such as AC/DC's “You Shook Me All Night Long”.
Miami FC soccer players wait for a weather delay before the start of the Miami FC and FC Cincinnati game during the US Open Cup quarterfinals on Wed., July 12, 2017. The game was postponed and will be made up at a later date. AL DIAZ adiaz@miamiherald.com
When the game was finally postponed, the north concourse had transformed into a makeshift dance club.
“The party in the north concourse was amazing; people didn't want to leave,” Flynn said. “You gotta love our fans. Through rain or shine or lightning, they stayed strong. The buzz was palpable, and they were ready to have a good time. Now , it's going to build some more. The suspense will carry on. I just hope all those fans bring those tickets back for the makeup game.”
Flynn said the players were anxious all night, hoping they could get the game in.
The match was billed as a battle between two of the most surprising teams in American pro soccer.
Both teams play in second-division leagues and were coming off back-to-back upsets of Major League Soccer opponents. They guaranteed that a Division 2 team will be in the U.S. Open semifinal for the first time since 2011.
The winner of the Miami-Cincinnati match will play the winner of Thursday's quarterfinal between the New England Revolution and New York Red Bulls.
Semifinal matches are scheduled for Aug. 9 and the Cup final is Sept. 20.
Fans who lost their Wednesday tickets can call the Miami FC office at 844-MIAMIFC and they will be re-issued with proof of purchase.

My Grandfather is turning 100 in a few weeks and the whole family is getting together to celebrate! Some of the people coming I have not seen in years and I am very excited. Wow – turning 100 – you don't see that every day!
So I need to bring a gift. What on Earth do you buy for a person turning 100? What do you really NEED at 100?  They are in good health, and doing remarkably well, but they sleep a lot and doesn't have a TON of energy – so what could they possibly want or need? The exercycle seems to be out, and skydiving lessons might not be spot on. They don't want to leave the house much less go on a trip to Europe, so that kind of scratches those ideas. Well – I will go get a cup of tea and let you think on it for a while – if you have any great ideas let me know…
…Thought of anything? Me neither… But wait a minute. You see a lot in 100 years. Their grandfather never owned a car – but drove a horse and buggy until the day they died. Women still wore corsets the year they were born, and their father was the FIRST president of the town electric company – first because there was no need of a president of the town electric company before them – because there was no electric company! So maybe, just maybe, they would like a remembrance of their life!
When my son was born, some sadistic person gave me an eight generation family tree chart – blank of course and I started working on it. I only really knew up to my grandparents and a few of my great grandparent's names – so I asked my relatives and my husband's relatives for any information that they had to help me fill out this &*%& chart. I got some interesting replies! It seems that there were people in the family who didn't WANT to tell me about the past – I guess some of those relatives of ours weren't very nice. Seriously, all I wanted was their names, birth and death dates and where they lived – I didn't want to know their dirty laundry!! But doors slammed in my face at every turn.
Except for Grandpa. They sent me this huge box just brimming with pictures and mementos from their family and their own research into their family's roots. They and I e-mailed back and forth as we worked on the project together and with their help, I finished Their 8 generation portion years before I even made a dent in the rest of the tree.
So what if I gathered all the information that I had gotten over the years together into one book, and then put my recently acquired bookbinding skills to use and make it pretty? I attended a fabulous bookbinding class at the American Academy of Bookbinding in July and was anxious to try out my new skills. (FYI the AAB class was worth every penny and every moment – if you have a chance to take a class there DO! You won't regret it!)
So I dug in my closet, contacted my relatives, swore them to secrecy and enlisted their help to make the book. First I complied the information into some semblance of order:
And once done and edited, printed it out on some beautiful French paper by Ingress using Word's booklet feature. Since the paper didn't absorb the inks well – I had to manually print both sides of the paper allowing for extra drying time.
Tip-Ins
Because I wanted this to look “old fashioned” I used acid free tissue paper to make “tip ins” to cover the main pictures in the book. I did this before sewing the book so that the extra bulk of the tissue paper wouldn't affect the swell on the spine or the closing of the book.
I also found a copy of my Grandfather's college newspaper from 1936. They were actually quoted in it in one of the opinion columns so I printed it out in miniature and created a way to put it into the book as well using a little pocket of the text paper to hold it in place. The newspaper was printed on very, very thin acid free copy paper to mimic the consistency of newsprint.
Equipment
Since my class, I had purchased some inexpensive bookbinding equipment from (aptly named) affordablebindingequipment.com and wanted to give it a test drive. I highly recommend their punching cradle, sewing frame and finishing press with ALL of its accessories (backing boards and lacing attachments). I will be saving my pennies to get a better plough and book press – but for the cost they are acceptable too, and will certainly hold me over until I can afford fancier ones!
Printing on Leather
One of the cool things I figured out how to do was to print on leather. I don't know how to gold tool yet and I really wanted something on the front and spine of the book. So I decided to see if my printer could print on leather, so I grabbed a goat and shoved it through the printer… (Just kidding, I was checking to see if you were paying attention!)
To do this, I went to word and created the labels I wanted in the sizes I wanted and then printed them out on standard copy paper. After checking to make sure that they were the right size and everything was spelled right – I printed a second copy making sure to note which way the paper went into the printer. Then, I Schärffixed a small piece of leather very, very fine and about ¼ inch on each side larger than the label. Using a glue stick, I lightly glued the edges outside of the label area, sticking the leather down over the printed parts of the paper.
Then I fed the paper back through the printer, printing the labels again. Using a rotary cutter – I cut the labels out and since the part of the leather that was printed on had no glue on it – the paper just fell away – leaving me a thin leather label ready to affix.
The only question that remained was were the labels waterproof and smudge proof enough to be pasted to the book and stand up to normal wear and tear? I did a lot of tests, both using my laser printer and my ink jet printer and the results were pretty good. Once they had fully dried from the printer, they did not smudge with normal touching and when I pasted them on the cover and dampened with a wet sponge, they did not run or rub off. I am not sure they would hold up to constant wear, tugging and touching with dirty fingers, but I don't usually let my books be treated that way anyway. I even was able to print in color on the inkjet.
Obviously, this works better on light colors of leather and the leather does need to be pared very, very fine. I am looking forward to using this technique for lots of things in the future – as I think it will open lots of opportunities for book design for me.
I made a presentation box by covering an existing box that I had that was the right size with leather and the left over paper I used for the flyleaves, and now the book is ready for Grandpa's birthday. I do hope they enjoy it!
If not, I can always get them those skydiving lessons…
