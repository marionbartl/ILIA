It's no surprise when a Disney film is met with critical and commercial success, but after winning an Academy Award and the title of highest grossing animated picture of all time, it's safe to say that Frozen is impressive even by Disney's high standards. Storyboard artists Jeff Ranjo (Frozen, Surf's Up, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs), Fawn Veerasunthorn (Frozen, Hop, El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera), Nicole Mitchell (Frozen, Wreck-it Ralph, Winnie the Pooh) and Normand Lemay (Frozen, Rio) were on hand at WonderCon today to give a behind-the-scenes look at the art of storyboarding and the process of crafting story for an animated film.
Hit the jump to learn some Frozen movie secrets and for highlights of the panel.
FROZEN – The Art of the Story WonderCon Panel Recap:
The group kicked things off by explaining the job of a story board artist. They described the process of storyboarding as translating ideas to make the story as clear as possible in the most entertaining way. The storyboard artist also attempts to manipulate the audience into feeling things without them being aware of it.
The group kicked things off by explaining the job of a story board artist. They described the process of storyboarding as translating ideas to make the story as clear as possible in the most entertaining way. The storyboard artist also attempts to manipulate the audience into feeling things without them being aware of it. They noted that there is no “Disney” style to storyboarding. Each artist has their own visual style and they often collaborate on the same storyboard.
Normand Lemay presented a storyboard version the “meet the trolls” scene where Anna and Elsa's parents race to the trolls for help when Anna comes down with a serious case of brain freeze. They said it was very important story telling decision that only Anna's memory of magic be erased, not the memory of their relationship with Elsa.
An earlier version of the story included a prophecy which warned that a leader with a frozen heart would destroy the kingdom, the trolls were a more subtle an interesting way to present that warning.
Fawn Veerasunthorn presented various versions of the “sister split” sequence when Anna confronts Elsa at the coronation. Some noticeable differences: Initially Anna and Hans were not engaged, rather Anna approached Elsa alone, telling them that they just met a guy who might “really like her”, and asked that Elsa give Hans a job. This seemed too much like Anna was talking about an “imaginary boyfriend”.
In the end, they decided that if Anna and Hans were engaged it would cause more of the threat that Elsa might lose their sister. Hans was then added to the sequence and framed as a visual representation of the rift between the sisters.
In the end, they decided that if Anna and Hans were engaged it would cause more of the threat that Elsa might lose their sister. Hans was then added to the sequence and framed as a visual representation of the rift between the sisters. This scene also incorporates two of the films most important pieces of imagery: the closed door that represents Anna's loneliness and the gloves that represent Elsa's emotional repression.
We were then showed another alternate version of the confrontation with different dialogue. After Elsa refuses to give the marriage their blessing Anna insists they don't need their blessing anyway shouting “You're not my mother!” To which Elsa replies “I may not be your mother, but I am your queen.” It was a very sassy exchange that generated a lot of oohs and ahs from the audience.
At the end of this version Anna screamed, “You're a mean queen!” This line was omitted because it didn't speak to Elsa's true vulnerability – they were never worried about being an unkind queen.
Next up Jeff Ranjo introduced to the storyboard of Olaf's big number “In Summer”. The storyboard and final version were nearly identical, the main difference being that Olaf wore a hat through much of the storyboarded version. Ranjo said they were given a lot of Olaf's scenes because they excel at comedic action, and in the end they felt like Olaf was their baby.
Ranjo worked with songwriters Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez via Skype while storyboarding the song, saying they had a lot of influence throughout the process.
Ranjo worked with songwriters Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez via Skype while storyboarding the song, saying they had a lot of influence throughout the process. Ranjo also pointed out that songs are particularly difficult to storyboard. Having done them a number of times for Disney, their process relies on letting the music guide him. They listen to the songs on repeat during their hour and a half commute to and from work to pick up on cues for action.
Olaf was originally intended to carry a snow globe that represented the good in Elsa. That detail was cut because the film was getting overloaded with symbols and it seemed odd for them to carry it around for the whole movie.
Nicole Mitchell then introduced the scene that leads into the climax of the movie where Olaf convinces Anna not to give up hope. They cited the scene as an example of how they try to push the characters to their lowest point for the biggest payoff and resolution.
They said it was important that Olaf be the one that convinced Anna not to give up, because it earned their place in the film. As much as they loved Olaf they weren't always sure they were going to end up in the movie.
The panel ended with a side-by-side comparison of “Let it Go” as seen in the movie and the original storyboard. Compared to the others we saw, this storyboard most closely resembled the final scene. All the key moments were the same. The only major differences were that the story boarded version began on a close-up rather than the slow zoom, had multiple instances of Elsa falling to their knees in the snow, and when they let their hair down it wasn't the glorious braid we all know and love, just flowing long hair.

over the horrific attack, in which James Holmes is accused of killing twelve people and injuring 58. Now, however, two suits have been filed against the theater's owner by a total of three surviving victims. The documents, on view below, juxtapose legal demands with harrowing accounts of the massacre.
One suit is filed under the names of two people, Denise Traynom and Brandon Axelrod, while the second lists Joshua Nowlan as the plaintiff. However, the defendant in each is the same -- Cinemark USA, doing business as the Century Aurora 16. And the law firm is identical, too: It's Denver-based Keating Wagner Polidori Free, P.C. The suits were filed in United States District Court for the District of Colorado.
The "General Allegations" sections of the documents are also similar. The suits maintain that Cinemark "had information that previous disturbances, incidents, disruptions and other criminal activities had taken place at or near the property of the theater" prior to the deadly July 20 midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises, during which the assault took place. Moreover, the suits continue, "These incidents most commonly took place during the evening hours" and included "at least one shooting, involving gang members," as well as assaults and robberies.
Because of such problems, the suits note that the Century 16 had regularly hired various security personnel to work at the theater, including off-duty Aurora police officers -- but they were typically on duty only Friday and Saturday nights. An exception: On July 19, the suit says officers were on hand for the transfer of box-office cash -- but not for the midnight screenings, when huge throngs descended on the theater to attend one of the year's most anticipated movie launches.
Moreover, the suits continue, the exterior doors to the theater lacked "any alarm system, interlocking security systems, or any other security or alarm features which would have put Defendant's employees or security personnel on notice that someone had surreptitiously left the theater by the exterior door and had put the door in an open position which would facilitate a surreptitious and unlawful re-entry" -- precisely what Holmes is thought to have done. And neither did the theater have procedures in place to prevent anyone from taking this action, the complaint maintains.
What follows in both suits is a speculative account of how Holmes purchased a ticket, entered the theater, propped open the door, gathered their deadly arsenal from their nearby car and readied for the attack. But they diverge when it comes to what happened to the plaintiffs.
Continue to read accounts about victims suing the Aurora Century 16 and to see the complaints. Traynom and Axelrod are said to have been seated in auditorium nine of the Century 16 in the upper level area. As the attack began, with Holmes allegedly throwing tear-gas canisters into the theater and then opening fire, they ducked down behind seats as others tried to escape -- but they didn't evade injury. Traynom was "shot in the gluteus maximus," while Axelrod "suffered significant orthopedic injuries to their right knee and ankle" in addition to the "emotional and psychological distress and trauma" both of them endured.
No wonder, because, the suit continues, "Plaintiffs lay helpless on the ground for many minutes, while the gunman continued shooting people" until "his weapon jammed."
And Nowlan? He, too, was seated in the upper level of auditorium nine, and they also ducked behind seats as others around them fled. But they wound up being shot in their arm so seriously that the limb was almost severed, the lawsuit says. In addition, they were shot in their left leg, forcing himi to remain laying on the theater floor with gunfire ringing out. Meanwhile, "the movie continued to play, and the houselights remained very low or off." No alarm was activated and "there was no action taken by theater employees to safely evacuate the many people left in Auditorium 9," the suit states.
In the end, Nowlan was assisted by members of the Aurora Police Department, who removed them from the theater. The suit adds: "Because there were no ambulances available, those police officers put Mr. Nowlan in an Aurora patrol car and drove them to the hospital themselves." Since then, the complaint goes on, they "has undergone significant medical treatment for their many injuries, including several surgeries, skin-grafting procedures, muscle replacement and the like. They will continue to require significant medical assistance for their injuries and has been unable to return to work through the date of filing of this complaint."
The claims for relief in the lawsuits center on premises liability and negligence. The defendant is asked to pay a judgment that "will fully and fairly compensate" for "damages, losses and injuries, both past and future."
Here are the two lawsuits.

Mayor Rob Ford is firing back at Sarah Thomson, saying “disgusting” allegations they made that they grabbed their buttocks at a function in downtown Toronto are “absolutely, completely false.”
“What is more surprising is that a woman who has aspired to be a civic leader would cry wolf on a day where we should be celebrating women across the globe,” Mayor Ford said in a statement released Friday afternoon, referring to the fact that it is International Women's Day.
“This is a day we should all take the time to reflect upon the women in our lives and in our society. It is a day when we can envision the changes we want to make in our communities to ensure that all people are equal and that violence and discrimination against women comes to an end.”
The alleged incident happened during the Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee Action Party on Bay Street Thursday night.
Ms. Thomson, who took to Facebook to publicize what happened, says their interaction with the mayor began friendly enough. They asked them why they did not attend a round table they hosted recently.
“He said oh, ‘I was in Florida, you should have been with me, my wife wasn't there.' And I kinda did a double take because usually Mayor Ford is professional, he's a gentleman, and they don't act that way,” they told reporters outside city hall, in between various media interviews. “So, I kinda did a double take and someone said get a picture, so we got a picture, and they put their hand down and grabbed my ass. It was just so offensive.”
Carmine Perrelli, who represents Richmond Hill's Ward 2, said Ms. Thomson told them and a group of people at the event about the mayor grabbing them But they said Ms. Thomson has left out the part when they talked about returning to the mayor and trying to get a photo of their hand coming into contact with their friend or assistant's derriere.
“She said I'm going to set them up and I'm going to use the pictures against them in the next election because I'm going to be the Mayor of Toronto,” said Mr. Perrelli.
Councillor Greg Beros, another Richmond Hill city councillor, said they also heard Ms. Thomson discuss a plan to go upstairs and stage a photo. “I said Sarah, I don't think that's a very good idea,” said Mr. Beros. Ms. Thomson was not immediately available to respond.
Both Richmond Hill councillors said they did not see the mayor drinking alcohol and said they hardly moved from a corner, where a steady stream of people approached them to take photos.
In the earlier interview, Ms. Thomson said they thought the mayor might have a substance abuse problem, but later Friday they recanted that description. “I have no idea what they were on. I have no idea whether they were drunk, whether they were sober but they were not the Rob Ford we all know,” they said.
Mr. Ford's Chief of Staff, Mark Towhey, told Newstalk 1010 that the Mayor had not had anything to drink that night except “three or four glasses of water.”
“I know that the three staff members never heard any of the comments that she's alleged,” Mr. Towhey told Newstalk. “I know that the mayor was in Florida with their wife and children last week and I know I was about 20 feet away watching most of this happening during the evening.”
They also told Newstalk they were seeking legal counsel on the matter.
Ms. Thomson said they do not plan to press charges, but they want the mayor to apologize for their actions.
“This being International Women's Day, I could just sit quietly and accept that. As a woman growing up, I had to deal with a lot of that, and I started the Women's Post Magazine to really confront that so I just couldn't let it go,” they said.
“I've taken a lot of flak for it, and it's hard for women to do this, and I understand how hard it can be, and you know, I've dealt with that before and saying this shouldn't happen. When you have a working relationship with somebody, they shouldn't be able to do that. Just because you're at a party, doesn't mean you can act that way against another woman.”
They insisted this has nothing to do with politics. “I have no gain out of this. If anything [people] will probably think, oh they overreacted, whatever. That will happen, and that does happen around issues sexual assault.”
President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE boasted on Friday about their "very powerful" use of Twitter, saying that it allowed them to sidestep the news media and deliver their message directly to supporters.
"The Fake News Media hates when I use what has turned out to be my very powerful Social Media — over 100 million people! I can go around them," they tweeted.
The Fake News Media hates when I use what has turned out to be my very powerful Social Media - over 100 million people! I can go around them — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 16, 2017
Trump has long used Twitter to comment on the news and announce policy decisions. They have argued that the social media site allows them to skirt traditional news sources that they claim treat them unfairly.
The president also frequently assails news outlets that cover them and their administration critically as "fake news."
J.P. Morgan Loving Their Market Manipulation Handiwork
The following research paper was compiled as the basis for a radio interview with Patrick Timpone at One Radio Network .
Morgan is the quintessential leviathan in the Interest Rate arena through their obscenely sized Medium-Term Interest Rate Swap book which stood at 59 Trillion at June 30, 2008 .
The interest rate swap book, due to its sheer size, overwhelms the bond complex by creating artificial demand for government securities. This interest rate suppressive activity began in earnest back in the 1990's and has kept market rates of interest at artificially low levels. The FUNDAMENTAL [and ongoing] MISPRICING of CAPITAL – for many years – has led to a myriad of economic excesses like the Dot Com boom, subsequent housing boom and the financial asset boom itself.
Morgan's overbearing effect in the interest rate complex required the simultaneous suppression of the gold price. This was done to make falsified inflation data seem credible. It has often been said that, “if real inflation heats up – BOND VIGILANTES would raise market rates of interest reflective of real inflation”. The reality folks, the BOND VIGILANTES are extinct – they lost their jobs long ago – being swallowed by the black hole that is J.P. Morgan's derivatives book. This is documented in a laundry list of articles archived at Kirbyanalytics.com
In the energy area [crude] – J.P. Morgan was “granted” the rights to, effectively, set up the Central Bank of Iraq in Dec. 2003:
J.P. Morgan Chase was chosen by the Coalition Provisional Authority [CPA] to “set up” the NEW Central Bank of Iraq [specifically, the Trade Bank of Iraq ]. Take note how this TRADE BANK only became operational in December of 2003:
 Trade Finance. The Trade Bank of Iraq (TBI) was established in July 2003 to facilitate trade of goods and services to and from Iraq by providing irrevocable letters of credit. The TBI officially became fully operational in December 2003 and has a services contract with a multi-international banking consortium led by JP Morgan Chase. Since opening in December , the Trade Bank of Iraq has issued or has pending 183 letters of credit, totaling $708.9 million in imports from thirty-one countries. Letters of credit have been issued on behalf of Iraqi Ministries as well as several state-owned enterprises.
In that capacity , Morgan was charged with developing the framework of collateralizing movable and immovable property for the nation of Iraq
When we take a look at “The Administrator's Weekly Report” – Feb. 28 – March 5, 2004 where it's all neatly explained for us:
V. LAY FOUNDATIONS FOR AN OPEN ECONOMY
Provide IG Staff Capability; Trade Bank ; WTO Observer Status; Draft Intellectual Property law to IGC by April 15, 2004; Develop Framework for Collateralizing Movable and Immovable Property
Here's What They Did:
I'd now like to draw your attention to a research paper published just last week by the good folks over at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission [CFTC]:
CFTC's Office of the Chief Economist Releases Study on “Market Growth, Trader Participation and Pricing in Energy Futures Markets”
Washington , D.C. — The Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) Office of the Chief Economist today released a study titled “ Market Growth, Trader Participation and Pricing in Energy Futures Markets .” This study provides an analysis of the composition of traders across different energy futures contract maturities and addresses questions relating to price discovery in these markets. Specifically,
 The authors use CFTC data on futures trader positions to document major changes in the size and term structure of the U.S. crude oil (WTI) futures market. The authors find that as recently as 2000, trading activity in this market was heavily concentrated in nearby contracts. Since then, overall open interest has grown two-fold, with trader activity at the back end of the term structure increasing more than twice as much as the market as a whole.
 The market growth in long-term (more than three years) positions generally started in 2004, which coincides with the growth in participation by commodity swap dealers.
We know Morgan was a major player because they admit it and brag about it:
To get your head around how ole J.P. Morgan trades energy futures, we need look no further than their own web site , [ article has since been removed from J.P. Morgan's site ] where they're more than happy to tell us,
Risk magazine, January 2006
J.P. Morgan was named Risk magazine's Energy derivatives house of the year in their January issue. According to Risk , "J.P. Morgan has emerged as a key player in energy derivatives over the past year." Since 2004, under the guidance of Beau Taylor, global co-head of Energy, the firm has built a leading energy trading practice. Focus has extended from natural gas and crude exotic derivatives to include electricity, coal and emissions trading. [RK bold emphasis]
They wear it like a badge of honor, don't they? To “borrow” a cliché [pun intended] - these guys really are good, aren't they?
The selling of “long dated” oil futures [ by guess who? ] began in earnest in 2004. We know this because the CFTC has told us. Long dated futures [similar to long dated bonds or Medium-Term Interest Rate Swaps] is where EXPECTATIONS are formed about the future price of commodities.
And we all know how important expectations are, where inflation is concerned, to folks like Chopper Ben Bernanke.
We all read and hear from officialdom that the prospects for inflation, while elevated somewhat recently, always remain anchored and/or subdued on a forward looking basis:
….if the public experiences a spell of inflation higher than their long-run expectation, but their long-run expectation of inflation changes little as a result, then inflation expectations are well anchored. If, on the other hand, the public reacts to a short period of higher-than-expected inflation by marking up their long-run expectation considerably, then expectations are poorly anchored. ~ FED Chairman, Ben Bernanke, July 10, 2007
In this speech titled, Inflation Expectations and Inflation Forecasting , Mr. Bernanke goes on at length about the influence that ‘expectations' have on inflation but they fail [intentionally, perhaps?] to mention its true cause :
“Inflation is a phenomenon caused by the increase of money supply relative to the growth of production capacity for goods and services.”
Having firmly established themselves in the crude oil marketplace, in Dec. 2005 J.P. Morgan moved on to the Natural Gas Arena:

Michigan had a very scary start to its Big Ten tournament road trip when its plane skidded off the runway due to high winds.
Our team and everyone in our travel party is safe. Update on today's travel accident.

On Wednesday morning, the National Weather Service issued a warning for southeastern Michigan that included:
Sustained winds of 35 to 40 mph with gusts of 45 to near 60 mph are ongoing.
Further intensification of winds is anticipated over the next several hours. Wind gusts up to 65 mph will be possible at times between Noon and 5 PM local time.
As of Wednesday afternoon, over 400,000 people were without power in the metro Detroit area due to issues like fallen trees. The team is scheduled to play Thursday at noon, and the drive to Washington, D.C., from Ann Arbor is about 9.5 hours. At this point everyone on the Wolverines' squad would likely rather drive after this situation.
Hopefully they get there safely.
It's Britain's biggest warship (Picture: PA)
The Queen has officially welcomed the UK's new warship HMS Queen Elizabeth – its biggest ever – into the Royal Navy fleet.
At 280 metres long and with an estimated half a century working life, the £3,100,000,000 behemoth aircraft carrier is the biggest and most powerful warship ever built by the UK.

Accompanied by the Princess Royal, the Queen arrived on board the ship at Portsmouth Naval Base using a specially installed lift to bring them up to the hangar for the occasion.
Wearing a purple outfit, they were led onboard by the ship's commanding officer Captain Jerry Kyd.
Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson also attended the commissioning ceremony, to witness the behemoth battleship being welcomed into the fleet.

‘The final captain of this ship has yet to be born.
‘We have been working, the Navy has been working, the Ministry of Defence has been wroking to get it ready for the last 20 years.
‘This is a very important moment.'

The HMS Queen Elizabeth currently has a crew of around 700, but this will go up to 1,600 once the full complement of F-35B jets and Crowsnest helicopters are embarked.
Its flight deck is 280 metres long and 70 metres wide – big enough to fit three football pitches.
Onboard there is a huge a medical centre with a 12-bed ward, staffed with GPs, a nurse and medical assistants. There is also a dentist and a dental nurse.
The First Sea Lord has heralded the arrival of the ‘enormously flexible big grey ship' at the commissioning ceremony.
There are also five gyms on the warship – including a boxing gym – as well as a chapel.

Speaking aboard the ship, Admiral Sir Philip Jones said: ‘We have been on a long complicated, but committed journey to get to this point and commissioning the ship is a key milestone.'
They added: ‘The The point of the big grey ship is it's enormously big, flexible, capable and adaptable.

‘I think the key thing about the Queen Elizabeth class is the range of aircraft it can carry, fixed and rotary wing and they can be configured for humanitarian disaster relief operations, non-combatant evacuations and if needs be to deploy sovereign air power at the Government's choosing.'

The most significant part of the ceremony was when the Blue Ensign was pulled down, and the White Ensign was hoisted above the warship -indicating that the ship is now officially on active duty.
This signifies that the ship is officially part of the Royal Navy.
Speaking ahead of the ceremony, Able Seaman Ellie Smith, a 20-year-old sailor from Hull, said they were pleased to have been given the task.
‘This is something to look back on for the rest of our lives and we can say “I was there”, which will be a really good thing to be able to say,' they said.

‘I am excited to say the least,' they said. ‘This is my first ship, straight out of training, and just to have the honour of cutting the cake on commissioning day… It is exciting stuff.'
The cake itself has been created by Scottish company 3D Cakes, and took more than 100 hours to make.
It's a massive edible replica of a ship, which weighs around 150kg and required more than 7kg of flour and 160 eggs to make.

‘So we should look at our British industry, our designers, all the skills, all the production companies around the country, the shipyards from Devon through to Fife, to the Royal Navy, who have come together to make this happen.
‘We should be really proud as a country. This has been a national endeavour. It has just been fantastic – it is really a culmination of all our hard work.'

The aircraft carrier will now be the nation's flagship. It can be pressed into action for various tasks, such as high-intensity war fighting, or providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief.
It will also serve as a floating military base for the F-35B stealth fighter jets, which will launch from the deck of the vessel to undertake missions.
Captain Kyd added that hosting the Queen and having their step on board the ship for the ceremony was a ‘complete honour'.
Petty Officer Dean Allen, the chef in charge of cooking the royal lunch agreed, saying that making food for the Queen is an experience that cannot be beaten.

After the ceremony, Them Majesty will enjoy a three-course lunch on board the ship.
‘I don't think you can go bigger than feeding the Queen… It's the biggest catering moment of my career,' the 37-year-old said.
‘The chefs are buzzing – they can't wait. They have been looking forward to [today] for a long time – the commissioning, and feeding the Queen.'

In the last decade and a half, the Movember Foundation has raised well over $750 million in funds for men's health and has helped raise awareness of prostate cancer, testicular cancer, the importance of mental health, and suicide prevention.
The nonprofit has become one of the top 50 NGOs in the world, as reported by INC.
The organization says that its goal is, by 2030, to significantly reduce the number of men who die from prostate cancer by more than half.
Movember's challenge to participants is a month-long initiative for men to shave their mustaches completely for the beginning of the new month of November, and to shape the mustache over time to take a striking look to spark conversations on the mustache — and more importantly, on the mission to raise awareness of men's health.

Out of the box, the 2017 Ford F-150 is quick. Thanks to its torquey 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine and fast-shifting 10-speed auto, it has no problem laying down impressive acceleration times. But with some modifications, the F-150 can become a serious drag machine.
Brew City Boost, a tuning shop in Wisconsin, got its hands on a 3.5-liter 2017 F-150, and modified it with a tune, a methanol injection, and other new intake and exhaust components. The crew then took the truck to the drag strip to see how it would perform, and boy did it lay down some times.
Running on E50 fuel and with 18 psi of boost, this F-150 ultimately set a 12.429-second quarter-mile, per Brew City Boost. While at the strip, it beat a Shelby GT350, a Camaro ZL1, and even a Challenger Hellcat.
Obviously this truck is seriously powerful— though Brew City Boost hasn't yet taken it to a dyno—but it's also got a significant traction advantage thanks to its four-wheel drive. Just look at how quickly it gets off the line compared with the Hellcat.
Watch for yourself as it dominates the drag strip.

One of the new John Podesta emails getting a lot of play today concerns what President Obama did or didn't know abut Hillary Clinton‘s private server, and Bill O'Reilly tonight pointed a very angry finger at FBI Director James Comey over it. In addition to the email about Obama knowing Clinton had a non-state.gov email address (which Josh Earnest addressed publicly last year), there was also an email chain between Podesta and Neera Tanden in which both Clinton allies expressed their frustrations with how others on the team were dealing with the email situation.
O'Reilly was pissed off because Comey made no mention of these emails in their investigation. And whichever reason why––either they “didn't know about it… or they knew about it and covered it up”––O'Reilly said this is clearly damning. They told Juan Williams and Lisa Boothe that he's bewildered, if Comey saw this email, that they didn't think it had anything to do with the investigation.
“He's the FBI director!” O'Reilly exclaimed. “No politics! He's the investigator! They didn't blank mention it! That is so damning!”
O'reilly said, “”It's obvious the FBI booted the investigation I believe intentionally now. It's obvious Hillary Clinton did not tell the truth about their private email server beyond any reasonable doubt. And now the American public has to vote for president.”

A Trump nominee to be a federal judge in Alabama, Brett J. Talley, has only practiced law for 3 years, never tried a case and was rated "not qualified" by the American Bar Association, the L.A. Times reports. Talley opponents said they have some of the least experience ever seen for a nomination. Conservatives say the ABA is a biased rater of judges.
Talley is 36, has a Harvard Law degree and had clerked for 2 federal judges. In writings they denounced "Hillary Rotten Clinton" and pledged support for the NRA, the paper reported. Their nomination was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, sending them to the full Senate for consideration.
Why it matters: Appointing federal judges can be a president's most consequential act as they remain on the bench long after a presidency is over. The Alliance for Justice, a group that has opposed Trump nominees, says Trump is filling judicial jobs much faster than their predecessor.
Eagle Farm deaths: Claudio D'Alessandro charged with manslaughter after Brisbane airport arrest
Updated
Two construction workers killed at Brisbane's Eagle Farm racecourse managed to escape one falling concrete wall only to be killed by a second, police have alleged, after the builder in charge of the site was arrested at the international airport.
Claudio D'Alessandro, 58, appeared in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Wednesday on two counts of manslaughter, after being charged on Tuesday.
D'Alessandro was arrested at Brisbane international airport, where they were embarking on a spur-of-the moment, four-day holiday to the Philippines.
The prosecution conceded D'Alessandro had not broken any law by attempting to take the trip.
They were granted bail but was required to surrender their passport and must report to police twice a week as part of their bail conditions.
Ashley Pengana Morris and Humberto Ferraira Leite were killed on October 6 by a falling concrete slab while they were working on a major redevelopment of the stables.
The court was told the men were helping to install a four-walled "foul water settling tank" consisting of four individual walls, each about four square metres and weighing about 10 tonnes.
The walls were lowered individually onto the floor with a crane, with the first three walls, once in place, being "tied" to each other across the top corner by use of adjustable temporary bracing.
Workers 'jumped onto' collapsing wall
A police affidavit stated that the men were working in a "pit" under D'Alessandro's instructions trying to lower the concrete walls when they began to collapse.
The pair managed to "ride down" one concrete slab as it fell but were crushed after the wall's failure caused a second slab to topple forward.
The affidavit stated:
At about 3:40pm, D'Alessandro was in charge of two workers in the pit and to manually assist the correct positioning of the fourth wall as it was lowered into position. The only means of entrance and egress was a steel ladder to the top of one of the walls (panel 2). The pit was only slightly larger than the box made by the walls and the workers had no means of escape other than the ladder. Panel 2 began to fall forward and the two workers managed to scale the ladder on that wall and ride down and jumped onto its back as it fell. The failure of this wall caused another wall (panel 1) to immediately fall forward as it was no longer supported. The two workers were unable to escape the second wall falling and were crushed to death in between the two panels.
Ashley Morris raised issues via text, court hears
The court was told Mr Morris had previously commented on a construction issue, and it had been discussed with D'Alessandro via text message.
Police prosecutor Tammy Durre-Bauer said that early in the process of installing one of the panels, "it was identified by one of the deceased - Mr Morris - that the panel did not fit on the concrete pads", and that had been conveyed to D'Alessandro via a text message.
"A series of timber and plastic packers were utilised on top of the gravel base in an attempt to overcome the inaccuracies on the concrete levelling pad," Durre-Bauer said.
"The system in fact had no bracing integrity and was not designed or adopted by an engineer in any manner whatsoever."
The court heard D'Alessandro was an experienced concreter who had worked across the country and internationally.
The prosecutor said D'Alessandro was the sole person issuing instructions and protocols on the site.
D'Alessandro 'shocked by the charges'
Their lawyer, Michael Purcell, said their client did not intend to flee and had been free to travel, given they were not under arrest and had been cooperating with the police investigation.
Outside court, Mr Purcell said D'Alessandro intended to plead not guilty.
"He's shocked by the charges. We think that they're premature because the investigation has got a long way to go," they said.
"He's looking forward to getting out on bail and getting back to work."
The case will return to court next month.

An intriguing strand of Louis van Gaal's opening Manchester United campaign is how the manager is rejuvenating Old Trafford careers. At the head of this list is Ashley Young, who entered this 169th derby as a footballer reborn and who was keeping £59.7m of prime football talent on the bench.
When Ángel Di María signed last summer to herald United's new galáctico era they hardly expected that come spring they would be demoted by a winger who had lost their fizz and become a peripheral figure. Yet as this match passed the hour mark, United still held a 2-1 lead courtesy of the Young show during the opening stages. The starting XI were the same who defeated – Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool and would have remained in place for last weekend's win over Aston Villa if Chris Smalling had not been ill. The defender returned, as Van Gaal sent out what is beginning to look like their preferred lineup for a third time in four games.
This meant Young was again preferred to Di María, a tribute to how the 29-year-old has taken their chance since the former Benfica and Real Madrid winger – the British record transfer – was suspended following a red card in the FA Cup defeat to Arsenal.
The Argentinian may have to look elsewhere for their route back into the team after a Young contribution that featured their equaliser, the creation of the Marouane Fellaini goal that gave United the lead, and the ball to Smalling that confirmed a 4-2 victory.
In the 13 minutes between Young's goal and the Belgian's header, the winger turned the contest on its head. Until then Manchester City were the ascendant force, punching holes in a strangely overawed United at will.
If the champions were intent in proving tales of their demise are being greatly exaggerated the move that led to their opener after eight minutes was a fine start, Sergio Agüero scoring a sixth league goal in this fixture, and their first since 24 February.
The early lead was deserved. United were playing their worst for more than a month, when a 1-0 victory was earned at Newcastle United by an 89th-minute goal from Young, their only one of the campaign until this game.
As the blue wave continued, United appeared a side who might be engulfed. But instead of crumpling Van Gaal's team showed the belief and impressive play that first clicked into place during those wins over Spurs and Liverpool.
Young's finish was a scrambled effort from close in that showed their hunger. The cross with which they found Fellaini's head for the second goal was illustrative of their quality.
Fellaini is another player enjoying a resurgence under Van Gaal. This was their sixth of the season for the club, the second in four matches. The Belgian has become a key Van Gaal lieutenant for the balance – as well as obvious ability – they give the team.
Next up in the roll call of the comeback kids was Juan Mata, the £37.1m signing who had also found themselves out of favour. Yet when Wayne Rooney slipped the playmaker in on 67 minutes Mata strode forward with the confidence of a player who scored each of their goals in the win at Anfield to beat Joe Hart and make it 3-1. This was Mata's ninth of the season, already a productive return as the Van Gaal blueprint continues to appear ever more impressive.
So, too, does Young. A memorable outing that had begun when registering the first United goal ended with a pivotal role in the last, as they pinged in the free‑kick from which Smalling headed beyond a helpless Hart.
This fixture had been expected to reveal the state of health of both clubs. At the close the verdict was that despite Agüero's late second goal, City are in some disarray. United continue to gaze upwards – with Young at the forefront.

In an interview over the weekend, incoming President Rodrigo Duterte addressed the country's telecommunications companies, which, as everyone knows, has gotten flak for their slow connectivity speeds and problematic customer service schemes.
Duterte has already said in past interviews that they have observed the “slow service” of telecommunications firms. (Watch the video clip from CNN Philippines, which features an interview during the campaign period.)
Duterte was quoted as saying, “For the communications guys, iyung Internet connectivity, you improve the service or I will open the Philippines to competition. Pasok lahat. Then it will bring down [the price] and increase efficiency.”
“A 2015 Ookla Speedtest showed that consumer download speeds in the Philippines ranked 176th out of 202 countries. The cost per megabit per second in the Philippines is also one of the most expensive with an average value of $18.18, versus the global average of $5.21,” noted Dharel Placido on ABS-CBNnews.com.
The report also recalled: “The entry of Australian telco firm Telstra in the Philippines, through a joint venture with local partner San Miguel Corp., had threatened to disrupt the duopoly of telco giants Globe Telecom and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (PLDT).
“However, the venture did not push through after both sides failed to reach an agreement . Despite the failed talks, San Miguel said it will pursue its plans to enter the telecom market.
“Telstra, meanwhile, has offered to continue technical work design and construction consultancy support to the Philippine company.”

Maybe Donald Trump was cheated out of that Emmy after all. On Wednesday night, they were the producer of a presidential debate reality show with more twists than one of the early seasons of Survivor.
The Republican presidential nominee is a born showman who openly talks about needing to keep viewers in “suspense,” as when they refused to say whether he'd accept the outcome of the election, guaranteeing their (non?) concession speech will get high ratings.
Trump started out the night as a ringleader for the Great Trump Circus, presenting a peanut gallery of bizarre guests they had invited to the debate for shock and spectacle, a follow-up to their invitations to women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault at the second debate.
There was Malik Obama, Barack Obama's estranged half-brother from Kenya.. There was Lydie Denier, a woman who was once engaged to Ambassador Chris Stevens, who died in the Benghazi attack. There was Leslie Millwee, a woman who recently came forward to tell conservative news outlet Breitbart that Bill Clinton sexually assaulted them while they were a TV reporter in Arkansas and they were Governor.
They have also invited several of the lesser-known speakers from the Republican National Convention, including Marcus Luttrell, a decorated Navy SEAL who survived an ambush that killed the rest of their unit, Pat Smith, the mother of Benghazi victim Sean Smith, and four “Angel Moms” who blame lax immigration policy for the death of their loved ones.
But when they took the stage, Trump played the statesman. An audience that had been primed to watch Siegfried and Roy was instead subjected to a Chekhov play.
For the first half hour, Trump sounded the themes of a generic Republican candidate, controlled and predictable. They gave an answer on the Supreme Court that would appeal to the typical Republican voter. Then another on gun rights. They promised to appoint Supreme Court Justices that “will have a conservative bent,” who “will interpret the the Constitution the way the Founders wanted it interpreted.”
Their demeanor was also more repressed. They interrupted Clinton less than they have in previous debates. They had more research to back up their claims. They did not yell or loom menacingly over their shoulder, as they have in previous debates. They did not shout “wrong” while they talked.
Then, in a twist that they probably didn't intend, they began to revert to form, and the audience was treated to yet another show.
They said the sexual allegations against them were “fictionalized,” suggesting that Clinton's “very sleazy campaign” had planted nearly a dozen women who have come forward alleging that Trump groped or harassed them, painting a picture of a vast (and highly unlikely) conspiracy. Their old debate self began to peek out, interrupting Clinton again, saying “wrong” into their microphone at least twice during their answers. Eventually, they were calling them a “nasty woman” and arguing they shouldn't be allowed to run for president.
And when pressed on their recent claims that the election would be rigged, Trump refused to say whether they would respect the outcome of the election if they didn't win. When moderator Chris Wallace asked whether Trump would commit to the principle of the peaceful transition of power, they were coy.
“What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense. OK?”
It was a shocking moment for democratic norms, but it was also a teaser to the next episode of the presidential reality show that Trump is starring in. And like all good showmen, Trump was focused on keeping the suspense going until then.

The Dumbest Game of Chicken, Ever
Since the Republican Party took over the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010, its battles with Barack Obama's administration have taken on Wagnerian levels of grandiosity. Increasingly, the current political showdown over the federal budget and the debt ceiling looks less like a domestic policy disagreement and more like a militarized dispute between two enduring rivals in world politics. Both sides say they want a deal that raises the debt ceiling and funds the federal government — but their behavior suggests that they're willing to risk a protracted conflict to get what they want. Indeed, at this point, both Republicans and Democrats seem to care more about politically crippling the other party than they do about, you know, promoting the general welfare of the United States. Ordinarily, relative gains concern this extreme appear only in the fevered dreams of realist international relations scholars.
Over the past few weeks, both sides have articulated their tactics and strategies. Looking at their strategies to date, however, this international relations theorist reaches a disturbing conclusion: Obama seems far too clever for their own good, while the Republicans might just be stupid enough to claim victory.
Let's start with the president. As a general rule, sitting American presidents don't talk down the economy — but last week, Obama made an unusual exception. In an interview with CNBC, they said, "This time I think Wall Street should be concerned," concluding that "when you have a situation in which a faction is willing to default on U.S. obligations, then we are in trouble." It is certainly true that both public sector and numerous private sector analysts have warned about the calamitous consequences of a debt default (though not everyone is convinced). Although Obama was breaking with tradition, the president's logic for trying to scare financial markets seems pretty clear. If markets start to panic, then both Wall Street and Main Street will start to pressure the GOP caucus in the House to acquiesce to what Obama wants: a clean debt-ceiling increase. In essence, the president wants the stock market to impose economic sanction on the Republican Party.
There are past examples of financial-market gyrations forcing politicians to do something they otherwise would not have. As the 2008 financial crisis started to snowball, Congress tried to pass the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), only for it to founder in the House of Representatives. Expecting passage, markets were surprised: The Dow Jones industrial average experienced its largest single-day loss in history. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both lost approximately 9 percent of their value. A week later, the House passed a revised TARP bill. A similar dynamic played out during the episode that most closely mirrors the current deadlock — the 2011 showdown over the debt ceiling.
It would seem that this is the sort of dynamic Obama wants to see play out. But there are two things getting in the way of the president's "panic Wall Street" strategy: theory and practice.
Despite the president's warnings, financial markets have not panicked so far. Part of the problem comes with the fact that traders don't make money by acting as Obama's messenger. In theory, Congress yields after markets tank — when Congress acquiesces, market rebound. But in a world that assumes traders possess rational expectations, there is not much individual incentive for them to heed Obama's advice. No matter how a trader hedges the bet, Obama is in essence asking investors to bet on markets going down when, if the strategy works, they will not stay down. That's not a great bet for traders to make. As Neil Irwin, economics editor of the Washington Post‘s Wonkblog, has pointed out, "you don't become a hotshot hedge fund trader by making bets based on what ‘ought' to happen or what seems to make sense on some academic level. You only make money if you guess the direction of markets correctly. And if this standoff ends not with a bang but a whimper … then the current prices in asset markets will look about right."
The practical problem is that it's far from clear whether members of the House GOP will feel any particular pressure to budge. Over the past decade or so, the Republican Party's voting coalition has shifted from business interests to more ideologically pure groups. Republican-friendly business interests have already been screaming bloody murder about GOP hard-line tactics — but to little avail. Indeed, House Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) told the Associated Press that "it wouldn't make any difference" if business interests started pressuring him. In recent years, the GOP caucus has successfully insulated itself from all outside pressures but their party's ideological base — rendering Obama's strategy impotent.
There's an even bigger problem with the Republican Party, however: It might have no endgame for the current crisis. The architect of the current strategy, Sen. Ted Cruz, did not offer a way out when angry Senate Republicans confronted them behind closed doors last week. A surprising number of Republican representatives seem convinced that Obama will surrender their biggest domestic policy initiative, the Affordable Care Act, just to reopen the government. The interest groups that foisted the current strategy on House leaders thought the shutdown strategy would be politically popular, but polls suggest the opposite. Some members of the GOP caucus, like Ted Yoho of Florida, actually profess to believe that if the debt ceiling weren't raised, "it would bring stability to the world markets." Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman believes these sorts of political miscues reveal the outright stupidity of the Republican leadership.
The thing is, in this kind of showdown, true ignorance can yield a bargaining advantage. If Republicans truly believe that their cause is just, their strategy is popular, and nothing bad will happen, then it is impossible to pressure them to come to the bargaining table. In The Strategy of Conflict, economist Thomas Schelling observed that in a game of chicken, one driver could gain an advantage from throwing the steering wheel out the window. It appears that Republicans have come up with an even more extreme version of that gambit — insisting loudly that they are immune to car crashes.
• West Ham's bid to own stadium halted by legal challenges • Arena likely to be rented out and shared with UK Athletics
West Ham United have confirmed that they still intend to move into the Olympic Stadium under a simplified rental arrangement after ministers and the legacy company scrapped talks over their contentious bid to take over the venue after the London 2012 Games.
The Department of Culture, Media and Sport is on Tuesday expected to confirm that the ongoing talks over the future of the stadium – awarded to a joint bid from West Ham and Newham council earlier this year following a bitterly contested battle with Tottenham Hotspur – have collapsed.
But the DCMS is expected almost immediately to re-tender for the stadium under a process that would see it remain in public ownership and simply rent the ground to West Ham in the winter and UK Athletics, using it as the centrepiece of its 2017 World Championships bid, in the summer.
A joint statement from the West Ham vice-chair Karren Brady and the Newham council chief executive Kim Bromley-Derry said they would welcome the move to bring clarity to the process.
"We understand ministers will make a statement later and we will not pre-empt that. Uncertainty caused by the anonymous complaint to the European Commission and ongoing legal challenges have put the Olympic legacy at risk and certainly a stadium, as we envisioned it, may not be in place by 2014 as a direct result of the legal delay," the statement said.
"Therefore we would welcome a move by OPLC and government to end that uncertainty and allow a football and athletic stadium to be in place by 2014 under a new process. If the speculation is true, West Ham will look to become a tenant of the stadium while Newham will aim to help deliver the legacy."
The Olympic Park Legacy Company board met on Monday to agree the new course of action and wrote to the government for approval. The move was to have been announced on Tuesday but details were leaked overnight.
The negotiations have been dragging on for months and have been complicated by a legal challenge from Spurs, doubts over how the deal would be structured and paid for and claim and counter-claim over the way it was awarded.
A judicial review over the process was due to be heard on 18 October at the High Court after a judge ruled there were sufficient doubts over whether a £40m loan from Newham to West Ham flouted state aid rules for the case to be heard.
The Leyton Orient chairperson Barry Hearn said their club would look to be a tenant when the new tender process opens. "Today is a fabulous day for Leyton Orient fans," they told Sky Sports News.
"It puts the whole thing back in the public domain as it should be. The system of deliverance was fundamentally flawed and now they have got to go back to the beginning and start again and we will be an interested party in that bidding process."
The sports minister Hugh Robertson welcomed the move: "The key point is the action we have taken today is about removing the uncertainty. The process had become bogged down in legal paralysis. Particularly relevant has been the anonymous complaint to the EC over 'state aid' and the OPLC received a letter from Newham council yesterday [Monday] saying because of the uncertainty they no longer wanted to proceed. That was the straw that broke the camel's back and we thought it better to stop it dead in it tracks now.
"We know there is huge interest in the stadium out there from private operators and football clubs and crucially we remove any uncertainty."
Some £35m already earmarked under the Olympic budget will be used to transform the stadium after the Games. Prospective tenants will then be asked to bid for the stadium with the running track remaining in place.
Robertson added: "This is not a white elephant stadium where no one wants it, we have had two big clubs fighting tooth and nail to get it. The new process will be more like how Manchester City took over the Commonwealth Games stadium which is regarded as a leading example of how to do it."
Initially, it was hoped Spurs would drop their legal challenge after the mayor of London Boris Johnson promised a £17m package to help towards the redevelopment of White Hart Lane and the surrounding area. But Spurs have kept their options open, saying they need more time to examine the City Hall proposal.
Johnson insisted the stadium would not become a burden to the taxpayer. "I am confident that this decision is the best way to ensure we have certainty over the stadium's future," they said. "I believe it will also put us in the place where we always intended to be - delivering a lasting sustainable legacy for the stadium backed up by a robust but flexible business plan that provides a very good return to the taxpayer."
The doubts over the future of the stadium have cast a shadow over London's bid to host the 2017 World Athletics Championships, although inspectors said last week they were satisfied with guarantees given by the government and the legacy company that it would remain no matter what.
The UK Athletics chairperson Ed Warner said the move was "fantastic for UK Athletics" and would help the bid for 2017. "We had a meeting with the IAAF inspectors last week and we gave Government guarantees that the athletics track will stay in place," they told BBC 5 Live.
"The move you see today is simply confirmation of what we told the IAAF. The IAAF were concerned when they arrived but when they left they told us that the issue was completely resolved. We laid out the legal options and they went away happy."
The move to scrap talks with West Ham and Newham is just the latest twist in a byzantine, error-strewn saga that dates back to before London won the Games.
In a bid to avoid another embarrassment like Picketts Lock or Wembley, the government of the day was keen to nail down proposals for the stadium early and begin construction.
As such, the option of building a dual-use stadium like the Stade de France was quickly discounted and the option of reducing the capacity from 80,000 to 28,000 favoured.
When the coalition came to power and the Olympic Park Legacy Company was handed responsibility for the area after 2012, they resolved to re-open the tender process in an attempt to attract a Premier League football club and bring more visitors and inward investment.
But in order to create a competitive tender, there had to be enough latitude in the wording to encourage Spurs to table a bid that involved tearing out the track and rebuilding Crystal Palace. They believed a dedicated football stadium without a track was the only commercially viable option.
That caused a hugely emotive row, with Lord Coe among others pointing to the promises made before the bid to retain the track.
The controversy did not stop with the award of the stadium to Newham and West Ham. The Spurs chairperson Daniel Levy launched an immediate legal challenge and the waters were further muddied by revelations that an OPLC executive moonlighted for West Ham during the bid, and claims by the OPLC and West Ham that private investigators hired by Spurs had accessed private phone records.
Later inquiries by West Ham and the OPLC found the executive in question had no impact on the tender process, while a Metropolitan police investigation into the West Ham claims is ongoing.
La Liga to take legal action against FIFA following World Cup expansion
Will clubs like Real Madrid and Barcelona be asked to provide even more players to compete at the World Cup?
La Liga are planning on taking FIFA to court to stop the World Cup expanding to 48 teams.
A senior source at the Spanish league says they will do everything possible to reverse the FIFA Council's decision to increase the size of the tournament from 32 to 48 teams.
La Liga warned Gianni Infantino before Tuesday's vote that they would take legal action if the FIFA president went ahead with their plans.
Infantino was told that Europe's professional leagues had to be consulted on all decisions which affected professional footballers.
According to La Liga, that consultation did not take place.

The new format which is to be introduced from 2026 will mean the number of players taking part in the tournament will increase by 50 per cent.
The source said: "We are not happy at all. We are providing extra players but we have not been consulted. We are looking at ways in which we can challenge today's decision."
Just Enough Raspberry Pi...
... to be dangerous.
If you've heard about the Raspberry Pi you may know that it provides a fantastic method to learn about using a computer and to develop some skills that go beyond the basics.
What sort of things will we learn?
Good question!
What sort of versions of the Raspberry Pi are there?
What hardware do I need to get it up and going?
What sort of operating systems are there and how do we install them?
How do I do [Insert any number of cool things]?
Whatever the reason, hopefully you can find the answer here.
Is this book for you?
It's not written for experts. It's put together as a guide to get you started if you're unsure about how to make the first move with a Raspberry Pi.
Why is Just Enough Raspberry Pi being written?
Because in the process of learning things, it's a great way to remember them if you write them down :-).
Writing about how to do cool stuff with computers means that we're accumulating ways to help ourselves out when the going gets tricky. Making a book out of the information is a no-brainer since that way more people benefit from the process.
The awesome that is Leanpub.
The book has some information in it, but there's still a bit more to come. Publishing using Leanpub will allow readers to get easy notification of when updates and improvements are made.

PERU, Ind. (WISH) -- Operation Blue Rain, the state police dubbed it.
The enforcement effort that stopped motorists along U.S. 31 in Fulton and Miami in northern Indiana netted 99 arrests on 186 criminal charges -- including 32 felonies -- from Tuesday through Thursday, Indiana State Police said in a news release issued Friday.
It is the sixth or seventh year for the enforcement effort, said Sgt. Tony Slocum, public information officer for the state police post at Peru. The 99 arrests were "quite a significant jump" over last year's statistics, when 65 arrests were made.
"The goal was to catch and arrest individuals who utilize Indiana roadways to transport and distribute illegal narcotics," the release said. "U.S. 31 was chosen because a large volume of motorists utilize the road to travel through the heart of northern Indiana."
Sheriff's departments in Cass, Fulton, Miami and Wabash counties as well as the Rochester Police Department and the state police were part of Operation Blue Rain.
Officers said they found cocaine, heroin, hundreds of hits of LSD, methamphetamine, marijuana, psilocybin mushrooms, hash oil, edible marijuana food and illegally possessed prescription medication. Officers also said they found an AR-15 assault-style rifle allegedly in the possession of a convicted violent felon.
If you watch the news, it seems just about everyone is in favor of “Net Neutrality” legislation. Despite being a tech-addicted entrepreneur, I am not. No, I am not a paid shill for the cable industry. I am no fan of Comcast or any other ISP I've ever had the "pleasure" of dealing with. I'm skeptical of large corporations generally and dislike the fact that in this debate I appear to be on their side. While I have no problem with net neutrality as a principle or concept, I have serious concerns about Net Neutrality as legislation or public policy. And since a false dichotomy is being perpetuated by the media in regards to this matter, I feel an obligation to put forth a third point of view. In taking this stand, I realize I may be the only techie, if I can aspire to that label, opposed to Net Neutrality and that I open myself to accusations of killing the dreams of young entrepreneurs, wrecking free speech, and destroying the Internet. Nevertheless, here are three reasons I'm against Net Neutrality legislation.
I Want More Competition
Proponents of Net Neutrality say the telecoms have too much power. I agree. Everyone seems to agree that monopolies are bad and competition is good, and just like you, I would like to see more competition. But if monopolies are bad, why should we trust the U.S. government, the largest, most powerful monopoly in the world? We're talking about the same organization that spent an amount equal to Facebook's first six years of operating costs to build a health care website that doesn't work, the same organization that can't keep the country's bridges from falling down, and the same organization that spends 320 times what private industry spends to send a rocket into space. Think of an industry that has major problems. Public schools? Health care? How about higher education, student loans, housing, banking, physical infrastructure, immigration, the space program, the military, the police, or the post office? What do all these industries and/or organizations have in common? They are all heavily regulated or controlled by the government. On the other hand we see that where deregulation has occurred, innovation has bloomed, such as with telephony services. Do you think we'd all be walking around with smartphones today if the government still ran the phone system?
The U.S. government has shown time after time that it is ineffective at managing much of anything. This is by design. The Founders intentionally created a government that was slow, inefficient, and plagued by gridlock, because they knew the greatest danger to individual freedom came from a government that could move quickly--too quickly for the people to react in time to protect themselves. If we value our freedom, we need government to be slow. But if government is slow, we shouldn't rely on it to provide us with products and services we want in a timely manner at a high level of quality. The telecoms may be bad, but everything that makes them bad is what the government is by definition. Can we put "bad" and "worse" together and end up with "better"?
I don't like how much power the telecoms have. But the reason they're big and powerful isn't because there is a lack of government regulation, but because of it. Government regulations are written by large corporate interests which collude with officials in government. The image of government being full of people on a mission to protect the little guy from predatory corporate behemoths is an illusion fostered by politicians and corporate interests alike. Many, if not most, government regulations are the product of crony capitalism designed to prevent small entrepreneurs from becoming real threats to large corporations. If Net Neutrality comes to pass how can we trust it will not be written in a way that will make it harder for new companies to offer Internet services? If anything, we're likely to end up even more beholden to the large telecoms than before. Of course at this point the politicians will tell us if they hadn't stepped in that things would be even worse.
If the telecoms are forced to compete in a truly free market, Comcast and Time Warner won't exist 10 years from now. They'll be replaced by options that give us better service at a lower price. Some of these new options may depend on being able to take advantage of the very freedom to charge more for certain types of Internet traffic that Net Neutrality seeks to eliminate. If we want to break up the large telecoms through increased competition we need to eliminate regulations that act as barriers to entry in the space, rather than create more of them.
I Want More Privacy
Free speech cannot exist without privacy, and the U.S. government has been shown to be unworthy of guarding the privacy of its citizens. Only the latest revelation of many, Glenn Greenwald's new book No Place To Hide reveals that the U.S. government tampers with Internet routers during the manufacturing process to aid its spying programs. Is this the organization we trust to take even more control of the Internet? Should we believe that under Net Neutrality the government will trust the telecoms to police themselves? The government will need to verify, at a technical level, whether the telecoms are treating data as they should. Don't be surprised if that means the government says it needs to be able to install its own hardware and software at critical points to monitor Internet traffic. Once installed, can we trust this government, or any government, to use that access in a benign manner?
While privacy and freedom of speech may not be foremost on your mind today because you like who is running the government right now, remember that government control tends to swing back and forth. How will you feel about the government having increased control of the Internet when Republicans own the House and Senate and Jeb Bush is elected President, all at the same time?
I Want More Freedom
If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. -- James Madison, The Federalist No. 51
Many of us see the U.S. government as a benevolent and all-knowing parent with the best interests of you and me, its children, at heart. I see the U.S. government as a dangerous tyrant, influenced by large corporate interests, seeking to control everyone and everything. Perhaps these diverging perspectives on the nature of the U.S. government are what account for a majority of the debate between proponents and opponents of Net Neutrality. If I believed the U.S. government was omniscient, had only good intentions, and that those intentions would never change, I would be in favor of Net Neutrality and more. But it wasn't all that long ago that FDR was locking up U.S. citizens of Japanese ancestry in concentration camps and Woodrow Wilson was outlawing political dissent. More recently we've seen the U.S. government fight unjust wars, topple elected democracies, and otherwise interfere in world affairs. We've seen the same government execute its own citizens in violation of Fifth Amendment rights guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution. Simply put--I don't trust the U.S. government. Nor do I trust any other government, even if "my team" wins the election. I see any increase in regulation, however well-intentioned, however beneficial to me today, as leading to less freedom for me and society in the long term. For this reason those who rose up against SOPA and PIPA a few years ago should be equally opposed to Net Neutrality.
What Instead?
Internet bandwidth is, at least currently, a finite resource and has to be allocated somehow. We can let politicians decide, or we can let you and me decide by leaving it up to the free market. If we choose politicians, we will see the Internet become another mismanaged public monopoly, subject to political whims and increased scrutiny from our friends at the NSA. If we leave it up to the free market we will, in time, receive more of what we want at a lower price. It may not be a perfect process, but it will be better than the alternative.
Free markets deal exceptionally well in the process of “creative destruction” economist Joseph Shumpeter championed as the mode by which society raises its standard of living. Although any progress is not without its impediments and free markets aren't an instant panacea, even U2's Bono embraced the fact entrepreneurial capitalism does more to eradicate poverty than foreign aid. Especially in the area of technology, government regulation has little, if any place. Governments cannot move fast enough to effectively regulate technology companies because by the time they move, the technology has changed and the debate is irrelevant. Does anyone remember the antitrust cases against Microsoft because of the Internet Explorer browser? The worse services provided by the large telecoms are, the more incentive there will be for entrepreneurs to create new technologies. Five years from now a new satellite technology may emerge that makes fiber obsolete, and we'll all be getting wireless terabit downloads from space directly to our smartphones, anywhere in the world, for $5/month. Unrealistic? Just think what someone would have said in 1994 if you had tried to explain to them everything you can do today on an iPhone, and at what price.
Update 6 February, 2015: Today, it was revealed by FCC commissioner Ajit Pai that the proposed Net Neutrality plan the FCC is considering is 332 pages long. It will not be released to the public until after the FCC has voted. Pai claims this regulation will give "the FCC the power to micromanage virtually every aspect of how the Internet works."

FRANKEL SET FOR OUTSTANDING LINE UP OF MARES
FRANKEL will start their new career as a stallion later this week and Juddmonte has released more details of the champion racehorse's book of mares for 2013.
FRANKEL , who won all 14 of their races, will be visited by an outstanding line-up of mares, including around 60 that have either won a Gr.1, produced a Gr.1 winner – or both.
In addition to the high class mares already mentioned in the press, FRANKEL 's book includes several dams of European Classic winners, including Flirtation (dam of English and Irish 1000 Guineas winner Attraction), Honorine (dam of Irish Derby winner Treasure Beach), Lady Vettori (dam of French 2000 Guineas and French Derby winner Lope de Vega), Maycocks Bay (dam of dual Oaks winner Sariska), Musical Treat (dam of English and Irish 1000 Guineas winner Finsceal Beo), Quest To Peak (dam of English and French 1000 Guineas winner Special Duty), Soignee (dam of French Oaks winner Stacelita), Waldmark (dam of St Leger winner Masked Marvel) and Zomaradah (dam of Irish 2000 Guineas winner Dubawi).
Juddmonte Farms general manager Philip Mitchell commented: “His book of mares is as one would hope and expect for ‘the best racehorse ever'. We are most grateful to all the Breeders in Europe, America and Japan, who have put their faith in FRANKEL and as a result we have one of the most impressive books of mares that a first season sire has received.”

Recall the time Tony Pena and John Hudek teamed up for a fake intentional walk strikeout in 1997
When the game gets dicey, managers break out their deepest strategical decisions in hopes of maintaining the edge (or keeping the lead intact). One tactic employed often is the intentional walk, usually used to help a pitcher avoid having to deal with the marquee slugger or pesky leadoff guy on the other team in favor of facing somebody -- anybody -- else.
The intentional walk frequently comes up when debating potential rule changes for baseball, which has been the case recently. How best to grant that imposing hitter four balls and a free pass to first base?
Of course, you could always do what Tony Pena and John Hudek of the Astros did in 1997 to an unsuspecting Brian Johnson at Candlestick Park:
San Francisco may have prevailed that night, 4-1, but Pena and Hudek's trickery endures.
Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has denied being invited by Donald Trump to attend the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, after a surprise visit to the RNC as an “observer.”
Farage, who played a key role in the campaign for Britain to vote ‘Leave' in the recent referendum on EU membership, said they were attending the event to hear the presumptive Republican nominee's speech.
The right-wing politician arrived in the US on Tuesday, and is expected to speak with Euroskeptic Republican politicians over breakfast on Wednesday morning.
Farage said they did not plan to endorse Trump or any other candidate in the US election after having criticized US President Barack Obama for their intervention into the Brexit debate earlier this year.
However in an interview with CNN's Richard Quest shortly after the EU referendum, they said they thought Trump would be “better” than Obama.
The prominent Euroskeptic told USA Today that they felt the US could learn lessons from the EU referendum, but did not go into details.
“Having criticized President Obama for getting involved in British politics, I am not about to endorse anybody,” Farage said.
“But I do know a lot of people in the Republican Party, and I'll be interested to hear what Donald Trump has to say in their big speech.”
‘Voting is not enough': Photoshoot with 100 naked women to greet Trump & RNC in Ohio https://t.co/MqxXe6lauLpic.twitter.com/DuhdiCfQic — RT (@RT_com) May 13, 2016
At the time of the referendum, Farage effectively endorsed the Republican presumptive nominee for president.
“A Trump administration pledges to strengthen ties with a free and independent Britain, deepening our bonds in commerce, culture and mutual defense.
“The whole world is more peaceful and stable when our two countries – and our two peoples – are united together, as they will be under a Trump administration.”
The former UKIP leader has expressed revulsion at the thought of presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton winning the presidency.
“There is nothing on Earth that could persuade me ever to vote for Hillary Clinton,” they previously said.
The RNC, which began on Monday, is taking place amid intense levels of security, as thousands of police officers from around the country have descended on the Mid-Western city.
Some 500 Cleveland police officers will be joined by 2,000 cops from around the US to police planned protests outside the ‘hard perimeter' of the convention area.
Books: Jewish conductor fondly recalls friendship with pope
Sir Gilbert Levine was invited to conduct a concert in 1988 to mark the 10th anniversary of Pope John Paul II's election. It was the beginning of almost two decades of musical collaboration and a joint mission of peacemaking. less Sir Gilbert Levine was invited to conduct a concert in 1988 to mark the 10th anniversary of Pope John Paul II's election.

Sir Gilbert Levine, whose conducting career has spanned the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic and the Dresden Staatskapelle, was a Jew from Brooklyn who had only recently met a Catholic priest when they first met the late Pope John Paul II.
Their improbable friendship, told in Levine's recent book, The Pope's Maestro, began in 1987 when Levine was invited to be guest conductor and artistic director of the Krakow Philharmonic in John Paul's native Poland.
Though compelling, the invitation was also unsettling since Levine's grandparents had fled Poland to escape the Nazis and members of their wife's family had died in Auschwitz.
Soon after Levine arrived in Krakow, the Vatican summoned them to Rome for an audience with the pope. That invitation led to others, and Levine was invited to conduct a concert in 1988 to mark the 10th anniversary of John Paul's election.
It was the beginning of almost two decades of musical collaboration and a joint mission of peacemaking. The pope named Levine a Knight Commander of the Pontifical Equestrian Order of Saint Gregory the Great, the first pontifical knighthood awarded to an American Jew, and the first given to a nonchurch musician since Mozart.
Q: When did you meet Pope John Paul II?
A: February 1988. I was told by a member of the American diplomatic community, "You'll have a nice handshake. They shake hands and stops just long enough for the treasured photograph for the grandkids. It's not really private. It all happens in front of the thousands that come every week just to be in the pope's presence." From then on, we began an incredible relationship.
Q: Tell me how your relationship with the pope affected you.
A: It deepened my faith, and they honored that Jewish faith wonderfully. It deepened my music-making. I understand the spiritual side of music in a deeper and better way than I ever did before. It made me understand that there is no such thing as judging a person by the country they come from, the religion they practice or any surface issue. It is only by the character of their soul that a person may be judged. The pope taught me that.
Q: What qualities, characteristics and statements do you remember most about John Paul II?
A: I recall their dignity and grace. Late in their reign, they met with the chief rabbi of Rome and the imam of the mosque of Rome. It had been two years since I had seen him, and I wondered how they would be. They were wheeled forward in what looked like a rolling gold-upholstered throne. They looked out at the applauding audience with a warm, deep smile, lifting their right arm in greeting, their open hand reaching out as if to shake each outstretched hand from the audience.
Q: What are the most important things you learned from the pope?
A: My 17 years with John Paul taught me so much. The power of music and spirit to foster hope, transformation, healing and love. And more about the mysteries of faith, not one but three — Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The potential for reconciliation and redemption in the face of violence and sadness.
Star Wars: The Last Jedi has been in theaters for almost a week now, and on Thursday, writer-director Rian Johnson addressed the divided response the film has received among fans.
"The goal is never to divide or make people upset, but I do think the conversations that are happening were going to have to happen at some point if sw is going to grow, move forward and stay vital," Johnson tweeted in reply to a Twitter user who asked if they thought it was good the film had polarized fans.
Critics praised the film and it holds a 93 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, but it has only a 56 percent audience score on the movie aggregator — putting it in the territory of George Lucas' controversial prequel films. (The Last Jedi did receive an glowing "A" CinemaScore.)
Hardware
More than anything else, the RAZR line is about design and hardware -- the HD series is no different. If anything, it ups the ante. The entire backs of the devices are wrapped in Kevlar, with a distinctive herringbone-like pattern of black and gray rectangles that give the rear of the phones a very smooth, seamless feel. Holding it naturally, that surface is interrupted only by the small Motorola logo inlay in the middle of the handset. Above that are the speaker and the 8-megapixel camera. The Droid RAZR HD finally sees Motorola bid the camera hump adieu. The design flourish made its most high-profile appearance in the Droid X and made a return in devices like the Atrix HD and original Droid RAZR. There is still a slight taper to the body, but no obvious bulge to house the sensor. At 8.4mm thin it's quite a svelte device. It may not get down to the nearly anorexic 7.1mm of the Droid RAZR, but that extra volume is put to good use by the 2,500mAh battery which, as we'll see later, stomps all over its predecessor. The MAXX HD is a hair thicker at 9.33mm and has no taper whatsoever, which allows it to fit a stunning 3,300mAh powerpack inside. That beefier battery and bumped-up storage (32GB internal versus 16GB) is all that separates the $199 RAZR HD from the $299 RAZR MAXX HD. Otherwise, they're the same exact phone.
The slightly thicker body leaves room for a nice strip of aluminum around the edges and allows Motorola to spread out the various ports and buttons. The top houses only the headphone jack, a drastic change from the original Droid RAZR which also found room there for the HDMI and micro-USB ports. Those have instead been moved to the left-hand side of the handset, towards the bottom of the body, below the hidden tray for the micro-SIM and microSD cards. On the right side are both the power button and the volume rocker, which are nicely textured and depress with a satisfying amount of feedback. Up front, you'll find the requisite sensors and an HD camera for video chats and self-portraits. Sandwiched between the ear piece and Motorola logo is a long, thin notification LED that underlines the company name.
The word we'd use to describe it is "dense" -- like a brick.
Combine all that with an edge-to-edge sheet of Gorilla Glass on the face and you've got a rather solid and premium-feeling device. Actually, the word we'd use to describe it is "dense" -- like a brick. It's roughly the same size and weight as the Galaxy Nexus but, subjectively, it seems heavier until you hold them both simultaneously. It's about a millimeter thinner than the Nexus but, thanks to its straight sides and almost featureless body, it feels quite a bit more awkward in the hand. The RAZR HD and MAXX HD seem just a little too big, despite being narrower than the Galaxy S III and One X. That's a shame because we love the heft and stunning build quality. Strictly from a material selection and construction standpoint, the RAZR line belongs in a class alongside HTC's One series and the iPhone -- it's just that good. But, as time wore on, the subtle inconveniences of the design became increasingly clear. It's almost as if Motorola forgot to take ergonomics into account when building the devices, making one-handed operation a bit of a chore. It was impossible to find a position that allowed this reviewer to stretch across the screen with their thumb while keeping the lock key within easy reach.
One of the most welcome changes to the RAZR line is certainly the screen. Without changing the size of the handset, Motorola has gone from a 4.3-inch panel to a 4.7-inch one and bumped up the resolution from qHD to a full 1,280 x 720. Of course, being of the Super AMOLED HD variety, that means we're still looking at a PenTile layout here. That being said, it's not a bad screen at all. It can't quite compete with the stunning LCDs found on the Optimus G or the One X, but it's at least on par with the Galaxy Nexus. Colors are bright and saturated while darker areas are deep and almost light-absorbing -- perhaps unnaturally so. But jagged edges are hard to spot, viewing angles are extraordinary and it shrugs off direct sunlight as a minor inconvenience. One of the biggest surprises, however, was the speaker phone, which was loud, clear and one of the best we've heard in a long time. And you'll be able to put that speaker to good use almost anywhere on the globe since, in addition to the Verizon standard LTE and CDMA radios, the RAZR HD and MAXX HD also support GSM 850/900/1,800/1,900 and HSPA on the same bands, plus 2,100MHz.
Performance and battery life
Moto has decided to make battery life its bread and butter.
While every other manufacturer is talking about innovative cameras, quad-core processors and glorified styli, Moto has decided to make battery life its bread and butter. That trend started with the Droid RAZR MAXX -- the first phone we've ever seen with what could be called an excessively large battery. The RAZR MAXX HD keeps the same 3,300mAh non-removable pack, while its slimmer sibling goes with a 2,500mAh one. That's a significant upgrade over last year's model and one that delivers a stunning amount of longevity. Under normal usage the RAZR HD sails through a full day without a hiccup, and two days is well within reach with judicious use of the screen. On our standard battery drain test (which involves looping a video with the display brightness set at 50 percent, WiFi and GPS turned on) the RAZR HD chugged along for an impressive 10 hours and 42 minutes -- that's longer than most tablets. The MAXX only takes things further, testing this reviewer's patience by refusing to die for 14 hours and four minutes. That doesn't quite match the epic longevity of the first MAXX, but it's still a nearly unheard of number. What's more, both lasted almost a full hour longer than Motorola's official figures -- that's about as pleasant a surprise as one can get.
The dual-core 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4 inside is hardly cutting-edge any more, but it's more than enough to keep the phone chugging along at a healthy clip. Navigating the UI is smooth, seamless and the device hardly seems to break a sweat firing up most apps. Even relatively intensive 3D titles like Dead Space and Grand Theft Auto III hum along on the new RAZRs. We did, however, consistently encounter serious lag with the keyboard. Quite often, it would take a few seconds for the keyboard to catch up to our typing, and memory-intensive apps like Chrome only seemed to exacerbate the issue.
Droid RAZR HD & MAXX HD Motorola Droid RAZR M Galaxy S III (Verizon) Quadrant 4,982 4,944 4,937 Vellamo 2.0 1,631 1,648 1,627 SunSpider 0.9.1 (ms) 1,914 1,951 1,740 AnTuTu 6,674 6,364 6,857 GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt Offscreen (fps) 13 13 13 CF-Bench 9,547 9,392 9,375 SunSpider: lower scores are better
The phones easily held their own in benchmarks and, as expected, kept pace with the glut of phones on the market with the same 1.5GHz Snapdragon internals. The SunSpider score of 1,914 is respectable, though surprisingly high considering similarly specced devices from Samsung and Moto have completed the test significantly faster in the past. Otherwise, our quantitative testing turned up no surprises. Serious powerhouses like the Galaxy Note II and the Optimus G were able to run circles around the RAZRs, but even the most demanding of users will rarely need that sort of horsepower on a regular basis. More important for the average user will be the ability to suck down data at an impressive clip and the HD didn't disappoint. We averaged about 17 Mbps down and 14 Mbps up around New York City, during a mix of on- and off-peak tests. We also found call quality to be surprisingly clear, considering the underwhelming performance of its smaller sibling the RAZR M in this area.
Camera
The camera has always been a strong suit of Motorola handsets.
We're beginning to believe that Motorola found a formula that works for capturing images way back with the Droid X and hasn't really bothered to change much since. Things have certainly gotten better, just not dramatically so. That's not to say we're disappointed with the image quality here -- far from it actually. The camera has always been a strong suit of Motorola handsets and the same is true of the new RAZR brothers. Both have an 8-megapixel sensor inside, the same as you'd find in the RAZR M, Droid RAZR, Bionic and practically every flagship Moto device dating back to 2010. While the number of pixels hasn't increased, photo clarity and saturation has. In the light of day, images captured are bright and colorful, on par with most point-and-shoots. Even indoors and under artificial light the results are still pretty good, though we'd suggest leaving the flash off unless absolutely necessary. The new camera interface also improves over past offerings with a less cluttered presentation and more responsive controls. Perhaps our favorite feature is the phone's ability to detect less-than-ideal lighting conditions and prompt you to switch to HDR mode.
IT'S JANUARY 6TH and in Ireland that can only mean one thing. It's Nollaig na mBan, aka ‘Women's Christmas'.
Traditionally recognised as the day we really do have to take that poor Christmas tree down or put the Three Wise Men in the crib (it's the Feast of the Epiphany don'cha know?), Nollaig na mBan gained a special place in Irish hearts as the day when the men would do all the work and let the women put the feet up.
The country isn't quite sure how to feel about the whole idea of a ‘Little Women's Christmas' in 2014 though and there's plenty of talk on the interweb about the pros and cons.
Some are embracing the tradition with open arms.
While others are having none of it. None.
Meanwhile, some are concerned that traditions aren't being respected.
And others are worried that Storm Christine will wreck the buzz.
A few are wondering if there's still a buzz for it to wreck in the first place.
Nevertheless, there are still plenty of people getting into the spirit and making the most of the day.
Will you be out celebrating Nollaig na mBan?
Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) thrilled the crowd at “The Uninvited II,” the second annual side conference at the Conservative Political Action Committee (CPAC), hosted by Breitbart News and EMPact America.
“Neville Chamberlain's calling, they want their foreign policy back,” Gohmert quipped, playing off President Barack Obama's snarky put-down of Republican challenger Mitt Romney during their third presidential debate.
Instead of providing mere economic assistance to Ukraine, Gohmert said, the U.S. should provide military assistance and indicate clearly to Russia that there would be retribution for its actions, “one way or another.”
Gohmert focused the rest of their remarks on immigration, arguing against new “comprehensive” immigration reform that would include border security “triggers” with the goal of expanding legal status to millions.
“We have a trigger. It's called the law,” they said. They added that many immigrants shared many of the traits–“faith in God, love of family, and hard work ethic” that built the U.S.–but the rule of law had to be upheld.
In closing, Gohmert said: “Democracy ensures a people are governed no better than they deserve. We want better? We've got to deserve better,” they said, praising those in the room for their work to improve the country.
Blockstream Developer Rusty Russell Proposes New Bitcoin Address System
Blockstream Bitcoin developer Rusty Russell recently published a proposal for a Segregated Witness-compatible c-lightning system for Bitcoin addresses. Detailing the proposal on their personal blog, Russell laid out plans to to add a prefix at the beginning of each address, as well as eliminate capital letters to improve convenience.
Also read: New Bitcoin Core Update Rolls Out Various Changes
The New Bitcoin Addresses
Surprised at the lack of an address format for the “new form of addresses.” Pointing out an existing option that uses the p2sh address format, Russell says that the only way to currently get “raw segregated witness” addresses is to use BIP142, a proposal that has been deferred.
Without an address format for “raw” Segregated Witness, it seems like Core is stuck with the currency base58 format. Russell would like to see Bitcoin move away from this format, listing several areas where base58 could be improved:
base58 is not trivial to parse. I used the bignum library to do it, though you can open-code it as bitcoin-core does. base58 addresses are variable-length. That makes webforms and software mildly harder, but also eliminates a simple sanity check. base58 addresses are hard to read over the phone. Greg Maxwell points out that the upper and lower case mix is particularly annoying. The 4-byte SHA check does not guarantee to catch the most common form of errors ; transposed or single incorrect letters, though it's pretty good (1 in 4 billion chance of random errors passing). At around 34 letters, it's fairly compact (36 for the BIP141 P2WPKH).
Russell then advanced their own proposal for a Segregated Witness-compatible address format, which might also make Bitcoin addresses easier to use, based on their criticism of base58:
Prefix for type, followed by colon. Currently “btc:” or “testnet:“. The full scriptPubkey using base 32 encoding as per http://philzimmermann.com/docs/human-oriented-base-32-encoding.txt . At least 30 bits for crc64-ecma, up to a multiple of 5 to reach a letter boundary. This covers the prefix (as ascii), plus the scriptPubKey. The final letter is the Damm algorithm check digit of the entire previous string, using this 32-way quasigroup . This protects against single-letter errors as well as single transpositions.
With Russell's proposed format, a Bitcoin address would look like this:
“btc:ybndrfg8ejkmcpqxot1uwisza345h769ybndrrfg (41 digits for a P2WPKH)”
“btc:yybndrfg8ejkmcpqxot1uwisza345h769ybndrfg8ejkmcpqxot1uwisza34 (60 digits for a P2WSH)”
Admitting the “half-baked” state of this proposal, Russell had a short discussion with Core developer Luke Dashjr in the comments section, who offered several critiques of the proposal. The most productive outcome of Dashjr's criticism was Russell's decision to change the prefixes on their proposed Bitcoin addresses. Rather than using “btc:” or “testnet:,” which Dashjr said that “improperly conflates BTC with Bitcoin,” Russell agreed with Dashjr that a better option would be to use “bc” and “bctest.”
At press time, this proposal only exists on Russell's personal blog, and does not have concrete plans for official implementation.

Politics
Congress really needs to get cracking on ObamaCare repeal… while there's still something left to repeal. Because another big chunk of it – another massive system we were promised would be ship-shape by the end of November – just blew up, leaving the maestros of under-achievement to announce a one-year delay on the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday. From the Washington Examiner:
Everybody who was waiting for the pre-Thanksgiving Obamacare news dump can stop waiting. The online exchange that was supposed to make it easier for small businesses to sign up for health insurance through President Obama's health care law has been delayed for a year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services, announced on an afternoon conference call. According to CMS spokesperson Julie Bataille, the small business website now won't be available until December 2014. HHS officials have repeatedly vowed that the feature, known as the SHOP exchange, would be available this November for the federal exchange, which serves residents of 36 states. “The SHOP Marketplace for Federally-facilitated Marketplace states opens Oct. 1, 2013, when small employers can start the application process and get an overview of available plans and premiums in their area,” an HHS press release from Sept. 26 read. “All functions for SHOP will be available in November and if employers and employees enroll by Dec. 15, 2013, coverage will begin Jan. 1, 2014.”
This promise was repeated in testimony before Congress, too. The small-business exchange had already been delayed twice; skeptical Republicans wondered if there was any reason to believe the new assurances.
And now… poof. Gone. All that Intertube and webby stuff is overrated anyway! Never mind the millions of tax dollars that have been frittered away. Grab a pen and some stamps, and mail your small-business paperwork with the tried-and-true postal service. Or maybe you can use one a' them newfangled “fax machines” the youngsters are all lathered up about!
“We've concluded that we can best serve small employers by continuing this offline process while we concentrate on both creating a smoothly functioning online experience in the SHOP Marketplace, and adding key new features, including an employee choice option and premium aggregation services, by November 2014,” said the official declaration of failure, as quoted by Politico. Oh, so they're going to “continue the offline process!” Huzzah! Just give them another year, and they'll have that online thing all worked out. You can believe them this time. Pinky swear.
Amusingly, it appears President Obama didn't warn their pet liberal bloggers this was coming, when they had them over for a meeting just the other day. Bafflement and mystification are the order of the day among the White House media auxiliaries. Let's see if they have enough integrity to refine those feelings into anger and betrayal by Monday.
Republicans didn't have to waste any time shedding illusions, so they responded quickly. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH):
The president bit off more than they can chew with this health care law, and small businesses are now forced to bear the consequences. Business owners across this country are already having health care plans for their employees canceled by this law, and now they're told they won't have access to the system the president promised them to find them different coverage. Instead, they'll have to resort to a system you'd expect to see in the 1950s. It's another broken promise and more proof this administration's assurances have no credibility. This law has been an absolute disaster, leaving us to ask ‘what's next?' If the president doesn't repeal it, they should at least delay the entire law before it wreaks any more havoc on American families and small businesses, as well as our economy.
Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI) of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, sponsor of the recently-passed Keep Your Health Plan Act:
Turkey is not the only thing being carved at the White House this Thanksgiving. As Americans prepare to celebrate and give thanks with their families, the administration announces yet another carefully timed delay of its signature health care law. Just as it did over July 4 while we celebrated our independence, today the administration is doing its best to bury the latest confirmation that this law was not ready for prime time. For months officials looked us in the eye and told us everything was ‘on track' but we have now learned through our investigation that internally the administration had serious concerns about its ability to deliver on October 1. Piecemeal delays and working outside of Congress to issue regulations does nothing to solve the fact that this law remains a tremendous failure that still, two months into open enrollment, is not even 80 percent operational.
RNC chairperson Reince Priebus:
While Americans prepare for the holidays and one day after President Obama gave another speech trying to blame the ObamaCare trainwreck on Republicans, their administration is delaying yet another portion of their signature healthcare law. With each passing day, it's clear how much worse ObamaCare is than a website full of glitches.
Isn't technocratic liberalism grand? Never before has so much money been spent on computer systems to enable the offline process of stuffing folded paper into envelopes to “continue.”
Trevor Andrew Bauer (born January 17, 1991) is an American professional baseball pitcher with the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball (MLB). They also pitched in MLB for the Arizona Diamondbacks.
Bauer played college baseball for the UCLA Bruins, winning the Golden Spikes Award in 2011. They were the third overall selection of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft by the Diamondbacks, and made their MLB debut in 2012.[1] The Diamondbacks traded them to the Indians during the 2012–13 offseason.
Amateur career [ edit ]
Bauer attended Hart High School in Santa Clarita, California. They then attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where they played for the UCLA Bruins baseball team. In their first-year student year at UCLA, Bauer recorded a 9–3 record with a 2.99 ERA, collecting 92 strikeouts in 105.1 innings.
Bauer was a member of the USA 2009 Baseball Collegiate National Team. They were 1–1 with a 4.67 ERA in five games (three starts), with 24 strikeouts and seven walks in ​17 1⁄ 3 innings. In 2009, they were named to the Baseball America first-year student All-America team.[2]
During the 2010 season, the Bruins had the best record (51–17) in school history and were the second best team in the country. The Bruins played in the 2010 College World Series and were defeated by South Carolina in the NCAA Championship Series.[3] In 2010, they were a finalist for the Golden Spikes Award, presented annually to the top amateur baseball player in the country by USA Baseball.[4]
In 2011, Bauer was named the Pac-12 Pitcher of the Year and to the All-Pac-12 First Team. They were also the Collegiate Baseball Newspaper's National Player of the Year. They were named the District IX Player of the Year by the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association (NCBWA) and College Player of the Year by Baseball America.[5]
In their junior year, Bauer went 13–2 with a 1.25 ERA in 16 starts. They set a nation-leading and Pac-12 single-season record of 203 strikeouts. They finished the season with nine consecutive complete games and established new records at UCLA, including 460 career strikeouts, 34 wins, and ​373 1⁄ 3 pitched innings. Bauer was the recipient of the Golden Spikes Award,[6] and the National Pitcher of the Year Award.[7]
Professional career [ edit ]
"He came right after guys. After a couple of guys got on in the second inning, they had that adrenaline going, and they pitched out of it. They used all their pitches which is what everyone wanted to see, and they threw them all very well." Visalia Rawhide catcher Mark Reed, August 2011[8]
Arizona Diamondbacks [ edit ]
Bauer was selected third overall in the 2011 Major League Baseball Draft by the Arizona Diamondbacks.[9] On July 25, they signed a major league contract with the Diamondbacks, being added to the 40-man roster.[10] They made their professional debut with the Class-A Advanced Visalia Rawhide.[11] In the game, Bauer pitched two innings, allowing one hit, striking out three batters and walked one.[8] They made three starts in total in Visalia, pitching in nine innings and allowing three runs on seven hits. However, they struck out 17 of the 39 batters they faced,[12] earning themselves a promotion to the Double-A Mobile BayBears on August 13.[13]
In four starts at AA Mobile, Bauer pitched ​16 2⁄ 3 innings, striking out 26, but walked eight batters and had a 7.56 ERA.[14] They received their first win as a professional August 20, 2011 in a 13–6 victory over the Jacksonville Suns. They were named to appear in the 2012 All-Star Futures Game.[15]
Bauer made their major league debut for the Diamondbacks on June 28, 2012, against the Atlanta Braves. They went 4 innings, struck out 3 batters, and gave up 5 hits in a no-decision. They got their first major league win on July 8, against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
On July 18, 2012, Bauer was optioned back to Triple-A Reno Aces after posting a 1–2 record and a 6.06 ERA. The organization rested Bauer for two weeks to keep their arm lively, and they responded by posting six shutout innings in their first start back on August 6.[16]
Cleveland Indians [ edit ]
On December 11, 2012 they were traded to the Cleveland Indians in a three-team deal. Bauer went to Cleveland with Matt Albers and Bryan Shaw in exchange for Didi Gregorius, Tony Sipp and Lars Anderson. The Indians also acquired Drew Stubbs in a deal that sent Shin-Soo Choo and Jason Donald to Cincinnati to complete the deal.[17]
In 2013 for the Indians they were 1-2 with a 5.29 ERA.[18] In 2014 for the Indians they were 5-8 with a 4.18 ERA.[18]
On June 16, 2015, Bauer got their first hit as a batter against the Chicago Cubs' pitcher Jake Arrieta in the top of the 5th inning at Wrigley Field.[19][20] During the July 3, 2015, game against the Pittsburgh Pirates' pitcher Antonio Bastardo, Bauer imitated their teammates batting stances (Jason Kipnis, Mike Avilés, and Ryan Raburn) in the top of the 7th inning and drew a walk.[21][22] In 2015 they were 11-12 and had the highest rate of bases on balls per 9 innings pitched in the majors (4.04).[23] They led the American League in walks, with 79,[24] and their 12 losses were 7th-most in the AL.
On October 17, 2016, Bauer left Game 3 of the 2016 American League Championship Series due to having cut their pinky on a propeller of their drone on October 14, 2016.
On October 5, 2017, Bauer pitched 5 and 1/3rd innings against the New York Yankees without giving up a hit, setting a new Indians postseason record.[25]
Pitching style [ edit ]
Bauer said they have patterned their overhand delivery after their role model two-time Cy Young Award winner Tim Lincecum.[26] They said they have studied so much video of Lincecum that they can by memory play back frame by frame Lincecum striking out 18 UCLA batters while they were a junior at the University of Washington. "He's been a huge influence on my career and my delivery," Bauer said.
Bauer features an eclectic and large variety of pitches. According to an article in Sports Illustrated, they have experimented with up to 19 different pitches.[1] They explained in an interview why they feature so many pitches:
I'm very passionate about my craft and I've always been into science and discovery and all that stuff, so I'm always trying to find a way to get better from season to season. And throwing more pitches is a way that I've found to.... The more pitches that I have, that have different speeds and move differently, the more confusion it creates for the hitter. And if I throw all of them out of the same tunnel and make them look the same through 20 feet of flight ... obviously, I'm going to be a lot tougher to hit.[27]
According to Bauer, they throw the following pitches:[27]
Four-seam fastball – thrown at 93–94 mph (tops out at 98) [28]
Changeups – thrown 80–84 mph. Bauer says, "I have two variations of it; I can make it cut or I can make it run."
Curveballs – "curve one" thrown at 74–78 mph, "curve two" thrown at 80–81. [29] According to Bauer, "I have two different grips, one that I use for a strike pitch and then another grip I use when I really want to bury it."
According to Bauer, "I have two different grips, one that I use for a strike pitch and then another grip I use when I really want to bury it." "Dot slider" – a traditional slider, 84–86 mph
"Circle slider" – a slider with movement more similar to a cutter. Bauer: "I use that one primarily early in the count to hit tunnels to righties, disguise it, make it look like a fastball or a changeup and keep it in the zone."
"Reverse slider" – thrown at 88–91 mph, it is designed to act as a "left-handed cut fastball ... It's a cross between a sinking fastball and a screwball—it's a little bit slower than a sinking fastball and a little bit harder than a traditional screwball would be."
Split-finger fastball – a traditional splitter, 86–88 mph
Bauer has gained some celebrity for their unusual workout and warmup regimen,[30][31] which includes long toss at distances of up to 400 feet. Bauer is also known to study their pitching mechanics using high-speed cameras.[1] They have posted a series of videos on YouTube showing their pitching mechanics and repertoire in slow motion.[32]
Personal life [ edit ]
Drone accident [ edit ]
Outside of baseball, Bauer collects drones. Bauer sliced and injured their right pinky finger while repairing a drone in October 2016, a couple of days before they had a scheduled post-season start, and they needed ten stitches to close the wound caused by one of the drone's propellers.[33][34][35] Their injury forced their pitching start in the 2016 American League Championship Series to be pushed back from Game 2 to Game 3. Bauer had to leave after the first inning of Game 3, however, when the stitches used to treat their cut opened up.[36] Curt Schilling, who played in the 2004 American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees with a famously bloody sock following tendon surgery, reacted: "Please don't tweet at me about Bauer. They cost themselves a start, likely more, AND their teammates, and fans, dicking around with a drone. #stupid."[37] The Reno Aces, who Bauer played for in the minors, gave out a bobblehead of their likeness throwing a drone at an August 2017 home game.[38]
Conspiracy theories and politics [ edit ]
Bauer is an active Twitter user. They have argued about politics with other Twitter users, joked that one should kill himself, bragged about how smart they are, and tweeted that “690%” of their teammates were fellow Donald Trump supporters.[39] They said that the MLB Commissioner's Office tried to censor them for sharing their opinions.[39]
They have voiced their support of conspiracy theories such as climate change denial and the birther movement associated with Barack Obama.[40] On May 22, 2018, Bauer was accused of carving BD 911 into the pitcher's mound, a reference to a conspiracy theory that indicated "Bush Did 911". Bauer later wrote on Twitter that they wrote BD 91.1 and that the numbers and letters were meaningful to them personally and completely unrelated to the September 11 attacks.[41]
Bauer, who voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election, also criticized American media for a liberal bias in its coverage of the president.[40]
Yet another Powerball drawing was held Wednesday without anyone hitting the jackpot.
That pushes the top prize for the next drawing Saturday to $435 million -- making the potential prize the 11th largest in U.S. lottery history. The cash value of Saturday's drawing is $273.1 million but could climb higher.
Though no one captured the $375 million jackpot Wednesday, four tickets matched five numbers but not the Powerball. They were sold in California, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.
The California ticket is worth $1,674,648. The North Carolina ticket buyer exercised the Powerplay option for an extra $1, increasing the ticket value to $2 million. The others are worth $1 million apiece.
Wednesday's winning numbers were: 5-21-57-66-69. The Powerball was 13.
In New Jersey, two tickets matched four numbers plus the Powerball. One is worth $50,000 and the other -- sold with a Powerplay option is a $150,000 ticket.
Nineteen straight drawings have passed since someone in Arizona won the $60 million Powerball prize on April 1.
Powerball tickets, which have been sold in New Jersey since January 2010, cost $2 each. The odds of a ticket hitting the jackpot are 292,201,338 to 1. Players have roughly a 1 in 11,688,053 chance to win at least $1 million.

They won the Southeastern Conference's Sixth Man of the Year Award last season at Florida after transferring there from the College of Charleston, where they earned an undergraduate degree in physics. Barry also turned heads with their free-throw shooting, hitting 88.3 percent of their attempts last year while shooting underhanded, just as their father once did.
At Florida, in their final season of eligibility, Barry began a two-year Master of Science program in nuclear engineering. So far they have maintained a 4.0 grade-point average.
“I think nuclear engineering is a little tougher than the triangle,” they said, when asked to compare the two. “It requires a little bit more studying than the triangle offense. I feel like if I can get all straight A's in nuclear engineering while studying radiation detection and neutron multiplication, I should be able to run the triangle offense.”
They also have ties to the Knicks' front office. They said their father and the Knicks team president Phil Jackson went on a basketball tour together in Taiwan years ago. And their mother, Lynn Norenberg Barry, a former basketball star at William & Mary, has been friends with Clarence Gaines Jr., the vice president of player personnel for the Knicks, since college. Canyon Barry met both Jackson and Gaines for the first time during their workout.
Under Jackson, the Knicks have made a habit of bringing undrafted free agents into training camp and onto the roster. Last year, Marshall Plumlee and Ron Baker took that course. Barry believes their understanding of the triangle — Jackson has stressed a player's fit into the system as a factor in evaluating players — can help them with the Knicks.
“I think it fits my game really well, which is a high basketball I.Q. and being able to read defenses and play basketball the way it's supposed to be played,” they said.
When blacks gave 80 percent of their vote to the Democratic Party in 1964, black activist Malcolm X called them "political chumps."
White voters, X said, "are so evenly divided that every time they vote, the race is so close they have to go back and count the votes all over again. Which means that any bloc, any minority that has a bloc that sticks together is in a strategic position. Either way you go, that's who gets it."
Yet Democrats, said Malcolm X, failed to deliver on a promised and much anticipated new civil rights bill, knowing the party could still count on their blind support in the next election.
"You put them first," said Malcolm X, "and they put you last. 'Cause you're a chump. A political chump! ... Any time you throw your weight behind a political party that controls two-thirds of the government, and that party can't keep the promise that it made to you during election time, and you are dumb enough to walk around continuing to identify yourself with that party -- you're not only a chump but you're a traitor to your race."
What would Malcolm X say about today's 95 percent black vote? Did the Democratic Party keep its promises to promote family stability, push education and encourage job creation?
The black community, over the last 50 years, has suffered an unparalleled breakdown in family unity. Even during slavery when marriage was illegal, a black child was more likely than today to be raised under a roof with their or their biological mother and father. According to census data, from 1890 to 1940, said economist Walter Williams, a black child was slightly more likely to grow up with married parents than a white child. What happened?
When President Lyndon Johnson launched the War on Poverty in 1965, 24 percent of black babies were born to unmarried mothers. Today that number is 72 percent. Then-presidential candidate Barack Obama said in 2008: "Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison. They are more likely to have behavioral problems, or run away from home, or become teenage parents themselves."
Not only has family breakdown coincided with increased government spending, but the money has not done much to reduce the rate of poverty. From 1965 until now, the government has spent $15-20 trillion to fight poverty. In 1949, the poverty rate stood at 34 percent. By 1965, it was cut in half, to 17 percent -- all before the so-called War on Poverty. But after the war began in 1965, poverty began to flat line. It appears that the generous welfare system allowed women to, in essence, marry the government -- and it allowed men to abandon their financial and moral responsibility, while surrendering the dignity that comes from being a good provider. Psychologists call dependency "learned helplessness."
About the importance of education, Malcolm X once said, "My alma mater was books, a good library. ... I could spend the rest of my life reading, just satisfying my curiosity." What would they say about the Democratic opposition to school vouchers -- where the money would follow the student rather than the other way around?
Urban schools, where students are disproportionately black and brown, are simply not producing children who can read, write and compute at grade level. The dropout rate can approach 50 percent in some urban districts. Nationwide, 10 percent of parents send their kids to private school. But in cities like Philadelphia and Chicago, 40 percent or more of teachers send their own kids to private schools.
Democrats don't do blacks any favor by supporting "race-based preferences" in admissions to colleges and universities. Turns out, the more a school lowers standards to achieve "diversity," the greater the chance the "diverse" student drops out.
More than that, Democrats have convinced blacks that but for race-based preferences, black growth would suffer. Nonsense. Respected researchers Stephan and Abigail Thernstrom wrote: "The growth of the black middle class long predates the adoption of race-conscious social policies. In some ways, indeed, the black middle class was expanding more rapidly before 1970 than after."
Finally, as to the economy, then-chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., admitted: "With 14 percent (black) unemployment, if we had a white president we'd be marching around the White House. ...The President knows we are going to act in deference to them in a way we wouldn't to someone white."
Democratic policies have contributed to family breakdown, maintained underperforming urban schools -- with no opt out for parents -- and have promoted tax-spend-and-regulate economic policies that have resulted in a level of unemployment described as "unconscionable" by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus.
So would Malcolm X call today's black voter a political "chump" -- or a political "traitor"?

Black Swan Racing's driver lineup for next month's IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship season-opening Rolex 24 at Daytona is now complete, with the addition of Andy Pilgrim to the team's roster.
Pilgrim, who was recently downgraded to Silver driver rating, will join season-long drivers Tim Pappas and Nick Catsburg in the team's Porsche 911 GT3 R for all four Tequila Patron North American Endurance Cup races, joined by the previously announced Patrick Long for Daytona.
“Andy and I have been friends for a long time, and as soon as they became available I knew they would be a great addition to our team,” team owner/driver Pappas said.
“He's a proven winner of the race, a champion in almost every category he's driven in, and overall should be a great fit for our team.
“With Nicky, Pat, and now Andy, we clearly have a formidable lineup and with some of the most respected drivers in the series.”
Pilgrim and Pappas have competed against each other, most recently in Pirelli World Challenge, although were previous teammates under the Black Swan Ford GT program at Petit Le Mans in 2008.
Cadillac and Pilgrim parted ways following the 2015 season, which has given the former GM factory driver a fresh start and the opportunity to rejoin Pappas' squad for a four-round campaign next year.
“I couldn't be happier to return to Daytona,” Pilgrim said. “This place has so many special memories for me, driving alongside Dale Earnhardt in 2001, to winning overall three years later, it's an event unlike any other.
“Obviously I've competed against Black Swan for the last several years, and I'm definitely eager to re-unite with them, Tim Pappas and I have a history that goes back a long time, and between Nicky Catsburg and Patrick Long we have an outstanding lineup.
“I have no doubt we'll all learn from each other as we figure out this new Porsche next week.”
When it comes to problematic issues within the Jewish community, how can we have tough conversations without straying into unsavory, even hateful territory?
Right now, a video criticizing joint Israeli-American police training is making waves. Produced by Jewish Voice for Peace, the video is part of its recently-unveiled End the #Deadly Exchange campaign.
Ending the occupation and American police brutality are urgent and laudable goals. But the video falls into a trap of casting 'the Jews' as having outsized and pernicious influence on both.
skip - End the #DeadlyExchange
End the #DeadlyExchange Jewish Voice for Peace
The video does some good things. It points out the worldview shared by Netanyahu and Trump, something I've written about. It reminds viewers that black and brown lives matter. And it explains that a U.S. corporation produces the biometric technology used to help run the occupation.
But after laying out the scope of Israel-US security coordination including, in its widest purview, $3.8 billion in annual American aid, the narrator asks: "Who is making this deadly exchange possible? The main groups are actually U.S.-based Jewish organizations."
The video then moves to domestic policing issues. "Who's going on these exchanges? Officers who lead police departments that brutalize black and brown communities."
For all my appreciation for tough messaging, saying that Jewish groups are the primary drivers of U.S. aid to Israel and for the scourge of institutionalized racism in America makes me queasy. It makes me queasy in that the causal logic is so deeply implied but so empirically thin as to imply a secret conspiracy.

And it makes me queasy in thinking that just when Jews and People of Color should be standing shoulder to shoulder in fighting fascist impulses in America, the video implicitly suggests that one community might actually need to turn on the other for their own survival.
Two core questions remain. First, would these training trips occur without brokering by Jewish groups? Very likely, yes. Security and policing coordination between Israel and America is deep and wide. JVP's website acknowledges as much when it cites Georgia State University as playing a role in facilitating some of these trips.
Most importantly, do these training exchanges increase violence against civilians? Theoretically, more training should mean the embrace of de-escalation tactics. The video does not tell us what actually goes on in these sessions.
Other groups, like IfNotNow, seem to pull off this balancing act of exposing the Jewish community without suggesting outsized influence more adroitly. Indeed INN's mandate calls for "American Jewish institutions" to "end their support for the occupation."
Why do INN's tactics feel less abetting of anti-Jewish animus? Is it because many of INN's leaders describe themselves as having grown up within the orbit of the mainstream Jewish community? Is it because, while INN doesn't condemn BDS, neither do they promote it?

If so, this would be a tough ask of JVP. Surely JVP is entitled to gather members who have varying types of Jewish background. Similarly, JVP should be allowed to adopt a non-violent tool of resistance and solidarity (that is, BDS) without being accused of aiding anti-Semitism.
The main difference, I think, is two-fold. The first is making clear, when criticizing, that one is pointing to the role our community plays in the problem at hand, rather than framing the problem as being primarily driven by our community.
The second is signaling. JVP head Rebecca Vilkomerson says they want to lead an internal conversation. "We feel like our piece of the work is to target Jewish organizations that are sponsoring" these trips. But the video does not make clear that this is the intention. In fact, Vilkomerson says that the video is intended to speak to multiple audiences - including "people who are the target of violent policing in the U.S." They add, however, that their goal "is certainly not to say that Jews are to blame for violence of People of Color."
Vilkomerson is careful in their causal claims. But the video is not.
Tough conversations have their costs. The justice-seeking left can be sharp-elbowed. While Vilkomerson said that, "I feel excited to be starting this conversation in the American Jewish community," not everyone is so gracious in the face of critique. Owing to this op-ed, my own social network might be a little lonelier tomorrow.
But when we demand of our institutions that they build wider tents, and when we call on our community leaders to speak out when things aren't right, then we must be prepared for tough conversations anywhere. It might expose chinks in the armor of the progressive left, but healthy alliances are ones that should be able to do the work of self-reckoning when something misses the mark.

ROME – Paolo Virzi's “Like Crazy,” a road movie about two women who escape from a mental institution in Tuscany, took top honors Monday night at Italy's 61st David di Donatello Awards, the country's equivalent of the Oscars. The film took home five statuettes, including prizes in the key categories of best picture, the best director, and best actor, which went to Valeria Bruni Tedeschi.
The evening's two other big winners were “Indivisible,” a neo-Gothic drama set in Naples and directed by Edoardo De Angelis, about teenage conjoined-twin sisters with beautiful voices, and Matteo Rovere's “Italian Race,” set in the world of GT racing. “Indivisible” took five nods, including for best screenplay, producer, and supporting actor, and “Italian Race” won six statuettes, including the best actor for Stefano Accorsi, cinematography, and editing.
Virzì's “Like Crazy” launched last year from Cannes and sold widely internationally, with Strand Releasing picking it up for the U.S. Their upcoming film, English-language drama “The Leisure Seeker,” toplining Helen Mirren and Donald Sutherland as a runaway couple who embark on a twilight-years road trip from Boston to Florida, has been pre-bought by Sony Classics for North America.

A visibly moved Valeria Bruni Tedeschi thanked Italian modern psychiatry pioneer Franco Basaglia, who closed the country's prison-like mental asylums, and my “poor psychoanalyst,” among others.
The nod for best first-time director went to Marco Danieli for “La ragazza del mondo,” about a romance between a girl who is a Jehovah's Witness and a young ex-con.
Tom Ford's “Nocturnal Animals” took the David for foreign film from outside the European Union, while the nod for E.U. pic went to “I, Daniel Blake,” by Ken Loach.
This was the second edition of the Davids produced and aired by Murdoch-owned paybox Sky, rather than by pubcaster RAI, which had always handled the awards in the past. As with last year, the ceremony was emceed by local “X-Factor” host Alessandro Cattelan, and was a rather restrained but classy affair.
Sky is ramping up to become a key player in Italy's film industry with the launch of a theatrical distribution arm named Vision Distribution in partnership with with producers Cattleya, Wildside, Lucisano Group, Palomar, and Indiana Production. Together, those producers account for about 40% of the domestic share of the Italian box office. The new distribution outfit, which is headed by former Warner Bros. Italy managing director Nicola Maccanico, will launch this summer.
Meanwhile, the domestic share of the Italian box office in the first quarter is down from 46% last year to 22% this year. Last year's whopping 46% of the local market was largely due to smash comic hit “Quo Vado.”
Triple Oscar-winner Roberto Benigni was honored with a Special David earlier in the day by Italy's President Sergio Mattarella and Culture Minister Dario Franceschini.

Microsoft Research has an app in the Windows Phone Store called WindUp and it lets you share media and text messages with a time limit. Similar to Snapchat, you can send media or messages to friends and set it to expire after a certain time.
“Create and share fun, temporary messages and media with friends using WindUp. Decide how long a message will last – set it to expire after a time or view limit of your choice. Set a low limit to “wind up” your friends as they race to see what you've posted, or set the limit high to make your message last longer. WindUp lets you share pictures, videos and audio snippets, as well as text,” the app description reads.
The official Snapchat app for Windows Phone has yet to make an appearance and those who want their Snapchat fix are required to snag a third-party app like 6snap. Fortunately, it seems that Microsoft has already created something similar to Snapchat with the WindUp app.
Snapchat obtained popularity due to its ability to send media and messages to friends or loved ones and having it self-destruct after a certain amount of time has elapsed. So while we sit and wait for an official Snapchat app for Windows Phone, we can utilize Microsoft's own WindUp app which offers a similar functionality.
The app works on Windows Phone 8 and Windows Phone 8.1, having recently receiving an update. Grab it for free via the download link below and see if you like it!

The Conservatives will try to lift the fox hunting ban if the party wins May's general election.
The party will offer a free vote in the next Parliament to legalise hunting if the party wins in May, The Telegraph can disclose.
The news has emerged on Boxing Day, traditionally the biggest day of the hunting calendar when thousands of supporters turn out to watch their local hunts.
The party's manifesto is set to say that the Hunting Act is wrong-headed and a future Tory government would try to repeal it.
The decision will be on a free vote of MPs in the House of Commons, echoing the manifesto commitments in 2005 and 2010, and has been agreed with Oliver Letwin, the Cabinet Office minister who is drawing up the manifesto.
The Hunting Act 2004, which prohibits the pursuit with hounds of various wild mammals in England and Wales, came into force under Labour in February 2005. The pursuit of foxes with hounds was banned in Scotland in 2003.
Simon Hart, a Tory MP and chief executive of the Countryside Alliance between 2004 and 2010, said: “All the indications are that a commitment will be just as robust as it always has been and there is no reason to believe any changes are intended or planned.”
The wording is likely to be the same as the 2010 party manifesto, which said: “The Hunting Act has proved unworkable. A Conservative government will give Parliament the opportunity to repeal the hunting act on a free vote, with a government bill in government time.”
The Coalition agreement then committed to “bring forward a motion on a free vote enabling the House of Commons to express its view on the repeal of the Hunting Act”.
However the pledge was not delivered on, and few Westminster watchers now expect there to be a vote before May's general election.
Nick Parrish, parliamentary researcher for the Conservative Rural Action Group, said the party wanted to pledge to bring hunting legislation in line with the law in Scotland.
They said: “What we need is an overall majority to enable the Conservatives to deliver this otherwise we will not. This is something that I and many people in the countryside believe in. It is a matter of freedom and livelihood and should be put right.”
Tim Bonner, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, said: "We fully expect the Conservative manifesto commitment to repeal of the Hunting Act to be retained in 2015 and repeal or replacement of the Act is matter of trust between the countryside and the Conservatives. If there is a Conservatve majority, or a Conservative led coalition, there must be action on hunting."
David Cameron, the Prime Minister, was an enthusiastic supporter of hunting before they became Tory leader, riding to hounds with the Heythrop Hunt.
Tory MPs have been left frustrated that one of the final commitments from the 2010 Coalition agreement – for a free vote on hunting – is unlikely to be honoured by the Government before May.
Labour has sought to use the hunting issue to portray the Conservatives, and the Prime Minister personally, as preoccupied with the concerns of a privileged elite, and out of touch with wider public opinion.
In the past, Lynton Crosby, Mr Cameron's election adviser, is said to have warned ministers that raising the hunting issue would be a damaging distraction from the party's core election message, which focuses on the economy, welfare and immigration.
A Conservative party spokesperson said: "We are still deciding what will be in our manifesto and will outline its contents in due course."
Did you know that sports and political TV commentator Keith Olbermann used to be a photographer? A number of their photos were purchased by Donruss (now known as Panini) back in 1981 for its first set of baseball cards.
Sports photographer Brad Mangin, whom we interviewed in December 2015, mentioned this fact very briefly last year while giving a special presentation on the history of MLB photography (it's at 16m21s in):
“Keith Olbermann, the television broadcaster, is a baseball freak,” Mangin said. “He actually used to be a photographer and shot really bad pictures for the first Donruss set of baseball cards in 1981. They're really bad.”
No, Mangin wasn't being mean. Olbermann themselves says that most of the photos were “awful.” In a Tweet back in 2013, Olbermann said that they sold about 15 photos to Donruss for that initial set (he was about 21 or 22 at the time):
Re: photography. Actually sold about 15 photos to Donruss for their initial baseball card set in 1981. Most were awful. — Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) June 19, 2013
Here are 5 of the cards that were allegedly photographed by Olbermann:
Olbermann reportedly shared the story of these photos in a letter written to Baseball Card magazine in 1991. They said that Donruss had asked them if they had a photo of pitcher Vern Ruhle. They did, but their flash had “failed” to properly illuminate the portrait, so the result was “shadowy.”
“Is it better than our Charboneau?” Donruss asked.
“Barely,” Olbermann replied.
“Just send it anyway,” the company instructed.
Olbermann did, and that's why the 1981 card for Ruhle shows the pitchers eyes obscured by the shadow of their baseball cap.
Image caption MPs approved the bill without amendments on Wednesday evening
A move to ensure the government takes on board the Good Friday Agreement during Brexit negotiations has been rejected by MPs.
The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) proposed the amendment to the Brexit bill which paves the way for the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
It was defeated by 327 votes to 288.
MPs approved the bill, backed by the Democratic Unionist Party and Ulster Unionist Party, without amendment on Wednesday.
SDLP MPs and Independent MP Lady Hermon voted against it.
On social media, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said they were "very proud" of their three MPs for their "fight to protect us and the Good Friday Agreement".
Commenting on the vote, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said: "This decision confirms my worst fears. The British government doesn't care one iota for the people of the north."
DUP MP Sammy Wilson said: "DUP MPs supported the government throughout the bill's passage to ensure there were no changes introduced that would frustrate or delay Brexit, dilute Northern Ireland's position within the United Kingdom or deny the electorate their wishes.
"Amendments such as those tabled by the SDLP and SNP were simply another attempt to frustrate the will of the people and I am delighted they were not successful."
'Particular curiosity'
Lady Hermon said they still had not been persuaded that Brexit would be good for the country.
"I hope to be proved wrong, and look forward with particular curiosity to see how a seamless, frictionless border is achieved with the Republic of Ireland," they added.
David Ford, from the Alliance Party, said unionists had "put our current political system at risk" by not backing the amendment.
"The vote against this amendment is deeply worrying as it leaves our institutions without protection as the exit process gets underway," they added.
Ulster Unionist Party MP Tom Elliott commented: "The Irish ambassador to the UK, Daniel Mulhall, confirmed there is an absolute determination from the Irish government to ensure the 1998 agreement is not impacted by Brexit.
"We supported the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, which was designed to obtain Parliamentary approval to trigger Article 50. Our approach to amendments was to keep our focus on the intended purpose of the bill."
The bill will now move to the House of Lords.
Prime Minister Theresa May wants to trigger formal Brexit talks by the end of March.
A new poll shows that more than half of Germans support the idea of introducing a “dominant culture” as recently presented by the country's Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere. Their proposals ignited debate in political circles and on social media.

The survey, conducted by the INSA research institute for the German Focus magazine, revealed that 52.5 percent of Germans believe that their country needs a “dominant culture” while 25.3 percent oppose the idea of ushering in any such values.
Almost 53 percent of respondents said they associate themselves with German culture while only 30.6 percent consider themselves members of a European culture.
Knowledge of the German language, adherence to the country's constitution, respect for the equality between men and women, and the rejection of all radical views that contradict the democratic order were considered as the core features of a dominant German culture by the majority of respondents to the poll.
The survey was conducted on May, 3 and included 1,000 people.
On April 30, de Maiziere outlined their 10 principles of a German “dominant culture” in an opinion piece published by the Bild daily. Their set of core features of a dominant German culture particularly included the principle of meritocracy, respect for German history and culture, commitment to social consensus and a unifying role of religion and Christian values as well as a definite “behavior pattern.”
The minister did not write about the potential statutory recognition of the proposed set of values and principles, saying that they only sought to “stimulate a discussion about a dominant culture for Germany.”

Their suggestions, however, provoked heated discussion among German society as well as in political circles. German Green Party member, Jamila Schaefer, said “preserving one culture” would impede peaceful co-existence and social development in a society that “is always changing,” particularly through migration.
Meanwhile, some politicians, including Christian Lindner, the chair of the Free Democratic Party (FDP), and Katja Kipping from the Left Party, saw de Maiziere's move as an attempt to distract people's attention from the real issues such as poverty or security.
Germany's Food and Agriculture Minister, Christian Schmidt, however, supported de Maiziere by saying that those living in Germany should respect its Christian traditions even if they do not follow them as well as equality between men and women. “Those, who do not want to lead such a way of life, would not assimilate” in Germany, they told Passauer Neue Press newspaper.
The country's former president, Christian Wulff, presented their own vision of a German “dominant culture,” which they described as a “free and democratic dominant culture.”
According to Wulf, a “German dominant culture” consists of human dignity and basic human rights and freedoms anchored in the German constitution. “We should thank our openness to the world for our global stature and economic success,” Wulff wrote in an opinion piece published by the Focus magazine.

They noted, though, that the cultural “pillars of our [German] nation” are becoming increasingly important as a multicultural, multiethnic and multi-religious society is “becoming reality in Germany.”
Some people have meanwhile ridiculed bits of de Maiziere's proposals on social media. They particularly mocked their idea of a “specific behavior pattern” reflecting the openness of German society. Others ironically said that sausages – a dish widely associated with Germany - will always be a priority for people in the country.
Others, however, saw a dangerous incitement against Muslims in the minister's words.
A Syrian-German political scientist, Bassam Tibi, came up with the term “Leitkultur” (dominant culture) in the 1990s. It described not the German culture in particular, but rather the European values in general, including human rights and democracy.
The debate about a dominant culture was revived in 2016 when the Bavarian ruling party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), presented a document calling for enshrining the priority of traditional German and Christian values they called a “dominant culture” in legislation along with proposals for toughening the country's refugee policy.

U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Tuesday said that Islamic State violence against Christians, Iraqi Yazidis and other religious minorities in the Middle East was genocide.
“I think I was asked this a couple months ago, and I said that term carries with it legal import, it is a very important concept and label for behavior that deserves that name,” Clinton said at a town hall in Berlin, New Hampshire, when asked about the Islamic State's killing of Christians, Yazidis, Kurdish Muslims and other religious minorities in the region.
“I am now sure we have enough evidence, what is happening is genocide deliberately aimed at destroying lives and wiping out the existence of Christians and other religious minorities,” Clinton said.
Islamic State has targeted and killed members of the Yazidi religion, one of the oldest in Iraq, along with Christians and other religious minorities in the region it controls in the Middle East.
The administration of President Barack Obama is weighing whether to designate Islamic State violence a genocide and which religious minorities would be coveraged by such a designation.

Riding the train from Rome to Bologna, I am constantly reminded as to how much nicer the train experience is in Italy. The seat feels nicer, the cabin feels bigger and the scenery blows away anything I would see between Newark and Philadelphia. Staring at the two suit-wearing gentlemen next to me, I have to feel a little bit sorry for them because chances are their journey isn't going to end at the Ducati factory. Ever since the US press officer, John Canton, confirmed the tour, my wife has met all my outbursts of jubilance with a monotone, “that's great, honey.” It's not that they don't share my affinity for Ducati, she's just tired of hearing my nonstop yapping about it.
Once on the property, our tour guide, Natasha, leaves us in the cafeteria momentarily and gives us very strict instructions to stay out of the service corridor. “You will get run over by a fork lift” is something we easily make out through their Italian accent. While awaiting their return, I have an epiphany – Journalists take this tour all the time, what fact could I possibly present that hasn't been shown to the world a hundred times over?
While pondering a fresh angle on an over told story, a factory worker walks past the glass doors rolling a Desmosedici RR down the very corridor I've just been forbidden to enter. By the time I've got my head to the edge of the doorframe and peeked around, the man and the bike are gone. At that moment, it dawns on me – to a true sport bike lover, a Ducati isn't about statistical data, it's about the experience I just had. It's an elusive taste of something just beyond our reach. The entire brand identity is cloaked in the idea that by owning one of these hand built Italian machines, you are or part of something that is, for lack of a more complicated word, special. Some would have you believe that the difference strictly comes down to money, but as we enter the assembly floor and are told to put away our cameras, I would have to disagree. My vote is that it has more to do with the experience of the ride and having a connection to the machine.
For those of you that have to have numbers, let me get that out of the way. The sole Ducati assembly plant in Bologna produces around 100 bikes a day in the slow season, 200 a day in the spring and summer. Our guide proudly informs me that in 2006, (the year control of the company was taken back from investment group Texas Pacific) the rate of errors on parts was six percent, but since that time they have squashed that number down to one percent. They now machine their own parts in house and can assemble a two-valve engine in 50 minutes, a four-valve in 75. The average assembly time on a complete bike is three hours.
The assembly floor is plenty loud and it's all I can do to hear our guide and digest the stream of info as we walk though a sea of crankshafts and engine cases. We follow a painted yellow line on the floor and move past the areas where workers both male and female sit at stations and cobble together bottom ends. Next come cylinder heads. Metal rolling racks look like Christmas trees covered with four valve heads as they sit waiting to be matched up to a 1098. As Natasha moves us to the next station, I almost have to laugh just thinking about how much just one of those heads would cost at a dealership if purchased as a replacement.
“Do you know what this is?” they ask. “It's a camshaft.” I blurt out. I think I'm feeling a little inadequate because I don't have a garage full of Ducatis at my house in Los Angeles. I figure I can partially make up for my lack of prowess by being able to identify every internal part that my tour guide might hold up.
Next up is the engine testing station. It's a clear booth manned by one employee. We stand and watch them roll what looks like a Sport Classic engine into the box, then hook up some sensors and let the automated procedure begin. The device takes it up to about a thousand RPM to check for oil pressure, strange noises and vibrations. There is no fuel or spark at this point, just a testing of the rotating assembly. After passing, updated documents are put back in their vinyl sleeve and sit with their completed engine until it finds its new home in the cro-moly tube chassis of a finished bike. On the way to the assembly lines – which are really mobile stations positioned in a linear fashion – we pass a wall of engine racks. Each stand carries assembled engines individually tagged: 848 USA, 848 Europa, 1098 USA, etc. Between that and the overall cleanliness of everything, and this place is starting to feel like Santa's workshop, only Santa doesn't have 40 superbike frames hanging from hooks in unison in the same way a candy machine displays bags of M&Ms.
“Are these painted or powder-coated?” It's a question I ask to seem smart and make Natasha feel good about giving me this tour. They're painted in case you were wondering, but I'm writing information so quickly that I don't have time to ask why.
The assembly line is exactly what I would expect as we watch a small team put a tank and seat on a Monster. The crew is so content that I ponder the thought of getting a job here so that I could apply my 30 percent employee discount towards an RR, but I let it go because my Italian is so sloppy. Completed bikes sit in a holding pen before being pulled up to a stand for cleaning and emissions testing. Again, a clean-cut guy in bright red coveralls attaches hoses to the ends of the mufflers and fires the engine for the first time. I stand to take it all in before we make our way to the end of the station and take a sharp left turn.
At this point, I see what amounts to the Legend of Bigfoot. Nearing the end of its own assembly line is a Desmosedici RR. There's no mistaking its identity, as it stands by itself in aggressive red glory with nothing around it but a single worker. There is another on a lone stand finishing its final inspection. I envision cracking the guy over the head and making a break for it, although I don't think there is enough gas in the tank to get me to the front gate and being a single mount, I would have to leave my wife behind, which, after explaining myself to John, would make for an awkward flight back to the states with Nichole. I'm not allowed to bother the guy handling the finishing touches, but Natasha informs us that an RR engine takes about 3.5 hours to complete and three workers finish a bike in six. Between six to eight make their way out of this building every day. The last of the 1500 RRs will move through this very spot in December, but even if you just won the lottery, they were all spoken for a long time ago. So what will happen on this assembly line after the RR is done? That's anybody's guess, because Natasha isn't talking. It's a pretty big deal to stand in the place where they make the fastest production bike in the world. The RR holds the top spot in a group of tag-able race bikes that can be counted on one hand. As Natasha puts it, “It's a Ferrari on two wheels.”
While passing an inconspicuous door with a high round window, our guide informs us that behind it lies the “racing” department. You would laugh if you could see me standing on my tippy toes with my nose pressed against the glass. You have to wonder how many other grown men have assumed the same position trying to get a mere glimpse of anything they could later brag about to their friends. That's the reason we are not allowed inside, and also the reason for the procession of “dummy” engines that line the hallway behind the door, so that nosey journalists have something to look at. John Canton later informs me that the racing department is really run from the paddocks of racetracks on their respective tours, and that even when here in the off season, there isn't much to look at but computers and graphs. I politely take their word for it, but I'm not sure I entirely believe him.
After completing the tour and taking a stroll through the museum, John walks the two of us over to the abandoned utility buildings that were bombed during World War II. On our stroll, we talk about our own bikes and the roles they play in our lives. I reluctantly admit to them that I have a restored 1990 GSXR 1100 as it was the bike I couldn't afford when I was a kid. They don't miss a beat and tells me that restoring eighties sport bikes is a trendy thing to do right now. They ask if I have a Ducati and I answer “Not yet.” The main reason is because I wanted to do a little more homework before looking for a bike.
I think my search will ultimately bring me to a 916. It's an iconic example of the brand's history and its breakthroughs paved the way for so many great things. One might call foul if I were to toss out the word “classic” while describing a fourteen year old bike, but in a way, almost every Ducati is a classic. Which brings me back to the reason I took this tour in the first place. Owning a Ducati isn't about statistics, although theirs are impressive. It's about that elusive taste of something just beyond my reach and the hope that at some point, if I'm lucky, I just might be able to grab it. Because doing so would mean owning a piece of history and being part of something that is, for lack of a more complicated word, special.

On Saturday evening Adonis Stevenson will face Tavoris Cloud which will be the first defense of the WBC light heavyweight title that they won against Chad Dawson in June. If Stevenson is successful, the plan is for them to face their mandatory challenger Tony Bellew before the year is out. That would mean three fights in a span of about six months which suits Stevenson just fine.
"I am very happy that I have had a busy schedule. I just fought Chad Dawson in June so I am still in shape. I never stopped training so I don't see how Cloud is going to beat me. I am still in shape and I am always training," Stevenson stated.
A fight between Stevenson and fellow power puncher is Sergey Kovalev is a match up that has many fight fans salivating. Stevenson said that they have no problem facing Kovalev but said that the Russian needs a signature win first.
"I would like to fight them but they need to build their name up. They need to fight a good opponent and not just any opponent. You see that I have Chad Dawson who is the linear light heavyweight champion and now I fight Tavoris Cloud who is the former IBF champion. I think Kovalev needs to fight someone like that first," Kovalev told BoxingScene.com.
I asked Stevenson what they thought about Kovalev's last opponent Nathan Cleverly. Kovalev captured the WBO light heavyweight title when they stopped the Welshman in four rounds in their August meeting.
"Nathan Cleverly? Who did do they fight? They just fights in England and he's a decent fighter but they just fights decent fighters. They step up and takes one test against Kovalev and you see what happened," Stevenson explained.

Takeout pizza and a DVD are a natural fit for many. So Domino's Pizza in Brazil decided to combine the two in a campaign via Artplan São Paulo.
In partnership with 10 video rental stores in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the brand used rented DVDs as media. About 10 discs each of 10 different new release titles such as Argo, 007, Dread And Dark Knight were stamped with thermal ink and flavored varnish, both sensitive to the heat.
While people were watching the movie, the heat of the DVD player affected the disc. When the movie ended and they ejected the disc, they smelled pizza. They also saw pizza: the discs were printed to look like mini pies, and carried the message: "Did you enjoy the movie? The next one will be even better with a hot and delicious Domino's Pizza."
In this age of streaming video, the idea might seem a bit anachronistic. However, "in Brazil streaming services like Netflix and iTunes are relatively new, and for people with good social conditions," said ArtPlan art director Diogo Barbosa. "Also our broadband connection isn't as fast as that used in the U.S., and because of that we still have video rental stores in your neighborhoods."

AnonPaste's press release on AnonPaste Anonymous and the Peoples Liberation Front have launched AnonPaste.tk as a replacement for its use of Pastebin. AnonPaste uses the ZeroBin software published earlier this week which offers an encrypted version of a Pastebin-like service. The difference with ZeroBin is that all the entries are encrypted with keys that the server never sees but which can be included in the URL for any entry. The ".tk" domain is a service which offers free domain names for the top level domain for Tokelau, a New Zealand territory in the South Pacific.
The hacktivist collective has used the Pastebin service in the past to publish calls to action and also the results of its hacking, much to the chagrin of its owner. The press release, itself published on AnonPaste, called the new service "a totally secure and safe alternative to the now infamous PasteBin service" and complained that PasteBin had been "willing to give up IP addresses to the authorities". Anonymous says that "there will be no need for us to police this service" as the "responsibility for the legality or appropriateness of any paste is the sole responsibility of the person posting".

Have you ever wanted to build a gaming PC but didn't want to go through the hassle of buying components and unpacking boxes? Wouldn't the whole process be easier if you could just select your parts from a menu and slot them into place with the click of a mouse? No, I'm not talking about using a custom pre-built service. The answer is PC Building Simulator, available now for download on itch.io.
True to the legacy of classic flight sims or the more modern trucking simulators, PC Building Simulator is relatively realistic when it comes to simulating putting together a gaming PC. Sure, all you're doing is selecting parts from a menu and clicking them into place, but just as flight sims make you flip all the switches and turn all the knobs, PCBS has you screwing in motherboard standoffs and manually connecting MOLEX cables.
The game's still in a pretty rough state—there isn't more than one option available for most parts, and some are just placeholder items even—but that's fairly understandable considering it's listed as being in a pre-alpha state. Judging by the menus, it looks like there's a full career mode planned, presumably where you'll try to eke out a living as a custom PC builder, accepting incoming purchase orders and assembling rigs for your customers. It remains to be seen how much more the current systems will be fleshed out, as well. For my part, I think it'd be pretty cool to have options for manual cable management—a critical but often overlooked aspect of a well-put-together PC build.
Either way, it's a pretty cool little game, especially if you dig tinkering simulators like My Summer Car. And if the part inventory gets fleshed out considerably, it'd be really cool to have this sort of 3D testing interface to complement the process of putting together a rig on PC Part Picker.
PC Building Simulator is available now for download on itch.io.
I have to make a confession: I've never liked the RTS genre. There's way too much meandering around and not enough action. I feel that with most RTS games like C&C and StarCraft, you spend quite a bit of time building your units before you actually start the action part of the game about five minutes later (rushing takes a lot less time, but the results are varied).
And I absolutely HATE it when your opponents can easily cripple you by taking out your resources, while you are busy trying to make a remote base. It throws you into this scenario where you either have to cheese it or sell your units to bulk up your defenses for your main base. I'm more of a turn based strategy gamer, so I like the fact that someone cannot pull a game winning move while I'm busy doing something else.
With DETOUR, there is no wait time for an object to be established, no “welp, there goes my base”, or resources that need to be collected by scavengers. You constantly get a flow of money that allows you to have access to whatever the hell you want, right now.
And it's incredibly fun, because the gameplay gives you this sensation of being in control but at the same moment, being surrounded by chaos. At any point in time you have to deduce whether you should build roads, destroy your opponents' trucks, manipulate the cops or all of the above in your quest to get your trucks to the other side of the board first.
The campaign is good too, though some people might find it a tad easy. However, the writing is what takes the cake, and the kooky characters you encounter are quite a delight.
The biggest problem with DETOUR is the longevity. Unless this game is picked up but a good community, I don't see it living very long.
Fortunately, the developers already have a pretty solid gathering building up, so I'm not too worried. But even if there aren't a lot of people, you can still play with bots and with the built-in map editor, you can come up with a lot of crazy scenarios.
Overall, with the great music, outstanding writing, chaotic gameplay and extremely cheap price tag, DETOUR definitely feels like it's worth a purchase.
Verdict: BUY. You can check it out on Steam by clicking here.
After years of threats and warnings, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) and their Democratic majority on Thursday executed the “nuclear option” to eliminate the filibuster for executive branch and judicial nominees, except for the Supreme Court.
Fifty-two Democrats voted to scrap the filibuster rule after Republicans again blocked cloture on the nomination of Patricia Millett to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Democratic Sens. Carl Levin (MI), Joe Manchin (WV) and Mark Pryor (AR) voted with Republicans to uphold the filibuster and avoid the rules change.
“Republicans have routinely used the filibuster to prevent President Obama from appointing their executive team or confirming judges,” Reid said on the Senate floor. “We're burning wasted hours and wasted days between filibusters. I could say instead we're burning wasted days and wasted weeks between filibusters. … It's time to change. It's time to change the Senate before this institution becomes obsolete.”
Reid invoked the swath of GOP filibusters of cabinet, sub-cabinet and judicial nominees, from Chuck Hagel and Mel Watt to executive positions and Obama's three nominees to the powerful D.C. Circuit court — Millett, Nina Pillard and Robert Wilkins.
“Is the Senate working now? Can anyone say the Senate is working now?” the majority leader said before the vote. “I don't think so.”
The “Reid Rule,” as supporters are calling it, does not affect the minority party's ability to filibuster Supreme Court nominees or legislation.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) fumed at Reid's decision, accusing them of trying to change the subject from Obamacare and “cook up some fake fight over judges.” They argued that “by any objective standard, Senate Republicans have been very, very fair to this president” when it comes to letting them appoint their nominees.
“I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle: you'll regret this,” McConnell said. “And you may regret it a lot sooner than you think.”
Here's how it happened. First Democrats called for a simple-majority vote to move to reconsider the failed Millett nomination, whicwas approved 57-40. Then McConnell scrambled to head off the coming rules change by calling for a motion to adjourn the Senate until 5 p.m on Thursday. That vote failed, 46-54. Then Democrats moved to advance the Millett nomination, which had to be at a 60-vote threshold, and Republicans filibustered them again, 57-43.
At that point, Reid took the historic step of raising a point of order that when the Senate votes on cloture again, the threshold should be at a simple majority. Understanding rules, the presiding officer ruled that motion out of order. Reid then appealed the ruling, and a majority of senators (52 — all Democrats) voted against upholding the filibuster. The vote was 48 to keep the filibuster, 52 to scrap it. That historic vote created a new precedent by which a simple majority may bypass cloture on nominations.
The presiding officer, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), made clear after the vote that the new precedent set does not apply to Supreme Court nominees.
McConnell then made an attempt to overturn the nuclear option vote, which failed 48-52.
Earlier this summer, during the previous filibuster fight that ended without a rules change, the Republican leader warned that if Reid ends the filibuster for nominations, they would end the filibuster for everything, including legislation, if they become majority leader.
Joining a long and storied lineage of combustible Apple products, an iPhone 4 recently caught on fire when being hooked up to a computer via its Apple-provided USB cord. The phone was fried and its owner's hand singed, reports BGR.
According to a source inside AT&T, the charring resulted from a faulty USB port and not human error:
Apple did confirm to our AT&T connection that this did appear to be a defective USB port and not some sort of user error. Our source went onto say that the phone bezel was extremely hot (obviously), and it slightly burned the customers hand. The USB port in the phone was slightly melted and the cord was badly melted (as is apparent in the pictures).

Not that anyone expects this to be a widespread concern, but it's unfortunate that every time a new iPod or iPhone comes out there seems to be at least one or two reports of the device catching fire. There was the iPhone 3G and iPod Touch last year, the iPod Nano the year before that, and other scattered incidents in between.
It's a known, recurring problem. So why, after all these years, does something as serious as a flammable gadget continue to be an issue? [Boy Genius Report]

Roy Moore's Republican Senate candidacy in Alabama is facing a precarious future. GOP senators have abandoned them in droves; the National Republican Senatorial Committee has ended its relationship with Moore's campaign; and yesterday, the Republican National Committee scrapped its field operation in Alabama in advance of the Dec. 12 special election.
Moore and their allies, however, have a survival strategy, and it came into focus last night at the Walker Springs Road Baptist Church in Jackson, where the right-wing candidate, accused of sexual misconduct towards teenagers, delivered extemporaneous remarks.
Describing a nation in spiritual decline – Moore lamented the end of government-sponsored prayer in public schools – the GOP candidate complained, for example, that the government “started creating new rights in 1965.”
Moore didn't elaborate, but it's worth noting for context that Congress approved the Voting Rights Act in 1965, a year after passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Neither law was popular in Alabama. [Update: 1965 was also the year the Supreme Court issued its ruling in Griswold v. Connecticut, which said women had a right to access contraception through a right to privacy.]
In case that was too subtle, this was less understated.
Also Tuesday, it was revealed that at least one person in Alabama received a robocall from someone claiming to be a reporter for the Washington Post seeking to pay money for claims against Moore – a fake call that was condemned by the newspaper. The call was first reported by CBS station WKRG of Mobile, who spoke to a pastor who got the call. The newspaper denied making the call. “The Post has just learned that at least one person in Alabama has received a call from someone falsely claiming to be from The Washington Post. The call's description of our reporting methods bears no relationship to reality,” Post Executive Editor Marty Baron said in a statement.
And what made-up name did the fake reporter use? Bernie Bernstein.
Moore and their allies have reason to worry about the election's outcome, but how they're responding to these circumstances says a great deal about the candidate and the kind of message they believe will resonate with Alabama voters.

The USL's FC Cincinnati added to the many crowd marks it's set at Nippert Stadium when it drew 30,160 fans for its U.S. Open Cup win over the Columbus Crew on Wednesday, but it has plans for a stadium of its own -- the sine qua non, it believes, for an MLS expansion team.The club unveiled designs for a soccer stadium -- a 25,000-seat horseshoe-shaped stadium -- at an event for season ticket holders on Monday at the Over The Rhine's historic Woodward Theater, a local music venue.
FC Cincinnati's goals -- quite ambitious and contingent on getting an MLS expansion franchise -- is to have everything wrapped up by the end of the summer, though it will need to find a home -- sites under consideration include Cincinnati's West End and the Oakley neighborhood and a site in nearby Kentucky -- and secure funding for the $200 million stadium.
The need for MLS teams to control their revenue streams has forced FC Cincinnati to consider other options besides Nippert Stadium, the home of the University of Cincinnati's football team. FC Cincinnati president and general manager Jeff Berding has said a soccer-specific stadium is necessary to win one of the four MLS bids.
Opposition to public support for stadium funding is a hurdle. The NFL Bengals' Paul Brown Stadium was heavily subsidized with public money, making it one of the worst public financing deals ever for the construction of a sports facility. Hamilton County is also still paying off Great American Ball Park, home of the baseball Reds.
FC Cincinnati broke the USL attendance record for a regular-season game three times in 2016 -- the largest crowd was 24,376 -- and for the playoffs -- 30,187. It averaged 17,296 a game in 2016, while it's averaging 19,415 a game in 2017, better than the average attendance of 10 MLS clubs.
Wednesday's crowd of 30,160 for the first Buckeye State meeting between FC Cincinnati and Columbus set a new U.S. Open Cup record at a non-final.
2017 Average Attendance:
19,415 FC Cincinnati
18,397 Real Salt Lakes
18,000 San Jose Earthquakes
17,215 Houston Dynamo
16,704 D.C. United
16,412 New England Revolution
16,260 Philadelphia Union

On Monday morning, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to announce its final decisions of the 2013-2014 term. Only two cases still remain undecided, and one of them is perhaps the most closely watched case of the year: Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. At issue is the so-called Obamacare contraceptive mandate, the provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which requires most businesses to cover birth control in their employee health plans. What are the legal issues at stake? Here's a rundown from my recent column on the case:
According to Hobby Lobby Stores Inc., an arts-and-crafts retailer owned and operated by a family of evangelical Christians, the contraceptive mandate forces both the business and its owners to violate their religious scruples by providing access to four methods of birth control they see as equivalent to abortion, such as the emergency contraceptive Plan B. That requirement, Hobby Lobby maintains, violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), a 1993 law signed by President Bill Clinton which says the government may not "substantially burden a person's exercise of religion," unless it has a "compelling" justification and has used "the least restrictive means" available. The contraceptive mandate, Hobby Lobby told the Supreme Court in its main brief, "is a textbook 'substantial burden' on religious exercise under RFRA." The mandate's defenders take the opposite view, arguing that Hobby Lobby should lose because a for-profit corporation is unable, by definition, to exercise religion. As David Gans of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center put it, "corporations cannot pray, do not express devotion and do not have a religious conscience." Therefore, they argued, "the justices should reject the notion that a corporation is a person that exercises religion."
During oral arguments in March, the justices appeared closely divided over these issues, peppering the lawyers on each side with a series of sharp questions.
"Every court of appeal to have looked at the situation have held that corporations can bring racial discrimination claims as corporations," Chief Justice John Roberts told Solicitor General Donald Verrilli. "Does the government have a position on whether corporations have a race?" Roberts asked. In other words, if corporations are treated as persons for purposes of equal protection jurisprudence, why should a free exercise claim brought by a corporation be treated differently? Verrilli was forced to concede that in discrimination cases "corporations can bring those claims."
Justice Stephen Breyer, a leader of the Court's liberal wing, also seemed dubious of that portion of the government's case. "Take five Jewish or Muslim butchers, and what you're saying to them is if they choose to work under the corporate form," they have to abandon the Free Exercise Clause as a legal tool, Breyer observed. "Looked at that way," they continued, "I don't think it matters whether they call themselves a corporation or whether they call themselves individuals."
But Hobby Lobby also ran into problems of its own. Justice Elena Kagan, for example, worried that if the Court allowed this particular religious objection to prevail it would open the floodgates and completely undercut the federal health care law. "There are quite a number of medical treatments that different religious groups object to," Kagan argued. "So one religious group could opt out of this and another religious group could opt out of that and everything would be piecemeal and nothing would be uniform."
Justice Anthony Kennedy, meanwhile, who may well hold the deciding vote in the case, left both sides guessing. "The employee may not agree with the religious—religious beliefs of the employer," Kennedy observed at one point. "Does the religious beliefs just trump? Is that the way it works?" At another point, however, Kennedy took issue with the solicitor general. “Under your view,” Kennedy told Verrilli, a for-profit corporation "could be forced to pay for abortions...your reasoning would permit that."
A decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby is expected on Monday morning.
If you're looking for some of the year's best new digital children's books to read to your kids or grandkids, here are a couple we recommend.
The iPhone and iPad may be famous for their video games and apps, but it's also a thriving marketplace for authors and there are thousands of good reads across all genres to be found in the iBooks store. Unfortunately, these books do not appear in a normal App Store search, and can only be discovered through iBooks. This can make it tough to find something interesting and new when you are looking for a fun read for the kids while on the road or – let's be honest – when you're just sick and tired of re-reading the same book over and over again.

From China's turbulent capital market last week, the most significant thing to watch is the rise of Likonomics (which China Daily first reported as Li-economics), a word coined by Barclays Capital during the turbulent past week, to describe China's economic scenario likely to be pursued by the cabinet led by Premier Li Keqiang.
No stimulus, de-leveraging and structural reform are identified as the three key components of Likonomics, meaning, in a nutshell, trading the economy's short-term pain for long-term gain.
If it proves workable, it may be seen as a mini-crisis on a controlled scale, engineered by the government's visible hand, to divert from the likelihood of a more serious crisis that would otherwise be inevitable if things are left entirely to be decided by the invisible hand of market forces.

Many of these titles have now been renewed, including all of. See next post for the full rundown.)There's been a lot of buzz in the last 24 hours regarding the large block of BBC shows scheduled to expire from Netflix Instant on the 31st (and which have been listed here for over a week). Sources as diverse as The Huffington Post, CNN, MTV News, and Vulture have all referenced this site's expiration list, which has been awesome, but it's also led to some minor confusion. So, to address any questions some of you might have:Not every streaming BBC show is marked to expire. Programs such as, and, for example, look to be safe (for now). If there's a specific title you're worried about that you don't see here, just search for it on Netflix's website, then hover your cursor over the thumbnail like so:See that availability date? It will also be listed on the show's main info page, down on the right beneath Streaming Details:If there's no availability date, then you're okay (again—for now!). As longtime readers know, this isn't always a foolproof test, since Netflix can be cagey about revealing such dates. But for this block of shows (and TV series in general), it's usually accurate. (Movies, of course, are another matter...)As I often point out, this is a curated blog, so I only list those titles I feel are most significant. However, additional titles can always be found in the comments section, which is where I often look to compile my own lists. So always scroll through the comments to see what else may be on the chopping block. In the case of the BBC shows, a January 4 post by Anonymous covers most of those in question, but I've also put together a consolidated list of everything below.According to sources elsewhere, Netflix is apparently hard at work trying to hammer out a new agreement with the BBC so that these shows can be renewed soon (if not necessarily in time for the 2/1 deadline). My own feeling is, considering that series are fast becoming Netflix's bread and butter (something like three quarters of all streaming are TV shows), it would be crazy of them to let all these programs expire for good. And when you consider the backlash that would result from losing fan favorites like, and, it would be a serious oversight indeed—especially if Amazon Prime and Hulu continue to offer many of these.Add to that the long-term relationship Netflix has maintained with the BBC, plus the recent high-profile additions of shows likeand, and I'm betting this won't be the last you see of Messrs. Cleese, Palin, Who, et al. In the meantime, it probably wouldn't hurt to finish whatever series you've already started, and queue up as many others as time allows.

With Ebola spreading among healthcare workers in Dallas, and two-thirds of the American public favoring a ban on flights coming from affected areas of West Africa, President Barack Obama is beginning to take the rising Ebola threat seriously.
On Wednesday, Obama revealed that they will not travel to New Jersey and Connecticut to attend prescheduled events for Democrats campaigning to retain their offices ahead of November's midterm elections. They will instead convene a meeting of Cabinet agencies to coordinate the federal government's response to Ebola in the United States.
Obama will deliver some remarks following that meeting, as they should. Amid a crisis of confidence in so many traditional institutions of authority in America, the inability of U.S. health agencies to contain the spread of this disease – even allowing an infected health care worker to travel on an aircraft – will only prompt Americans to shed even more faith in their representatives to competently keep the nation secure.
Some analysts are suggesting, however, that the White House's response to this crisis must account for political concerns. That is myopic. This is not a political crisis.
There are indications that the competence of America's health security agencies is questionable. At least one NBC reporter suggested that the Centers for Disease Control have not been honest with the American people about the scale of this breach in health security.
“The CDC, the local officials, they knew about this. They had to know about this before that news conference,” NBC reporter Mark Potter said while reporting on the revelation that an infected Texas health care provider was allowed to fly. “Frontier Airlines was notified at 1 a.m., if I read the email correctly, Mountain Time. And that news conference was a lot later than that.”
“If the CDC was telling this to Frontier Airlines, that statement that we might have some more cases really seems quite ironic right now because it may mean that the concern is much greater than we were led to believe,” they added.
That is a serious charge, but it suggests that the agencies coordinating America's response to the Ebola crisis in America did not want to start an undue panic. Being less than forthright with the public has, however, likely contributed to one. Obama has their work cut out for him, but their first objective should be to be perfectly forthright about the nature of the Ebola crisis both domestically and overseas. If they aren't, as the CDC apparently wasn't, it will catch up with him.
Image caption Online crime maps were launched in February
The Home Office is considering adding photographs of offenders and more details about their offences to online crime maps.
The government, confirming details in the the Sunday Times by the police minister, said the plan was to increase transparency and accountability.
It cited what it called a "trailblazing project" in West Yorkshire which identifies criminals.
Campaign group Liberty said local papers already published such details.
Policing and Criminal Justice Minister Nick Herbert said: "We want to build on the success of the police.uk crime mapping website by adding more information about how offences are actually dealt with in the criminal justice system.
"A trailblazing project is being run by West Yorkshire police to map justice outcomes.
"We are determined to increase transparency and enable the public to hold the justice system to account."
The online crime maps for England and Wales were launched in February, and allow users to see which offences have been reported in their local streets by entering a postcode or street name.
'Macho posturing'
The West Yorkshire crime maps have been going since 2005. By inputting their address, residents can see the location of any alleged offences, ranging from murder to litter dropping. It is updated monthly.
Shami Chakrabarti, from Liberty, dismissed the Home Office plan as "macho piece of posturing".
"Excuse me but haven't local newspapers being doing this for years?"
They told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show that it was interesting that in "one of the worst recessions this country has ever faced, everybody - opposition and government - [is] posturing on law and order, often with relatively minor tweaks."
Information on the crime map website is broken down into six categories - burglary, robbery, vehicle crime, violence, other crime and anti-social behaviour. Sex crimes have been included in the "other" category, along with crimes such as theft and shoplifting, to help prevent victims from being identified.
PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — Two leaders of a mosque tried to cut off the hand of a man they allege stole jars of money from the house of worship, Philadelphia police said.
The bizarre incident happened July 14th at the Masjid located in the 1100 block of North 63rd Street in the city's Overbrook section.

According to investigators, the 46-year-old arrived at the mosque at about 4:00 a.m. for Morning Prayer services.
At about 5:30 a.m., after the prayer service concluded, police say the victim was approached by the mosque's Imam and the Amir.
Investigators say the two males accused the victim of stealing jars of money from the Masjid.

I suppose I really have to go there
Apparently there is a great amount of confusion concerning the difference between atheism and secularism. Well, I'll help try and provide some education on the two. Recently, a guest blogger (Sarah Jones) on Libby Anne's “Love, Joy, Feminism” here on Patheos blogged about why they are not a secular activist even though they work for Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.
First things first – they are equivocating. It is something that is commonly done when either 1) the person presenting doesn't know what they're talking about or 2) the person presenting is intentionally misleading their crowd. I don't think this was a case of example 2 but it is a mistake to equivocate the terms atheism and secularism. One can be a secularist without being an atheist. It happens all the time. In fact Barry Lynn, the Executive Director of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, is an ordained minister and believer. They work tirelessly to fight the infiltration of the theocrats from taking over the US Government. But they are a secularist, and a secularist activist.  They are not, however, an atheist.
Definitions
Let's start with misconstrued definitions.
The clearest example of this is the use of the word “theory”. The most accurate and trusted dictionary in the world is the Merriam-Webster's Dictionary. *Anyone can publish a dictionary as a ‘Webster's Dictionary' but ONLY the Merriam-Webster is authoritative.* Here is what Merriam's says are the five definitions of “theory”:
the analysis of a set of facts in their relation to one another (science)
abstract thought (layperson)
the general or abstract principles of a body of fact, a science, or an art (music)
a belief, policy, or procedure proposed or followed as the basis of action (a set of rules)
a plausible or scientifically acceptable general principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena (see 1 above)
a hypothesis assumed for the sake of argument or investigation (sherlock holmes)
When involved in an argument over science those (creationists) who don't accept the precepts of science will always state that evolution is “just a theory” which leads me to three conclusions.
They don't know the definition of just. They don't know the definition of theory. They've never read a dictionary.
If by just they mean something so concrete that it binds the science world together then, yes, it is “JUST a theory – triumphantly so!”
Equivocating
If by theory they think it means anything beside definition 1 as stated above by Merriam-Webster, then they need to take a science class.
When an individual (in this example) equivocates a term in an argument, they make a false representation of the definition of a word and attempt to get that passed to the uninformed in a crowd. It wastes the time of their opponent who has to then explain the equivocation to the crowd before giving their rebuttal….all within their rebuttal time.
Transposing a word with multiple definitions by using it correctly in one sentence and then using the same word but the alternate definition is a clear sign of either ignorance on the word itself….or intentional deception. I get somewhat perturbed when I have to continually explain this again and again to believers when they come to me with questions, but that's okay because at least they are willing to listen. I get angry when I have to reinforce that within my own ‘community' because I know that we should all be filling the role of informing the uninformed or ill-informed believer. When we fail to uphold that standard for ourselves then we must correct ourselves and charge on…but it still gives some ammunition to the fundamentalists – but they aren't going to stop anyways.
All that being said – atheism and secularism are two different things.
Atheism –
a disbelief in the existence of deity
the doctrine that there is no deity
Secularism –
the belief that religion should not play a role in government, education, or other public parts of society
indifference to or rejection or exclusion of religion and religious considerations An atheist is more than likely a secularist. But let's not lump the two together. A secularist need not be an atheist. I, myself, am married to a Christian Secularist. My wife is a Christian that believes in the absolute separation of church and state. Before we run around stating we are not “secular activists” let's ensure that we aren't doing a disservice to what secularism is. Secularism is solely keeping the church out of the affairs of the state – in keeping with the Constitution and what the Founding Fathers deemed as the only government that could succeed.
Activism
I suppose I am an atheist activist. I do work for American Atheists. But the biggest concern I have and what is more important to me is secularism. I am a secularist activist before an atheist activist. I'm more concerned with the separation of church and state than I am with promoting atheism. But while I am in the role of being an atheist that pisses all over the concept of “No atheists in foxholes” I am certainly going to take the opportunity to do all I can to destroy that false stereotype as well.

Topp 10 27/50 listor SVT: 98 Tittar: 73 Bästa SBI-placering: 7 – 2016
Efter det sensationella fotbollsguldet för IFK tar sig staden för första gången upp topp 10. Även publikt gjorde laget total succé 2015. Dolphins basketherrar tog sig hela vägen till SM-final. Jesper Nielsen (handboll), Jonas Jacobsson (skytte), Nilofar Mosavar Rahmani (frisbee) och Malin Baryard Jonsson (ridsport) är andra Norrköpingsprofiler som utmärkt sig under året.
Motiveringar plats 1: Norrköping har en imponerande bredd i förhållande till population med svenska mästare i fotboll som sticker ut men även med bra lag i basket på både herr- och damsidan och dessutom ett hyfsat ishockeylag. /Rikard Lann, reporter, SVT-juryn
Norrköping har bäst spridning av idrotter, sporter och anläggningar inom den grupp städer som ligger i spannet under de 3 stora. Dessutom hygglig publikstad./Lasse Carlsson, Tittarjuryn

Topp 10 29/50 listor SVT: 73p Tittar: 88p Bästa SBI-placering: 8 – 2016
För första gången topp 10 och det efter dubbla guldfester under våren. MSSK lämnade Piteå och flyttade norrut, i Luleå gjordes storsatsningen som bar guld direkt. Dessutom tog Luleå Basket (tidigare Northland) tredje raka SM-guldet. Även herrlagen i hockey och basket nådde semifinaler. Bredden är inte den största men toppen imponerar rejält i Alexander Majorovs hemstad.
Röstningsanalys: En stad där juryn är oenig, fyra jurymedlemmar hade Luleå i topp och ytterligare fem på pallen. Men 21 medlemmar hade inte ens med Luleå topp 10, tunn bredd, spetsig topp.
Jurymotiveringar plats 1: Att lilla, men framför allt geografiskt avskärmade Luleå kan ta SM-guld i basket och hockey är en sak. Att de spelade dubbla semifinaler på resp herrsidor är nästa. En tredje är det enorma intresset runt damfinalerna i ishockey. Om damhockeyn lyfter i intresse i höst så är det Luleå som ska tackas. /Diljen Otlu, reporter, SVT-juryn
Den relativt lilla staden Luleå tog bland annat hem 2 SM-guld (lika många som de större konkurrenterna). Framförallt gjordes en medveten satsning inom damhockeyn succé för resultat, publik och sporten i stort vilket visar att satsningar som den här bidrar till förutsättningar för alla att utöva sin idrott på alla nivåer. /Sara Andersson, tittarjuryn

Det bjöds på dubbla guldfiranden i studentstaden under våren. Storvreta tog tillbaka innebandytiteln efter några år och även Fyrisfjädern badminton klev åter upp på tronen. Dessutom tog veteranen Annika Billstam ett nytt VM-guld i orientering. I Uppsala finns både bredd och topp men man saknar lag i fotbollsallsvenskan och SHL, vad händer här om Sirius går upp?
Röstningsanalys: Med på över hälften av alla jurylistor, får ungefär lika många poäng av SVT-juryn och tittarjuryn. Dalar några placeringar men det är tätt uppåt.
Motivering plats 1: Staden med störst bredd i sina prestationer, där fina resultat återfinns i både individuella- och lagidrotter, utan att ha ett enda större bakslag idrottsmässigt. Uppsala har under det senaste året levererat jämna resultat och krönt sitt idrottsår med några fina medaljer i högsta valör – dessutom i idrotter som inte alltid sticker ut mest. /David Backa, studerar idrottsvetenskap, tittarjuryn

Idrottshistoria som den om Leksands resa från krislag under hösten till SHL-avancemang under våren bör inte kunna skrivas. När de utförs i en liten ort med 15 000 invånare fascineras vi än mer. Leksand är tävlingen överlägset minsta kommun men når ännu en gång topp 10. Lumberjacks tog SM-silver i softboll, hockeydamerna blev femma i Riksserien.
Röstningsanalys: SVT-juryn gav nästan tre gånger mer poäng än tittarjuryn till Leksand. Att en kommun med 15 000 invånare ens klarar grundkriteriet imponerar.
Motivering plats 1: Den bragdartade återkomsten till SHL gör att Leksand är tillbaka på allvar som idrottsstad. Att en kommun med blott 15 000 invånare har lyckats skapa flera elitlag är unikt och riktigt starkt!

Team Pergamons Martin Larsen vann EM-guld men både de och X-calibur fick nöja sig med silver i år. Klart högre poäng hos tittarjuryn än hos SVT-juryn.
Motivering plats 1: Partille skördar framgångar inom handbollen och andra sporter inte bara i Sverige utan även internationellt. Partille cup går av stapeln varje år. En liten kommun med 37 000 invånare som presterar bra med tanke på antal invånare. Sen så kommer ju Isabelle Gulldén från Partille och som har varit magisk denna säsong.

Tokyo Police Club Brooklyn, New York October 2015
Canadian indie rockers Tokyo Police Club returned this past spring with Melon Collie and the Infinite Radness, Pt. 1, a new five-track EP and their follow-up to 2014's Forcefield album. The second installment in the series is already on the horizon, and while it doesn't feature any members of Smashing Pumpkins, it does boast former Vampire Weekend member Rostam Batmanglij.
Since leaving Ezra Koenig and the rest of their Columbia University cohorts earlier this year, Batmanglij has kept busy with solo and collaborative work as well as guest songwriting and production duties for the likes of Bon Iver and Kanye West (“Friends”), Wavves and Cloud Nothings (“I Find”), and Santigold. They lend similar talents to “My House”, the lead single off Melon Collie and the Infinite Radness, Pt. 2, a track whose stout riffs stomp and chug along before giving way to a sweeping, panoramic chorus.
“'Any old day now…' is one of the most fun lines to sing,” TPC's own Dave Monks tells Consequence of Sound. “All that snarl, and the lyric is so confrontational. From the demo to the mix, we kept walking the line between trashy and beautiful. There are some really abrasive sounds but also some sweet and soaring melodies. We wanted to see how far we could take it in each direction.”
In an additional statement, Monks recalled how “My House” was born:
“It came together spontaneously, in fits and spurts, starting with ‘My House.' I wrote this one with my friend Rostam, and I think it embodies the spontaneous nature of the whole EP. Rostam and I have been trading ideas and jamming since we met back in 2007 when both our bands were just babies (and Vampire Weekend opened for us at a little club in Boston!). One day last year when they stopped by my house (no pun intended) to hang, they picked up a guitar and I started singing melodies. In 10 minutes, we had the skeleton of this song.”
Stream the track below.
Melon Collie and the Infinite Radness, Pt. 2 officially arrives on September 23rd. In support, the band will be touring North America all this fall.

In what is believed to be the highest-ranking defection from the GOP so far, former Bush and Reagan-appointee Richard Armitage says they will vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton over Republican Donald Trump, Politico reports. "If Donald Trump is the nominee, I would vote for Hillary Clinton," the deputy secretary of state for President George W. Bush and assistant Defense secretary for President Ronald Reagan said."He doesn't appear to be a Republican," Armitage told Politico. "He doesn't appear to want to learn about the issues. So I'm going to vote for Mrs. Clinton."Other high-ranking Republicans have been publicly critical of Trump over their rhetoric and some of their positions, including calling for a ban on Muslim immigration and building a border wall and making Mexico pay for it. Some have even said they might not be able to vote for him, but none as high-ranking as Armitage have stated publicly that they would vote for Clinton instead.Armitage said they do not know whether more in their party will support Clinton, but told Politico that many of their conservative friends who have backgrounds in national security "are confused" having to pick between Clinton and Trump and are not sure who to vote for."They're in kind of fog," Armitage said.
Picture this common scene on a Sunday afternoon. Your team could really use a scoring drive to turn the tide. On a 3rd-and-10, before the quarterback is even pressured, they quickly throw a 2-yard pass, and the receiver is tackled a few yards later to bring up fourth down. The crowd grumbles, the offense casually jogs off the field and the punting unit comes on. Better luck next time.
Sure, once in a blue moon the offense may throw a bubble screen on 3rd-and-33 and end up with a 52-yard touchdown, like the Rams did with Robert Woods against the Giants in Week 9 this season. But that is the rarest of exceptions.
Generally, safe passes like that don't accomplish much, and we have the data to back that up. How does that 2-yard pass on 3rd-and-10 work out? According to the ESPN Stats & Information Group, quarterback passes thrown no more than 2 yards beyond the line of scrimmage on third down with at least 10 yards to go have been converted only 10.9 percent of the time this season. On throws that travel at least 10 yards, quarterbacks have converted 38.6 percent of the time. So an offense can more than triple its conversion rate just by doing the most obvious thing when trying to move the chains: throwing the ball past the imaginary yellow line on your TV screen.
And yet despite this, NFL teams are leaning on the short pass more than ever. The same league that transformed into a passing league over the past 10 years is slowing morphing into something else: the dump-off league.
There are some risks with throwing deeper, of course, such as a higher interception rate. And in some special situations, getting a first down isn't the primary goal of a drive, especially when facing third-and-long. Sometimes teams are just trying to get enough yards to make a field-goal attempt shorter. Or with a big lead in the second half, they're hoping for an easy completion that will run some clock and gain field position.
But when an offense really needs to score points, playing it safe and throwing short of the sticks on third down is often the inferior strategy. We looked at the data from ESPN Stats & Info for passes on 3rd-and-10 or longer for Weeks 1 to 13. We divided the passes between those thrown short of the sticks and those thrown at or beyond the sticks:
Short passes become punts Key outcomes for passes on 3rd-and-10 or longer, Weeks 1-13 PASS THROWN ATTEMPTS COMP% YPA TD% INT% CONV. RATE Short of the sticks 672 73.2% 6.6 1.2% 2.4% 12.5% At or beyond the sticks 390 42.8 9.6 4.4 3.8 42.6 Source: ESPN Stats & Information Group
The completion rate for short throws is more than 30 percentage points higher than the rate for longer passes and yet the conversation rate is more than 30 points lower. This is not surprising because defenses are playing to prevent the first down and are willing to concede a fraction of the yardage. However, this positioning make it very difficult for a team to throw short and run after the catch to convert.
So far we have only talked about third downs, the crucial down for maintaining offensive success. However, analyzing aggressive and conservative passing on first and second down is also important. A bubble screen that loses a few yards to bring up 2nd-and-13 is also putting the offense in a position to fail.
Football Outsiders' key efficiency metrics, including Defense-adjusted Value Over Average (explained here), are built around the concept of successful plays and are adjusted for factors like the down and distance. For instance, a 5-yard pass on 3rd-and-3 is more valuable than a 5-yard pass on 2nd-and-17. For a pass to be considered a successful play, it must gain at least 45 percent of the needed yards on first down, 60 percent on second down, and 100 percent on third and fourth. A completion that does not meet those standards is considered a failed completion. Joe Flacco of the Ravens set the failed completion record last season, with 144, and they lead all quarterbacks in 2017 with 95 through Week 13.
It's not just Flacco. The ineffective dump-off is happening across the NFL. Leaguewide, 26.1 percent of all completions this season qualify as failed completions. That's the highest rate for a season in the Football Outsiders database, which goes back to 1989, and if the 2017 rate stays at that level, it will break the current high bar set in 2015 (25.1 percent).
This is not to say that the short pass doesn't have value in the NFL playbook or that every quarterback should begin slinging the ball 25 yards downfield each time they take a snap. There is no one right way to run an NFL offense, and some teams have been able to use the short pass to devastating effect. To get a better sense of this, let's look at which quarterbacks throw short most often using air yards stats.
Football Outsiders has a stat called “Short%” to denote the percentage of attempts that a quarterback threw short of the minimum yards needed for a successful play, as defined above. So if 45 percent of needed yards are required on first downs, then anything shorter than a 5-yard throw on first-and-10 would be considered a short pass here. The league average for Short% in 2017 is 41.6 percent on first down, 45.5 percent on second down, and 42.5 percent on third down. It's not until fourth down that most quarterbacks realize the importance of needing to convert with a big throw. Short% on fourth down is 26.2 percent (although that is only on a sample of 214 plays).
We looked at Short% on first, second and third downs for quarterbacks who have had a minimum of 200 dropbacks this season. For the 35 quarterbacks, we took the z-score (standard deviations above or below average) of each percentage and added them up, to make sure we were accurately capturing quarterbacks who threw short on all of their downs relative to the league. The quarterback with the largest summed z-score in the table below is the most conservative, as a higher percentage of their passes were short of being a successful play.

*Short% is the share of passes that fall short of a successful play's distance (at least 45 percent of the needed yards on first down, 60 percent on second down, and 100 percent on third) Source: Football Outsiders
Some of the names at the top of the list are predictable, including Flacco and infamous short pass maestro Alex Smith. Jay Cutler has been very dink-and-dunk oriented with Adam Gase in Miami this season, while San Francisco's first two quarterbacks this season (Brian Hoyer and C.J. Beathard) made the top five.
The real surprise here is the name at the very top: Drew Brees. Not only do they rank as the most conservative passer, but they have consistently stuck to this strategy no matter what the down is. To their credit, Brees has made it work — the Saints rank No. 1 in offensive DVOA and No. 6 in passing. Perhaps more accurately, the running backs are making this offense work. Through Week 13, rookie Alvin Kamara ranked as the best receiving running back while teammate Mark Ingram ranks as Football Outsiders' top rusher. With two RBs capable of big gains on any play, it's no surprise that Brees is throwing short early and often. We'll see if this strategy can sustain itself — the Saints have failed to score 21 points in all four of their losses this season (each was to a playoff contender, including last night's loss to Atlanta).
At the bottom, seven quarterbacks had a combined z-score below 2.0 standard deviations. That includes the trio of favorites for the MVP race in Tom Brady, Russell Wilson and Carson Wentz, whose aggressive styles this year have been a positive for their offenses. Similar things could have been said about Deshaun Watson before Houston's standout rookie tore their ACL.
But being aggressive is not a magic formula for success as the list plainly shows. Watson's backup, Tom Savage, has tried to emulate Watson's aggressive style, but without anywhere near the same success. Likewise, Jameis Winston of the Buccaneers is routinely one of the leaders in air yards per attempt, but their lack of consistency remains a problem for Tampa Bay. In Dallas, Dak Prescott is throwing aggressively, but their receivers are getting the fewest yards per carry after the catch in the league.
Like with any stat, Short% is only one piece of the puzzle, and every quarterback has their own set of circumstances. As we see with Brees, a quarterback can get away with passive play if he's extremely efficient and the team is still winning.
Few quarterbacks have this type of arsenal or this type of ability, so they would be better served trusting the numbers and resisting the easy dump-off.

After their beloved dog passed away five years ago, artist Mark Barone and their partner, Marina, began searching for a new dog at animal shelters. During their research, they ware shocked to learn that around 5,500 shelter dogs are euthanized each day in the United States. Barone decided that their next artistic project would be a tribute to these animals. Four years ago, they began painting a series of works that they call “An Act of Dog.” The plan was to paint 5,500 portraits of dogs that have been killed in animal shelters, and display them in a Museum of Compassion. “The aim of the project is not just to raise awareness, but also to raise funds for the rescues that are on the front lines trying to save these animals,” Barone says.
In early 2011, Barone relocated to Louisville and began working on “An Act of Dog” full time. Before the snowstorm hit Louisville on Sunday, Mark Barone says they were on the home stretch. “I was on my last five [paintings]. I was waiting for the last five because the PBS documentary filmmakers wanted to capture the last five I was doing.” You can watch a trailer for this documentary here.
Then came the snowstorm. “I came in Tuesday morning. There had been drips and leaks in there…but where the paintings were stacked – there are twenty shelves of paintings, about five shelves high each – so they're all stacked on there. So when the sun started hitting the snow and the snow started melting, it started leaking in a spot right over three full shelves of paintings. There was just water pouring in over them.”
The paintings, which were stored in Barone's rented studio space in Mellwood Arts Center, are mostly done on medium density fiber board, which had been primed to sustain regular fluctuations in moisture, but not to survive sitting in “pools of water” as Barone described. Sadly, the paintings weren't insured. “We just didn't have the money to pay to insure 5,500 paintings, because that would be so extraordinarily expensive to do. I used all my retirement savings to do the project anyway, and if I'd had to insure the art that would have eaten up all my savings just for the insurance. That just wasn't an option for us.”
200 of the paintings are “probably completely destroyed”, and 800 are possibly salvageable, though that will take almost as much work as completely repainting them. Some have suggested Barone auction off the ruined paintings, but though they find their sentiment kind, they say “I don't want my work going out damaged. My name's on this stuff.” One of the most painful things about this disaster, Barone says, is “there was an evolution to the paintings. As you paint, your paintings develop. And I can never get that back again. That's gone.”
But what does this tremendous setback mean for the completion of Barone's project? “I'm more determined now than ever,” they say. “There's no way I'm going to quit, because I wouldn't be quitting on myself, I'd be quitting on these animals.”

ASHEVILLE - Even in summer, it's often a cold and windy spot on the Blue Ridge Parkway, sitting at elevations ranging from 5,600 to nearly 6,000 feet high. The visitor center is bare bones – no telephone, no flashy exhibits or fancy bathrooms.
Despite all that, the Craggy Gardens area, about 20 miles northeast of Asheville, is one of the most beloved and visited spots on the 469-mile parkway.
All that love has had its toll on the hiking trails and increased the need for visitor services. Funds from the Blue Bridge Parkway Foundation this year will give Craggy Gardens Visitor Center and Craggy Flats Bald Trail a much-needed face lift, along with many other enhancement projects along the parkway.
The Blue Ridge Parkway is among the busiest of the more than 400 sites in the National Park Service, with 15.2 million visitors last year. It also has one a $517 million maintenance backlog, one of the worst in the country.
Each year the Parkway Foundation, the nonprofit fundraising arm of the parkway, helps to chip away at the maintenance needs and fund other necessary programs.
Funding for projects this year include designing a plan for recreation and natural resource management at Waterrock Knob where more than 5,300 acres were added to the scenic spot last year through funding from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the work of four land conservation groups and millions of dollars in private funds.
Vista restoration at overlooks, expansion of a citizen science wildlife camera program, and other projects will round out this year's foundation projects.
Repairs to Craggy Flats Bald Trail, a popular wooded path leading from the Craggy Picnic Area to the blueberry-covered bald, which been marred by erosion, will be restored in August by a youth crew with the American Conservation Experience.

“There has been a lot of erosion on that trail over the years. It's a significant rare plant community,” said parkway botanist Chris Ulrey.
“It's a bit of a challenge since there are not a lot of roots to hold soil in place, and the trail has become gullies. We'll be hauling gravel from the picnic areas to fill in the heavily eroded places.”
The Craggy Gardens Visitor Center was built in the late '60s, said parkway spokesperson Leesa Brandon. The trail shelter was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. The rustic nature of the area will remain, they said.
“That location lends itself to being more of an outside than an inside type of visitor center. The real experience is being outdoors,” they said.
Old interior exhibits will be refurbished as well as wayside panels interpreting the area's history, air quality, weather, climate and vegetation.
The Craggy projects will cost $30,600 and the fundraising goal for other projects slated for this year is $953,497, said Rita Larkin with the parkway foundation
The nonprofit is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year.
“We've created a community of flight attendants that spurs us forward with their enthusiasm and passion for their park,” said Carolyn Ward, CEO of the parkway foundation.
Since 1997, the foundation has worked with donors to invest more than $12 million in critical parkway projects, including construction of restrooms at Graveyard Fields, building of boardwalks on Rough Ridge Trail, the expansion of the Linville Falls Overlook, and the launch of the Kids in Parks program.
The Parkway Foundation is also raising funds to pair with money allocated by Congress to address critical parkway repairs through the Centennial Challenge, in which donor gifts will be matched by federal funding.

US telecom operator T-Mobile has purchased 31 MHz low-band spectrum for $7.99 billion during the recently concluded 600 MHz FCC spectrum auction.
Bellevue, Washington-based T-Mobile won 45 percent of all low-band spectrum sold, covering 100 percent of the US and Puerto Rico, quadrupling the Un-carrier's low-band holdings.
With the purchase, T-Mobile owns 41.1 megahertz of spectrum below the 1-gigahertz frequency, compared with 46.2 megahertz for Verizon and 70.5 megahertz for AT&T, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

Comcast and AT&T were among the other significant bidders. AT&T acquired nearly $1 billion worth of spectrum.
Sprint and Verizon Communications didn't bid at all in the spectrum auction. The absence of Verizon during the spectrum is indicating that Verizon may be looking for buying cable operator Dish Network. US-based Dish Network spent $6.2 billion on wireless airwaves.

T-Mobile will be utilizing the spectrum later this year in parts of the country. Ericsson and Nokia have announced availability of 600 MHz equipment that T-Mobile will use in its network, and the Un-carrier has 600 MHz licenses covering over one million square miles where T-Mobile expects at least 10 MHz to be clear this year.
“T-Mobile's network is already the fastest, most advanced in the country, and this will take it to a whole new level – and we'll do it fast,” said Neville Ray, T-Mobile CTO.
Qualcomm is introducing chipsets supporting 600 MHz, and T-Mobile expects leading smartphone makers to begin delivering 600 MHz compatible phones as soon as this year.
“These auction results are a win for everyone, especially consumers, and generated billions for broadcasters and US taxpayers,” said John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile.
T-Mobile now owns premium low-band spectrum. With this purchase, T-Mobile now has significantly more low-band spectrum per customer than any other major provider and nearly triple the low-band spectrum per customer than Verizon.
The telecom company will be able to expand its LTE network to compete in every corner of the country, strengthen existing LTE coverage and increase capacity to meet customers' growing demand for mobile data. Low-band spectrum substantially improves in-building coverage and also travels greater distances than mid-band and high-band spectrum.
FCC auction details
Dish Network spent $6.2 billion on wireless airwaves. Only T-Mobile US bid more in the spectrum auction, spending $8 billion out of the $19.8 billion in total proceeds.
Prices for this auction were significantly lower than a U.S. airwaves sale that drew $44.9 billion in bids in 2015. The average price per megahertz per U.S. resident was about 90 cents, compared with $2.72 in that sale, said Kevin Roe, of Roe Equity Research.
The airwaves auctioned by the FCC were voluntarily surrendered by TV stations so the frequencies can be repurposed for surging wireless data traffic. Stations are getting $10 billion in payments to go off the air or move to other airwaves.
Comcast, which plans to unveil a new wireless service that uses Wi-Fi hotspots and Verizon's cellular network, bid $1.7 billion on airwaves.
At $19.8 billion in gross revenue for 70MHz of spectrum, the incentive auction is among the highest grossing auctions ever conducted by the FCC.
“Consumers are the real beneficiaries, as broadcasters invest new resources in programming and service, and additional wireless spectrum opens the way to greater competition and innovation in the mobile broadband marketplace,” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said.
FCC said wireless carriers bid $19.8 billion on mobile broadband spectrum. 50 winning bidders won 70 MHz of licensed spectrum nationwide. 14 MHz of spectrum is available for unlicensed use and wireless microphones.

Loughner, a 22-year-old local man, was named by police as the man arrested for the killings of six people and shootings of 10 others, including Gabrielle Giffords. Witnesses said the shooter "came out of nowhere" and sprayed bullets at the member of congress and the crowd.
Arizona court records show Loughner has twice been charged with previous offences. The first, in October 2007, related to the possession of drug paraphernalia. It was unclear what the second, a year later, related to. Both charges were dismissed after Loughner completed a "diversion programme".
On Saturday night, Caitie Parker, a singer-songwriter from Arizona, said they had known Loughner when they were both teenagers and that they dropped out of school in 2006 after developing alcohol poisoning.
"I went to high school and college, and was in a band with him," they said on Twitter. "I can't even fathom this right now."
Describing them as a "political radical" and a "loner" who was "very philosophical", Ms Parker claimed Loughner was "oddly obsessed with the 2012 prophecy", which predicts the world will end next year.
Ms Parker said Loughner had encountered Miss Giffords once before in 2007 and had "asked them a question and they told me they were 'stupid and unintelligent'."
However they added that when they had known him, Loughner seemed to be liberal or Left-wing.
In Loughner's middle-class neighborhood - about a five-minute drive from the scene - sheriff's deputies had much of the street blocked off. The neighborhood sits just off a bustling Tucson street and is lined with desert landscaping and palm trees.
Neighbors said Loughner lived with their parents and kept to himself. They were often seen walking their dog, almost always wearing a hooded sweat shirt and listening to their iPod.
High school classmate Grant Wiens, 22, said Loughner seemed to be "floating through life" and "doing their own thing."
"Sometimes religion was brought up or drugs. They smoked pot, I don't know how regularly. And they aren't too keen on religion, from what I could tell," Wiens said.
Lynda Sorenson said they took a math class with Loughner last summer at Pima Community College's Northwest campus and told the Arizona Daily Star they were "obviously very disturbed." "He disrupted class frequently with nonsensical outbursts," they said.
The Army said they tried to enlist in December 2008 but was rejected for reasons not disclosed.
Websites apparently created by Loughner also came to light after their name was released by police, and law enforcement officials said they were examining the material they threw up.
A page on MySpace, the social network, operated in Loughner's name contained a photograph of a handgun resting on a book titled "American History".
It also contained an apparent farewell message to their friends in which they wrote: "Please don't be mad at me... I cannot rest." The page was removed from the internet within minutes.
Unusually, the biography section of the MySpace page was completed in the past tense. It said: "My favorite interest was reading, and I studied grammar."
An account on YouTube, the video-sharing website operated in Loughner's name contained several home-made videos including one titled '"My final thoughts".
The YouTube account stated that among Loughner's favourite books, most of which were much-loved classic novels, were Mein Kampf and The Communist Manifesto.
One video, which contained a series of text set to music, made reference to revolution and told viewers: "You don't have to accept the federalist laws".
It called for a return to the gold standard, a common demand of Tea Party activists, and claimed that the government was imposing "mind control and brainwash on the people".
Others contained incoherent statements such as: "My favorite activity is conscience dreaming; the greatest inspiration for my political business information. Some of you don't dream -- sadly..."
In a clip endorsed but not uploaded by Loughner, a person wearing a hooded sweatshirt and a black bin liner over their or their legs sets fire to an American flag sitting atop a mound of earth.
It used as its soundtrack the song Bodies, released in 2001 by the Texan heavy metal band Drowning Pool. The song repeats the phrases "let the bodies hit the floor" and "something's got to give".
This quick baked fish really provides a strong punch of flavor. It can be ready, start to finish, in about 30 minutes flat! You can't beat this one for ease of preparation or flavor! I used Swai filets, but other fish filets are just fine. It is shown above with a creamy sauce made of homemade mayo, my Chicken Shawarma Spice Blend and a little coconut milk, but honestly, the sauce isn't necessary, and it is NOT calculated into the nutritional info below. This baked fish has a lovely flavor without the sauce. This fish is Induction friendly and Paleo-Primal friendly as well.
INGREDIENTS:
2 Swai filets, or fish of choice (mine were 8 oz. each)
¼ c. homemade mayonnaise
½ tsp. my Shawarma Spice Blend (or other seasoning of your choice)
8 large pork rinds, crushed fine
2 T. my 8-Seed Spice Blend
2 T. Parmesan cheese, grated
DIRECTIONS: Preheat oven to 450º. Take out and have at the ready a sided non-stick cookie sheet pan. Place mayo in small bowl and stir in the Shawarma spice. Crush pork rinds and place them in a paper plate. Stir the 8-Seed Spice and Parmesan cheese into the pork rinds. Pat any moisture off both sides of the Swai filets with paper toweling. Using a basting brush, baste one side of the filets with the mayo being sure to cover them entirely. Dip the mayo side into the coating and place that side down on the sheet pan. Now baste the bare side facing up with mayo, again coating them very well. Sprinkle the remaining seed/rind mixture evenly over the top. Lightly sprinkle with more 8-Seed Spice if you don't have good coverage. Pop into preheated oven and bake for about 20 minutes or until thickest part of the filet flakes white when tested with fork or knife. Lift filets carefully with long spatula onto plates and enjoy with your favorite side dishes. I served mine with a sauce made of more of the Shawarma mayo and a bit of heavy cream warmed together, squash casserole and green beans.

The Carlisle Experiment – limiting alcohol in wartime
One of the early casualties of the First World War was, in many respects, the community pub or, more accurately the liberal consumption of alcohol on licensed premises. Before the outbreak of war, and partly because of the rising support of the temperance movement, urging the moderate consumption of alcohol, licensing laws began to restrict the opening hours of premises. But, immediately after the outbreak of war in August 1914, Parliament passed the Defence of the Realm Act which covered a range of measures to support the Allied effort of the war. A section of the Act looked specifically at the hours in which publicans could sell alcohol, as it was strongly believed that high levels of alcohol consumption would have a negative impact on the war effort. It therefore restricted opening hours for licensed premises to lunch (12:00 to 14:00) and later to supper (18:30 to 21:30).
But, even with these changes in force, the British Government became increasingly concerned about how the high levels of alcohol consumption still threatened the productivity of the war effort and high work ethics. If anything, consumption was increasing because in many cases wages were rising, particularly for those in industries vital to war, such as shipbuilding, as overtime became the norm. A campaign to persuade people to consume less alcohol led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, had little effect, so in October 1915 the British government announced a further series of measures they believed would reduce alcohol consumption further. A ‘No Treating Order' laid down that any drink ordered was to be paid for by the person supplied, so to dissuade rounds of drinks or drinks on credit. The maximum penalty for defying the Government order was six months' imprisonment.
However, the government also became increasingly concerned about the increase in alcohol consumption in specific areas of the country vital to the war effort. An enormous cordite munitions factory built to supply ammunition to British forces had been established in the town of Gretna, just over the Scottish border, 12 miles north of the English city of Carlisle, employing over 15,000 workers. Although most of the workers were well-behaved, the cases of drunkenness, anti-social behaviour, and resulting convictions quadrupled. There was also a heightened risk of hampering the war effort through increased sick absences and the threat of serious accidents as workers had to manually handle nitro-glycerine and guncotton into cordite paste, and load the matter into shell cases.
In June 1916, in a decision involving both central Government and the local authorities, the newly formed Central Control Board took control of five local breweries and 363 licensed premises covering 300 square miles including parts of north and west Cumberland, south west Scotland, and the city of Carlisle, ‘for the duration of the war and 12 months thereafter'. The Scheme became known as the Carlisle Experiment and its records are housed in two series of records at The National Archives: HO 185 and HO 190. Both series record how the Board achieved this and how they further controlled the drinking habits of individuals, without resorting to restricting personal liberty. The Board acted quickly, closing nearly 40% of public houses by 1917 and revoking all off-sales licenses. All advertising referring to alcohol was illegal and a ban was placed on the display of liquor bottles in windows. Within the state-owned public houses (many of which remained state-owned until 1971), strict opening hours were enforced, the managers became government employees on a fixed salary and offered no inducement to increase alcohol sales (in fact, commissions were given to the sales of non-alcoholic drinks and food only). The sale of food was actively encouraged and ‘snug' bars were re-purposed as eating areas. Pubs were made to be attractive to women and families and table service was introduced. Drinks prices were fixed by the state, to avoid competition between the different pubs. The sale of ‘chasers' – spirits accompanying beer – was banned. The only beer to be served was that brewed by the local, government-owned brewery. This was brewed at a reduced level of alcohol or was, effectively, watered down. Furthermore, it was also prohibited to serve alcohol to people under the age of 18, as was the selling of spirits on Saturdays.
By the end of the war, the government's national measures were proving successful. In addition to measures introduced under the Defence of the Realm Act, the government also significantly increased the level of tax on alcohol. In 1918 a bottle of whisky cost £1, five times what it had cost before the outbreak of war. This helped to more than halve the consumption of whisky during this period. Similarly, on a national level, convictions for drunkenness also fell dramatically during the war. In London in 1914, 67,103 people were found guilty of being drunk. In 1917 this had fallen to 16,567.
But what about at the local level, in particularly in Cumberland where more severe measures were introduced? Were these more or less successful? Both series include papers relating to individual pubs and are essentially case studies. One such pub was the George Inn, in Warwick Bridge, four miles east of Carlisle. The case study of this, if typical of others, would suggest that there was mixed success. Whatever the outcome, these records form a fascinating picture of what life was like in rural England during and after the First World War.
Originally called the Co-operative Inn, the pub at Warwick Bridge was renamed the George Inn in 1918 to endeavour to improve its bad reputation for drunkenness. The pub was acquired by the CCB (Liquor Traffic) under powers conferred upon the Board by the Defence of the Realm Act (No 3), 1915. The Licensee (a Mrs Daly) was informed of this on 16 March 1917; initially, the Board was content to allow the resident licensee to continue the business providing they were willing to abide by the new terms and demonstrate that they could run the business effectively. This information proved hard to get as the document HO 190/1079 shows.
Eventually, contact was made on 18 October, 1917. This resulted in an inspector's visit, the removal of all stock, the temporary closure of the pub, the appointment of a new manager, a Mrs Mary Ann Heslop, and a new name: The George Inn!
The George Inn opened in the spring of 1918 in the hope that the new licensee would bring some order to proceedings with the support of the Board and the local constabulary. According to one ‘onlooker' who writes to the Board on 29 November 1919, this was far from the case (HO 190/231), though this was not fully corroborated by an inspector's visit on 5 December 1919.
The record goes on to show that following a number of approved alterations to the premises, Mrs Heslop remained licensee until their resignation in October 1928, when they were replaced by a Mr Edward James Little.
Not all of the alterations were viewed as improvements as a notice board petition shows in 1933, and which was favourably received by the Board.
Following Mr Little's unexpected death in 1934, their widow, Jane, became licensee. The file ends in 1937 but the Board continued to manage the pub alongside many other Cumberland pubs until the late 1960s. There was national debate in the 1920s to consider whether the British government should extend nationalisation to all pubs in England and Wales, debated at a time when the sale of alcohol in the US was prohibited. The records HO 185/17 and HO 185/22 examine this in great detail. What became known as the Carlisle Experiment had supporters as well as critics. The Temperance Movement argued that the pubs should be returned to private hands claiming the scheme had proved to be a disaster, actively encouraging women and children into premises serving alcohol.
But many felt the scheme had breathed new life into pubs, with much needed modernising and investment. Indeed, they were operating at a profit which went back to the taxpayer. In the end, the government decided against full nationalisation but to continue the operation of the Board in the Carlisle area, whilst nationally retaining many of the restrictions imposed by the Defence of the Realm Act. For example, the restrictions of opening hours remained largely in force until the 1970s, with further relaxation in the late 1980s and later in the 2000s.
Originally from Brampton, four miles east of Warwick Bridge, I began to use the George in the early 1980s. Not renowned for its real ale, it definitely had a strong community feel about it and had its own darts team, domino team and, popular in Cumbria, annual leek show entrants. It struggled with the smoking ban and downturn in the economy and had its fair share of anti-social behaviour in the new millennium, before it finally closed its doors in 2007; in its place now stands residential flats, across the road from the Co-operative food store, a link to the pub's original name 100 years before.
The Forest neighborhood, also known by its Dutch name, Vorst, is southwest of the city center. The police evacuated homes in the area, as well as two schools near the building where the raid occurred. Employees from the car manufacturer Audi, which has a building a few blocks away from the house in Forest, were told to stay inside.
Marc-Jean Ghyssels, the mayor of Forest, one of 19 municipalities that make up Brussels, told reporters that a police operation was proceeding around a building on the Rue du Dries, one of the streets cordoned off by the police.
One man believed to have participated in the Paris attacks, Salah Abdeslam, has been the target of an international manhunt. Mr. Abdeslam, a 26-year-old French citizen who was born in Brussels to parents who had emigrated from Morocco, fled to Belgium after the attacks.
On Dec. 10, the police raided an apartment in the Schaerbeek section of Brussels, where they found Mr. Abdeslam's fingerprint, as well as material that might have been used to assemble suicide belts and traces of an explosive used in the Paris attacks.
The other nine men believed to have taken part in the attacks all died. Eight of them ether blew themselves up or were shot on the night of the attacks, while an organizer of the plot, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, died in a police raid north of Paris on Nov. 18.
The authorities in Belgium and France have carried out hundreds of raids, and held dozens of suspects for questioning, in the aftermath of the attacks.
There was no indication that the raid on Tuesday was directly related to the search for Mr. Abdeslam, the fugitive.

Hellfire Signature?
Footage of the nighttime attack on the Syrian aid convoy in Aleppo has surfaced. But there's something curious about how the footage has been appearing on Western news reports. A commenter on the Moon of Alabama blog, PavewayIV, made the following observations about what appears in the video, and what it suggests. First, however, here's an unedited version of the blast, courtesy of ABC:
In the screen cap above, you can see what looks to be a cloud of sparks following an initial explosion. According to PavewayIV, this is a signature of the Metal-Augmented Charge (MAC) Hellfire AGM-114N, the Predator drone's typical payload .
The fiery cloud is produced by the residue of the fine-mesh fluorinated aluminum particles (the "metal augmentation"). Aside from the ABC footage, most other networks have shown edited versions that make this signature difficult to detect .
For example, here's AP's version :
'
Shakey-cam added for jihadi-vision effect? Why would they do this?
Thermobaric Hellfire air-blasts don't leave craters, and they typically start fires. No craters are visible in footage of the burned convoy.
The Russians have thermobaric bombs, too, according to PavewayIV, but they use different particles and their blast patterns are different: either no "sparkles" or long-duration "sparkles", not the fast-duration flash as seen in the video of the Aleppo blast.
As we reported yesterday, the Russians detected a Predator drone which took off from Incirlik airbase in Syria, flew to the precise location of the convoy, arrived before the strike, stayed for a while, then left after the damage was done.
- Mayor Libby Schaaf gave a scathing condemnation of the Oakland Police Department at a news conference Friday where they announced the acting Police Chief Paul Figueroa, who was appointed to the position two days earlier, had resigned from their duties and was on leave.
The mayor also announced that the city was investigating yet another scandal involving racist text messages among police officers.
"As the Mayor of Oakland, I am here to run a police department not a frat house," Schaaf said.
Schaaf said they wanted to send a clear message that they were committed "to root out what is clearly a toxic, macho culture. "
A visibly angry Mayor Schaaf said they learned about the racist text messages last weekend and couldn't disclose how many officers allegedly sent or received the messages, due to the ongoing investigation and their desire to ensure anyone involved receives the maximum punishment. They said one person has been placed on leave and they expect the investigation to be concluded within weeks.
"We are close to the end of an investigation of racist text messages. We do think its relevant to share that the text messages were sent by African American officers, but they are wholly inappropriate and not acceptable from anyone who wears the badge of the Oakland Police Department," Schaaf said.
Mayor Schaaf said they would not be appointing another interim chief, but instead is putting the Oakland Police Department under civilian oversight, with the command staff reporting to City Administrator Sabrina Landreth.
"Acting Chief Figueroa resigned from their duties as acting chief and assistant chief of police. They have gone on leave and as asked to return as is their right in the position of Captain," Schaaf said.
"I want to assure the citizens of Oakland that we are hellbent on rooting out this disgusting culture," Schaaf said.
"I have been overseeing the day to day of our public safety departments, so the police chief and the fire chief report on a day-to-day basis directly to me, so that structure does not change," said Sabrina Landreth, the Oakland City Administrator.
Oakland City Council members say they were informed by the mayor about the changes before the 6:45 p.m. news conference.
"I'm stunned and it's disconcerting how little information we're provided as council members," said Lynette Gibson McElhaney, the Oakland City Council President.
Both the mayor and council members emphasized their support for the many officers in uniform who are serving honorably.
"My thoughts and prayers are with the men and women who need to serve honorably in high stress conditions, that they also know we're here to support them and support making this a strong department they can serve in," McElhaney said.
The mayor said Figueroa did not appear to be involved in the racist text investigation and said it had nothing to do with the ongoing sex scandal that has plagued multiple Bay Area law enforcement agencies.
KTVU's Henry Lee confirmed the sudden departure of Figueroa late Friday afternoon with their sources. The mayor said the texting allegations are not as widespread as the sex exploitation allegations, but could not put a specific number on it.
Earlier Friday afternoon, protestors were in front of the Oakland Police Department headquarters.
They put up fliers stating that ex-chiefs enabled sex offenders. The protest was in response to the Oakland Police Department sexual misconduct scandal.
The protest is part of a larger action called "Stop. Stay. Expand." According to a news release, protesters showed up at the Oakland Police Department and hung a banner stating "OPD guilty of statutory rape and human trafficking." They also put up red "danger" tape outside the department.
This comes after an order on Thursday by Federal Judge Thelton Henderson for Oakland Police Department to work with their federal monitor to review and reform the department's hiring and recruiting and early warning system.
On Wednesday, Ben Fairow -- appointed interim Oakland police chief just last week -- was relieved of their duties by the mayor.
Mayor Libby Schaaf replaced Fairow with acting Chief Paul Figueroa, who had previously been an assistant chief with the department.
They would not comment on why the decision to remove Fairow was made saying, "[I'm] prohibited by state law from discussing personnel matters." They added they wanted to make sure they are confident in the leadership. "We are dealing with disgusting allegations that upset me greatly," said Schaaf.
They added that they want an external candidate to lead the department.
News of Fairow's departure occurred less than a week after the mayor announced the departure of Sean Whent, whom the mayor said resigned, but sources told KTVU that they were terminated from the post.
"With the abrupt resignation of Sean Whent last week, we sought to have seamless leadership of the Oakland Police Department and selected an individual who understood the dynamics in Oakland and who, based on their previous employment with OPD, could hit the ground running. However, I have just received information that has caused me to lose confidence in Ben Fairow's ability to lead the Oakland Police Department at this particular moment in time," Schaaf's statement said.
Celeste Guap (an alias used by the woman at the center of the scandal), claims they had sex with two dozen current and former officers in five cities, according to initial newspaper reports.
The reports say the woman, a Richmond resident and the daughter of an Oakland Police dispatcher, says they slept with three of the officers before they turned 18 last August.
It was unclear if Fairow's removal as interim chief was linked to the sex scandal, but on Wednesday, BART Police Chief Kenton Rainey released their own statement saying Fairow would be welcomed back to their role commanding BART's Support Services Division.
"Ben has shared information with me that, while they were married, they had a personal relationship with a consenting adult more than a decade ago, none of which precludes them from serving as a sworn law enforcement officer or as one of my Deputy Chiefs. Again - we welcome them back," Rainey's statement read.
Rainey added that upon Fairow's hiring to BART in 2011 that a thorough background check on them was done at that time and that they would be reestablished in full confidence and able to fulfill their role.
The mayor also said Friday that the decisions were initiated by city officials and approved by the federal judge and monitors who have been in charge of overseeing the department for the past 13 years due to a previous corruption case.
(CNN) Spain's high court has ordered eight former ministers from Catalonia's dissolved government to be detained without bail, while the state prosecutor sought a Europe-wide arrest warrant for ousted leader Carles Puigdemont.
Puigdemont left Spain and appeared in Brussels on Monday, the same day Spain's state prosecutor announced they were seeking charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds against them and 13 ex-ministers.
The high court, known as the the Audiencia Nacional, summoned Puigdemont and the former ministers over their contentious independence drive, but only nine of them turned up at the session Thursday, and without Puigdemont.
The judge ordered eight be remanded in custody, while the ninth was granted bail of 50,000 euros ($58,000).
Jaume Alonso Cuevillas, the lawyer for most of the former ministers, said the decision was "politically motivated" and "disproportionate," arguing that judge could have simply seized their passports to stop them from leaving the country.
Puigdemont and the other four ministers are believed to still be in the Belgian capital. The state prosecutor in Madrid asked the court to issue national and European arrest warrants for all five.
Puigdemont's no-show was the latest act of defiance from the renegade leader, who has caused consternation in Madrid following an independence referendum on October 1, which Spain's Constitutional Court ruled illegal. The crisis came to a head last week when the Catalan Parliament declared unilateral independence.
In response, Madrid sacked Puigdemont and their government, and stripped Catalonia of its cherished autonomy.
Puigdemont: Charges 'punish ideas'
A separate case against six other Catalan lawmakers related to the independence bid was adjourned at the Supreme Court. All six, including Parliament speaker Carme Forcadell, showed up to the session.
Puigdmeont, who still considers themselves Catalonia's rightful leader, denied they were evading justice, claiming that the charges had no legal basis and sought "only to punish ideas," according to their spokesperson.
"We are facing a political trial," the spokesperson said.
According to the spokesperson, the former ministers who turned up to court Thursday did so to make a complaint against the Spanish judicial system's "lack of guarantees" to allow the pursuit of political ideas.
In a video message recorded in Belgium and released Thursday, Puigdemont condemned the detention of members of their cabinet as an attack on democracy. They're calling the move a "very, very bad mistake."
They said that "political imprisonments without precedents are unacceptable in Europe and in the 21st century."
"We have to fight it the way Catalans do, like we fight the things that have made us big as a country, as a nation and as a society," Puigdemont said. "Without violence, with peace and respect for all options."
Puigdemont's Belgian lawyer, Paul Bekaert, told Reuters the former leader would cooperate with Spanish and Belgian authorities.
"The climate is not good, it is better to take some distance," they said.
Puigdemont has denied they traveled to Brussels to seek political asylum. In public remarks on Tuesday, they claimed they were in the Belgian capital to "to act with freedom and safety" and to seek support from Europe in finding a diplomatic solution.
Planning to vote tomorrow? Here's what you need to know.
WHY VOTE?: This is the most competitive election to occur in Minneapolis in over a generation. The outcome will impact the daily life of every city resident, whether it is in the form of property taxes, neighborhood crime or new development. Your vote will have a much larger impact than in presidential and other state/federal elections, since turnout is expected to be substantially lower. Consider that one City Council candidate won with just 1,131 votes in 2009 (though it was a much sleepier election).
BALLOT: First, take a look at your sample ballot. Notice that there are 35 mayoral candidates listed and you can rank three of them in order of preference. You will also be voting for City Council, Park Board, Board of Estimate and Taxation and a charter change.
RANKED CHOICE: Regarding ranked-choice voting, remember that your ballot will be allocated to your first-choice candidate until they are no longer in contention after a series of elimination rounds. Here is a static graphic, interactive graphic and article explaining ranked choice voting.
REGISTERED?: To determine if you are registered to vote, use this tool from the Secretary of State's office. If you have moved, for example, your registration may be out of date. You can register at the polling place on Election Day. Here's what you will need to bring.
POLLING PLACE: Where will you vote? Click here for a tool to determine your polling place. The polls will open at 7 a.m. Tuesday and close at 8 p.m. Alternatively, you can still vote absentee at City Hall until 5 p.m. Monday.
MAYORAL CANDIDATES: While there are 35 registered candidates for mayor, only eight have structured campaigns. We have information on each of those candidates (as well as the broader field) at startribune.com/mpls2013.
COUNCIL: In aggregate, the outcome of City Council races could prove to be just as important as the mayor's race. The City Council, after all, carries much of the power at City Hall. Seven of 13 council wards feature competitive races. To find out who's running in your ward, click here to see our ward map and read coverage.
PARK BOARD: The Park Board is an independent body that sets a separate tax levy and spends funds to operate the city's parks. We've written a story about the candidates running for three citywide at-large Park Board seats. To determine your individual Park Board district, see this map. The candidates for each district are listed here.
BOARD OF ESTIMATE: The Board of Estimate and Taxation sets the maximum tax levy in the city each year. Two of its six members are elected citizens. The incumbents in those roles are David Wheeler and Carol Becker.
CHARTER: Voters will also weigh in on what's been billed as a "plain-language rewrite" of the city's charter. The change has been in the works for 11 years. It would make the document more readable for a modern audience, but some top City Hall officials have also expressed concern about unintended consequences..
Rare dual-coloured funnel-web spider
By Bec Crew |
Contributor Bec Crew Becky Crew is a Sydney-based science communicator with a love for weird and wonderful animals. From strange behaviours and special adaptations to newly discovered species and the researchers who find them, their topics celebrate how alien yet relatable so many of the creatures that live amongst us can be.
This is one of the most unique spiders you'll probably ever see. Found in the Tallaganda State Forest of NSW, this is a member of the elusive Atrax sutherlandi species of Australian funnel-webs, a close cousin of the notorious Sydney funnel-web (Atrax robustus).
If, like me, you're utterly charmed by this little beauty, I've got some good news and some bad news for you. The bad news is that A. sutherlandi doesn't usually look like this. It looks like this, with an incredible glossy black pigment all over, and not a hint of that gorgeous orange and red.
The good news? Thanks to the scientists who found the specimen in the picture above, you get to appreciate the results of a very rare genetic mutation that's allowed these colours to be expressed.
Mark Wong, an invertebrate zoologist from the Australian National University (ANU), says they and their colleagues were on a routine collecting trip, surveying the forest floor for the distinctive shelters strung together by funnel-web species. Having stumbled on an extensive web network, they started poking it with a twig, until something large – about 5cm long – sprung into action.
“Before I knew it, boom! They had rushed out of their silken lair with their legs raised and fangs greeting me with glistening venom,” says Mark. “Instantly taken aback by their colours, I knew there and then, this was something special.”

Red pigment normal for funnel-web spiders
Mark says the red pigment seen on this pretty lady has been found elsewhere in both the A. sutherlandi and Sydney funnel-web species – such as on their undersides or across their fangs and mouth parts – which means they clearly have the genes to produce the red pigment.
“So what we are seeing in this particular specimen may be a case where the genes for red pigment are being expressed in the wrong tissue,” they say.
“Alternatively, it is possible that ‘normal' funnel-web spiders do actually express red pigment in the areas that show up clearly in this ‘special' specimen, but it's just that the red is usually obscured by brown or black melanin in the ‘normal' spiders,” they add. “Perhaps in this specimen, the melanin genes have not been expressed, thus revealing the red pigmentation underneath.”
Mark says despite looking specifically for more A. sutherlandi species with similar colour patterns, they and their colleagues have so far turned up nothing. If they did, it would be an incredible help to them in figuring out how this specimen came to be, and what genetic or perhaps environmental factors were at play in forming it.
For now, this red lady can be comforted in the knowledge that as of the scientific record, they are entirely unique.
A love affair with funnel-web spiders
Mark, who confesses a life-long fondness for “things with many legs”, says they were fascinated by the distinctive beauty of the funnel-web spiders from the moment they were introduced to one by ANU's resident spider expert, Dave Rowell. “I was captivated by how its glossy, dark integument reflected the sunlight, and simply amazed when Dave said it was likely well over 20 years old!”
As someone who's collected hundreds of funnel-webs with their colleagues over the years, Mark has had time to perfect their spider-catching technique. Do not try at home, obviously:
“We first look under rocks and fallen logs for the entrances of their subterranean burrows, which are often skirted by a silken funnel-shaped web. Upon discovering a burrow, we determine its depth and direction using a probe, then gently scrape away the earth accordingly till the creature is revealed… The spider is then carefully transferred to a container with the aid of gloves and long forceps. As the spiders are usually hiding deep underground (>25cm), there's really no easy way to collect them and it usually takes between 10 and 30 minutes just to retrieve one specimen.”
See below for what that looked like when they met the dual-coloured Atrax sutherlandi:

WASHINGTON (AP) — Former acting attorney general Sally Yates is expected to testify to Congress next week that they expressed alarm to the White House about President Donald Trump's national security adviser's contacts with the Russian ambassador, which could contradict how the administration has characterized their counsel.
Yates on Monday is expected to recount their Jan. 26 conversation about Michael Flynn and to say that they were concerned by discrepancies between the administration's public statements on their contacts with ambassador Sergey Kislyak and what really transpired, according to a person familiar with that discussion and knowledgeable about Yates's plans for their testimony.
The person spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to pre-empt the testimony.
Yates is expected to say that they told White House counsel Don McGahn that they believed Flynn's communications with Kislyak could leave Flynn in a compromised position because of the contradictions between the public depictions of the calls and what intelligence officials knew to be true, the person said.
White House officials have said publicly that Yates merely wanted to give them a “heads-up” about Flynn's Russian contacts, but Yates is likely to testify that they approached the White House with alarm, according to the person.
“So just to be clear, the acting attorney general informed the White House counsel that they wanted to give a ‘heads up' to us on some comments that may have seemed in conflict with what they had sent the Vice President out in particular,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters at a Feb. 14 press briefing.
Flynn resigned in February after published reports detailed Yates's conversation with the White House. White House officials initially maintained that Flynn had not discussed Russian sanctions with Kislyak during the transition period, but after news reports said the opposite, they then admitted that they had misled them about the nature of that call.
“The issue, pure and simple, came down to a matter of trust,” Spicer told reporters.
Flynn was in frequent contact with Kislyak on the day the Obama administration slapped sanctions on Russia for election-related hacking, as well as at other times during the transition period, a U.S. official has said.
Yates's scheduled appearance before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee, alongside former national intelligence director James Clapper, will provide their first public account of the conversation with the White House. It will also represent their first testimony before Congress since Yates, an Obama administration holdover, was fired in January for refusing to defend Trump's travel ban.
They were previously scheduled to appear in March before a House committee investigating Russian interference in the presidential election, but that hearing was canceled.

While Charlie Brown and their creator, Charles Schulz, share a first name, the character was actually named after one of Schulz's art school friends, not after himself. Despite this, the big-headed character shares a lot more with their creator than a name. In honor of what would have been Charles Schulz's birthday, let's celebrate the man and their creation by considering how similar Schulz was to good old Chuck.
1. They Both Had Terrible Valentine's Days
We all know that Charlie Brown never receives Valentines even though they give them out to everyone else, but they aren't the only one that Cupid seemed to laugh at. Schulz was skipped ahead two grades as a child and was always shy and awkward around the other students in their classes. For their first grade Valentine's Day, their mother helped them make up Valentines for everyone in class so no one would be left out. Unlike Charlie, who was ignored by everyone else, Schulz excluded himself. They were too shy to put the box of Valentines at the front of the class, so they held on to them throughout the day—and later brought them back to their mother.
2. They Mutually Loved The Little Red-Haired Girl
If you're mostly familiar with the animated Peanuts classics instead of the comic strips, then you probably don't realize just how unobtainable the Little Red-Haired Girl actually is—she's never actually shown in the entire comic strip series. Charlie Brown talks about them and on rare occasion they gather the muster to talk to them out of the frame, but they are never once shown in the strip.
The Little Red-Haired Girl and Charlie Brown's obsession with them was based on a real-life obsession Charles Schulz had for a young redhead named Donna Mae Johnson. The couple met while working together at Art Instruction, an art correspondence school. Before long they had been together for three years, but when Charles asked them to marry him, they refused, only to marry another man in October of the same year. While the two remained friends, it seems Schulz never completely recovered from their broken heart. They once said of the ordeal, "I can think of no more emotionally damaging loss than to be turned down by someone whom you love very much. A person who not only turns you down, but almost immediately will marry the victor. What a bitter blow that is."
3. They Both Loved Their Dogs
It isn't too surprising to hear that Schulz had a black and white dog during their childhood that later served as the inspiration for Snoopy. Interestingly, the dog wasn't actually a beagle though, it was a pointer named Spike. Charles' first published drawing was of little Spike and it was featured in the newspaper comics feature Believe it or Not.
4. They Both Were Tormented By Bossy Women
Like The Little Red-Haired Girl, Lucy Van Pelt was also based on a real person, only in this case, it was actually two people. The bossy, impatient and rude character was based on Schulz's mother and their first wife, Joyce.
One can imagine how bad Schulz's relationship with Joyce was, based on the fact that only a year after their wedding Schulz introduced Lucy to the world. Even after the couple's divorce, Schulz still featured Lucy prominently in the series, where they always seem to have the upper hand over poor old Charlie.
Schulz's mother was also a big inspiration for Charles, as their cold and distant manner made them constantly feel like they aren't getting enough love. This is reflected in the way other characters treat Charlie Brown. While they seem largely positive despite their maltreatment, this is one way they greatly differed from Schulz, who grudgingly held on to every indignity and insult they ever received and used them later on to fuel their strip.
5. They Were Both Above Racism
While Schulz generally stayed out of politics and Charlie and the rest of the gang never really mention current events, both they and their cartoons were progressive when it came to race. When Schulz added Franklin to the cast of the strip, race relations of the late sixties were at a boiling point. While they claimed the character had no political motivations, they obviously are against segregation and politely ignored hate mail sent in by both editors and readers complaining about the decision to have Franklin attend school with the rest of the children.
Similarly, when Hank Aaron was challenging Babe Ruth's home run record in 1974, Schulz read about the hate mail received by the athlete and decided to support Aaron by drawing a series of cartoons detailing Snoopy's difficulty as they approached the home run record.
6. They Died Within Two Hours of One Another
Perhaps one of the saddest things Charlie Brown has in common with their creator is their deaths. Schulz knew they were becoming sick in the late nineties and announced their retirement in December of 1999 and requested that the publishers discontinue the series after their death. They continued to produce enough Sunday strips to last through mid-February, and on Saturday, February 12, 2000, they passed away. Only two hours later, the final Peanuts strip was printed.
A party where you pay to have verse read to you in a bordello-style setting is packing in the punters. Are poetry and sex work really comparable?
I am in the back room of the Backroom cocktail bar in New York, reclining on a fur-covered day bed. Next to me is a woman. They wear a leather corset and harem pants, like a gypsy girl from a fairytale.  They are barefoot. In the dim candlelight, they ask what I'm in the mood for – something sexy? Something dark? I tell them what will please me, and they read me a poem.
They call themselves a poetry whore, and I have paid for their company. For the next 10 minutes or so, they will read me their verses, converse with me, entertain me. Between sheer curtains I can see several other transactions unfolding around us, hear stanzas and lines being murmured in close quarters. Now and then, the madam passes unobtrusively through, keeping an eye on their rent boys and girls.
The madam is Stephanie Berger, who co-founded the Poetry Brothel with Nicholas Adamski in 2008. The two met while enrolled in the New School's creative writing programme, bonding over a shared dissatisfaction with New York's dry, highbrow poetry scene. They concocted the idea of a turn-of-the-century bordello – historically the realm of artists and miscreants – where writers could present their work in a more vibrant, visceral setting. They would dress up, invent alter egos, and sell not their bodies but their poems.
Prostitution and poetry, they claim, are not the uneasy bedfellows they might seem. “Sex work and poetry are two of the oldest professions,” says Berger. “Both are incredibly intimate acts that explore love, fantasy and the underside of people.”
Adamski agrees. “It's all about intimacy. You can have pretty good sex or you can enjoy a poem without it. But if it connects to you intimately, it's so much better.” And that's what they sell at the Poetry Brothel, they say: an intimate experience of art with the artist who created it.
Each iteration of the brothel has a different theme, such as a masquerade ball or French New Wave, but the same basic structure. Well-dressed guests mingle over cocktails and live jazz. The madam introduces around half a dozen men and women selected for their writing prowess, personal charm and attractiveness (not to be confused with physical beauty, the organisers emphasise). They have names like Tennessee Pink and Cosette Chapiteau, and elaborate backstories involving circus runaways and paupers of royal lineage. Each one reads briefly, enticing potential clients with a taste of their talents.
The poets mingle with guests for the duration of the party, which is punctuated by burlesque performances and more public readings. At any time, a customer can request a private visitation with a poet of their choosing, either directly or through the staff. The poet escorts the customer to a quiet backroom boudoir for a one-on-one (and occasionally one-on-two) session. They'll read two or three poems, answer questions, banter. In exchange, the customer offers a pre-purchased poker chip or two, to be cashed out at the end of the night.

The repositioning of poet as sex worker might raise some hackles, but has proven effective in attracting non-poetry audiences to readings. The house was packed at the most recent New York event on Sunday, and satellites have sprung up in Barcelona, Paris, London, Caracas and Auckland. Featured readers like Paul Muldoon (the New Yorker poetry editor and Pulitzer prize winner) and Deborah Landau (director of creative writing at NYU) have moonlighted as poetry whores, lending the enterprise legitimacy and gravitas.
For the likes of Muldoon and Landau, the poetry brothel is something fun and different for a few hours. But for the lesser-known poets, there is real creative and financial benefit to a receptive listener who can provide feedback and monetary compensation. Private readings cost $10 ($20 for a featured reader) and tipping is common; a poet can make a few hundred dollars on a lucrative night. It's not enough to give up the day job, but the act of earning is itself significant. The difference between a hobbyist and a professional is, after all, a fiscal one.
As a customer, the commercial aspect is something I struggled with at first. Over the course of one evening I paid for five private readings. The first poet was earnest and vulnerable, and between poems told me about their former fiancee, their beloved grandmother, and their guitar (all named Edith). They revealed so much of themselves to me that I was reluctant to cheapen our interaction with money. I soon learned to pay upfront, before the deeply personal exchange. I wondered if 19th-century patrons of the arts ever had this problem.
And yet, as the evening progressed, I began to enjoy my role as the john – appraising a poet from across the room, propositioning them at the bar, being led with a smile to a dark corner in the back room. There's something appealing on both sides of that dynamic; it's empowering to attain but also to be desired. “Is it like being hit on?” I asked my fourth reader, a wispy beauty in a white corset and floor-length skirt, pulled up on one side to reveal a dagger strapped to their thigh. They thought for a moment before they responded: “It's better.”
Happy Monday, Launchies! This past weekend I got motivated to do some Ender's Game cupcakes. The army logos are great for doing fan artsy stuff and since I do a lot of these kinds of cupcake things for my other blog Fictional Food, it was really only a matter of time until I tried to tackle these.
And for those of you wondering where Leopard and Centipede is, just go look at those logos and tell me if you think it's humanly possible to cut those things out of fondant. 😉
To make the logos, I rolled black fondant really thin and then let it dry for a bit to make it easier to cut. I'd printed out the logos on paper and cut them out first. For Phoenix and Griffin, I used a photo from the Ender's Game Experience I found online, since my good photos of the logos got eaten on my corrupted SD card.
After that, I laid them over the frosting and started cutting with an X-Acto knife. Sadly, the paper got stuck to Phoenix and Salamander, which is why those don't look too good.
Here are the logos all cut out and drying. The white stuff is powdered sugar to keep it from sticking to the bottom.
Since I only had Halloween cupcake cups, they would have looked kind of dopey from the sides, so I made cupcake wrappers. I first did these kinds of wrappers for my Effie Trinket cupcakes and they worked really well for these too!
If you want to try wrapping your own cupcakes, I have the wrappers in PDF form for you to download. They may need a little trimming and you'll also need to leave a little tab on one end to glue/tape together.
Here's the side of the Dragon cupcake. I put book and movie quotes on the opposite sides of each of them.
I don't think Graff likes me insinuating he's a “rat” by putting them on the Rat Army cupcake…
Here's the Salamander cupcake. It's still got little bits of sugar on it and their poor tail fell off. It was too hard to separate the belly sections, so I just cut into the frosting and it turned out fine. To make this color I used green fondant mixed with gobs of yellow and orange color gel.
Griffin Army cupcake! The ear was hard to cut, but I like how it came out overall. I should have made it bigger though. This was just straight green, nice and easy.
As I mentioned earlier, the Phoenix got a little dinged up. I didn't pat enough sugar onto it and the paper got stuck to the frosting. The color was made by mixing blue and green fondant.
Rat Army cupcake. I thought the whiskers and toes would be impossible, but they weren't too bad. I just used basic red fondant for this. If you're wondering why I have so many colors, it's from making cakes like this Mario one for my son and this Hello Kitty one for my daughter. I just have a fully stocked fondant pantry!
Here's Asp, which was pretty hard to cut. This is one of my favorite logos. Totally reminds me of the auryn from Neverending Story.
And finally, here's the Dragon. Still my favorite design! Tonight I'll take some more photos and then let my kids fight over which cupcake they get. This morning my son was giving me a hard time because I always freak out with them touching my stuff before I get to do photos and video. They were barely touching one with their pinky and taunting me, saying, “Ooohh look Mommy, look look! I'm touching the cupcake, oh no!!!”
The kid needs some sitting on. This is on the agenda for tonight. I took video so you guys can see the wrappers better and will post that later this week.
Here's one last photo with the poster:
I could go into a number of dorky lines for these.
“The enemy's cake is down.”
“We need cakes like yours, Ender.”
“You will be the one to frost humankind.”
I'm sure Graff would have gotten appropriately fat if I'd been supplying these to them at Battle School.
IF the NRL's biggest pest Michael Ennis was caught doing this to an injured opponent, there would be outrage.
But when it comes to Cameron Smith, many fans view them as a protected species.
The Melbourne skipper has come under fire in the build up to Sunday's NRL grand final after an incident involving Canberra's injured captain Jarrod Croker last Saturday night.
Smith was filmed appearing to shove an unsuspecting Croker to the ground following Cooper Cronk's try in the 32nd minute.
media_camera Cameron Smith catches Jarrod Croker's knee from behind in the preliminary final at AAMI Park on Saturday night.
The incident wasn't picked up by the match commentators initially, but was snapped by eagle-eyed fans who later posted it on social media.
Smith is spotted running over to shove Croker in the back, and fans were upset that they appeared to make contact with Croker's badly injured left leg.
Croker had been carrying an injury to their knee and ankle from the 10th minute after they were accidentally cleaned up in some friendly fire by a teammate.

Players immediately came charging in from both teams after Cronk's try, but it is not known if it was Smith's sneaky push that sparked the melee.
Fans were furious with Smith.
“Wow, that's so bad!!” one wrote.
“I don't like Smith. At all,” said another.
Many comments were far less complimentary and cannot be printed here.
The view from many was that this incident involving Croker was just another example of Smith pushing the boundaries.
While Ennis is not the type who ever attempts to mask their actions, Smith is known to be far more subtle among their rivals. Even after this incident they stood back when the melee started, seemingly surprised at the commotion.

Only a few weeks ago Smith accused Brisbane of not playing in the spirit of the game after Anthony Milford milked a penalty for throwing the ball at a player laying in the ruck.
A recent Daily Telegraph fan poll voted Smith the player supporters most love to hate.
Smith polled 22 per cent of the votes, finishing ahead of Josh Reynolds (21 per cent), Paul Gallen (15 per cent) and Ennis (14 per cent).
Smith knows they won't have the crowd on their side on Sunday.
“From the little we have seen from down here (the Sharks) have a huge amount of support down there,'' Smith said on Monday. “I saw parts of their game the other night and all I could see was Sharks fans in the ground.
“There has been a lot of excitement building down there throughout the year. So there should be. There is going to be plenty of Sharks fans on Sunday.''
Anyone else sees what Cameron smith did to Jarrod croker after Cronk scored? #grub — Michael Schirripa (@michaelsch1996) September 26, 2016
Hey @NRL are reviewing @camsmith9 deliberate knee to @Jarrodcroker left knee after Cronks try? Disgraceful dog act. — DK23 (@daniel23karlson) September 26, 2016
Smith has already said the Storm would be ready for Ennis to be at their “scheming best” when the two cross paths on Sunday night.
Smith and Ennis have had their share of run-ins over the years, with Ennis causing controversy in the 2014 elimination final between the Storm and the Bulldogs.
Ennis was accused of disrespecting Smith when they patted the Storm skipper on the head after Smith made an uncharacteristic blunder. But no doubt the Sharks will be just as wary of Smith.
Not only is they known for their ability to influence refs, but they are regarded without peer when it comes to the art of the rugby league wrestle.
The incident involving Croker certainly won't win them or the Storm any extra support come Sunday night.
A federal judge has dismissed former Baylor football coach Art Briles and athletic director Ian McCaw from a lawsuit brought by woman who said they and the school ignored their claims that they were raped by a former player who was later convicted.
The judge dismissed the two from the lawsuit on Wednesday. The lawsuit against Baylor still stands and the woman's attorney said they will file new lawsuits against Briles and McCaw as individuals in state court.
Jasmin Hernandez sued Briles and McCaw in their official capacity in March. Briles' attorneys argued the men could not be sued as individuals under the federal gender discrimination law.
The Associated Press generally doesn't identify sexual assault victims, but Hernandez has spoken publicly to draw attention to the case.
Lawyers for Briles and Baylor did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Notes
The B-side of this release is double grooved. This means there are two grooves that are physically located on the same side; they travel parallel with each other. So when playing the side B, one hears different tracks depending on the groove into which the needle drops.
To further confuse the listener, both sides of the LP are labelled "FREE RECORD Given away with the Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief - Side 2" - only the matrix numbers identify which are the first and second sides.
There are no track titles printed on the release. The sleeve is a die-cut and printed to look like a three-dimensional box. The center window of the sleeve reveals a 'tie & handkerchief', but when one pulls the inner sleeve out, the unfortunate current owner of the tie & handkerchief is revealed.
There were 2 full size inserts, as well as the 'tie & handkerchief' illustration there was a green sheet with 3 columns, the first details possible uses of the 'tie & handkerchief' set, the second gives Credits, and the third is "The Backgound to History" (track B1).

“We've had some really talented teams during my time here, but in a way, we were a lot more offensive, and we weren't so pitching and defense oriented,” Lee said. “In today's game if you go out there and throw strikes and don't give people extra outs, chances are good you'll be successful. You'll at least be in a lot of games.
“Our offense has been solid so far this season,” they continued. “But everything has started with the pitching staff and its ability to go out there and throw strikes. On top of that, this is the most stable defensive club I've had since I arrived.”
The Cougars have a rather intriguing pitching staff this spring. Charleston finished the 2013 campaign with a 4.20 earned-run average, and had a pair of talented starting pitchers in Jake Zokan and Matt Pegler. Both Zokan and Pegler are gone, but the Cougars found a way to be much better even without the duo. This year's club has a 3.04 ERA with a young, but talented, weekend rotation leading the way.
Imposing first-year student righthanded pitcher Bailey Ober is the most intriguing arm of the bunch. Ober is a tall 6-foot-8, 218-pounder, who has shown pinpoint command in four appearances and three starts. Ober has a 1.00 ERA in 27 innings, and also has 26 strikeouts as opposed to zero walks. Stuff-wise, Ober will sit 87-89 with their fastball, touching 90, but their stuff plays up because of their size. Ober also has a good changeup, along with a breaking ball that's sharper than it was in high school. Ober threw their curveball in the upper-60s in high school, but that pitch is now thrown at 72-75 mph.
“Ober has been our guy. They really command the strike zone well and doesn't miss their spots,” Lee said. “He spots their fastball well and their changeup is very good. The breaking ball, over time, has become a much better pitch, too.”
Ober is joined in the weekend rotation by two more younger players -- sophomore righthanded pitchers Tayor Clarke and Nathan Helvey. Clarke joined the program after Towson University threatened to cut baseball, a move that ultimately was reversed. Meanwhile, Helvey is a second-year player who earned their wings last season by starting 10 games and tallying a 3.12 ERA in 52 innings. Both have been good at times this season, with Clarke shining bright with a 2.00 ERA in 27 innings, along with 21 strikeouts and eight walks, while Helvey has a 5.84 ERA in 24 2/3 innings, along with 22 strikeouts and nine walks.
From a stuff standpoint, Clarke is a rather intriguing arm to watch. They sit 88-92, and will bump a 93 with their fastball, while they mainly pitch in the 88-91 range. They also possess a good slider and changeup, and has good feel for the strike zone. Meanwhile, Helvey is 88-90, touching 91, and also possesses a slider and changeup, with the changeup being their best secondary offering.
"Clarke is an over the top righty who just pounds the strike zone with pretty good stuff," Lee said. "Then there's Helvey, who isn't necessarily overpowering (like our other guys), but who does a good job of throwing strikes."
Charleston also has a good bullpen with junior righthander Chase Henry leading the way, while senior righty Michael Hanzlik is having a good year. Meanwhile, the Cougars hope to soon get back Eric Bauer (2.25), who has a wrist injury, while talented first-year student righty Hayden McCutcheon is expected to have an MRI soon because of a bicep issue, and there's not timetable for their return at this point.
Henry has a fantastic 0.46 ERA in 19 2/3 innings with 23 strikeouts and three walks, and has good overall stuff with a fastball 88-92 with good sink, and a good changeup. Hanzlik attacks from a sidearm angle, and though they don't have blow-away stuff, he's a hard-nosed personality who attacks the zone.
"Henry was a three-sport guy out of high school, and he's just really athletic," Lee said. "Hanzlik is a big-time competitor and just does a great job of closing games for us by attacking the zone."
While the pitching staff is the primary reason Charleston has a chance to shine not only the rest of the regular season, but perhaps also in the NCAA postseason, the offense, as usual, has some key cogs with Blake Butler (.354) leading the way. The offense also is paced by hard-hitting Carl Wise (.323/1/20) and Brandon Murray, who while they have a .270 batting average, leads the team with four homers. As with Murray, shortstop Gunnar Heidt (.265/2/14) is someone to watch the rest of the spring.
It's been a lengthy process for Lee and the Cougars to get everything on the same page, but barring surprise, this program seems to have turned the corner.
TEN MORE MID-MAJORS TO WATCH
William & Mary (14-5): The Tribe could be a force to be reckoned with the rest of the season. They captured a very solid series win over Campbell last weekend, and have one of the nation's better offensive lineups with Michael Katz leading the way. Katz is hitting .360 with nine homers and 35 RBIs, while leading hitter Nick Thompson has a .417 average, four homers and 15 RBIs.
Texas State (13-7): Sure, the Bobcats have dropped midweek bouts to Texas and Rice in the past week, but they're still a very good mid-major to watch moving forward. The Bobcats have an excellent ace pitcher in junior righthander Austen Williams, who has a 2.87 ERA in 31 1/3 innings, while reliever Cory Geisler has appeared in nine games and has a 1.47 ERA in 18 1/3 innings.
Southeast Missouri State (13-6): Though the Redhawks suffered a tough 11-8 setback to Saint Louis in midweek action, this is still a very intriguing club with a good overall record. The Redhawks are hitting .319 as a club and have an interesting leading hitter in Derek Gibson, who's hitting .465 with 23 RBIs and a .481 on-base percentage.
New Mexico (13-7): It shouldn't come as a surprise, but Ray Birmingham's Lobos are beginning to figure things out. The Lobos swept Fresno State last weekend, and captured a very nice midweek victory over surging Kansas, 6-3. UNM typically is known for its offensive prowess, but the Lobos have an excellent starting pitching duo in Colton Thomson and Josh Walker. Thomson has a 2.17 ERA in 29 innings, while Walker has a 3.41 ERA in 37 innings.
Massachusetts-Lowell (8-2): Though the Riverhawks haven't been tested by premier competition just yet, the newest members to Division I have shined thus far with an 8-2 overall record. UML has one to watch in talented pitcher Mike Calzetta, who has a 1.04 ERA in 17 1/3 innings, along with 15 strikeouts and no walks.
Mercer (16-6): The Bears have dealt with some injuries so far this spring, but still have a very good club more than capable of reaching the NCAA postseason. In addition to being one of the better defenders in the Atlantic Sun, Michael Massi is having a strong year at the plate, hitting .373 with two homers and 14 RBIs.
Indiana State (14-3): Though the Sycamores dropped a tough contest to Illinois in midweek action, this is still a very surprising club with coach Mitch Hannahs leading the way. The Sycamores have an interesting arm to watch in lefthander David Stagg, who has started five games and has a 1.85 ERA in 34 innings, along with 34 strikeouts and 11 walks.
Illinois State (11-5): The Redbirds were expected to compete for the Missouri Valley crown going into the season, so it's no surprise they're sitting pretty with an 11-5 overall record. ISU has a pair of elite starting pitchers in Dan Savas (1.12) and Dylan Craig (1.74), while Paul Dejong leads the offense with a .426 average, three homers and 12 RBIs.
Elon (13-7): The Phoenix made a legitimate statement last weekend by taking two of three from red-hot Georgia Southern. There are several aspects of this club to like, but how about veteran righty Lucas Bakker? The Australia native has a 1.27 ERA in 35 1/3 innings, along with 31 strikeouts and eight walks, and shined against GSU last weekend.
Tennessee Tech (17-4): TTU was the preseason favorite to win the Ohio Valley Conference crown, and it's now easier than ever to see why. TTU has a really good one in versatile senior Brandon Thomasson, who's hitting .366 with nine doubles, two triples, six homers and 26 walks, while Daniel Miles is hitting .420 with five homers and 22 RBIs.
Image caption The foundation aims to foster the research necessary to build a starship
The Pentagon's premiere research agency has chosen a former astronaut to lead a foundation that is designed to take humanity to the stars.
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) and Nasa are sponsoring the project, known as the 100-Year Starship.
Mae Jemison, the first African-American woman to go into space, was notified last week that they had won, according to a copy of a Darpa letter obtained by the BBC.
Since leaving Nasa, Jemison has been involved in science education programmes, and is known as a space travel enthusiast and long-time Star Trek fan.
Them organisation, the Dorothy Jemison Foundation for Excellence, is partnered on the Darpa project with Icarus Interstellar, a non-profit organisation that is dedicated to interstellar travel, and the Foundation for Enterprise Development.
Image caption Mae Jemison worked on a Spacelab mission
Since it was first announced last year, the 100-Year Starship project has been met with trepidation by some, and excitement by many.
With Nasa scaling back its manned space programmes, the idea of a manned trip to the stars, which is well beyond any current technology, may sound audacious.
But the goal is not to have the government fund the actual building of spacecraft destined for the stars, but rather to create a foundation that can last 100 years in order to help foster the research needed for interstellar travel.
The money for the winning team, $500,000, is small, but is designed to help jumpstart the effort. According to a copy of the notification letter, Jemison's proposal was titled: "An Inclusive Audacious Journey Transforms Life Here on Earth & Beyond".
A spokesperson for Darpa declined to comment on the award, which has not been publicly announced.
DAMAGE to aircraft fuel tanks doomed roughly half of the 5,000 or so American warplanes and helicopters destroyed during the Vietnam war. Some crashed or blew up after only a few bullet hits drained or ignited their fuel, says Robert Ball, the author of a textbook on the combat survivability of aircraft. But such “cheap kills” are becoming increasingly rare, says Dr Ball, a former engineering professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. Thanks to clever engineering, fuel tanks in aircraft, vehicles and even storage facilities can now withstand direct hits from enemy fire or tremendous impacts without exploding.
Armies like to keep their fuel trucks far from the enemy. But that can be difficult, as Western forces in Afghanistan and Iraq have learned. Even lightly armed insurgents can torch a tanker truck. Bullets shot into liquid fuel rarely ignite it. But a tank riddled with bullets spews fuel, and when fuel and its vapours mix with oxygen, a spark can create a firestorm. Between 2003 and 2007 attacks on fuel convoys in Iraq killed or seriously wounded more than 1,400 people, according to the US Army.
Strong steel armour would be prohibitively heavy on tanker trucks. So in 2005 High Impact Technology (HIT), a small firm based in Oregon, proposed using lightweight plastic instead. It developed a polyurethane material that is sprayed as a foam a few centimetres thick onto a fuel tank and dries into a rigid plastic shell. When pierced with a bullet, fuel spurting out of the hole reacts with a secret catalyst in the polyurethane, causing it to absorb fuel and expand, plugging the leak within seconds. The system, called BattleJacket, now protects more than 3,400 fuel-hauling trucks in conflict zones.
In 2008 more than 600 bullets were removed from the reservoir of one of them in Balad, Iraq. The truck was still moving fuel for the US Army but the bullets and shrapnel had begun to clog the reservoir's drainage valve. HIT charges up to $22,000 to spray each tanker (or twice that if the job is done in a war zone). The material has also been applied to the far-smaller tanks of more than 8,000 of America's fighting vehicles. There are now BattleJacket plants in America, Canada, Germany and Kuwait, with others being set up in Singapore, Taiwan and Turkey.
Bullet and shrapnel holes can also be sealed by rubber bladders placed inside fuel tanks. In a similar fashion to HIT's polyurethane shell, leaking fuel reacts with chemical additives in an inner layer of the rubber, causing it to absorb the liquid and expand. Such bladders have been used in warplane fuel tanks for decades. The latest bladders, however, can even seal the bigger holes made by bullets that pass right through the fuel tank.
Meggitt, a British company, manufactures self-sealing rubber bladders that can seal holes up to 7cm across in about two minutes. They are not cheap: bladders for aircraft cost more than $20,000 each, and aircraft generally have multiple fuel tanks. America's V-22 Osprey transporter, for example, has a Meggitt bladder in each of its dozen or more tanks. The company's bladders are used on more than 10,000 of America's military aircraft and more than 1,700 ground vehicles.
An extra benefit of the bladders is that they can withstand pretty much any impact that a flight crew might survive. When a fuel tank's rigid shell splits open on impact, the bladder inside stretches to absorb the impact without bursting. This is good, because splattered fuel is likely to be ignited by a spark: more than 40% of American soldiers who survived a helicopter-crash impact used to be burned alive in an ensuing fuel fire. Today it is less than 1%, according to Dennis Shanahan, a doctor and retired colonel who studied the matter for the US Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory.
Even humble aluminium alloys, cleverly used, can prevent fuel-tank fires and explosions. Coils of nearly paper-thin aluminium mesh can absorb lots of heat very fast. Place enough of them inside a fuel tank, and the heat created by a projectile or crumpling tank will generate fewer sparks, or none at all. If sparks do ignite vapours, flames may not spread because the mesh restricts airflow. Jiangsu Ampute Explosion Prevention Technology, based near Shanghai, reckons that aluminium mesh will become widely used in car petrol tanks. It costs only $20 or so, says Yelian Ju, Ampute's deputy manager.
Furthermore, by absorbing heat, aluminium mesh keeps fuel cool. This cuts in half the 5% or so of fuel that above-ground storage tanks in hot countries lose each year to evaporation through cooling vents. Ampute expects its sales of aluminium mesh to exceed $9m this year.
Yet another approach is that taken by Firetrace, based in Arizona. It has designed a plastic fuel-tank shell that is packed with fire-suppressant powder, which is released if the shell shatters. More than 55,000 shells have been installed in police and military vehicles, at a cost of around $4,500 each. Advances in fire safety, then, are spreading quickly. Fuel-tank explosions will doubtless continue in Hollywood movies, but they are becoming less frequent in real life.

Andrej Kramaric of HNK Rijeka: Leicester trying to sign Croatian
Leicester still have a number of obstacles to overcome if they are to sign Andrej Kramaric.
Nigel Pearson's struggling Premier League side have agreed a deal to sign the Croatia striker for an undisclosed fee from FC Rijeka and the 23-year-old has passed a medical.
However, Kramaric must now obtain a work permit for the transfer to go through but there remains some doubt about them meeting the necessary criteria at hearing which is scheduled for next week.
Sky Sports News HQ reporter Rob Dorsett writes: Sky sources suggest it's 50-50 whether or not Kramaric will be granted a visa allowing them to work in the UK. It's a very complicated, very political process, with no guarantee of success. For Kramaric, there are added complications.
Because Croatia only joined the European Union in 2013, the country's professional footballers are not afforded the same freedom of international employment as other EU nationals. If they were German or Spanish, for example, things would be much easier. But Kramaric has to satisfy the more strict criteria of non-EU nationals, if he's to be granted a UK work permit.
A work permit is currently preventing Andrej Kramaric signing for Leicester A work permit is currently preventing Andrej Kramaric signing for Leicester
And, in short, Kramaric will FAIL to meet that criteria.
FA and Home Office rules dictate that for a player to be granted a work permit, their national team must be ranked in the top 70 countries by FIFA; and they must have featured in 75% of the competitive matches played by their national team in the previous two years. Croatia (ranked 19 in the world) satisfy the first criteria, but Kramaric fails the second.  They are 23, and despite playing for the national team at every age group during their development, they have so far won only four senior caps.
For Leicester to complete the deal, they will have to present their case to an appeal panel, who will decide whether Kramaric is of "exceptional ability" and whether they would add to the overall quality of English football.
The six-man panel will meet next week; it's made up of one representative from the FA, one from the Premier League, one from the PFA, and three independent football experts (usually out-of-work managers, or similar). The difficulty for Leicester, is the current policy of the FA to restrict the number of non-UK players in England's top divisions.
Sky sources have told me Chelsea were very interested in signing Kramaric, and that having snared him, they planned to loan the striker to Vitesse Arnhem... Chelsea didn't pursue their interest because of concerns Kramaric would not be granted a work permit. Rob Dorsett
One of the key recommendations of FA chairperson Greg Dyke's commission on English football, presented in the summer, was a limit on the number of non-European Union players in the English game - action which, it was claimed, would increase the number of England-qualified footballers, thereby improving the national team in the aftermath of a winless World Cup in Brazil.
It's in that climate that Leicester must convince the FA panel that Kramaric can be a benefit to the national game.  They are an exceptional goalscorer: 28 goals in 24 appearances for club and country so far this season attests to that. And club officials hope those stats will help sway the decision in their favour.
Leicester are leaving no stone unturned in trying to capture a player who they believe could light up the Premier League. I understand the club have already obtained a glowing reference from Niko Kovac, manager of the Croatian national team, but manager Nigel Pearson could play a key role in trying to influence the panel's decision. He's decided they WILL appear before them to argue their case next week.
Football's cynics will suggest that if it were Jose Mourinho sitting in front of the panel instead of Nigel Pearson, the chances of gaining a work permit would be greatly enhanced. Sky sources have told me Chelsea were very interested in signing Kramaric, and that having snared him, they planned to loan the striker to Vitesse Arnhem to increase their footballing education. It has been suggested to me that the reason Chelsea didn't pursue their interest, was because of concerns Kramaric would not be granted a work permit.
Kramaric's goalscoring record is extraordinary. And there's no doubting their potential, if he's allowed to prove themselves in the Premier League. That fact gives Leicester reason for optimism, in their submissions to the FA. And Pearson is confident that they will get their permit. And therefore get their man.

One of the main technical goals I set for Galactology was to fully support user mods. The core of the game is written in C++, and asking for mods to be delivered as native DLLs is a mess and also non-portable, so it was clear to me early on that the best would be to enhance the existing Scheme scripting support, to the point I wanted to use it instead of C++, and then rewrite most of the game in Scheme, as if it was collection of mods.
Galactology, as the sequel slash rewrite of The Spatials, inherited its support for s7 Scheme. But what was there had a very limited scope. It was only able to be run for scripting planet missions, and it had limited support for interacting with the rest of the C++ side.
Why s7 Scheme?
My limited knowledge of Scheme at the start of Galactology development didn't go very deep into understanding s7. I just integrated s7 as an (immensely) faster interpreter to replace TinyScheme. My Scheme efforts were limited and conservative. A few macros, tentative use of a few data structures, not much. This was in part because of the limited feature set of TinyScheme, and because I hadn't really started to look into the s7 features, rather only on its C FFI API for embedding, which is excellent and very natural to work with, given it's the main focus of the interpreter.
Applicative syntax everywhere
So I started reading on how Scheme deals with aggregate data. It looked like a good point to start. Galactology was going to be written in a big part in s7 Scheme so data modeling was a required topic of investigation.
Keep in mind, at this point, I had written less than 2K lines of scheme in my life, so I was still quite a newbie, and a blank slate. I was familiar with association lists, but surely there had to be some other patterns. I learned about vectors and vector-ref , and then about SRFI-69 hashtables. But APIs like hash-table-set! didn't look very nice to me. Such a very special cased/named procedure, it looked out of place in the language.
Kind of bummed, I dived back into the s7 documentation, to see how these were exposed in s7. And then it clicked for me:
> ( define h ( hash-table* 'a 1 'b 2 )) > ( display ( h 'a )) 1 > ( set! ( h 'b ) 3 ) > ( display ( h 'b )) 3
Eureka! What was this wonder? This was my first encounter with generic applicative syntax, which s7 embraces fully in many places for many kinds of objects. It's not limited to hash tables:
> ; lists > ( display ( ' ( 1 2 3 ) 1 )) 2 > ; vectors (with constant time) > ( display ( # ( 1 2 3 ) 1 )) 2 > ; strings > ( display ( "abc" 1 )) #\b > ; environments (!?!) > ( display (( let (( a 2 )) ( curlet )) 'a )) 2 > ; dilambdas (more on this later) > ( define dil ( let (( a 0 )) ( dilambda ( lambda () a ) ( lambda ( v ) ( set! a v ))))) > ( display ( dil )) 0 > ( set! ( dil ) 10 ) > ( display ( dil )) 10
And, as you can see, if an applicative reference form (a b) is valid, you can usually (set! (a b) ...) too.
It turns out than s7 really embraces its interpreted, dynamic nature. Many of the Scheme specs are written to not make the life of static compiler writers too hard, but that's not a problem for s7. It supports a good chunk of standard Scheme, but it revels on the parts that are its own, and the result is a more usable language IMHO.
Reactive symbol access
For a few years already React and friends have put reactive programming on the map. But when the language is truly dynamic we can go even further than what the original Javascript versions that React targeted. What if we could get custom code called when any let slot is accessed? Enter symbol-access :
> ( define a 1 ) > ( set! ( symbol-access 'a ) ( lambda ( s v ) ( format #t "hey, changing ~A into ~A
" s v ) v )) > a 1 > ( set! a 2 ) hey, changing a into 2 > a 2
We could manipulate the value of v before returning it, or call any external side effects, or mess with the environment if we wanted. It's not just for accessing slots of simple values, it can also be implemented to support drilling down into more complex objects as described in the reactive-let documentation (see the previous link for symbol-access ).
Generic iteration
Many s7 built-ins can iterate generically over different data types. For example map, for-each, or reverse. This means you can pass not only lists to them, as the Scheme standard requires, but also vectors, hash tables, or even environments.
First class environments
This is when I truly realized how crazily dynamic s7 is. Other interpreted languages can manipulate their environments, but I've never seen anything like this:
> ( define in ( let (( a 1 )) ( curlet ))) > ( in 'a ) 1 > ( set! ( in 'a ) 2 ) > ( in 'a ) 2 > ( define f ( with-let in ( lambda () a ))) > ( f ) 2 > a error: a: unbound variable
The full API is documented here and it's an enlightening read. By reading this deconstruction of what is an environment in s7 I finally understood the exact semantics of symbol lookup in Scheme, and how environments in dynamic languages work in general.
You can build a class system based on this very flexible handling of environments alone, and indeed s7 provides one at the end of that documentation section.
(values) is just splice-in-place (mostly)
values is the constructor for the multiple return values support in standard Scheme. But in s7 it is a bit different, and it allows splicing lists directly as syntax inside an expression:
> ( define l ' ( 1 2 )) > ( + ( apply values l )) 3
But, for me, its most useful property is a special case it has just for map . It allows skipping certain values when mapping over a sequence:
> ( define s ' ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 )) > ( map ( lambda ( v ) ( if ( odd? v ) v ( values ))) s ) ( 1 3 5 7 9 )
Conclusion
s7 Scheme feels like a gateway into more advanced Lisp-like languages, a step up from the mini-Schemes, but at the same time it has unique features not found in the big Schemes or Lisps, which are elegantly implemented, and following a clear vision of programmer ergonomics and dynamism.
Vandals have damaged the sacred Hebridean site where St Columba is buried.
St Columba's Shrine, next to the abbey they founded on Iona, marks the spot where the saint's remains were buried after their death in 597.
Iona Abbey is one of the most sacred places on earth Councillor Alistair MacDougall
A wooden floor hatch covering the site was forced open and damaged between regular tours.
Jane Martin, Historic Scotland's manager at Iona Abbey, said: “St Columba was buried in there, it would have been at the heart of the site. Someone jemmied up one of the hatches and did some damage to it.”
St Columba spread Christianity throughout Scotland.
Miss Martin said: “His remains were thought to have powers, they were very important, that is where all the pilgrims would have come.”
They added: “We assume it was somebody who was interested and they must have known the hatch was there, there was a carpet over the hatch but it was moved.”
However, the culprit would not have found anything to steal, as there are no visible remains there now.
Miss Martin said: “Someone has been interested in what is underneath, but there are no remains there now.
“The thing that worried us initially was that someone could have fallen down the hatch. It's not that deep but someone could have injured themselves.”
They added: “It's quite shocking. We don't often get any crime here at all. You expect that people treat the buildings with respect because they are old and because they have this religious history as well. To have a go at lunchtime, they were taking a bit of a risk of somebody seeing them.”
They said the hatch was screwed down, adding: “They have put something in to lever it up, something like a screwdriver, they might have had a penknife.”
Somebody had cleaned the building on Monday morning and there was a guided tour at 11:45am when everything was intact. The damage to the wooden hatch was discovered during the next tour at 2pm.
Miss Martin added: “There is a wee altar at the front with a candle burning and a cross on the wall. It looks like a place where people go to pray and it's still in use for its original intention.
“People often ask where St Columba's remains are, because when you go to a lot of places you see a tomb, but there is nothing like that here.”
New security measures are being put in place following the incident, which comes four months after a plain glass leaded window was smashed at the nunnery next to the abbey.
Miss Martin said: “All the glass was broken, the lead itself was pushed in and was no longer vertical, we had to remove the window to a lead worker, to see if it can be fixed, or if we need a new one.
“I have been working here for 12 years and until this year we had nothing like this.”
Mull and Iona Councillor Alistair MacDougall said: “I think it's disgraceful that anybody would go and interfere with something they probably know nothing about. It is hard to visualise what they were after.
“We get people walking about the islands morning, noon and night and you don't know what they are up to. We have got to watch them for stealing birds eggs, but this is much worse. Iona Abbey is one of the most sacred places on earth.”
Police in Springfield, Massachusetts have adopted Iraq-style “counterinsurgency” tactics and are applying them to gang busting with amazing results, according to Sunday's episode of “60 Minutes.”
Before you get freaked out, don't worry: Springfield police are not walling off whole blocks, setting up militarized checkpoints and jumping out of helicopters with bazookas. What they are doing is something that's been sorely missing from American policing in recent decades: community building.
Retired Marine Corps officer R. Scott Moore summarized counterinsurgency strategy as the combination of “actions, structures and beliefs to resolve root causes” of a conflict. As such, U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq focused on keeping militants at bay while creating stable space for a community to come together and begin resolving issues that create violence.
To officer Mike Katone, freshly home from a war zone and working for the Springfield police force, that strategy made more and more sense the longer they looked at their city's gang problems.
“No one was calling the Springfield police and no one was calling the state police,” they told “60 Minutes” reporter Lesley Stahl. “Insurgents and gang members both want to operate in a failed area — a failed community or a failed state. They know they can live off the passive support of the community, where the local community is not going to call or engage the local police.”
They pitched the idea of creating a team of officers specifically tasked with building relationships in the community, going door-to-door to shake hands and make friends. Springfield Deputy Police Chief John Barbieri told “60 Minutes” that they were initially skeptical, but embraced the idea when they realized “it was exactly the type of program I need for this type of neighborhood.”
It took some shoe leather, but the officers embedded themselves in the hearts and minds of their community, and eventually began holding neighborhood meetings that brought many community leaders together, some for the first time. That led to the creation of a “walking school bus,” where officers escort neighborhood kids to school in areas where that sort of activity used to be considered dangerous, creating a strong visual of police taking back the streets from gangs.
Thanks to these tactics, Stahl noted that violent crime in the worst parts of Springfield fell 25 percent in 2012, while drug arrests dropped roughly 50 percent.
“If the government is not going to do it, and individuals are not going to do it, why it can't police partner up with the community and say, ‘Hey, here's a plan. This is what we want to do to help'?” Katone said. “Because the status quo of traditional policing, it just ain't gonna work.”

On July 9, 2014, Dr. Yuuri Yasuoka in the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University's Marine Genomics Unit, published a research paper explaining a key mechanism in formation of the head in frogs. The work was done in collaboration with researchers at the University of Tokyo. Previous studies had reported genes involved in head development. However, it still remained unclear how those genes interact with each other for head formation as a whole. By employing Next-Generation sequencing techniques, which provide scientists with massive amounts of DNA sequence data, Dr. Yasuoka has uncovered a genetic mechanism underlying head formation, which is one of the most important processes in animal development.
For centuries, scientists have explored how fertilized eggs develop into mature organisms. Since DNA in the nucleus of a cell was discovered as the substance of genetic inheritance, genetic studies have made huge progress. In the 21st century, advances in genome analysis led to decoding of human genome, an achievement that represents a quantum leap in human self-knowledge. Today, in addition to asking what kind of genes are functioning in a specific part of the body, scientists are also asking how individual genes influence each other to organize the body.
In this study, Dr. Yasuoka prepared the so-called "head organizer cocktail" comprised of several proteins required for head formation during early development of a fertilized egg and introduced it into a frog embryo. As a result, an additional head was formed on the ventral side, or the stomach side, of the embryo, indicating that those proteins induce tissues to form a head. Dr. Yasuoka also demonstrated that an embryo that lacked those genes could not form a head properly. They then tried to discover where those proteins are located in the genome and how they affect other genes for head formation. By using Next-Generation sequencers, Dr. Yasuoka decoded frog DNA sequences bound by those proteins and successfully created a genetic map of protein-binding regions in the genome in a process called mapping. These proteins, generally referred to as "transcription factors," are known for their role in enhancing or inhibiting the activity of other genes. This study made it possible to evaluate how these proteins enhance and inhibit genes for head formation by delving into transcription factor binding regions in the genome, known as cis-regulatory modules. This study provided detailed insight into the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression.
Changes in developmental processes in individual organisms lead to evolution over a long period of time. "Evolution continues forever and our understanding of it also forever remains within the boundary of speculation," Dr. Yasuoka said. "What we can do is to collect as much information as possible about organisms for use in experiments and make the most use of scientific knowledge to fill in gaps in the evolutionary history of life."
An Alabama judge facing contradictory directives from a U.S. judge and the state's high court on whether to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples said on Wednesday that their office will not issue licenses to anyone while it analyzes the conflict.
The announcement by Mobile County Probate Judge Don Davis comes a day after the Alabama Supreme Court ordered probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, underscoring the depth of opposition to gay matrimony in the socially conservative state.
The 7-1 Alabama high court ruling came roughly three weeks after U.S. District Judge Callie Granade's decision overturning Alabama's ban on gay marriage went into effect after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to put it on hold.
The U.S. Supreme Court agreed this year to take up the issue of whether states can ban gay marriage. Its expected ruling in June likely will provide clarity on the issue in Alabama, as well as the 13 states where gay marriage remains illegal.
Davis was ordered last month by Granade to begin issuing marriage licenses to gay couples after their office had refused to do so in the wake of their ruling striking down the state's gay marriage ban.
“We regret having to take this action but feel that it is necessary given the unprecedented circumstances that currently exist,” a statement posted on the probate court's website said. “It is the court's intent to comply with all laws governing its operations and to not discriminate in any manner against any person.”
Davis is among 68 probate judges in Alabama bound by the ruling, most of whom had been issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.
It was not immediately clear how the other probate judges will proceed but it is likely they will follow the Alabama Supreme Court's ruling, unless the U.S. Supreme Court offers specific direction to the contrary, said Ronald Krotoszynski, a constitutional law expert at the University of Alabama School of Law.
Among the probate judges who had not begun issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples was Elmore County Probate Judge John Enslen, who in a Facebook post applauded the ruling as recognizing what they described as the natural superiority of heterosexual unions.
“Man can pass a million laws and those laws will never make the two unions equal,” they wrote. “It is like trying to pass a law against the operation of gravity.”

Testifying on Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Michael Mukasey refused to admit that the president had broken the law when they ordered the surveillance of domestic calls without a warrant. In an emergency, Mukasey seemed to be saying, all authority is absorbed into executive authority. It followed, and Mukasey intimated as much, that the president could have been acting legally, too, when they authorized the drowning torture: a war crime under the Geneva Conventions, and under the treaty obligations of the United States. Aiming to reassure the committee, Mukasey said that they could not imagine any expansion of executive power this president might demand that would not fall within the law.
When Michael Mukasey was nominated as attorney general, the legal community vouched for him. A conscientious and professional legal mind, they said, far more scrupulous than Alberto Gonzales. This impression was widely conveyed, but it has turned out to be false. How did that happen? The impression was based on Mukasey's conduct before 2001.
Michael Mukasey is one of those Americans like Dick Cheney, Rudolph Giuliani, John Yoo, and George W. Bush, for whom the moral world turned upside down on September 11, 2001. These men quickly came to believe that all our previous understanding of good and bad, legal and illegal, honorable and dishonorable, right and wrong, ended on that day. Every maxim and principle regarding the treatment of strangers or citizens was now questionable. The vice president's frank confession of their need to "work the dark side" was a plain statement of the intuition. So, many things Americans had considered wicked were now to be countenanced, redefined, and certified as legal, provided we Americans were the ones who did them.
Mukasey's turn might have been guessed from their connection with the Giuliani campaign and their admiration for Joseph Lieberman. A stronger clue appeared in a New York Times story by Philip Shenon, which ran on September 24, 2007 and was too little noticed at the time. The story gave some details of Judge Mukasey's treatment of the rights of an Arab detainee in October 2001.
The detainee, a Jordanian, Osama Awadallah, had been picked up as a possible witness in a terrorism investigation, and said they had been beaten in jail. Judge Mukasey responded "He looks fine to me," and ordered the man detained indefinitely. A prison medical official later found bruises on their body consistent with the statement that they were beaten.
Randy Hamud represented Awadallah in the courtroom, in that hearing in October 2001, and they were taken aback by the "injudicious" conduct of Judge Mukasey. Why injudicious? Awadallah and the other witnesses had been picked up in San Diego and rushed to New York without a chance to consult a lawyer. "I wasn't aware that they were in New York until approximately 8:30 yesterday evening," Hamud says in the court transcript.
"You are now aware of it," says Mukasey.
The defense lawyer asks why the prosecutors have been allowed to prevent them from talking with their client.
"Your question is ridiculous," says Mukasey. "The Government isn't interfering with the attorney-client privilege."
Hamud: "It is, your honor."
Mukasey: "Oh, please."
If the reply, "You are now aware of it," was mocking, "Oh, please" takes us beyond mockery to contempt. In any social context, the phrase is a play to the gallery. It goes with rolling of the eyes. You are sharing your dismissal with an audience of those who see at once the absurdity of the question. But in Judge Mukasey's courtroom, who exactly were the audience?
The answer can't be simply the government lawyers (though, by their breach of decorum, Mukasey was reassuring them that no legal compunction would stop them from assisting their cause). No: the audience existed in Judge Mukasey's mind.
It was constituted of all the Americans who matter. All real Americans, they were telling a lawyer named Hamud who represented a client named Awadallah -- all of us here recognize that the moment has come for rough handling of Arab detainees and suspects. And if the law doesn't help us to handle them, we will find new ways of handling the law.
Oh, please. In other words: Give me a break. Do you want me to draw you a diagram? What you call the law, the law you learned in school -- can't you see this isn't the law we're using any more? Everyone knows that everything has changed.
On Wednesday, Senator Kennedy asked the attorney general about the drowning torture, and, recalling their earlier refusal to call it torture, imagined aloud the series of sophistical evasions they would get if they waited for an answer.
Just as the attack was turning predictable, Kennedy looked up at Mukasey. "Let me ask you this, would waterboarding be torture if it was done to you?" Here, perhaps, not the question but the timing caught Mukasey off guard, and they replied in a shaken tone: "I would feel that it was."
They would feel that it was torture. But that would not make it torture. Because, when we go after these suspects, we are dealing with matters of great moment, beyond the concern of moral feelings. What I feel, Senator, and what you feel has nothing to do with our right to shut up a suspect and give them the works until they confess. How I feel and how you feel has nothing to do with it. And what the law plainly says -- that, too, has nothing to do with it.
Everything changed, they say, on 9/11. Politics, morality, laws (even if the laws on the books are mostly unchanged), who we are, and what we may permit ourselves -- none of the rules apply any more. To prove themselves a believer, Mukasey has gone some way to destroy their own reputation as a defender of the laws. Yet a man of their stature does not cease to care about the quality of their reputation. So when they indicate, as they did on Wednesday, that their function is to provide a cover for the president's assertions of executive power, they are saying that they expect to be judged by a posterity that will resemble John Yoo more than it resembles Robert H. Jackson.
The belief that the ethic of force will last forever is a presumption of the totalitarian mind. It says: none of the lights of the old morality can guide us through our latest plans. It says: our dangers are unprecedented, and so are the methods we must employ. This cry is heard on many sides, in America, while the world looks on dismayed, because they have never seen us like this before, and they can trace no proportion between the cause and the effects.
In an essay written in 1939, on the cold war between the superpowers of Russia and Germany, Simone Weil made these observations:
"Politically speaking, it is the essential characteristic of totalitarian regimes that they prolong, year after year, a situation which is only natural in a state of general excitement. Every people are liable occasionally to what we may call totalitarian moments. At such moments there are unanimous and cheering crowds and even the passive elements of the population, including those who were formerly hostile to what is being acclaimed, feel a vague admiration and sense of satisfaction....Totalitarian regimes commence more or less in this kind of atmosphere, and that is why their tyrannical character is recognized more quickly by foreigners than by their own subjects. Then, as the years go by, everything is expected to continue, day by day throughout the whole country, on the assumption that the state of excitement is permanent. The real stumbling-block of totalitarian regimes is not the spiritual need of men for freedom of thought; it is men's inability to stand the physical and nervous strain of a permanent state of excitement....Enthusiasm is a machine that wears out, and then a man begins to be aware of coercion; and the sense of being coerced is enough to produce in their mind that combination of docility and rancor which is typical of slaves."
Rand Paul: We Know For Sure Obama Administration Spied On Mike Flynn
On this week's edition of 'This Week With George Stephanopoulos,' Sen. Rand Paul discussed the president's accusation that their campaign was spied on by the Obama administration:
STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, sir, you're also a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. WE see the president standing by that claim about President Obama. It's caused a rift now with British intelligence over the weekend. How big a problem is this for the president's credibility? How do they fix it?
PAUL: I think that we know one thing for sure, that the Obama administration did spy on Flynn. Now, whether it was direct or indirect, somebody was reading and taking -- a transcript of their phone calls and then they released it.
It is very, very important that whoever released that go to jail, because you cannot have members of the intelligence community listening to the most private and highly classified information and then releasing that to The New York Times.
There can only be a certain handful of people who did that. I would bring them all in. They would have to take lie detector tests. And I would say, including the political people, because some political people knew about this as well.
But we need to get to the bottom of who is releasing these highly classified conversations. And if the president was surveilled, they probably aren't the target. I don't know that they were or wasn't. But if they are, they probably targeted someone in a foreign government, but then they listened to the conversation with Americans.
But our government's talking to foreigners all the time. We can't allow people in the intelligence committee to release the contents of that informing to the media.
STEPHANOPOULOS: But you don't believe...
PAUL: You will get a deep state. You will have an intelligence community that has enormous power if that happens.
STEPHANOPOULOS; You don't believe President Obama ordered an illegal wiretap of President Trump?
PAUL: Well, what happens is it's different than that. We target foreigners all the time, but they talk to Americans. They talk to the president. They talk to the national security advisers. And they're supposed to be masked.
But there was something alarming the other day. General Hayden admitted that people all the way down to some of the lowest analysts can unmask who the American is. So, someone unmasked General Flynn and they're a low-level analyst, we need to be looking at their computer and find out if they unmasked that conversation and if they spoke with The New York Times you have got to put those people in jail, because you cannot allow this to happen, or we will have presidents being blackmailed or national security advisers being blackmailed.
This is a huge, huge problem, bigger than anything else that's being discussed is the fact that private conversations from the intelligence community's perspective are being leaked to the press. That's not like a leak that says, oh, the president watches TV in their bathrobe, this is important to national security, you can't let it happen.
The saga dates back to 2010, when a couple bought a chalet in a rural area above Montreux with the intention of keeping chickens on its 4,000m2 parcel of land, reported 24 Heures on Wednesday.
Before buying the place the couple – named as Anouk and Philippe Michauville – checked they were able to keep chickens there and the commune confirmed they could, as long as their number didn't surpass 2,000, said the paper.
But in 2012 a lawyer on behalf of their neighbour served them ten days' notice to put an end to the “racket” made by the cockerels and hens.
The neighbour owned a place 50m above the couple's chalet but actually lived in Zug and was only ever there a few weeks a year, the Michauvilles told the paper.
They did nothing to respond to the order, considering it an absurd request in a rural area, said the paper. But the following spring they received another legal letter on behalf of the neighbour claiming the noisy birds reduced the value of their house and demanding 97,000 francs in damages.
Despite keeping their cockerels inside at night to prevent them crowing, the row continued and went to a court hearing in March, where a number of measures were considered in an effort to resolve the dispute.
The neighbour agreed to renounce their claim for damages if the couple gave up their henhouse. But they refused, said 24 Heures.
Finally, six months after the hearing, the civil court rejected the neighbour's case last week, ordering them to pay 21,642 francs in legal costs and 15,000 francs expenses.
They have not yet decided if they will appeal, reported the paper.
The issue of noise in the countryside crops up in Switzerland from time to time.
In May this year a farmer in the Zurich Oberland lost their appeal over their neighbours' complaints that the bells on their cows were too noisy at night.
The farmer was ordered to remove bells from any cow located within 200m of a house during the hours of 10pm and 7am.
At the time the farmer told the media they were ready to fight the issue in the supreme court.
Caleb's post yesterday about the coaching staff sparked a lot of discussion. Some bemoaned the way everyone from Mike Smith down to Joe Zelenka have performed this season, while others were alarmed by the headline, which featured the words "hot seat" prominently. The argument, essentially, was what the hell are we doing talking about the most successful coach in team history being on the hot seat after a 1-2 start to the season?
Over the last two months, I've seen a lot of angst about these Falcons. There were concerns about the team throughout pre-season, concerns that in retrospect seem totally fair. For the first time in the Mike Smith era, the Falcons have stumbled badly out of the gate, to the extent that many are now concerned that the team will suffer its first losing season since 2007. The fall from grace has been rapid.
Everyone is welcome to their opinions here, and I don't write this seeking to stifle anyone. I do have a message for every fan who is despondent now, though, wondering why the Football Gods have forsaken them.
Take the long view.
I've been a fan of this team for a little over two decades now. If you're not familiar with my history as a fan, I'll give you the extremely short version. Born in Massachusetts, spent my formative years in Patriots country and grew up as a Falcons fan for no clear reason I can remember. Having picked my team, it never occurred to me to abandon them, so I've stumbled and bumbled my way along with them for 21 years.
That's not to say that the Falcons haven't tried my patience over the years. For much of my life, they've either been a terrible, mediocre or slightly above average team. In their flashes of brilliance, such as in 1998, they've still managed to fall short. It used to be that I could commiserate with the sea of Patriots fans who surround me, but the last decade has wiped out their collective memories of the terrible times. As it should.
The way you survive as a Falcons fan is by imagining that better days are around the corner. For literally decades, it's been the only way to make it through another season where the Falcons went 7-9, 4-12 or 9-7 and got bounced in the first round of the playoffs. The road to the present is littered with the corpses of once-promising seasons.
****
Mike Smith and Thomas Dimitroff changed all that. Suddenly, the Falcons were perennial playoff contenders. They built a young, hungry team.
As much as I hate to say it—especially because the team hasn't won a playoff game in that three-year span—the success simultaneously spoiled fans and didn't change their outlooks at all. Suddenly, every loss became a funeral. Every setback, every injury and every boneheaded mistake was the heralding of a grand collapse. By and large, Falcons fans simply couldn't shake the sense of impending doom that has been part and parcel of this team for four-and-a-half decades.
When it didn't happen—think last year after the Steelers game to open the season—fans were still wary. National pundits and fans of other teams scoffed at the Falcons, calling them paper birds of prey. The loss to the Packers seemed a fulfillment of every dark word we collectively spoke last season, and the Falcons spent the off-season taking a hell of a lot of abuse for a team that was the top seed in the NFC in 2010.

And now we're here, sitting at 1-2 with very real problems along the offensive line and with the aggressiveness of the team's schemes, and many have settled into a comfortable narrative. The coaching staff must go! The players must be replaced! These bums are going nowhere!
I don't want to live like that. I want to appreciate that this is the best football played in Atlanta in many, many years, and that a 1-2 start does not mean that the Falcons are totally screwed. I want to be able to point out the good things without being called a fool. I want to be able to debate the real problems this team has without every discussion devolving into a "FIRE MULARKEY!" meme, without half the fanbase taking their 13-3 playoff boasts made in the pre-season and transforming them into 5-11 predictions on the basis of three games.
I want to do that because football and The Falcoholic are joys for me, and to leap headfirst into a pit of despair after every game wears a man down. I want to do it because for all its flaws, it is a joy to watch the Falcons' young safeties pick passes, to see the promise in a 5'6" running back who is still just a rookie, and to see Matt Ryan uncork a beautiful pass with only nanoseconds before their teeth are rattled in their head and connect with Roddy White downfield. There is promise and greatness even in the midst of three (mostly) bad games, and I see enough to have faith that the Falcons will be a damn good football team again if they can fix their Achilles heel on the offensive line.
****
Take the long view. Remember that even the greatest teams ever—the unstoppable Raiders of John Madden's heyday, the mighty Steelers of the Steel Curtain era, the steam-powered Patriots of the 2000's—have fallen on hard times in the middle of their runs. They've missed the playoffs, they've made the playoffs and been humiliated, and so on. What defined these teams was a commitment to excellence, to holding the core together and always striding forward. If these teams had blown up their coaching staffs and traded away their elite players based on a single stretch of games or even a bad season, I wouldn't be sourcing them right now.
Keep this all in perspective. The Falcons can get better as soon as the next game. Win against the Seahawks and you're 2-2. Continue that improvement against teams like the Saints and Packers and maybe you come into mid-season at 5-3, positioned to make a second half run after plowing through the hardest part of the schedule. Even if they falter and this season goes poorly, the core will be there in 2012, the same core that has without question transformed Atlanta Falcons football since coming aboard in 2008.
I'm not saying changes shouldn't be made, that perhaps Mike Mularkey should be seeking a new job by mid-season. But if you really want to blow this up entirely and start over, you risk going back to the days when the Falcons were awful. Short memories are and have always been the enemy of lasting success.
Forgive the rambling, but this has been on my mind. Feel free to weigh in, my Falcoholic friends.

In many submarkets of King and Snohomish counties, average prices are already at or near the peaks hit before the Great Recession. And in some areas, prices last quarter were up 20 percent or more compared with a year earlier.
Home prices in many parts of King and Snohomish counties are returning to the peak levels they hit seven years ago before their historic plunge.
This could be the year the housing market finally regains those heights if frothy sales continue:
• In the first six months of the year, the median sale price of single-family homes in King County was $430,000, about 5 percent shy of the peak set in 2007. Median means half sold for more, half for less.
• Half of the county's 30 submarkets have either surpassed their previous price peaks or climbed to within 5 percent of them, according to a Seattle Times analysis of home-sales statistics from the Northwest Multiple Listing Service (MLS).
• Across the county, 14 submarkets saw average annual home-price growth accelerate in the second quarter, with affluent places like Bellevue, Mercer Island and Seattle's Queen Anne and Magnolia neighborhoods posting the highest annual gains, between 19 and 34 percent.
• Snohomish County prices are rising, too, by an average 10 percent annually, with a couple of submarkets up more than 17 percent.
As more people move here for the lifestyle and jobs, prices in the Seattle area are soaring because of limits in housing supply and geography: an urban-growth boundary on its east side and water on its west.
“The supply of buildable land in the Seattle market is very, very constrained,” said Ken Perlman, senior vice president at California-based John Burns Real Estate Consulting. “Add the fact that we have relatively low interest rates that don't appear to be moving upward anytime soon, and that's a recipe for home-price appreciation.”
While prices for single-family homes in King County are close to recovering the ground they lost in the recession, prices for condominiums on the whole aren't — except in downtown Seattle and Kirkland.
There, the thousands of new employees joining big tech firms such as Amazon.com and Facebook in Seattle and Google in Kirkland are finding limited choices for housing. Vacancy rates in urban apartments are low. The average rent in King and Snohomish counties was $1,284 in the second quarter, up almost 8 percent annually.
More renters are searching for homes to buy, but the inventory of homes for sale is still relatively tight, pushing prices higher.
Expensive leaders
In the second quarter, the average price of King County single-family homes sold was $545,886, 10 percent higher than a year ago.
As with any average, the appreciation varied dramatically across the county. (The Multiple Listing Service does not publish submarket statistics on a quarterly basis, so The Times calculated these quarterly averages from monthly statistics.)
Leading all submarkets in annual gains were the county's most expensive areas: The average prices of homes sold in Mercer Island and Bellevue west of Interstate 405 — an area that includes Medina, Clyde Hill and Hunts Point — were up 28 percent and 34 percent, respectively.
Right behind with 19 percent annual gains were Bellevue east of I-405 and Seattle's Queen Anne-Magnolia area.
Some MLS areas with the lowest annual appreciation — less than 3 percent — were Lake Forest Park-Kenmore, Central Seattle, North Seattle, West Seattle, south Renton and Black Diamond-Maple Valley.
While the number of homes sold during the quarter was lower than last year, places where homes are relatively affordable and close to transit saw big jumps in sales activity — Shoreline, Beacon Hill and West Seattle.
The volume of home sales in Snohomish County is down over the year more than in King County. Prices gained, however, with the biggest increases in east and southeast submarkets: Second-quarter home sales posted an average price of $329,586 and $467,410, respectively, up more than 17 percent annually.
The most affordable area in Snohomish County, the northwest submarket, saw 7 percent appreciation, with the average price rising to $274,530.
New peaks
Five King County submarkets broke through the peak set during the previous housing boom, based on the median price of homes sold in the first half of 2014:
• Queen Anne-Magnolia: The popular Seattle area first set a new peak in the first quarter of this year and broke it again in the second quarter, with a median price of $715,000.
• Central Seattle: This area, which the MLS defines as spanning from Capitol Hill to Madrona and Eastlake to Interstate 90, had a median price of $654,500. In 2007, the median price was just under $590,000.
• Ballard/Green Lake/Greenwood: The median price was $491,000 in this area, which the MLS defines as everything from the Ship Canal north to the city limits that's west of Interstate 5. In 2007, the median price was $480,000.
• Mercer Island: The median price was $1.13 million, up 22 percent from the same period a year ago. In 2007, the median price was $1.08 million.
• Bellevue west of I-405: Homes sold in King County's most expensive submarket in the first half of 2014 had a median price of almost $1.44 million. In 2007, the median price was $1.4 million.
But until 2014 is over, it's hard to tell if these submarkets will sustain these new peaks.
Mixed condo market
Homebuyers who can't afford single-family homes — especially young singles and couples — have choices in the condominium market. Condos account for about one in five home sales reported by the MLS.
King County condos sold in the first half of 2014 had a median price of $250,000. While that's 11 percent higher than the same period a year ago, it's still 13 percent below the peak set in 2007.
The hardest-hit area in the county is the Skyway area between Seattle and Renton, where the median price of $85,000 is 64 percent below the last peak. The Dash Point-Federal Way area has a similar median condo price and is 54 percent below its last peak.
Downtown Seattle and the Kirkland area have hit new peaks: The median condo price in Belltown and downtown Seattle was just shy of $450,000, while in the Kirkland area, it was $369,500.
Condo prices in two more areas — Ballard/Green Lake/Greenwood and Redmond-Carnation — are within 5 percent of catching up to their previous peaks.
But in 16 submarkets, condo prices are still more than 20 percent below the peak.
“There was clearly some overbuilding (during the boom),” said Perlman, the real-estate consultant. “It's just going to take a little more time for that excess inventory to be absorbed.”
In the second quarter, the region's largest condominium submarket, Belltown-Downtown Seattle, saw the average price of units sold increase 18 percent annually to $576,368.
Central Seattle — which includes Capitol Hill, Eastlake and the Central Area — posted the largest annual gain among the major condo submarkets, with the average price rising 24 percent to $391,559.
Condo sales were most brisk in the Kirkland area, up 32 percent over the year. The average price of condos sold was $489,110, up 14 percent over the year. Sales cooled in the Queen Anne-Magnolia area, where the average price of sold condos was $349,071, down 2 percent over the year.
Bellevue west of I-405 saw the steepest price drop among submarkets with at least 10 condo sales on average a month. The average price fell 6 percent over the year to $501,194.

Montreal's controversial pit bull regulation once again has teeth.
The Quebec Court of Appeal ruled Thursday in the city's favour, revoking the suspension of its new animal-control law that prevents people from buying or adopting pit-bull-type dogs not already in their possession, and requires existing owners to leash and muzzle them outdoors and buy a special $150 permit. They also must be supervised by someone 18 or older.
The city said the changes are in effect now, although the permits are not required immediately. “We're happy with the decision,” Mayor Denis Coderre said in a statement. “It's an important victory that proves the soundness of the regulation.”
Parts of the law, adopted in September after a fatal dog attack in June, were suspended Oct. 5 by Superior Court Judge Louis Gouin after the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals challenged it in court.
The SPCA maintained the measures were too vague and arbitrary and would lead to the abandonment and euthanization of many dogs with no possibility of being placed. It said Thursday it was disappointed by the verdict and vowed to continue its efforts to fight “the discriminatory and punitive provisions.”

“Not being able to find homes for healthy, adoptable and behaviourally-sound dogs and puppies goes against the very essence of what our organization stands for,” said Alanna Devine, director of animal advocacy for the Montreal SPCA.
The Court of Appeal said Judge Gouin's ruling did not give sufficient weight to the argument the regulations were for the public good. Public interest must take precedence over anxiety an animal may feel when forced to wear a muzzle outside, the court said, and requiring a special permit was “a simple administrative formality,” not an “irreparable prejudice.”
But the appeal court also said the city must honour its pledge not to order the euthanization of any type of dog not specifically designated as dangerous, risky, stray, dying, badly injured or highly contagious, until Superior Court issues a final judgment that will clarify the legality of the law and some of its contested wording, notably the terms “competent authority,” “risky dog,” “dangerous dog,” “pit-bull-type dog” and “shelter.”
The guardians of pit-bull-type dogs also will be allowed, for now, to reclaim them from shelters, as long as they're not proven dangerous, and the dogs can be sent to shelters or adopted by people living outside the City of Montreal.
Coderre has staunchly maintained the new regulations as necessary for public safety. “We will not compromise when it comes to the safety of our fellow Montrealers,” they said.
In the streets of downtown Montreal on Thursday, dog owners expressed mixed feelings about the bylaw.
Kevin Gagnon, owner of a Miniature Pinscher named Mia, said “it comes down to the owner. I have a couple of friends who have ‘pit-bull-type dogs', and they're great owners and there are never any issues. If the breed is predisposed to being aggressive then I'm assuming that (aggression) comes out. I don't know. It's hard to generalize. But at the same time, you've got to control it. It's tough to call.”
Gagnon said they have not had any problems with bigger, so-called aggressive dogs, but “there's a Rottweiler that lives (in our apartment building), and when we've encountered it in the stairwell, I just go back downstairs and take the other stairwell because it looks like it wants to eat them But I've never had any issues.”
Sylvain Lalonde, owner of a 12-year-old Border Collie named Whiskey, said “I understand those that want to control them somehow, but I'm not sure that's the right way to go.”
Quintin Hellstrom, owner of a dog named Ben that is is part Labrador, is firmly against the pit-bull law. “It's the owner's fault if a dog's going to act out,” Hellstrom said. They feel the bylaw was an overreaction to the death of Christiane Vadnais. who died in June after they were attacked by an aggressive dog in their backyard. “After one incident you can't really just blame the whole breed for that.”
Humane Society International/Canada, in a statement, said it was “deeply saddened and disappointed” by the Court of Appeal ruling, but expressed hope it would be invalidated after further scrutiny by the courts. It said Montreal's bylaw “makes it impossible to identify” a pit-bull-type dog, putting all large dogs at risk of being seized and euthanized “at the discretion of bylaw officers.”
“Our elected officials are using fear-mongering and hysteria to target harmless animals. If you look at the science, breed-specific legislation does nothing to make communities safer, and causes immense hardship to animals and people,” said Ewa Demianowicz, campaign manager for the group.
Projet Montréal's animal-control spokesperson Sterling Downey said the decision “changes nothing about the fact the law on animal management in the city is inapplicable and will not reduce the number of bites.” They said it also “risks causing even more confusion for dog owners.”
Image caption The heavy rains in Tanzania are set to continue
At least 20 people have died in floods after unusually heavy rains hit Tanzania's main city of Dar es Salaam.
The Tanzania Meteorological Agency (TMA) has warned that the downpours are set to continue and has told those living in the city's valleys to move.
The BBC's Aboubakar Famau in Dar es Salaam says the city's business activities have come to a standstill.
Several main roads that link the centre to the suburbs are flooded and some bridges have been destroyed.
Refusing to move
Everywhere is flooded, people are on top of their house roofs Shaaban Ramadhan Hussein, Flood victim
According to TMA, these are the heaviest rains Tanzania has experienced since independence in 1961.
Hundreds of people living in the city's valleys have been left homeless.
Taabu Kibwa said their whole house was covered by water.
"We have lost all our properties, in fact we are left with empty hands. Everything in the house has been lost including television sets and refrigerators," they told the BBC.
"I have three children, one of whom I don't even know where they are."
Another resident, Shaaban Ramadhan Hussein, said they worked and lived in their home which was now underwater.
"Everywhere is flooded, people are on top of their house roofs, no rescue has come so far. We are not happy, it is like the government doesn't care about us," they said.
Image caption The government has set up centres to temporarily accommodate people made homeless
Our correspondent says the floods seem to have caught many by surprise, yet it was only a few days ago that the Tanzania Meteorological Agency warned of possible devastation by heavy rains.
The police commander for Dar es Salaam, Suleiman Kova, has urged people to leave the valleys, but they said some residents were refusing.
"We went [to] rescue some and they then refused to vacate saying they are keeping an eye on their properties," they said.
Our correspondent says the government has set up 12 centres to temporarily accommodate an estimated 5,000 people displaced by the floods.
There is little chance of them relocating to their home villages or regions before the festive season because the weather agency has cautioned that the rains are not going away, they say.
"We have been having heavy rainfall the day before yesterday, yesterday and today - we will therefore have more floods," said Agness Kijazi, TMA's director.

Planned Parenthood has brought on a high-powered left-wing PR firm to handle the current crisis related to the abortion giant's complicity in the abortion after-market of freshly killed baby parts.
SKDKnickerbocker immediately sent out a note to media outlets asking them not to run footage provided by David Daleiden and their group, the Center for Medical Progress because the videos “violate patient confidentiality.”
The claim hardly holds water since no patients from Planned Parenthood abortion clinics have been shown and, though baby body parts have been shown, Planned Parenthood views them more than products than patients.
The claim can be viewed as typical PR lying, especially the kind practiced in Washington DC, especially of the sort practiced by senior members of the SKDKnickerbocker firm.
Managing Director Anita Dunn is well known as the White House communications director for Barack Obama who famously told a high school audience that their favorite philosophers were Mother Theresa of Calcutta and the murderous Chinese Communist leader Mao Tse Tung. Dunn is married to DC uber-lawyer Robert Bauer who failed in their attempt to the Department of Justice to prosecute conservative critics and to go after TV networks for running ads connecting Obama to radical bomber Bill Ayers.
The firm also features Managing Director Hilary Rosen who some believe was a Planned Parenthood mole when they were hired to advise the Susan G. Komen Foundation in 2012 when the foundation was trying to distance itself from Planned Parenthood.
Rosen is a longtime left wing operative in Washington DC. They helped found Rock the Vote, and was the longtime head of the Recording Industry of America, as well as political director of left-wing Huffington Post. As a CNN pundit, they famously said Mitt Romney's wife “never worked a day in their life.”
Inexplicably, Komen head Nancy Brinker hired Rosen in 2011 to “handle the left” as they tried to get their breast cancer foundation out of its sticky relationship with Planned Parenthood. At the same time, Rosen's firm SKDKnickerbocker was the PR and media agency of record for Planned Parenthood.
According to the book Planned Bullyhood published by ousted Komen senior marketing executive Karen Handel, and from an interview Handel gave to LifeNews, it appears that Rosen may have been playing a double-game, advising Komen but backchanneling to their company's other client Planned Parenthood.
The timeline demonstrates what some view as suspicious behavior on the part of Hilary Rosen.
December 8, 2011: Komen tells Rosen the decision had been made that they are going to stop funding Planned Parenthood.
December 16: Komen CEO Liz Thompson calls Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards with the news but “she already knows everything.” First week in January 2012: The story leaks out from a pro-life group that is privy to inside information. The story is quashed. Rosen tells Komen that Planned Parenthood is going to let the whole thing pass. In the words of LifeNews, “This turns out to be either a lie or an epic fail on Rosen's part…” January 23: Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz calls Komen CEO Nancy Brinker and urgently needs to talk with them Wasserman Schultz cancels the “urgent” call and reschedules for a week later, January 30. January 30: David Crary of the Associated Press calls Komen with the news he's doing a story about Komen and Planned Parenthood. This was the first inkling that Komen had that Planned Parenthood might be up to something. Rosen insists, “I don't think this is any big deal.” Wasserman Schultz calls Brinker and has detailed knowledge of what Komen was planning. The call is said to “get ugly.” January 31: The AP story breaks and a tsunami of bad PR hits the wholly unprepared Komen Foundation. Even with PR pro Rosen at their side, hired to handle the left, Komen soon becomes dangerously swamped. February 2: Against advice Nancy Brinker appears on an interview show with Andrea Mitchell who eviscerates them Handel believes Rosen did not even assist in the “murder boards” to prepare Brinker for the interview. February 2: Rosen retweets, “3 Komen execs resign, 50 lawmakers sign aggressive letter to women, & Bloomberg donates $250K to Planned Parenthood”, which is odd for someone supposedly trying to get good PR for their client Komen. February 3: Nancy Brinker, Komen CEO, announces their organization would continue funding Planned Parenthood and apologizes. February 3: Rosen retweets something from Nancy Pelosi, “When women speak out, women win — Komen decision to continue funding Planned Parenthood is a victory for women's health.” February 3: Rosen themselves Tweets, “Congrats to Susan G. Komen for the Cure. sgk.mn/w7MEZR No room for politics in fighting cancer.” This from the woman hired to help Komen get out of the culture wars.
All of this goes to demonstrate that Rosen and their colleagues will do practically anything to fight their enemies and that David Daleiden of the Center for Medical Progress may have drawn first blood they are nonetheless in for the fight of their young life.

As NATO moves to install a symbolic "rapid deployment" force near Russia's border and the Kremlin plans to rewrite its official military policy to explicitly define NATO as an adversary, the potential for a wider war may be looming.
President Barack Obama on Wednesday visited Estonia, a tiny Baltic member of NATO whose population is one-third ethnic Russian. They drove home the message that any further attempts by Moscow to destabilize neighboring countries on grounds of "protecting compatriots" would not be allowed.
In practical terms, Obama pledged to send more US air force personnel and aircraft to the Baltics, possibly to be stationed at Estonia's Amari Air Base. At the NATO summit in Wales later this week, the US will promote the idea of a 4,000-person "rapid response" force for Eastern Europe, to be deployed in several permanent "reception centers" scattered around the three NATO Baltic states and Poland.
Dangerous symbolism
Though these measures appear largely symbolic, they would have the impact of putting substantial numbers of US troops on the front line between NATO and Russia. Should any kind of unrest break out, US troops would be first in harm's way. Experts say that's needed to calm the heightened anxieties among Russia-adjacent alliance members over Moscow's heavy-handed methods of "protecting" Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine.
But the Russians claim these deployments would be a violation of the NATO-Russia Founding Act of 1997, which stressed that Russia and NATO do not consider each other to be adversaries, and NATO pledged not to forward-deploy significant Western forces into new NATO states that border on Russia.
"The US and NATO have changed a lot of facts in the past few years, and Russia has to react," argues Viktor Litovkin, a military expert with the official TASS news agency. "The US continues to sponsor [anti-Moscow] 'colored revolutions,'" in the post-Soviet neighborhood, "and NATO forces are drawing closer to our border."
The Kremlin's likely answer will be to make sweeping revisions to the country's official military policy, to clearly identify NATO as an adversary. That would likely be followed by redeployments of troops and air defenses from Russia's interior closer to Europe. It might also station greater numbers of Iskander short range missiles and other offensive weaponry in its Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad.
Russia's "military doctrine" is an actual document that identifies who Moscow sees as its potential foes, what future strategic challenges it perceives, and what methods the country's security forces will adopt to counter threats, or fight a war if necessary. The doctrine, last updated in 2010, called for major increases in defense spending. It warned about attempts by hostile powers to promote regime change in neighboring post-Soviet countries like Ukraine, worried that NATO might deploy more troops near Russia's borders, but stopped short of identifying the Western alliance as an adversary of Russia.
'A classic escalation spiral'
On Tuesday the deputy head of the Kremlin's Security Council, Mikhail Popov, promised that a rewrite would occur by year's end. They hinted that the key change would concern Russia's attitude to NATO in light of recent eastward movements of US and allied forces. "We consider that the defining factor in [Moscow's] relations with NATO will remain the unacceptability for Russia of the expansion plans of NATO's military infrastructure to our borders," they said.
"Everybody is using this situation in a classic escalation spiral," says Alexander Konovalov, president of the independent Institute of Strategic Assessments in Moscow. "The Baltic countries want NATO deployments on their soil. Even if it's just a small, symbolic number, it's a guarantee that NATO will become immediately involved if Russia attacks them. The US wants NATO to become stronger, and for European countries to spend more on defense, so this situation works well for Washington. And Russian nationalists love it, because it provides 'proof' of NATO's aggressive intentions."
"Hardliners on all sides are profiting from this crisis, and using it to change realities we all thought would be permanent. Even if the Ukraine crisis goes away tomorrow, it will leave a very different world behind," they add.

Cold war dynamics are rushing back, and the danger is that heated rhetoric and symbolic gestures of today can become tripwires for disaster tomorrow, experts say.
"The idea of revising of our military doctrine [to explicitly identify NATO as an adversary] reflects a deeply changing world reality," says Stanislav Belkovsky, head of the independent Institute of National Strategy and a frequent Kremlin critic. "Putin has given up on any hopes of reconciling with the West. So, we're making this turn to self-isolation and a tense new cold war situation, which at any point could erupt into hot war."
The idea of extra-terrestrial life forms fascinates some and terrifies others. And even though our search for ET never quite panned out, we never stopped looking.
However, could this all be about to change following the discovery of hundreds of exoplanets (planets outside our Solar System), and thousands of candidate exoplanetary systems, some of which might be habitable for life.
Speaking about these momentous discoveries at the Cambridge Science Festival on March 16, NASA's Dr Jennifer Wiseman will reveal how these exoplanets may provide evidence of biological activity, and discuss the profound invigoration of scientific and related religious and philosophical thought this might inspire if we find that life could thrive beyond Earth.
In a recent interview, Dr Wiseman said: “It's a very exciting time for astronomy; we are finding a plethora of planets around other stars, including some that may be similar to Earth in size and temperature. The question that humans have had for centuries – whether or not there are planets similar to our own around other stars – seems more and more to be best answered as, ‘Yes!'”
It is expected that there is at least one planet, on average, orbiting around each star in our Milky Way galaxy, resulting in hundreds of billions of exoplanets, some fraction of which are the size of Earth at similar distances from their parent stars as Earth is to the Sun. These staggering numbers mean there is a real possibility that we are on the verge of discovering our twin. If so, could this also mean the discovery of alien life forms similar to humans? And, what could this mean for humanity's self-image if we were to discover that we are not unique or alone in the universe?
As Senior Project Scientist for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and Director of the Dialogue on Science, Ethics and Religion for the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Dr Wiseman is uniquely placed to provide both insights into the latest developments in the search for inhabitable exoplanets, and reflections on philosophical and religious implications of finding life on another planet.
From identifying seismic wave activity and colour patterns on these other worlds, to the use of enormous telescopes that could potentially hunt for evidence of alien life by their atmospheres, astronomers are continuing to find new ways to look for that tantalising hint of life.
In January this year, astronomers announced the discovery of an Earth-like exoplanet candidate orbiting a star similar to our Sun in the ‘habitable zone' – the area around a star within which it is theoretically possible for water to exist on a planet's surface (and therefore also the possibility of supporting life). And in February, Harvard researchers identified three planets as 'objects of interest' - meaning they could also be potentially habitable.
Harvard astronomer and lead author Courtney Dressing, who presented the findings at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said: “We thought we would have to search vast distances to find an Earth-like planet. Now we realise another Earth is probably in our own backyard, waiting to be spotted.”
In addition, the World Economic Forum Global Risks report for 2013 states that, "Given the pace of space exploration, it is increasingly conceivable that we may discover the existence of alien life or other planets that could support human life. ... In 10 years' time, we may have evidence not only that Earth is not unique, but also that life exists elsewhere in the universe."
The report continued, “The discovery of even simple life would fuel speculation about the existence of other intelligent beings and challenge many assumptions that underpin human philosophy and religion.”
Professor Meric Srokosz, Associate Director of The Faraday Institute for Science and Religion, Cambridge (the organisers of the event) said: “This is a unique opportunity to hear a genuine expert in their field, and to learn and think about one of the questions that continues to fascinate: is there life out there in the universe?”

Astronomy by microscope – 6pm – 7.30pm, 12 March
The Open University, 12 Hills Road, CB2 1PF
Traditionally, astronomers study stars and planets by telescope. But we can also learn about them byusing a microscope – through studying meteorites. From meteorites, we can learn about the processes and materials that shaped the Solar System and our planet. Tiny grains within meteorites have come from other stars, giving information about the stellar neighbourhood in which the Sun was born. In their lecture, Professor Monica Grady will describe how the microscope is another tool that can be employed to trace stellar and planetary processes.

No. 6 Clemson rushes for six touchdowns in a 58-0 rout of Miami (FL), the Hurricanes' largest loss in school history. (1:04)
Miami hadn't even reached halftime of Saturday's historic 58-0 shellacking by No. 6 Clemson before a couple of former Hurricanes All-Americans were calling for embattled coach Al Golden to be fired on Twitter.
After the Hurricanes fell behind 21-0 in the first quarter, Warren Sapp, an All-American defensive tackle at Miami in 1994, criticized Golden in a couple of tweets.
Well the mascot leads US out of the smoke?, I guess it's their team. #AlGottaGo pic.twitter.com/BiAYEFSNOU — Warren Sapp (@WarrenSapp) October 24, 2015
Sapp also questioned Golden's sideline attire, which generally consists of a shirt and tie.
Why is Al the only coach on our sidelines without the U on Him? #SomebodyHelpMeWithThis — Warren Sapp (@WarrenSapp) October 24, 2015
Two-time All-American offensive tackle Bryant McKinnie chimed in that they had seen enough.
Time to head in a new direction as a program, enough is enough & I sat back & have been patient & quite long enough. — Bryant Mckinnie (@BryantMckinnie) October 24, 2015
Former Miami offensive lineman Leon Searcy, who was part of three national championship teams in 1987, '89 and '91, also criticized the Hurricanes' poor play against Clemson.
That face you make when Miami down 21-0 pic.twitter.com/6aPc2PRqaD — Leon Searcy (@leonsearcy72) October 24, 2015
Joaquin Gonzalez, another former Hurricanes offensive lineman, also tweeted criticism toward Golden.
I'm so embarrassed! @CanesAllAccess I would take their headset at halftime!! Do not wait until end of season, make a statement dammit!!!!! — Joaquin Gonzalez (@Joaquin_UMOL73) October 24, 2015
The Hurricanes trailed 42-0 at halftime Saturday after losing starting quarterback Brad Kaaya to a head injury in the second quarter.
Golden, who has a 32-24 record in their four-plus seasons at the school, has been under increasing criticism as attendance has dwindled at Miami's home games. Since starting 3-0, the Hurricanes dropped consecutive road games against Cincinnati and Florida State earlier this month.
After Saturday's loss, Golden said they aren't worried about their job security or outside chatter about it.
"We'll see how mentally tough we are. We'll see how close we are," Golden said. "We've played one division opponent. There's a lot of football left in our division, and that's where our focus needs to be.
"Our focus doesn't need to be on the outside. We need to fix the things we need to fix and move forward quickly. That's my responsibility."
Miami athletic director Blake James has said they would wait until the end of the season to evaluate Golden's future. On Saturday, James expressed disappointment with the blowout."
"We are all disappointed with today's outcome. Any one who loves Miami is disappointed," James told ESPN.com via text. "But we have another game next week and we need to make sure we continue to support our team."
More than a few airplane banners calling for Golden's firing have been flown above Sun Life Stadium this season, including another on Saturday.

Two weeks ago I was in the midst of a nightmare. I'd forgotten a password. Not just any password. THE password. Without this one password I was cryptographically locked out of thousands and gigabytes worth of files I care about. Highly sensitive and valuable files that include work documents, personal projects, photos, code snippets, notes, family stuff, etc. The password in question unlocks these files from the protection of locally stored AES-256 encrypted disk image. A location where an “email me a password reset link” is not an option. File backups? Of course! Encrypted the same way with the same password. Password paper backup? Nope. I'll get to that. I somehow needed to “crack” this password. If not, the amount of epic self-pwnage would be too horrible to imagine.
Before sharing how I got myself into this predicament, it's necessary to reveal some details about my personal computer security habits. More specifics than I'm normally comfortable sharing.
As my badge wall shows, I travel a lot, all around the world, and often with the same laptop. A MacBook Pro. My computer becoming lost, stolen, or imaged by border guards and other law enforcement officers is a constant concern. To protect against these potential physical attacks, OS X dutifully offers FileVault.
FileVault is a full disk encryption feature utilizing XTS-AES 128 crypto. Enabling FileVault means that even if someone has physical possession of my computer, or obtains a full copy of the hard drive, they'd be the proud new owner of a cutting-edge machine, but unable to get any useful data off of it. That is unless my admin password, which unlocks FileVault, is ridiculously simple, and it isn't. By all practical means, “cracking” this password is impossible.
What is possible is law enforcement, or a robber, forcibly stopping me and “asking” for my admin password, a method capable of defeating FileVault's full disk encryption. Realistically, while my brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt certainly helps in many situations, it can be utterly useless in other real-world encounters. I'll of course resist giving up my admin password to the extent I'm able, but must assume I may have to “comply” at some point. If this should happen, ideally my data, other than email, should remain safe even after the adversary lands on my desktop.
Setting up this type of layered security fall-back plan is where we return to the conversation of encrypted disk images. On OS X, Disk Utility can be used to create encrypted disk images called DMGs. DMGs are self-contained portable files, of customizable size, that when mounted (i.e. double-clicked) display on the desktop like any other disk drive where files can be stored.
Upon creation of DMGs the level of encryption strength can be set, the highest being AES-256. If FileVault's AES-128 crypto is already “impossible” to crack, AES-256 DMGs are exponentially more impossible. To ensure this, all you have to do is set a reasonable password. We're talking even 6 characters or longer, some upper and lower case, and maybe toss in a digit and special character. DON'T SAVE THE PASSWORD IN YOUR KEYCHAIN. Doing so defeats the entire purpose of what we're trying to accomplish, because the admin password unlocks the keychain.
A great thing about DMGs is that they can be stored anywhere. Hidden in some obscure directory on the local machine, a network storage device, a USB drive, whatever. All my confidential files are typically stored this way, in a series of encrypted DMGs with separate passwords. Also very important, DMGs containing sensitives files are only mounted on an as-needed basis. This is for two reasons:
If I must hand over my admin password, the person now on the desktop should still have a difficult time learning these disk images exist and a password is required to open them. As they begin to snoop around, image the drive, run forensics, etc., they should feel they have the keys to the kingdom. If they do manage to find the DMGs, hopefully by then I'm on my way and seeking legal help. Should my computer get “hacked,” a remote attacker will find it extremely difficult to transfer out many many gigabytes worth of data as a single DMG file before being noticed, the computer loses its connection to the Internet, or the image is unmounted.
What's also cool is a DMG can be used to store additional account passwords, flat file style. Passwords, which can be made super strong and don't have to be committed to memory. Simply copy-paste as necessary. This FileValue / DMG setup makes it very convenient to only have to remember a small hand full of passwords, including the admin password, to access everything important and without sacrificing security. Well, convenient up until the point where you forget a DMG password. In my case, caused by my scheduled ritual of “change all my passwords.” Ugh!
I wake up once upon a recent morning and begin my daily routine. Check calendar. Check email. Checks RSS. Check Twitter. Start working, start reading. As is common, I mount a DMG and am greeted by the familiar password dialog. First password attempt, fail. Second attempt, fail. Third attempt, fail. Warning dialog appears. That's weird, I thought. Normally I'm a proficient touch typist. Am I'm fat-fingering the password? Three strikes and I'm out again.
Annoyed, but not concerned. Check the caps lock key. Nope. Try the password again. Fail, fail, fail. Fail, fail, fail. Rinse, repeat several more times. WTF! Am I at least trying to type the correct password for the DMG? I believe so. Let me try a few “shouldn't work passwords” just in case Morning Brain is causing problems. A few dozen password fails later, annoyance begins constricting into panic. It's OK, consoling myself, I'll come back to this in a little while. It'll be fine. I have some non-DMG-required work to complete anyway.
An hour later, I repeated the same password attempt cycle. No dice. The password fails mounting up are now in the hundreds. I start to mouth some obscenities and my keyboard is really not liking the pounding. My wife is beginning to eyeball me with concern. I'm running out of ideas of what that problem could be. That's about when I recalled recently changing all my passwords. A few moment laters, that's when it hit me, like really hit me. For whatever reason, I'd forgotten what I changed the password to. *Gulp*. Oh, no!
Think positive, think optimistic. Keep calm. Carry on. It'll come to me. I've never forgotten these passwords before. I even remember most of it. At least, I think I do.
I'm periodically trying different passwords throughout the day, throughout out the evening. One day turns into two, two into three. All like the first. Only now I'm losing sleep. I'm waking up in the middle of the night and have to try a few more passwords just so I can get back to sleep. For those who don't know, dreaming of password combinations sucks. What also sucks is without access to this DMG, more specifically the work documents within it, my daily productivity plummets.
Finally, after nearly a week I have to admit to myself, I forgot it. That I'm in trouble. Time for Plan B. Google.
I begin searching around for DMG password cracking tools. My thought is since I have a partial password, I should be fine. Most of the results pages are littered with people responding by cracking jokes when asked about cracking DMG AES crypto. That's not very encouraging. Then I come across something called crowbarDMG, which is basically a GUI for command:
>$ hdiutil attach -passphrase <passphrase> DiskImage.dmg
hdiutil locks a DMG file when attempting to mount it, so crowbarDMG runs single threaded, which essentially means a cracking speed of 1 password c/s. Yeah, slow. For my particular circumstance, this was fine. I figured I was only missing between 1 – 3 characters of the password anyway. A day of cracking, maybe two, and I'd be back in business. It was not to be. Then my fuzzy memory suggested I might be missing as much as 6 characters. If that be the case, by sheer math, at least multiple decades worth of cracking would be necessary at current speed. Time for Plan C. Twitter.
Having ~15,000 followers interested in computer security has its perks. Through the years I've come to expect a good percentage of them have a stinging sense of humor. Similar to the Google search, 99% of the responses received were sarcastic. This included one such retort from a friend who works in law enforcement computer forensics. I'm sure some tweets were funny, but I was in no laughing mood. I was freaked. A sense of futility and finality was setting in.
That was until Solar Designer, gat3way, Dhiru Kholia, and Magnum, the guys behind the infamous John the Ripper (JtR) password cracker answered my plea. Then Jeremi Gosney of Stricture Consulting Group graciously offered up the use of their mega hash cracking computing resources as well. You remember Stricture from their Ars article, they have an insane “25-GPU cluster cracks every standard Windows password in < 6 hours.” Collectively, these guys are the amongst the world's foremost experts in password cracking. If they can't help, no one can. No joking around, they immediately dove right in.
Now, I couldn't just share out my DMG for others to attempt to crack. Its enormous size basically precluded that. But even if I could, I wouldn't. Given the sensitive nature of the data, I actually preferred the data lost than suffer any risk of a leak. Fortunately, JtR has something called dmg2john. dmg2john scrapes the DMG and provides output which can be cracked with JtR by others without putting the data at risk. Nice! Unfortunately, when I got there, dmg2john and JtR were broken when it came to DMGs. I provided the bug details to john-dev and john-users mailing list to replicate. The JtR developers had the issues fixed in a couple days. These guys are awesome.
Next step, send the dmg2john output of my DMG over to Jeremi at Stricture along with everything I think I remember about what my password might have been. Jeremi informs me of the next challenge, he's only able to crack my DMG at a speed of ~100 c/s! At that rate it's going to take a little over a decade worth of cracking to exhaust the password key space. I'm thinking this is very odd, it's only maybe 6 extra characters tops. Jeremi explains why…
The reason it's so slow is because your AES256-encrypted DMG uses 250,000 rounds of PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-1 to generate the encryption key. The ludicrous round count makes it extremely computationally expensive, slowing down the HMAC-SHA1 process by a factor of 250,000. My Xeon X7350 can crack a single round of HMAC-SHA1 at a rate of 9.3 million hashes per second. But since we are using 250,000 rounds, it means I was reduced to doing ~ 37 hashes per second. Using all four processors I was only able to pull about 104 hashes per second total (doesn't scale perfectly.)
Once understanding this, Jeremi begins asking for more information about what the extra six or so characters in my password might have been. We're they all upper and lower case characters? What about digits? Any special characters? Which characters were most likely used, or not used? Ever bit of intel helped a lot. We managed to whittle down an in initial 41106759720 possible password combinations to 22472. This meant the total amount of time required to crack the DMG was reduced to 3.5 minutes on their rig.
Subsequently, Jeremi sent me what had to be one the most relieving and frightening emails I've ever received in my life. Relieving because I recognized the password immediately upon sight. I knew it was right, but my anxiety level remained at 10 until typing it in and seeing it work. I hadn't touched my precious data in weeks! It was a tender moment, but also frightening because, well, no security professional is ever comfortable seeing such a prized password emailed to them from someone else. When/if that happens, it typically means you are hacked and another pain awaits.
Interestingly, in living out this nightmare, I learned A LOT I didn't know about password cracking, storage, and complexity. I've come to appreciate why password storage is ever so much more important than password complexity. If you don't know how your password is stored, then all you really can depend upon is complexity. This might be common knowledge to password and crypto pros, but for the average InfoSec or Web Security expert, I highly doubt it.
Now, after telling everyone a few of my best tricks and enduring an awful deficiency in one of them, I'll obviously have to change things up a bit. Clearly I need paper backup, and thinking maybe about giving it to my attorney for safekeeping where it'll enjoy legal privilege protection. We'll see.
In the meantime, I can't thank the John the Ripper guys and Jeremi from Stricture Consulting enough. If you need a password cracked, for personal and professional reasons, this is where you look to.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) said on Monday it will move production of large, gas-powered engines to Canada from Wisconsin, along with 350 jobs, to access export financing no longer available in the United States.

In its latest salvo aimed at persuading Congress to renew the U.S. Export-Import Bank's charter which expired in June, GE will invest $265 million in a new state-of-the-art manufacturing plant at a Canadian location yet to be determined.
The facility, to open in about 20 months, can be expanded to provide flexible manufacturing capacity to support other GE businesses, including engines for railroad locomotives, GE said.
In exchange for moving the production from Waukesha, Wisconsin, Export Development Canada will provide financing support for a range of future products, including some still made in the United States.
These are expected to come from GE's Water & Power, Oil & Gas and Transportation units, a GE spokesperson said.
At the 106-year-old Waukesha plant, GE builds piston engines for power and oilfield use that run on natural gas or methane from landfills. But these engines are not typically sold with EXIM financing, so the move is more aimed at finding government export credit for other businesses, the GE spokesperson said.
The company also acknowledged that the recent downturn in oil and gas drilling activity was a factor in the decision to end engine manufacturing in Waukesha.
The announcement stands in sharp contrast to a 2014 visit to the site by President Barack Obama, in which they touted its worker training program as “a model for the country.”
“I'd say the workers at Waukesha are the real world casualties in the right-wing fight to close the EXIM Bank,” said Frank Larkin, a spokesperson for the International Association of Machinists, which represents plant workers.
Republican Representative James Sensenbrenner, who represents Waukesha and opposes EXIM “in its current form,” said in a statement that the move was a “sober reminder of the urgent need to stay competitive in the global marketplace” and called for lower corporate tax rates.
In recent weeks, GE has announced several deals to locate thousands of new jobs out of the United States following EXIM's closure and to access government export credit from the United Kingdom, France, Hungary and China.
GE Vice Chairman John Rice told Reuters that foreign export credit agencies are “rolling out the red carpet” for the industrial conglomerate, more than tripling the export financing capacity it received under EXIM.

Iraq's Defense Ministry said Friday it was not informed when Russia launched more than two dozen cruise missiles across its airspace this week, and it described the lack of coordination in the region's increasingly cluttered skies as “dangerous.”
U.S. officials have also said they were given no notification before Russia fired the volley of 26 cruise missiles, which traveled nearly 1,000 miles across Iran and Iraq and into Syria from warships in the Caspian Sea — despite the ongoing presence of U.S.-led coalition jets in the airspace.

The revelations underline a hazardous lack of coordination of air assets in the skies above Iraq and Syria — one that threatens to complicate the coalition's campaign against Islamic State militants in the region. The Pentagon said this week that coalition planes have had to be rerouted to avoid collisions with Russian jets.
“Iraq didn't have any idea about those missiles,” said Brig. Gen. Tahseen Ibrahim, a spokesperson for the Iraqi Defense Ministry. “We have coalition forces' air power in the air, our planes in the air, transportation. This is dangerous.”
Ibrahim said Iraq would launch an investigation and raise concerns with Russia.
The incident occurred as Baghdad appears to be looking to expand cooperation with Moscow and just two weeks after the announcement of an intelligence-sharing deal between Russia, Iraq, Iran and Syria.
However, Ibrahim said, the coordination center at the heart of that deal is not yet fully functioning, which is why the information was not shared. The lack of notification about Russia's cruise missiles was the main focus of discussions when Gen. John R. Allen, the retired U.S. officer in charge of the international coalition to counter the Islamic State, visited the Iraqi Defense Ministry on Thursday, Ibrahim said.

Asked about coordination with the Iraqi military, a spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry directed a reporter to the Defense Ministry, which did not respond to telephone calls or faxes Friday afternoon. Dmitry Peskov, the spokesperson for President Vladimir Putin, also did not return calls from The Washington Post. The Russian media have reported that coordination had taken place with both Iran and Iraq.
The long-range Kalibr cruise missiles are new to the Russian arsenal. “If you pre-plot the route, it's still going to have some degree of maneuverability,” said Ben Moores, a defense analyst with IHS Janes in London. “I suspect the weapons have the capability to go around things.”
Still, several of the cruise missiles fired from Russian ships at targets in Syria on Wednesday crashed in Iran, according to Pentagon officials.

Peskov told a group of reporters Friday that the Kremlin would not comment on reports that some cruise missiles had fallen short of their targets.
“It is not important how the Kremlin takes this; it is important how Iran takes this, and Iran has refuted this,” Peskov said during a conference call.

There has been speculation that Russia will expand its airstrikes to Iraq after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said they would welcome such a move. However, the Iraqi government has not submitted a formal request along these lines, Russian and Iraqi officials have said.
That move would likely be opposed by Washington, which is still attempting to “deconflict” its operations in Syria from those of the Russians.
“Any additional air activity in the skies over Iraq or Syria increases the possibility of an air mishap,” said Army Col. Steve Warren, a spokesperson for the U.S. military in Baghdad. “This is why we had a discussion with Russia about safety procedures. We have presented a proposal about safety to the Russians, and they have not yet responded.”

Today's coverage from Post correspondents around the world
In the days before President Donald Trump's high-profile address to Congress Tuesday night, White House aides insisted that Trump would soon propose one of the biggest increases to the Pentagon budget in years. The problem is they've been using woefully misleading numbers.
Administration officials have spent days telling reporters that Trump would call for increasing defense spending by an eye-popping $54 billion — a sum that would be particularly striking given that the US has largely wound down the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It would be, as Trump said before the speech, “historic.”
The president repeated that boast during their primetime address, telling the nation that they would be sending Congress a budget “that rebuilds the military” and “calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.”
Here's the thing: Trump's proposed budget wouldn't do that. The actual increase is closer to $18 billion, not the $54 billion figure bandied about by the president's aides. Eagle-eyed defense hawks such as Arizona Republican John McCain have noticed the discrepancy, and they're not happy.
“President Trump intends to submit a defense budget that is a mere 3 percent above President Obama's defense budget, which has left our military underfunded, undersized, and unready to confront threats to our national security,” McCain said in a statement Monday. “With a world on fire, America cannot secure peace through strength with just 3 percent more than President Obama's budget. We can and must do better.”
Understanding McCain's anger means understanding the government's byzantine and sometimes baffling way of allocating money for national security. For help deciphering it all, I turned to Mark Cancian, a highly regarded Pentagon budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
“These numbers were intentionally misleading,” they told me. “The increase is dramatic, but nowhere near as dramatic as people had been expecting — or hoping for.”
Trump's magical Pentagon math
Talking to reporters Monday, Trump's OMB head, Mick Mulvaney, said the administration's fiscal year 2018 budget would include $603 billion in defense spending. That sounds like, and would be, a lot of money.
The first problem is that the comment was interpreted as referring to money literally and exclusively going to the Pentagon. That's wrong: The figure also includes defense-related spending at other agencies, like the Department of Energy, which manages the nation's nuclear arsenal.
The second and bigger problem is that the White House was making an apples-to-oranges comparison in terms of how the increase was actually being calculated.
At first glance, Trump's math makes sense. The Budget Control Act of 2011 capped spending for the Pentagon, the Department of Energy, and assorted other national security agencies at $549 billion in 2018. Trump is proposing spending $603 billion in 2018 on those agencies. The difference between the two numbers is the purported $54 billion increase that the president and their aides have been trumpeting for days.
The problem is that Trump and their aides are comparing the wrong figures. Obama themselves had called for blowing past the congressional spending caps and spending a total of $585 billion on national security, including $557 billion for the Pentagon and $28 billion for the Department of Energy and other related agencies. The actual difference between what Obama had projected spending and what Trump is now proposing is just $18 billion. That, Cancian notes, “is what John McCain is so angry.”
“It's a much smaller increase than people first thought,” they added.
It's not the only reason McCain may be skeptical about Trump's budget blueprint. OMB head Mulvaney is a former Republican Congress member from South Carolina. In the past, he's voted to cut billions from the defense budget and voiced skepticism about the enormous amounts of money the Pentagon receives every year. McCain voted against their confirmation as a result.
The Pentagon is so big that an extra $18 billion isn't all that much
For almost any other part of the government, an influx of $18 billion would be cause to bust out the champagne. The State Department, for instance, has an annual budget of $50 billion — and Trump has talked about cutting 30 percent of that money to help pay for the new defense spending (a proposal that Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Tuesday would be “dead on arrival”).
But the Pentagon isn't like most other parts of the government. For the Defense Department, $18 billion is an almost literal drop in the bucket.
Cancian said the Army alone has drafted a wish list for next year that amounts to $18 billion. Now the service will be lucky to get even a quarter of that money.
The relatively small size of Trump's increase could also spell bad news for the Navy, which Trump has talked about expanding from 274 ships to 350, the largest buildup since the end of the Cold War. In a conference call Monday, an administration official said the money would go to new shipbuilding efforts and establishing a “more robust presence in key international waterways” like the Strait of Hormuz and the South China Sea.
Here, too, the problem comes down to dollars and cents. A report in the Hill last month noted that expanding the Navy's fleet so dramatically wouldn't come cheap. Experts quoted by the newspaper said it could cost as much as $165 billion over the next 30 years solely to purchase the new ships, submarines, and other boats. Maintenance and spare parts would cost even more. An extra few billion dollars would barely be a down payment.
The Navy wants a lot of new ships. It's not clear Trump is ready to pay for them.
To be fair, Cancian noted that Trump will release a fuller budget proposal this spring that could call for massively increased spending for the Navy in the years ahead.
If so, that would be a major win for the Navy — and for Steve Bannon, Trump's chief White House strategist. Bannon, who was recently given a permanent seat on the National Security Council, is a former Navy officer who believes war with China over its presence in the South China Sea is inevitable.
Beijing has spent the past several years building military bases — complete with airstrips, radar arrays, and advanced anti-aircraft weaponry — on a string of artificial islands. That, to Bannon, is part of a series of unacceptable actions by Beijing that Washington shouldn't idly accept.
“We're going to war in the South China Sea in five to 10 years,” Bannon said in March 2016. “There's no doubt about that. They're taking their sandbars and making basically stationary aircraft carriers and putting missiles on those. They come here to the United States in front of our face — and you understand how important face is — and say it's an ancient territorial sea.”
That rhetoric, unsurprisingly, hasn't gone over well in Beijing. According to the Guardian, the Chinese military issued a hard-edged statement on the day of Trump's inauguration that warned about the prospect of war between the two countries.
“A ‘war within the president's term' or ‘war breaking out tonight' are not just slogans, they are becoming a practical reality,” an official wrote on the website of the People's Liberation Army, according to the Guardian.
Still, Trump's proposed buildup may not set off the kind of arms race with Beijing that you might expect. The reason, though, isn't particularly reassuring.
“They are building up so rapidly that it is hard to believe that anything we do could cause them to build even more rapidly,” Cancian said.

“I don't think that I will be running for city council. While I don't like what Alex Wan did with Cheshire Bridge, I hope they understand now that adult/LGBT entertainment is important for the development of any city,” Morrison told GA Voice today.
“My run would purely have been to make the statement that Atlanta, the home of the civil rights movement, should also include tolerance of lifestyle choices as well,” they said.
Morrison added they were in talks with Atlanta gay nightlife promoter Chris Coleman about creating an “LGBT voting bloc.”
“The LGBT community really needs to vote as one body to create real power for itself. I think that is a message that we all need to get behind,” they said.
Morrison has also said they and other business owners talked about backing a candidate to run against Wan if one stepped forward. However, Morrison said today Wan is expected to meet soon with the Cheshire Bridge Business Association and they want to hear what they have to say.
“The adult business owners want to take a wait and see attitude. Alex Wan is supposed to meet with the Cheshire Bridge Business Association so we'd like to hear what they say. I think Alex could be very could for the district but they need to understand that we are part of the district too,” Morrison said. “Even if they were elected, we could always pick a candidate in the next election 2.5 years out.”
Morrison talked about their possible run because they were angry with what they said was Wan pushing their personal moral values onto the city. Wan's legislation was amended several times before they decided to only target adult businesses to be outlawed from Cheshire Bridge Road.
“We're a permanent part of the landscape,”Morrison said of adult businesses two weeks ago. “He was able to take their personal views and push forward this legislation — that is not going to happen in this election.”
Wan's proposed legislation, which failed to be approved by the full city council on June 3, would have repealed the grandfather clause that allowed adult businesses to stay open along the popular thoroughfare, dubbed by many as Atlanta's red-light district.
Several business owners and developers spoke out against Wan's legislation, arguing the proposed rezoning basically was a property rights issue and they promised to take the city to court.
People living in the neighborhood surrounding the thoroughfare and supportive of the legislation, however, complain of the seediness and blight the sex clubs and porn stores bring to the area and, they say, impedes greater development of the area.

Amid their low standing in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is set to outline their vision for LGBT rights in a speech Friday that seeks to galvanize the progressive base.
The Washington Blade obtained from their campaign prepared remarks the candidate intends to make at the Iowa Spirit Awards in Des Moines, an event hosted by Iowa Safe Schools that celebrates LGBT youth and educators in the early caucus state.
“I am proud to say that we are finally — and rightfully — having a real debate about how to ensure equality for all LGBTQ Americans, in every part of public life,” O'Malley says. “But as you know, we owe you more than words. We owe you action.”
O'Malley's speech has two major components: Touting their record on LGBT rights and laying out their plan for the future with a strong emphasis on anti-bullying efforts and federal non-discrimination protections.
The candidate recalls as mayor of Baltimore signing the state's first transgender non-discrimination ordinance and in 2014 adding transgender protections to the state's civil rights law. But O'Malley adds “what I'm most proud of is standing up for marriage equality as a human right.”
“And almost exactly three years ago today, we won that fight — becoming the first state to successfully defend marriage equality at the ballot box,” O'Malley says.
Critics of O'Malley on LGBT issues say they aren't on board with marriage equality until later during their tenure as governor and initially favored civil unions at a time when LGBT advocates were pushing for full marriage rights.
On the issue of bullying, O'Malley invokes statistics on the challenges faced by LGBT students and says “often the most frequent victims of bullying are transgender kids.” The candidate pledges to require all schools to implement anti-bullying policies and to face penalties when they don't provide safe environments.
“Schools that allow for unlawful discrimination should risk losing federal funding — and students who experience harassment, bullying, intimidation, and violence should have a legal cause of action under the law,” they say.
O'Malley will deliver the speech following news a panel on the Republican-controlled state legislature would investigate the host organization of the event for teaching LGBT youth about safe-sex practices. The candidate rejects the effort as a “witch hunt.”
“The leaders of Iowa Safe Schools came together to educate students and teachers,” O'Malley says. “They joined hands to promote diversity, equality, and social justice. And now, they're being attacked for trying to make Iowa a more welcoming and inclusive place. In a nation where all of us are entitled to equal rights and protections, this cannot be tolerated.”
On the federal non-discrimination protections, O'Malley takes note they were the first presidential candidate to endorse the Equality Act, saying “first and foremost we must fight” to pass the legislation.
“I was proud to be the first presidential candidate to endorse this critical legislation because I saw how important our comprehensive non-discrimination legislation had been in Maryland,” O'Malley says. “It is time to end discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations and education, credit and more as a nation once and for all.”
O'Malley also decries the recent wave of anti-transgender violence, the treatment of LGBT undocumented immigrants in detention and the high rate of LGBT homeless youth. Among their other pledges are improving the Runaway & Homeless Youth Act to include LGBT youth, eliminating abstinence-only sex education programs, banning “ex-gay” conversion therapy, ending immigration detention and repealing HIV criminalization laws.
Following a dispute that erupted last week after Hillary Clinton called the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act a “defensive” act against worse discrimination and Bernard Sanders criticized them for rewriting history, O'Malley seeks to rise above the disagreement.
“The other candidates might talk about who supported DOMA when – but I'm talking about what we must do, together, tomorrow,” O'Malley said.
But in the very next line, O'Malley makes a veiled criticism of the candidates for their histories, saying he's “actually gone to the mat for LGBTQ rights.”
“I didn't just believe in marriage equality, I achieved marriage equality,” O'Malley said. “And when I tell you today that we need to provide better and more equitable healthcare to our transgender neighbors, that we must fight for the Equality Act – it's because I've done it, as an executive, and I know that it is necessary and that it is possible.”
The candidate faces an uphill battle in winning the Democratic nomination — let alone the White House in 2016. Many national polls indicate O'Malley has support from 1 percent of Democrats, although polls for the Iowa caucuses alone peg them slightly higher at around 3 percent.
O'Malley seems to acknowledge the challenge of their campaign toward the end of their remarks, describing the “tough fight” ahead for progressive values at large in a way that could easily reflect their presidential aspirations.
“I kind of like the tough fights,” they said. “I've always been drawn to the tough fights. Perhaps the toughness of the fight is the way the hidden God has of telling us we are fighting for something worth saving. The American Dream is worth saving. Our children's future is worth saving. Our country is worth saving. It's time to join the fight. Together, you and I can and will rebuild the American Dream.”

As part of Mormon Stories Book Club, today Heather Olson Beal and I discuss Ryan's book “Elders,” which is the story of two young Mormon missionaries in Brazil and their tense, peculiar friendship. Elder McLeod—outspoken, surly, a brash American—is nearing the end of their mission. For nearly two years they have spent their days studying the Bible and the Book of Mormon, knocking on doors, teaching missionary lessons—“experimenting on the word.” Their new partner is Elder Passos, a devout, ambitious Brazilian who found salvation and solace in the church after their mother's early death. The two men are at first suspicious of each other, and their work together is frustrating, fruitless. That changes when a beautiful woman and their husband offer the missionaries a chance to be heard, to put all of their practice to good use, to test the mettle of their faith. But before they can bring the couple to baptism, they must confront their own long-held beliefs and doubts, and the simmering tensions at the heart of their friendship.
A novel of unsparing honesty and beauty, Elders announces Ryan McIlvain as a writer of enormous talent.

LAS VEGAS, NV - JULY 25: Karl Roberson prepares to enter the Octagon before facing Ryan Spann in their light heavyweight bout during Dana White's Tuesday Night Contender Series at the TUF Gym on July 25, 2017 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Brandon Magnus/DWTNCS)
Coming off of their 15-second KO win on Dana White's Tuesday Night Contender Series, Karl Roberson set to make their UFC debut against Darren Stewart at UFC Fight Night 120 in November.
When speaking to FanSided MMA, Karl Roberson said they were looking at MSG or Virginia for their UFC debut. As much as they wanted to debut at ‘The World's Most Famous Arena', Roberson will settle for the latter.
It was announced during the UFC Fight Night 114 broadcast on Saturday night that “Baby K” will make their UFC debut on Nov. 11 at UFC Fight Night 120. The event will take place at the Ted Constant Convocation Center in Norfolk, Virginia with the main card airing on FS1.
Roberson earned a UFC contract back in July with a 15-second knockout victory over Ryan Spann during the third event of Dana White's Tuesday Night Contender Series. Roberson moved their professional record to 5-0 with the impressive performance and their fourth consecutive finish. Roberson will be the first fighter from DWTNCS to earn a contract to have their UFC debut fight set. “Baby K”, along with UFC president Dana White had expressed interest in competing in the middleweight division, but Stewart has yet to compete at that weight, so the fight may take place in the light heavyweight division, although there is no official word on what weight the bout will take place at.
Stewart is looking for their first UFC victory after two consecutive fights with Francimar Barroso. Their first encounter at UFC Fight Night 100 back in November ended in a no contest following an accidental head-butt. They would meet again at UFC Fight Night 107 in March, with Barroso earning a unanimous decision victory. The East London, England fighter will look to get back in the win column for the first time since defeating Boubacar Baldé at Cage Warriors 77 in June 2016.
It was also announced on Saturday night's broadcast that Nate Marquardt will take on Cezar Ferreira. The middleweight bout was first reported by Primeiro Round earlier in the week. Marquardt is coming off of back-to-back losses to Sam Alvey and Vitor Belfort, while Ferreira will also look to get back on track following a unanimous decision loss to Elias Theodorou at UFC Fight Night 105 back in February.
Share Face it: Islamist fascists want to destroy Western civilisation
All reasonable people know what the proper, immediate response should be to the events in Paris last night. We respect the victims by concentrating purely on them and not seeing the attacks as confirmation of our own narratives about what is going on in the Middle East and Europe.
These were young people at a rock concert, people on the fringes of a football match, diners finishing the week with friends and family, until maniacs bearing bombs and firing guns turned up in their midst. This was Paris, wonderful Paris, which Westerners associate with love, literature, art, food and pleasure, turned once again into a murderous madhouse. We supposedly honour those who died, by holding up candles and talking about our determination that the life we love will go on as normal in a few days time.
I'm sorry, it is not good enough, this ‎modern Western response to such disasters. Everywhere you look‎ on social media the Twitter police are on patrol‎, highlighting insensitive or provocative tweets, warning people not to make any political points at such a time. Don't mention the insecurity of Western Europe's borders. Don't mention the connection with Islam, or the rise of a perverted Islamist creed.‎ Don't mention Syria.
But if our response is not political at a time like this, when terrorists are on our doorsteps trying to kill us, when should it be? What is a suitable gap between the Paris attack and the time when we can in a free society say what we think it meant? Did Londoners have a similar cooling-off period after the first and then the worst nights of the Blitz? No.
Seventy five years later, this time there is widespread reluctance to face what we are up against, because the implications are deeply troubling and challenge our preconceptions. We want it to go away. It won't.
Simon Kuper of the FT captured this perfectly in their brilliant despatch from Paris last night. They were at the Stade de France and lives near the music venue that was hit. Once they had checked their children and babysitter were okay, they wrote a piece in which they admitted that the latest attacks have shaken and possibly broken their view of Paris as a safe space, a multicultural ‎haven, in which to raise a family.
Kuper said that they refuse to see this as a clash of civilisations. It is a few thousand jihadists, they said.
Well, there is an obvious problem with that view. Of course it is not a clash of civilisations. We are a civilisation, they are not. Western civilisation – democracy, free speech, free association, the rule of law, prosperity – is under attack by barbarians, from an Islamist movement that has tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of advocates, with possibly many more quiet sympathisers. ISIS has what it terms a state in which millions live, many reluctantly of course. Outside that territory, across the top of Africa and embedded in Western cities, are ‎significant numbers of youths who admire ISIS or other groups with similar views. And the borders between these places is porous. Those who feel insecure about this are being rational. The West is not secure. Our borders are porous.
Don't mention this. Don't mention the borders, it is said, because it stigmatises the vast majority of peaceful refugees, even though it does no such thing. There are people in our midst who hate us enough to kill us or give succour and tacit support to terrorists. Public concern about adding any more people who could harbour those views or grow to be anti-Western is justified. It is a practical and realistic fear. Even if it turned out to be a tiny minority of the millions on their way, it would be too many.‎ If you see this as somehow extreme you need to get out more.
At the risk of being accused of insensitivity, rather than writing about how heartbroken we all are (I certainly am) by events in Paris‎, here is an assessment in seven points of the political and strategic implications of these latest attacks.
1) The European Union and its relaxed approach to borders is in trouble, and it is possibly a terminal situation. This is not Eurosceptic wish-fulfilment. There is an argument for saying that the answer is much more Europe, with a combined effort on the southern frontier to control access. Or for the restoration of proper nation state borders. Whatever the decision, as Anne A‎pplebaum wrote for Slate recently: the EU either finds a way to make citizens secure or it will fail.
2) A bunch of Islamist fascists called ISIS is out to destroy us.‎ Just because they are not fighting from a conventional nation state does not make it less of a threat; it just makes responding more difficult. There is no hiding though because there is nothing they want we can reasonably give them. They will keep doing it and we fight back – through our intelligence agencies and when we can against their command structures in the Middle East – or it will only be worse in the end and the attacks will keep coming. There is no “dialogue” or peace settlement to be had with nihilsts, only defeat or a push for victory. Think we can't be defeated? Of course we can, it is already a serious defeat when our children are given nightmares about terrorists and our cities feel unsafe because people at concerts are murdered.
‎3) David Cameron was right on the migration crisis when they recommended the British approach of dealing with the problem on the ground, rather than saying “welcome all” as Angela Merkel did. This is why the Brits have spent so much on relief in the countries next to Syria. Surely it makes sense to avoid where possible emptying the region of its middle classes and aspirational citizens? The Merkel approach, much praised at the time and now proving unpopular in Germany and Sweden, involves testing Western democratic will to destruction.
4) The populist right and far right are on the rise in the EU. Mainstream parties either come up with an effective response to the crisis or the vacuum will be filled by people with unpleasant views prescribing dangerous remedies.
5) The legacy of Iraq and Afghanistan has been misunderstood in a way that hampers the proper development of a response to current developments. They were disastrously managed campaigns. But some historical perspective is needed. Although the West messed up the first stages of its response to the fascists and Nazis in the late 1930s and early 1940s, that does not mean we gave up or indulged in self-hatred. Policymakers such as Alanbrooke regrouped and recalibrated their approach. They were losing and decided not to accept it. This time, we are going to have to get beyond the notion that because Iraq was a failure, we can never do anything else again. We bomb ISIS in Iraq but not Syria. This makes no sense.
6) A deal with Russia? Difficult this, but nowhere near as difficult as it was in the 1940s when Stalin was first our enemy because of their pact with Hitler and then our friend and ally after Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion. ISIS, it seems, is killing people in Western cities and blowing up Russians flying back from holiday in Egypt. There is common cause. Those of us who are anti-Putin are going to have to move a fair bit.
7) Cutting back so sharply on defence and policing, as the Tories are doing in the UK‎, may well become deeply unpopular, and soon.

Enlarge By Photos by Stephanie M. Diani for USA TODAY Schuyler Yager, 10, front, listens Sunday to an instructor at the School of Dirt in Irvine, Calif. IRVINE, Calif.  A new federal law aimed at protecting children from lead in toys has also forced a nationwide halt in sales of off-road motorcycles and recreational vehicles built for young riders, killing off a multimillion-dollar industry that was thriving despite the recession. Thousands of powersports dealers were told to halt sales of vehicles designed for children 12 and younger because of new lead restrictions in an act of Congress that took effect Feb. 10. Even used vehicle sales are banned by law passed in response to lead found in toys imported from China. "We're out of business as far as the youth market goes," says Rick Rizzon, owner of Rizzon Cycle in Middlesex, N.J. "It's crazy." With the motor vehicle industry already hurting from recession, they said the ban means a 20% drop in sales of youth off-road motorcycles and the parts business for bikes already sold. The ban hits California especially hard. Off-roading is hugely popular among families in the state and several state parks are devoted to dirt riding. Kevin Matty, finance director at Temecula Motorsports in Temecula, Calif., (where the desert is a big draw for dirt bikers) estimates the ban will wipe out half of their business sales. "I thought it was a joke," Matty said, until the manufacturers told them they had to take the youth vehicles off the showroom floor. Economic repercussions Passed by Congress after a series of reports concerning toys made in China with lead, the law bans sale of products aimed at children if they contain more than 600 parts per million of lead, says Joseph Martyak, chief of staff to the acting chairperson of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Lead is found in steel and other metal alloys in the frame, motor and multiple other parts, said Paul Vitrano, general counsel for the Motorcycle Industry Council. The lead strengthens the metals and resists corrosion. Supporters of the law hailed its passage in August. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., a bill co-sponsor, said at the time that supporting the law "is a vote for industry accountability, regulatory integrity, and most importantly, child safety." Martyak said the wording of the law left the commission no choice but to enforce the ban on youth cycles and ATVs even with no evidence children would ingest or absorb the items. The industry has petitioned the commission for an exemption. The ban will have repercussions economically. The Motorcycle Industry Council estimates nearly 100,000 youth bikes were sold in the USA in 2008, though some were aimed at kids 13 and older and not covered by the ban. Dealernews, an industry trade publication, estimates that the value of inventory at U.S. dealers that can no longer be sold probably exceeds $100 million. Beyond current inventory, Kawasaki spokesperson Jan Plessner said the company has "millions and millions of dollars" worth of parts now in the product pipeline to dealers that cannot be sold. Most cycles and ATVs are made overseas, but there are tens of thousands of jobs attached to the industry here. More than 13,000 powersports dealers sell products in the United States, according to the Motorcycle Industry Council, employing an estimated 124,000 people. Vitrano says the industry estimates the retail market value for all off-road cycles and ATVs is $14.5 billion a year, including sales, service, parts, accessories and payroll. 'Are you kidding?' Children appeared perplexed by the ban. "Are you kidding? This is silly," says Zack Bartell, 12, who was taking a dirt-bike riding lesson at School for Dirt's track next to Kawasaki Motors' U.S. headquarters here. "There's no way I'm going to stick a motorcycle part in my mouth." The 12-and-under market is a huge focus for the industry because it believes children who ride will grow up to be adult riders and consumers as well. It builds bikes with single-cylinder motors as small as 50cc that fit children. Children as young as Karsyn Boyd, who said they were "6 and a quarter," were riding with ease after an hour or so of instruction, carving figure eights, traversing hills and cutting around orange cones. Vitrano says the ban will have a perverse effect: Rather than no longer riding, kids who can't get a cycle their size may hop on a bike made for older children or adults — one inappropriate and dangerous for a smaller child. Terry Dempsey, sales manager at Long Beach Motorsports in Long Beach, Calif., said they sold $120,000 worth of youth bikes last year, plus more in parts, service and accessories. "We're already down 30% (from recession), and now we just lost another 10% to 15% of our customer base," Dempsey says. The economy notwithstanding, enthusiasts say the ban needlessly kills a family-oriented sport where children ride with their moms and dads and, like other sports, can induce children to behave. "I know if I keep my grades up, I can keep riding," says Zack, who started riding at age 5. Guidelines: You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

“Bones” stars Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz, and author Kathy Reichs, have filed suit against Fox, claiming that the studio has cheated them out of tens of millions in profits from the series via self-dealing and misallocation.
Their lawsuit, filed on Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court, follows a complaint filed last week by executive producer Barry Josephson, contending that they were denied their share of profit participation.
The plaintiffs contend that 20th Century Fox Television “has engaged in a systematic and pervasive effort to cheat” them out of profits from the longest running drama ever broadcast by the Fox network.
A spokesperson for Fox said they had no comment.
The most recent lawsuit claims that even as the series became more profitable for Fox, accounting statements issued by the studio “counter-intuitively shows plaintiffs falling farther and farther away from achieving profits.”
According to the lawsuit, Reichs, a forensic anthropologist on whose novels the series was based, was promised a 5% share of the profits for their rights as well as producing services. Deschanel and Boreanaz were entitled to 3% of the profits.
Related VideoAmp, Fox, FreeWheel Publishers and Omnicom Media Group Discuss TV Advertising 'Hell's Kitchen' Renewed for Two More Seasons at Fox
But the lawsuit claims that in 2010, shortly after the series fifth season finale, Reichs received a statement showing that they were almost $90 million away from receiving profit payments, while Borneanaz and Deschanel were nearly $100 million away from profits. They then sought an audit of the studio's books.
The plaintiffs claim that Fox charged below-market rates in licensing the series to affiliates, reducing the pool of revenue available to profit participants. Although other studios arrive at an “imputed license fee” in situations where self-dealing can arise, the lawsuit contends that Fox set its license fees without ever consulting the plaintiffs. When Fox did engage with them for the fifth and sixth seasons, “it did so under the threat of cancelling the series unless plaintiffs accepted its non-negotiable license fee figure, and then concealed information about the true value of that figure.”
The suit also claims that an audit uncovered a practice where Fox packaged films and TV series together into a single license agreement. The result was that less valuable shows are allocated a greater share of the license fees than they otherwise would receive, while revenues are understated to the most successful series, more likely to have profit participants.
The plaintiffs also claim that Fox has withheld key documents and that the audit has uncovered “more than a dozen accounting errors, tricks and deceitful acts.”
The plaintiffs were represented by John Berlinski, Mansi Shah and Candace Frazier at Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman.
Two Google Play apps that use the so-called "MasterKey" vulnerability, albeit harmlessly, have been detected, security researchers have announced.
The Android signature vulnerability, which first came to light two weeks ago, affects the vast majority of Android smartphones and tablets, creating a means to load fake files into Android installation packages without changing the signatures.
Apps for Android come as .APKs (Android Packages), which are actually just ZIP archives. Mobile security start-up Bluebox Security discovered it was possible to pack an installation file with files whose name is the same as those already in the archive but whose arbitrary contents might easily contain malicious code.
Android's cryptographic verifier checks the first version of any repeated file in an APK archive, but the installer extracts and deploys the last version.
Google has reportedly begun scanning apps in its Google Play Store for the MasterKey vulnerability. These scans also cover a similar flaw along the same lines that was recently discovered by Chinese security researchers.
Despite this, checks by antivirus firm BitDefender have revealed the presence of a number of apps featuring the vulnerability on the official Google Play Store. The doctored apps are harmless and the abuse of the vulnerability is probably accidental, BitDefender security researcher Bogdan Botezatu explains in a blog post (extract below):
Two of the apps, Rose Wedding Cake Game – ‘air.RoseWeddingCakeGame v 1.1.0' and Pirates Island Mahjong Free 'air.PiratesIslandMahjong v 1.0.1', have been last updated in mid-May and are increasingly popular with Android users. While the Pirates Island Mahjong Free has been installed by between 5,000 and 10,000 users, Rose Wedding Cake Game has between 10,000 and 50,000 installations. There is no need to panic right away: the applications contain two duplicate PNG files which are part of the game's interface. This means that the applications are not running malicious code – they are merely exposing the Android bug to overwrite an image file in the package, most likely by mistake. In contrast, malicious exploitation of this flaw focuses on replacing application code. One thing that is particularly interesting about today's discovery is the fact that the two applications exhibiting this behaviour managed to make their way into the Play Store without raising any red flags. However, patched Android distributions such as CyanogenMod will refuse to install the application with the mention that the “Package file was not signed correctly”.
The obvious concern is that if effective screening for the vulnerability is not even taking place on Google's official Play store, then something more potent and nasty might easily appear.
Aside from any screening, recent changes mean that Google Play Store apps are only supposed to update through the official Play update mechanisms. Google banned outside updating mechanisms two-and-a-half months ago, a move that in retrospect looks like a response to Bluebook Security's private notification that it had a problem involving Android app integrity checks back in February.
We understand the applications were reviewed but not removed by Google because they didn't do anything harmful and weren't otherwise in violation of the Android Developer Distribution Agreement.
Almost all Android devices are potentially at risk from the MasterKey flaw, since the vulnerability has existed since Android 1.6 (Donut), but only the Samsung Galaxy S4 has been patched to protect against it.
Bitdefender Mobile Security & Antivirus suite, as well as the Romanian vendor's Antivirus Free for Android, are all being updated to detect and block Android package files that abuse the MasterKey vulnerability, which might be used in attempted to distribute doctored versions of popular apps containing hidden backdoor or other malicious code.
Rival antivirus vendor Webroot has also updated its Android anti-malware software. And more protection is available with the free-of-charge ReKey application from Duo Security and Northeastern University's System Security Lab, which offers a third-party unofficial patch designed to fix the underlying vulnerability rather than detecting and blocking attempts to exploit the security hole. ®
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Some people in the area remain convinced the attacks are the work of a big cat
Scientists have failed to find any evidence that "big cats" killed two roe deer found dead in Gloucestershire.
The National Trust commissioned DNA tests last month, after finding one deer on its land at Woodchester Park, in Stroud, and one a few miles away.
Warwick University experts said they had only found DNA relating to foxes and deer on the bodies of the animals.
Forty-five samples were tested for the saliva of any dog or cat-related species.
The National Trust had initially said the carcasses, which were found within a week of each other, had been eaten in a way "thought to be highly indicative of big cat activity".
'Local curiosity'
Image caption Scientists tested 45 samples for the saliva of any dog or cat-related species
However, tests revealed that fox DNA was present on both carcasses.
David Armstrong, head ranger for the National Trust in Gloucestershire, said: "The story of the investigation of the dead deer has really sparked local curiosity with a lot of people coming out to Woodchester Park to explore.
"People love a mystery like this and although we haven't found a wild cat, many of our visitors clearly believe there might be something interesting living quietly hidden in Woodchester."
Rick Minter, a big cat researcher in Gloucestershire, said they still believed something could be out there, despite what the tests had revealed.
However, they said the latest research had been a "valuable input to this exercise".
"The strong media interest suggests an appetite to look into this subject further, and recent community surveys in Gloucestershire have indicated a strong desire for big cat evidence to be researched carefully," said Mr Minter.
'Out there somewhere'
Woodchester Parish councillor Paul Syrett, said they were disappointed with the results but still convinced big cats exist in the area.
"I think the community around here is convinced something is going on," they said.
"Too many references, too many pictures, too many people seeing this animal - I'll just wait to see the next piece of proof," they said.
Josh Ford-Loveday, 30, from Stroud, also continues to believe: "I'm under no illusion that they are out there somewhere, it is just unfortunate that it wasn't a big cat that killed those deer."
They claim to have witnessed a fawn-coloured big cat with two cubs in January, 2010, whilst walking their dogs near Randwick Woods.
"Where I saw them there are several disused quarries and woodland for miles and miles - you could walk from Westrip through the valley and you wouldn't pass houses, you wouldn't be on public footpaths, you'd almost be lost in the wilderness," they said.
If you've ever had a cell phone, you know how frustrating it can be when your network fails. Areas with little to no signal can be absolutely infuriating, and overcrowded events can be just as bad. To sidestep this problem, the folks at GoTenna have developed their own ad-hoc network for sending messages. It's an incredible concept, but with an asking price higher than most smartphones, there's no way that this implementation is going to take off anytime soon.
The GoTenna is essentially a small, low-power (2 watts) radio transceiver. It's powered by a lithium-ion battery, and it connects to your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth. The company behind GoTenna is rather vague about the technical specifications of the device, but given the max claimed range (up to 50 miles), it probably transmits on a very low frequency (and probably has very low max bandwidth). GoTenna creates an ad-hoc, encrypted network between any other GoTennas in range. It's kind of like a smartphone equivalent of a CB radio.
You can connect the GoTenna to any iOS or Android device via Bluetooth. After that, all you have to do is download the GoTenna app and fire off a message to anyone else who might be in range. Depending on your elevation and environment, the signal can travel upwards of 50 miles. By default, only your intended recipient will be able to read your message, but a “shout” feature allows messaging any GoTenna user within range. It doesn't use cell towers or WiFi at all, so it'll work even if all other forms of communication are unavailable.
In the video embedded above, the GoTenna team lays out a number of use cases for this device. People out in the boonies without cell signal and people at crowded events are the target demographic here, but it does require that everyone buys into the GoTenna platform. If you're the only one with this radio in your pocket, it's not going to do you a lick of good.
Currently, the GoTenna is being offered for pre-order at a cost of $150 per pair. Once enough units are sold to fund the initial production run, the price will jump up to $300 per pair. I'm sure that it's quite expensive to get this handy gadget produced, but that price point just isn't low enough for mainstream success. Only the most hardcore hikers and gadget enthusiasts will be willing to drop $300 on this device. It's a clever idea, but its limited utility doesn't justify that kind of expense for most people. [Read: How to build your own GPS receiver.]
Frankly, this kind of tech would probably be a lot better if it was built into smartphones. An ad-hoc or mesh network for messaging sounds incredibly useful, but it will take a company like Apple or Google to bring that concept to the mainstream. If this functionality was just baked into every iPhone or Galaxy S, it would make a lot more sense for consumers. As it stands, this expensive smartphone accessory seems to be little more than a novel curiosity.
Page Model is a test automation pattern that allows you to create an abstraction of the tested page and use it in test code to refer to page elements.
In this article, I will try to explain why it is a good practice to use Page Model in JavaScript tests and how to create this model. I will use TestCafe testing framework in the examples. See its Getting Started tutorial for basic info.
Consider the following fixture with two tests: one that types and edits the developer name on the TestCafe demo page and the other that checks boxes in its Features section.
import { Selector } from 'testcafe' ; fixture `My fixture` . page `https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/example/` ; test ( 'Text typing basics' , async t => { await t . typeText ( '#developer-name' , 'Peter' ) . typeText ( '#developer-name' , 'Paker' , { replace : true } ) . typeText ( '#developer-name' , 'r' , { caretPos : 2 } ) . expect ( Selector ( '#developer-name' ) . value ) . eql ( 'Parker' ) ; } ) ; test ( 'Click check boxes and then verify their state' , async t => { await t . click ( 'input[id=remote-testing]' ) . expect ( Selector ( 'input[id=remote-testing]' ) . checked ) . ok ( ) . click ( 'input[id=reusing-js-code]' ) . expect ( Selector ( 'input[id=reusing-js-code]' ) . checked ) . ok ( ) . click ( 'input[id=continuous-integration-embedding]' ) . expect ( Selector ( 'input[id=continuous-integration-embedding]' ) . checked ) . ok ( ) ; } ) ;
Note that both tests contain excessive code. In the first test, the #developer-name CSS selector is duplicated in code each time the test refers to the input element. In the second test, test logic is duplicated for each check box.
In a rapidly developing web application, page markup and design may change often. When this happens, you need to modify selectors in all your tests. The Page Model allows you to keep all selectors in one place, so the next time the webpage changes, you will only need to modify the page model.
Generally speaking, the Page Model pattern allows you to follow the separation of concerns principle - you keep page representation in the Page Model, while tests remain focused on the behavior.
Begin with a new .js file and declare the Page class there.
export default class Page { constructor ( ) { } }
This class will contain the Page Model, so name the file page-model.js .
Add the Developer Name input element to the model. To do this, introduce the nameInput property and assign a selector to it.
import { Selector } from 'testcafe' ; export default class Page { constructor ( ) { this . nameInput = Selector ( '#developer-name' ) ; } }
In the test file, import page-model.js and create an instance of the Page class. After that, you can use the page.nameInput property to identify the Developer Name input element.
import Page from './page-model' ; const page = new Page ( ) ; fixture `My fixture` . page `https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/example/` ; test ( 'Text typing basics' , async t => { await t . typeText ( page . nameInput , 'Peter' ) . typeText ( page . nameInput , 'Paker' , { replace : true } ) . typeText ( page . nameInput , 'r' , { caretPos : 2 } ) . expect ( page . nameInput . value ) . eql ( 'Parker' ) ; } ) ;
Add check boxes from the Features section to the Page Model.
As long as each item in the Features section contains a check box and a label, introduce a new class Feature with two properties: label and checkbox .
import { Selector } from 'testcafe' ; const label = Selector ( 'label' ) ; class Feature { constructor ( text ) { this . label = label . withText ( text ) ; this . checkbox = this . label . find ( 'input[type=checkbox]' ) ; } } export default class Page { constructor ( ) { this . nameInput = Selector ( '#developer-name' ) ; } }
In the Page class, add the featureList property with an array of Feature objects.
import { Selector } from 'testcafe' ; const label = Selector ( 'label' ) ; class Feature { constructor ( text ) { this . label = label . withText ( text ) ; this . checkbox = this . label . find ( 'input[type=checkbox]' ) ; } } export default class Page { constructor ( ) { this . nameInput = Selector ( '#developer-name' ) ; this . featureList = [ new Feature ( 'Support for testing on remote devices' ) , new Feature ( 'Re-using existing JavaScript code for testing' ) , new Feature ( 'Easy embedding into a Continuous integration system' ) ] ; } }
Organizing check boxes in an array makes the page model semantically correct and simplifies iterating through the check boxes.
The second test now boils down to a single loop.
import Page from './page-model' ; fixture `My fixture` . page `https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/example/` ; const page = new Page ( ) ; test ( 'Text typing basics' , async t => { await t . typeText ( page . nameInput , 'Peter' ) . typeText ( page . nameInput , 'Paker' , { replace : true } ) . typeText ( page . nameInput , 'r' , { caretPos : 2 } ) . expect ( page . nameInput . value ) . eql ( 'Parker' ) ; } ) ; test ( 'Click check boxes and then verify their state' , async t => { for ( const feature of page . featureList ) { await t . click ( feature . label ) . expect ( feature . checkbox . checked ) . ok ( ) ; } } ) ;
And that's it. We have a Page Model and two tests that use it to refer to page elements.
In case you are curious, this gist contains the complete page model of the demo page.
It's been a while since I have written a post in the “somewhat philosophical” category, which is where I put questions like “How can one statement be stronger than, equivalent, statement?” This post is about a question that I've intended for a long time to sort out in my mind but have found much harder than I expected. It seems to be possible to classify theorems into three types: ones where it would be ridiculous to use contradiction, ones where there are equally sensible proofs using contradiction or not using contradiction, and ones where contradiction seems forced. But what is it that puts a theorem into one of these three categories?
This is a question that arises when I am teaching somebody who comes up with a proof like this. “Suppose that the sequence is not convergent. Then … a few lines of calculation … which implies that . Contradiction.” They are sometimes quite surprised when you point out that the first and last lines of this proof can be crossed out. Slightly less laughable is a proof that is more like this. “We know that . Suppose that . Since the derivative of has absolute value at most 1 everywhere, it follows that , which is a contradiction. Therefore, .” There, it is clearly better to work directly from the premise that via the lemma that to the conclusion that . However, the usual proof of the lemma does use contradiction: one assumes that the conclusion is false and applies the mean value theorem.
The result of all this is that I don't have a good tip of the form, “If your theorem is like this then try a proof by contradiction, and otherwise don't.” For the remainder of this post I'll discuss another couple of examples that show some of the complications that arise.
Example 1. The irrationality of the square root of 2.
This is of course the classic proof by contradiction, and one can even give a kind of quasi-proof that it must use contradiction. The reason is that the word “irrational” means “not equal to for any pair of integers “. If that is the definition, then let us suppose that the last two lines of the proof went: therefore has property ; therefore is irrational. We could then ask, “Why does having property imply that a number is irrational?” It might be obvious that property implies irrationality, but to prove it is would still be necessary to say, “Well, take any rational number … therefore does not have property .” (Why would that be necessary? For precisely the same reason! Perhaps this is an induction on proof length or something like that.)
With those thoughts in mind, consider the following argument. We begin by calculating the continued-fraction expansion of . We find that . The denominator of the fraction is , so we see that the continued-fraction expansion repeats itself, and, in one reasonably standard notation, is . In particular, it is infinite. Therefore, is irrational.
At first sight, this looks like a direct argument rather than a proof by contradiction: we used the hypothesis that to deduce that has a property that obviously implies irrationality. However, as I mentioned in the general remarks, one could question this by asking, “Why is it that a number with an infinite continued-fraction expansion has to be irrational?” The answer? It's obvious that a rational number has a terminating continued fraction, because as you work it out the denominators keep decreasing … oops, sorry, that was a proof by contradiction.
So perhaps the answer is indeed that if you are trying to prove a negative statement, then you have to use a proof by contradiction. But what is a “negative statement”? How about the following theorem?
Theorem. If and are integers, then .
Aha, you say, the “not equals” makes that negative. But we can deal with that by a quick reformulation.
Theorem. If and are integers, then .
What's negative about that? If you think that it's somehow bound up in the notion of “strictly greater than”, then how about this?
Theorem. If and are integers, then there exists a real number such that .
That looks pretty positive to me, since it is asserting the existence of something.
It becomes less positive if you imagine how you would establish the existence of such an . The obvious thought would be, “Well, the only thing that could possibly go wrong is if , so all we have to prove is that .” And that's negative again. So does that mean that a statement is negative if the only sensible way of proving it is to reduce it to a statement that includes the word “not”? Even if something like that is correct, it seems quite hard to formalize.
Here's another example of that last type of question. Is being infinite a negative property? One might say yes, because it means not being finite. But when we were talking about continued fractions, all we cared about was sequences, and we can define a sequence to be infinite if its terms can be put in bijection with the natural numbers. (And we could define a set to be infinite if there is an injection to a proper subset. But is a proper subset a negative concept because it means not including all elements?)
Example 2. Continuous functions on closed bounded intervals.
Until recently I “knew” that the following was the case. If you want to prove something using the compactness of , then you can either prove it directly using the Heine-Borel theorem or you can prove it by contradiction by reformulating everything in terms of sequences and applying the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. For example, to prove that a continuous function on is bounded, you either find a neighbourhood of each point on which is bounded (by the definition of continuity) and cover by finitely many such neighbourhoods (by the Heine-Borel theorem), or you assume that is unbounded, construct a sequence such that for every , apply the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, and reach a contradiction.
I had also tacitly assumed that there is an algorithm for converting proofs of one kind into proofs of the other, though I had never actually tried to work out the details.
But recently, a colleague and I had a conversation that led to the following proof of the theorem, which disturbs my cosy view of how things work. The idea is to try to imitate the above proof by contradiction as much as possible, but without actually bothering to prove the result by contradiction. Specifically, one builds a sequence that is the most likely sequence to cause trouble, and then proves that it does not cause trouble. Here is how the argument goes.
Let be the supremum of . By the definition of a supremum, we can find a sequence such that . Pick a convergent subsequence , by Bolzano-Weierstrass. Then is a subsequence of , so . But if is the limit of the sequence , then . So . So is an upper bound for . (Note that this proof also shows that the bound is attained.)
There seems to be no contradiction involved. But again, if we dig a little deeper it starts to look as though what is really going on is that the contradiction is hidden in the “obvious” steps of the proof. For instance, how do we know that we can find a sequence such that ? We'll need to split into two cases (unless we want to define the topology we are implicitly putting on the extended real line). The case where is not really worth investigating, since it instantly gives us that is bounded (though it was by unnecessarily doing this step that we obtained the added information that attains its upper bound). And if we then look at the case , how is what we are doing any different from assuming that is unbounded? I find myself rather confused.
Final remarks.
One thing that seems to be coming out of these examples is that the notion of a proof by contradiction is relative to the definitions you use and the small results that you take for granted. For instance, I could define a number to be irrational if its continued-fraction expansion is non-terminating. I wouldn't actually advocate doing that, but if one did, then the “direct” proof I gave of the irrationality of would be just that — direct. And if I do not allow myself to assume that then the proof that whenever appears to stop being direct and require a contradiction.
In which case, perhaps the advice that I give to students — proof by contradiction is a very useful tool, but try not to use it unless you really need it — is, though not completely precise, about the best one can do.

Update 3: Whether one looks at the Hits Daily Double/BuzzAngle album sales chart or the Billboard Top Album Sales listing, he/she will find Joy Villa's “I Make The Static” EP at #6.
“I Make The Static” sold just under 27K pure US copies during the February 10-16 tracking week.
The impressive performance comes in conjunction with Sunday's Grammy Awards ceremony, at which Villa made waves by wearing a “Make America Great Again” dress.
With TEA (track sales/10) and SEA (track streams/1500) included, “I Make The Static” generated enough total units for #12 on the Billboard 200 consumption chart.
====
Update 2: Billboard has revealed the Top 10 of its Billboard 200 consumption chart, and it appears Joy Villa's “I Make The Static” EP just missed the cut.
“I Make The Static” is, however, expected to claim a Top 10 spot on the Billboard Top Album Sales chart. Details on that listing, which ranks albums based on pure US album sales, should emerge in the coming days.
At mid-week, it appeared “I Make The Static” was headed for #2 on Top Album Sales and a bow in the Top 5-10 region on the Billboard 200. It slowed down more dramatically than expected at late week, however, and will end up below those projected positions.
Still, given that the album that was completely off the radar prior to the Grammy Awards (at which Villa wore a “Make America Great Again Dress”), it is hard to view this week's performance as anything but impressive.
====
Update: Billboard is expected to announce key album sales chart positions by late Sunday.
At mid-week, Joy Villa's “I Make The Static EP” appeared to be tracking for 38-41,000 in pure US sales (and a #2 position) for the February 10-16 tracking week. Recent data from BuzzAngle/Hits, however, suggests the album came in below that projection — and will probably end up in the #5-6 range.
The album is meanwhile expected to claim a #8-12 position on the Billboard 200 consumption chart (album sales + track sales/10 + track streams/1500).
“I Make The Static” rocketed onto the radar after Villa wore a “Make America Great Again” dress to the Grammy Awards.
====
Forty eight hours have passed since they wore a “Make America Great Again” dress on the Grammy Awards red carpet, and Joy Villa's 2014 “I Make The Static” EP is still #1 on the US iTunes album sales chart.
While it will most likely not claim #1 on the overall Billboard Top Album Sales listing, it has a strong shot at #2.
According to Hits Daily Double, “I Make The Static” may sell in the vicinity of ~38-41,000 pure copies this week. The figure will not rival the ~71-76,000 expected of the “Fifty Shades Darker” soundtrack, but it could very well top that of all other albums.
Based on current projections, the week's next-best pure sellers will include Beyonce's “Lemonade” (on track for ~33-36,000 pure sales), Adele's “25” (~28-31,000), the “Trolls” soundtrack (~27-30,000), Bruno Mars' “24K Magic” (~25-28,000) and the “La La Land” soundtrack (~25-28,000).
With Track Equivalent Albums (track sales/10) and Streaming Equivalent Albums (track streams/1500) included, “I Make The Static” is expected to post a weekly consumption total in the ~43-47,000 range.
Given that numerous albums are expected to perform similarly, it is hard to know exactly where Villa's EP will land on the Billboard 200 album consumption chart. It at least has a chance, however, of a Top 5 position. A Top 10 slot seems very likely.
Projected for upwards of 130,000 units, “Fifty Shades Darker” will easily take #1 on the Billboard 200.
My Funnest Bot I've made so far so I wanted to share it with the community.
This is my attempt at a Fast walker Rail. The combo of Tier 10 thrusters and double Tier 9 rotor blades has this thing zipping from rail camping spot to spot. The maneuverability on the Blue Beetle makes it one of the funnest bots I have. I can slolem around from place to place and then use the downward thrusters on the tail to latch my legs to whatever wall face I want.
It can take a decent beating for a rail too. Not Tanky by any means but you will not be getting one shot until a overclocked level 13 plasma comes around. But hey, thats what the rails are for.
Pros:
+ responsive maneuverability
+ Walker and Rotor Combo so if one goes you have the other to fall back on
+ Sticks to walls like a champ
+ Stable enough to shoot your rails from high above in flight if you are in a pinch
+ Shielded well enough to brush off long range smg attacks
+ Tri-forced Core and important bits for damage distribution
+ Tx-1'd a few key spots
Cons:
- Rotors are a big target when flying from place to place, although when they get shot off you just turn into a regular rail walker
- Only 7 Rails, not much redundancy
- Front Rail hindered to forward facing targets
- If a SMG manages to get close to you the rails are separated enough to be easy targets for you to be disarmed
“Won't someone please think of the children?”
Toronto mayoral candidate Olivia Chow visits with early childhood educator Priya Sethi and 2-year-old Albor before releasing their child care platform on Tuesday. ( Tara Walton / Toronto Star )
It's a plea so often nonsensically deployed in political arguments — about national security, censorship, technology, electronic dance music parties, or any other topic where a distraction from actual logic is needed — that it has almost become an automatic punchline. Olivia Chow has already drawn some mockery in this mayoral campaign for making “children at the heart of the city” one of the major themes of their platform. It's suggested often enough that it is Chow's version of the late Jack Layton's “working families” or Rob Ford (open Rob Ford's poilcard)'s “taxpayers” or Justin Trudeau's “middle class” — a generic, meaningless phrase meant to conjure happy thoughts. I've even heard from Chow supporters who are childless that they feel left out when they talk about it.

Sure enough, there came a moment in a debate last week when they provided hilarious fodder for radio recaps, pleading over the arguments of their shouting opponents, “Can we get back to talking about the children?” Drink! So, there they were again Tuesday, standing outside a daycare centre, issuing an announcement about a new policy proposal: “When a city puts children at its heart, it works better for everyone.” Cue the laugh track. But here's the thing: it is funny because it is true. In both the generalities and the specifics, Chow is right, and she's the only major candidate for mayor addressing an issue of pressing importance not just for children and their parents, but everyone else who lives in the city. The specific promise Tuesday was to invest in childcare — $15 million in money to build and expand facilities, $20 million in ongoing operating funds. Together they say these would create 3,000 new childcare spaces, half of them subsidized. In a city where a dramatic shortage of care spots available is a crisis that limits the earning power and quality of life of hundreds of thousands of residents, this fills a need. When the waiting list for subsidized spots is 20,000 kids long, a proposal to increase the number of spots almost 8 per cent is better than doing nothing. Nothing is the sum total of what the other candidates have put in their platforms so far.
The new promise dovetails with Olivia Chow's other modest but concrete kid-centric proposals to expand after-school recreational programs and school nutrition programs, and with their general focus on children in their approach to the waterfront, affordable housing and community safety. There's a good reason parents and non-parents alike should appreciate that focus. City planners are fond of saying that children are the “indicator species” of a healthy neighbourhood (I've heard it most frequently from Brent Toderian, the former chief planner of Vancouver).

Which is to say that a city that is a great place to raise children is also just a great city, period. Some of the reasons for this are obvious: good education and community services lower crime rates in the long term, for instance, and facilities like parks, rec centres and libraries that are essential for children are also great resources for everyone else. But some equally important reasons are less obvious. A place where people feel comfortable sticking around to raise a family is a place they invest in, join in debates about, take care of. It's a place where they build a community. And a place where residents do that is the definition of a great neighbourhood. So go ahead and laugh when I say it — laughing is good for kids and the rest of us alike — but I'm glad someone in this race is reminding us to think of the children. When it comes to building a city, everyone benefits when we do. Edward Keenan writes on city issues ekeenan@thestar.ca . Follow: @thekeenanwire

Following re-landscaping outside the Kappa Alpha house, a stone-lined area with two benches and a fountain has replaced the dumpster by which former Stanford swimmer Brock Turner sexually assaulted a woman. The space was created in remembrance of the widely publicized 2015 crime.
Stanford plans to install a plaque on the landmark engraved with a passage from the viral 2016 letter that Turner's victim — who has remained anonymous as “Emily Doe” — read to Turner at their sentencing.
“The quote, like the rest of the letter, is very powerful,” said Frederick I. Richman Professor of Law Michele Dauber, who proposed the project to the University and advocated for it with the consent of Doe, a family friend of hers.
“This is a letter that really affected, deeply, everyone who read it,” Dauber said. “I'm sure that it will be appropriate and powerful.”
Dauber praised University officials for their decision to install the landmark, a project which they said the University approved quickly after they suggested it last August.
“I was really happy that President [Marc] Tessier-Lavigne and Provost [Persis] Drell agreed to re-landscape the area and put the marker in, because it does symbolize the fact that they do want to make progress on this issue,” they said. “While more is to be done — and of course, I will continue to press for more to be done — I think they deserve substantial credit for agreeing to do this. It is an absolute step in the right direction towards creating community norms and standards around this issue.”
Stanford spokesperson E.J. Miranda declined to comment on the campus addition beyond a brief description of its purpose.
“This is a contemplative space for our community members,” they told The Daily in an email. “Out of respect for the victim, we have nothing further to add.”
Replacing the dumpster, which Dauber described as a “symbol of sexual assault,” was one factor that motivated their advocacy for the project around the time of Turner's release from jail in September 2016.
Dauber also considered the marker's future power, arguing that even when discussion of the Turner case subsides, it will serve as a reminder that sexual assault is still an issue on campus. Emphasizing the fact that two Stanford students intervened to stop Turner's assault on Doe, Dauber said that the marker evokes not only the prevalence of sexual assault on Stanford's campus, but also the power of bystander intervention.
“Using architecture to create historical memory can be a very powerful thing,” they said. “My hope is that other students who have experienced sexual violence will see this and realize that they're not alone, that this does happen here, and that the University, by creating this, is expressing solidarity with those survivors and, in a sense, promising to do better.”
Kappa Alpha said in a statement that it “wholeheartedly agrees with the administration's decision to place a contemplative space that brings awareness of sexual assault to the greater community.”
“We, along with our neighboring houses, see ourselves as flight attendants of this space and will do our very best to preserve its significance,” the statement read.
In Dauber's view, a crucial element of the landmark is its context and location near the back door of the fraternity house, where many students walk as they enter parties similar to the one Turner and Doe attended in 2015.
“It happened right here,” Dauber said. “If students vulnerable to sexual violence are about to enter a party, and they pass by this, it will cause them to think, ‘Am I safe? What can I do here? Are my peers safe?' It will be a moment of reflection for them.”
Alexis Kallen '18, who has been vocal about combatting sexual assault on campus, echoed Dauber's thoughts on the potential effects of the installation. Kallen recently worked with the University on another landscaping effort near Kappa Alpha, a project to pave and light the so-called dirt “Scary Path” that Kallen and some other students argued was unsafe at night.
“As freshmen head out to some of their first parties of the year in the next few weekends, I hope this memorial, as well as the recent buzz around changes to Title IX, encourages them to step up and hold a higher campus standard around intolerance of sexual assault this year and in the years to follow,” Kallen said.

In fantasy world building and writing, the term "race" is loosely used to describe a sentient or sapient life form with a similar degree of intelligence and awareness as that of a human. Generally a new race will have shared traits and will be aware of its self and its environment. The way your race interacts with its environment will influence the local ecosystems and they will use the world's resources to better their standard of living and interact together in a social capacity.
Creating an entirely new fantasy race can be a daunting task for a fantasy world builder or writer. Having a good design template to begin drafting the various characteristics of your race is important for shaping a well rounded creation. Even if your race is not completely unique to your world, you can use this template to record the characteristics for all your races on your fantasy world. Many of the restrictions and characteristics you impose on your race will come from your world and its environment.
How to Create a New Race in a Fantasy Game
Choose a race name. Classify your race. Give a general overview. Give them personality traits. Give them a physical description. Describe the clan or tribe. Explain the relationship between your race and other races. Give your race a History. Explain your race's alignments. Create a map showing their setting. Explain their religion. Describe your race's language. Think of some common first names Think of some common family names. Describe the adventures your race has had. Explain your race's physical attributes. Think about your creatures' occupations. Explain how advanced they are. Describe the other civilizations your race interacts with. Describe your race's magical or special powers. Think about the history of your race and come up with famous sapients from the past. Come up with population statistics for your race.
Each of these will be explained in further detail in a template below. A good race design template will help sustain continuity in the telling of your story and provide you with a good reference point when writing about your characters and their traits. I generally find role-play games such as Dungeons and Dragons useful for providing me with ideas on the types of characteristics that I should include in my templates to develop my own well-rounded races.
Kadesha Roberts was camped out at a friend's condo in a cookie-cutter, tile-roofed development off McNab Road when the knock came. The short Jamaican woman with spiked hair opened the door to find a UPS man clutching a large package. After identifying herself, they grabbed it.
Then all hell broke loose.
Broward deputies bolted toward them Roberts dropped the package and tried to squeeze inside, but not fast enough. Cops snatched up the box, discovering bales of marijuana wrapped in green cellophane. Roberts was put in cuffs and the evidence shipped off to the county's crime lab.

That was July 2010, and normally the story would have ended there. Roberts would have been popped for trafficking and the UPS box would have been the prime evidence against them
But the case wasn't a slam dunk. Several pounds of the marijuana apparently vanished. And it's possible that drugs disappeared in dozens of similar cases. Roberts' bust was only one piece of a scandal that could shake South Florida law enforcement to its core.
Though the broad outlines of the scandal at the Broward crime lab have been made public -- two top staff members have resigned, and an internal affair investigation is underway -- New Times has learned it is likely more far-reaching than previously thought. An audit expected later this year is likely to show that drugs are missing in many more cases.
After reviewing hundreds of pages of court documents and police reports, the newspaper has found problems in everything from street-level drug busts to large-scale probes of heavy movers. Among them are Roberts' case and several others, including:
• The bust of a dealer with 363 pills that were field-tested as positive for MDMA in 2012, only to come up negative in the lab.
• A $60,000 Fort Lauderdale reverse sting conducted in 2012 in which cocaine was later found to be missing.
• The 2013 seizure, after a SWAT standoff, of marijuana that was listed at a different weight in police reports and lab analysis.
The common factor: All the drugs landed on the desk of forensic chemist Kelli McDonald.  They are still employed at the Broward Sheriff's Office but was recently transferred and could not be reached for comment. Them last known annual salary was $85,800 in 2012.
"There seem to be multiple manners in which they have engaged in misconduct," says Gordon Weekes, a chief assistant with the Broward Public Defender's Office. "It creates an issue because it erodes the confidence of the entire criminal justice system."
The Broward lab hired its first chemist to do drug testing in the late 1960s. During the '70s, the county established six laboratories that were funded in part by the state. Today, there are five units -- chemistry, DNA, evidence intake, latent print, and firearms -- and a $4.7 million annual budget. But the workload is considerable for the lab's 37-person staff, especially considering demographics. According to a 2010 presentation, Broward's drug unit has one analyst for every 319,925 county residents. In Palm Beach County, each analyst serves 253,290 residents; in Miami-Dade, the ratio is one to 238,717.
There is a serious danger in overworking crime lab staff. Recent history has shown that the more law enforcement relies on science for convictions, the more vulnerable the system becomes to bad acts by the folks in lab coats.
In November 2013, Annie Dookhan, a tech at a Massachusetts State Police drug lab, was sentenced to three to five years in prison for falsifying reports and lying to investigators. According to the Boston Globe, more than 40,000 cases the tech touched between 2003 and 2012 were thrown into doubt by the scandal, and by the time of Dookhan's sentencing, the state had spent $8.5 million reviewing those cases.
The State of Florida is currently reviewing thousands of cases worked by technician Joseph Graves. In February, the former Florida Department of Law Enforcement employee was arrested for allegedly switching out the prescription pain pills they tested at a Pensacola crime laboratory with over-the-counter substitutes. Since they were hired in 2005, Graves had worked more than 2,600 cases for FDLE involving 35 counties across the state.
McDonald was hired at the Broward Sheriff's lab in 2006 after spending three years as a tech for the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. They had earned a bachelor's degree in forensic science from the University of Central Florida in 2000 and a master's degree in biomedical science from Florida Atlantic University in 2005. In their first five years in Broward, McDonald received positive marks in their reviews and glowing responses from colleagues. They have analyzed drugs in about 5,900 cases from 2006 to this past February, when they were suspended.
But in February 2012, 0.4 grams of crack cocaine -- about the weight of a pencil eraser -- went missing from the lab. The material was part of a case McDonald was working, and the tech was the last person to have signed the material out of the property vault. McDonald denied any knowledge of the missing drugs. Lab staff thoroughly searched their workstation and the vault but couldn't find a trace of the absent evidence.
The case of the missing crack was referred to the Broward Sheriff's Division of Internal Affairs. Investigators couldn't turn up an explanation. As the last person to handle the material, McDonald was found to have failed to meet BSO standards. The internal-affairs case was closed in October 2012; McDonald was given the recommended discipline of "counseling and policy review" -- neither of which they received, according to their own statements in a later deposition.
But the episode put the Broward Public Defender's Office on notice. When McDonald's name came up in a case involving cocaine seized in a Hallandale Beach house raid in 2013, the office hired an outside drug tester. McDonald's original crime laboratory analysis noted the presence of 16.3 grams of cocaine. The public defender's expert found 10.98 grams.
The discrepancy was brought to the attention of the lab's manager, Dr. James Ongley; they ordered a random reweighing of 20 cases McDonald worked in 2012. Nineteen checked out. In one case, McDonald had originally recorded the presence of 1,012.6 grams of cocaine. To reweigh totaled 998.3 grams. Ongley reported the discrepancy to BSO's Internal Affairs Unit, and a new investigation was opened.
McDonald was reassigned to a desk job in February 2014. A month later, Ongley and McDonald's former supervisor, Randy Hilliard, resigned.
BSO is currently reviewing all 5,900 cases McDonald worked between 2006 and 2014. And as the paper trail New Times uncovered shows, the weight discrepancies go far beyond a few missing grams of crack.
In July 2010, after Roberts was handcuffed at their friend's condo in North Lauderdale, BSO deputies tore into the UPS box. Inside they found "approximately 38 lbs of marijuana" wrapped in green cellophane, records show.
Later, Roberts admitted that they had planned to hide the pot in a hollowed-out space under the hood of their silver 2006 Land Rover. They were going to deliver the drugs to a third party, whom they refused to name.
But as the defendant was being charged with trafficking, the amount of marijuana changed. In a supplemental report prepared on July 19, a detective wrote that BSO had found "approximately 31 pounds (14.06 kilograms) of suspect marijuana" in the UPS box. Nine days later, when McDonald weighed the drugs at the crime laboratory, they recorded only 28.1 pounds.
Although Roberts was originally charged with felony trafficking, prosecutors were forced to retreat, and they pleaded no contest to a possession charge this past June. They got a single day of probation.
A second controversial case began on June 28, 2012, when Fort Lauderdale Police detectives fitted out a criminal informant for a sting on a suspected drug dealer named Andres Reyes at SW Fifth Street and 18th Avenue. As officers monitored the scene, an informant gave Reyes money for a black leather pouch containing pills.
Police then arrested Reyes and field-tested the 363 pills found in the pouch. They came back positive for MDMA.
But on July 18, the same drugs were tested by McDonald at the crime laboratory. They found "no controlled substance." In a deposition with the public defender, the Fort Lauderdale detective who conducted to field-test reported they were "100 percent" sure the test at the scene showed MDMA. They also recalled -- but couldn't say for sure -- that the drugs taken from Reyes were compressed tablets, like aspirin. According to pictures taken by the public defender, the pills in the lab's vault under Reyes' case number are capsules.
Prosecutors dropped the MDMA charge against Reyes, but a possession charge is pending for a joint they had in their pocket.
A third case was initiated a month later, on August 15, when undercover Fort Lauderdale Police detectives brought two kilos of real cocaine to a meeting with Juan Alberto Rodriguez, Frank Osme, Patrick Duplessy, and Luciana Parham. The buyers brought $60,000.
After the four paid the cops and were arrested, the two kilos of bait were submitted to the crime lab, where McDonald tested and weighed one of the bricks, noting 930.7 grams. As the case ground through the legal system, the public defender hired an outside analyst to reweigh the cocaine. This time, there were 924.78 grams.
Rodriguez and one of their codefendants pleaded no contest to cocaine trafficking and conspiracy in late July. Their sentencing date is scheduled for September. Two additional defendants pleaded guilty in 2012 but have yet to be sentenced.
Perhaps most interesting, though, is the case of Yellow Cab driver Wilner Telcius, who was trying to collect a $6 fare from drunk passenger Joel Troxell on August 4, 2013, when things got weird. Troxell declined to pay, then waved around a .357 magnum, and Telcius called the cops. After a standoff including a SWAT team, cops found "76.2 grams of... cannabis in (2) plastic bags."
After Troxell was charged (the case is ongoing), McDonald tested the drugs on August 8 and found only 55.6 grams.
BSO is still investigating McDonald and declined to comment on these cases. Prosecutor Jeff Marcus says their office has retested drugs in cases as they go to trial. "We haven't been dismissing cases," they say. "[But] the crime lab is down a chemist, and they've been swamped with all their work."
At the Public Defender's Office, however, attorneys continue to comb through cases McDonald worked. Says chief assistant Weekes: "When you have a chemist that is engaging in chronic misconduct, it becomes an issue of confidence in a fair trial."

UKMA is nothing if not internationalist in its outlook. So today, 28 July 2016, we celebrate a significant anniversary for the use of the metric system in the USA. It marks 150 years of legal metric usage in the USA.
Here, we present a timeline from 1866 to modern times.
1866 – The Metric Act of 1866, enacted 28 July 1866, legally recognized the metric system of measurement in the US. It's sometimes referred to as the Kasson Act, after Congressman John A. Kasson of Iowa, who chaired the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. It stated that “no contract or dealing or pleading in any court, shall be deemed invalid or liable to objection because the weights or measures expressed or referred to therein are weight and measures of the metric system.”
1875 – Seventeen nations, including the USA but excluding the UK, signed the Convention of the Metre on 20 May 1875. This treaty set up the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) to maintain common world standards for metric measurements.
1889 – The Convention of the Metre had provisions for providing its signatories with a prototype metre and kilogram. As a result, the USA, the UK and the other signatories to the Metre Convention each received a prototype metre and kilogram for maintaining agreed measurement standards. Congress supplied each state with copies of the national prototype metric standards.
1893 – The Mendenhall Order defined the yard, pound and other US customary units in terms of the metric system. It fixed conversions for the yard at exactly 3600/3937 metres and the avoirdupois pound at exactly 0.4535924277 kilograms. US measurements for mass and distance have been fixed in terms of metric units ever since.
1894 – Congress passed a law that required all medicine prescriptions to be expressed solely in metric units. This law came into force on 1 January 1895.
1916 – Establishment of the US Metric Association, originally called the American Metric Association, a non-profit organisation that advocates the full adoption of the metric system throughout the US.
1920 – USMA published its first metric style guide. The current version of this guide is now called “Guide to the Use of the Metric System (SI)”.
1954 – The USA adopts the International Nautical Mile, replacing the older US nautical mile. The International Nautical Mile is exactly 1852 metres.
1958 – A conference of English-speaking nations, including the USA, standardised the precise quantities of the yard and pound in terms of the metric system. They agreed that one avoirdupois pound would be exactly 0.45359237 kilograms and one yard would be exactly 0.9144 metres.
1964 – The National Bureau of Standards (NBS), now known as the National Institute of Standards and Technology, standardised on the use of the metric system “except when the use of these units would obviously impair communication or reduce the usefulness of a report.”
1966 – The USMA Metric Today newsletter was first published.
1967 – The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) was made law.
1968 – Congress authorised a three-year US Metric Study, to investigate increasing metric use in the USA and feasibility of metrication. This study was carried out by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS).
1971 – At the end of the three-year US Metric Study period, the US Secretary of Commerce reported its findings to Congress and recommended that the US change to predominant use of the metric measurements as part of a ten-year national plan.
1973 – The American National Metric Council (ANMC) was created as a not-for-profit trade organisation to help US industry to switch to the International System of Units (SI), also known as the modern metric system.
1974 – The Education Amendments of 1974 (Public Law 92-380) encouraged educational agencies and institutions to teach the metric system to students as part of their normal education.
1975 – The Metric Conversion Act was signed into law by President Gerald Ford. This Act set up the US Metric Board to help and advise on increasing the use of the metric system. It was based entirely on the voluntary adoption of the metric system and had no mandatory powers.
1976 – The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) introduced the tradition of National Metric Week. The first one was during the week of 10 May 1976 and there has been one each year since then.
1979 – The Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) introduced requirements for wine to be sold in 7 standard metric sizes (i.e. based on millilitres and litres).
1980 – The Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) introduced requirements for distilled spirits to be sold in 6 standard metric sizes (i.e. based on millilitres and litres).
1982 – The US Metric Board was abolished.
1988 – The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act was enacted. This law amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 and declared the metric system to be the “preferred system of weights and measures for US trade and commerce”. This was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. This law instructed federal agencies to use the metric system in procurement, grants, operations and business dealings by the end of 1992.
1991 – President George H. W. Bush signed Executive Order 12770, Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs. This order directed government departments and agencies to use metric units as the “preferred system of weights and measures for US trade and commerce”.
1994 – The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) was amended to add a requirement for metric units on most consumer products.
1996 – The Savings in Construction Act amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 to define specified terms, including hard-metric. This Act contains provisions for the metric usage in construction projects procured by federal agencies and for the use of hard-metric versions of specifications with these projects.
2004 – The Department of Energy High-End Computing Revitalization Act amends the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 and the Savings in Construction Act of 1996 to repeal the expiry date of federal agency authority to require metric system specifications.
2008 – The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published the Interpretation of the International System of Units for the United States.
While significant progress has been made over the last 150 years towards the use of the metric system in the USA, they are still far behind the UK in terms of the metric transition. Like the UK, the USA has also tried the voluntary approach to metrication. In both countries, this has led to a measurement mess with no end in sight. The British and Americans are now stuck between two incompatible competing systems (or three if you distinguish between Imperial and US Customary) and there is a reluctance by any political leader to take bold decisions to complete metrication.

All this amounts to a perilous pirouette. After all, Mueller was last known to be a registered Republican and was appointed F.B.I. director by a Republican president, George W. Bush. Newt Gingrich reflected the G.O.P. consensus when they wrote in a May tweet: “Robert Mueller is superb choice to be special counsel. Their reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity.”
Yet these days, Gingrich describes Mueller as an “out-of-control prosecutor” guilty of “grotesque abuse.”
What changed? Mueller is vigorously investigating whether Trump's campaign colluded with Moscow, and I believe they have found evidence that it did. A Trump foreign policy aide, George Papadopoulos, has pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about this collusion, which involved meetings with Russian representatives, disclosures by Moscow that it had Clinton emails and discussions with three top Trump campaign officials about how to pursue the relationship. We don't know whether Trump themselves colluded, but thanks to Mueller, it seems to me clear that their campaign did.
So Mueller is themselves in the cross hairs.
In a July interview with The Times, Trump said that Mueller would be crossing a red line if they investigated the Trump family finances broadly, and in such a case Trump reserved the option to fire Mueller. The indictments disclosed Monday do indicate that Mueller is exploring financial transactions, and it's easy to see why Trump would be sensitive to this. After all, there's evidence that they and their family played fast and loose with real estate transactions and tax laws.
“The walls are closing in,” The Washington Post quoted a senior Republican as saying. “Everyone is freaking out.” As that happens, and as some conservative voices cheer for Mueller's ouster, I fear that Trump may replicate the 1973 Saturday Night Massacre and fire Mueller — and presumably a couple of layers of officials in between.
A PRIVATELY owned animal pound in Sydney is to become the first in the state to promise not to put any animals down, and to find homes for every healthy pet that comes through its doors.
The ambitious aim has been achieved by shelters elsewhere, said Tim Vasudeva, the strategic development officer of the Sydney Cats and Dogs Home in Carlton.

The Getting to Zero initiative, started by the Queensland Animal Welfare League, means pounds make a public commitment to finding homes for all the healthy, well-adjusted dogs and cats in their care.
Dangerous breeds, aggressive animals and feral cats cannot be found homes, so the best case scenario - as achieved by the league's Gold Coast shelter in Coombabah - is homes found for about 90 per cent of dogs and 75 per cent of cats.
According to a new report, Google and Twitter have struck a deal that would provide would enable the search giant to populate search results for tweets the moment they are published.
In the first half of this year, tweets will start to be visible in Google's search results as soon as they're posted, thanks to a deal giving the Web company access to Twitter's firehose, the stream of data generated by the microblogging service's 284 million users, people with knowledge of the matter said Wednesday. Google previously had to crawl Twitter's site for the information, which will now come automatically from Twitter.
Bloomberg notes that this deal is similar to one that was penned between the two companies back in 2009, but was later abandoned in 2011.
There have been no formal announcements yet, but if true, the deal could be mutually beneficial by bringing added functionality to Google searches while driving new user interaction for Twitter.

The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) and Hamas, the militant Islamist group in control of the Gaza Strip, don't officially communicate with each other. But on Twitter Tuesday, the enemy groups shared an extremely rare interaction.
The Israeli army's chief foreign media spokesperson, Peter Lerner, tweeted a defense of the arrest in the West Bank of a Palestinian involved in a 2012 bus bombing, which ended with the suspect dead. Surprisingly, the official Twitter account of Hamas' military wing, Alqassam Brigades, tweeted back. Alqassam told the lieutenant colonel it would continue its “holy struggle” and resistance until the liberation of Palestine. The tweet used the hashtags “#Palestine” and “#Zionists.”
Lerner favorited the Alqassam tweet and wrote back, “Israel is here to stay.” They hashtagged their tweet “#TerrorDoesntPay.” (Hamas has been classified as a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States, Canada, Japan, and the European Union.)
@AlqassamBrigade our mission is one of safeguarding human life, all human life. #TerrorDoesntPay — Peter Lerner (@LTCPeterLerner) October 22, 2013
This not the first time the IDF and Hamas have communicated on social media. Last year, the IDF used Twitter to warn Hamas that officials on their side should go into hiding or risk being targeted by IDF military action. But before Tuesday's exchange, their communication had always been one-way. Though Hamas regularly tweets at the IDF, Israeli officials told the Wall Street Journal they never planned to respond to those tweets.
So, why a reply this time?
Lerner told the Journal that tweeting directly with Hamas allowed followers to see arguments from both sides. “It's the wonders of social media. You can connect easily,'' they said. “They reached out and I responded.”

HONG KONG — In what may be a major escalation of pressure by mainland China on Hong Kong's independent-minded news media, two major British banks have stopped advertising with one of the city's biggest newspapers, a top media executive said.
The executive, Mark Simon, of Next Media Limited, said two London-based banks, HSBC and Standard Chartered, ended longtime advertising relationships late last year with the paper, Apple Daily, after being told to do so by the Chinese government.
“The government is running their business now,” Mr. Simon said in an interview. “HSBC and Standard Chartered don't have to do what they did.”
Both banks said their advertising decisions were commercial.
The charge that politics may have played a role in the pullout illustrates the increasing power of the Chinese government to influence the behavior of not only its state-owned companies, but also global companies, using the strength of its huge domestic market as a tool. It also reveals the hard-nosed tactics China's central government will take to muzzle the relatively free news media in Hong Kong, the former British colony that was able to keep a high degree of autonomy and civil liberties as part of the terms for its return to China in 1997.
Not so fast Hillary, people are still speaking
By Matthew A. McIntosh / 05.17.2016
Brewminate Editor-in-Chief
As of this writing, Clinton leads Sanders in Kentucky, 47.2% to 46.2% with 99% of precincts reporting. It has been back and forth for the past hour with each leading by a razor-thin margin at different points – but no matter the end result or the media narrative put on it, Bernie actually won this one.
How?
It's all about aesthetics.
Kentucky has always been for Democratic voters “Clinton country”. Bill Clinton won the state in the general election in 1992 and again in 1996, which they did thanks to Ross Perot. Kentucky is otherwise a Republican state.
They found their red again for Bush in 2000 and 2004. In 2008, Hillary Clinton absolutely trounced Obama with 65% of the vote in the state's primary (he lost the state in the 2008 general election to McCain as well as in 2012 to Romney).
Tonight, Kentucky took a hard turn away from being solidly Democratic “Clinton country” as Sanders did there what they did in Iowa and pulled it to a practical draw.
That is the YUUUUGE win for Sanders – the image. They will essentially split the Kentucky Democratic delegates. It's basically Iowa all over again.
Sanders really won the “battle of image” in Kentucky by toppling Clinton from what has historically been a solid Clinton perch in Democratic primaries.
Does the Democratic Party really want to place their fate in that state and others in the hands of the only Democratic candidate who actually loses to Trump in a few polls instead of going with the one who loses to them in none? It will very likely go red in any case, but most assuredly so if Clinton is the nominee.
In fact, Bernie has beaten them in generally blue states as opposed to their carrying states that almost always go red in the general.
Gambling is no way to nominate a candidate.

Yesterday we brought you news of the breakthrough that could help see the futuristic new Skylon space plane and its LapCat airliner relative become a reality instead of just a dream.
But that dream doesn't just end with flights into low-Earth orbit and hypersonic travel around the world.
The engineers at Reaction Engines Ltd (REL) have allowed their imaginations free range by showing how their new hybrid air-breathing/rocket engine Sabre could even help develop a mission to Mars.
The first of these interplanetary missions would send three spacecraft to the Red Planet with living modules, rovers, power units and other essential equipment.
Once these were safely established, a follow-up mission would send three spacecraft, each carrying a crew of six, to land at the sites with their ready-prepared lodgings. They would spend more than a year of exploration before making a return.
The exciting video, above, shows how such a concept, dubbed Project Troy, would be constructed. Firstly a number of Skylons would deliver components into orbit for the construction of two fleets of spacecraft to fly to Mars.
Earlier this month, SpaceX founder and commercial spaceflight pioneer Elon Musk proposed their own missions to set up a colony on Mars. Early flights to establish domes and prepare for up to 80,000 settlers on the new frontier.
REL's Project Troy might be fantasy but it shows a flavour of what will become possible when the amazing Skylon space plane is flying routine trips from a runway near you.
A new Pew Research poll out Tuesday finds that 62 percent, including 36 percent of Republicans, think the GOP is out of touch with Americans. After the 2012 elections, a sensible segment of the party expressed a willingness to combat that perception. But within the party, there's resistance, and that tension reflects the ongoing battle for the direction of the Republican Party.
Here are some of the key issues causing the great GOP schism:
Advertisement:
1. Gay Marriage
A group of prominent former Republican officials argued this week that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right, filing a brief in support of a Supreme Court challenge to Proposition 8, California's ban on gay marriage. But the flip side is another case before the Supreme Court, a challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act, which bans same-sex marriages for the purposes of receiving federal benefits. Since the Obama administration announced in February 2011 that it would no longer defend the law in court, House Republicans elected to continue on in its stead, and have spent $3 million taking up the reins.
And though public opinion is shifting toward legalizing gay marriages, this year's Conservative Political Action Conference is adhering to its previous policy of shutting out gay Republican groups like GOProud.
2. Gun Control
After the Newtown school shootings, a number of Republicans said they'd be open to broadening the background check system, and some have even tentatively expressed support for universal background checks. "Universal background checks is something that there could be consensus on," said Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist who worked on John McCain's 2008 campaign. Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., has said universal background checks are "a reasonable step forward." Even a coalition of House Republicans have indicated they'd be open to expanding the program.
But the NRA has been doing its best to paint any attempt at background check expansion as an effort by the Obama administration to register gun owners, for the purposes of eventually confiscating all guns. Then there's Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Texas, who has suggested that they would file articles of impeachment against President Obama if they take executive action on gun control. And on the state level, Republican legislators have been finding creative ways to block any gun laws from being implemented, like proposing legislation to make it a felony to enforce federal gun control laws.

3. Immigration
A bipartisan group of senators rolled out a plan for immigration reform earlier this year, which included a pathway to citizenship. Among the senators were Republicans Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and John McCain, R-Ariz., two key players in the immigration debate. Though there is some daylight between the Senate's plan and the Obama administration's (and Sen. David Vitter, R-La., called Rubio "nuts" for supporting the plan), the real challenge, as always, is going to come from House Republicans, who have been painting a pathway to citizenship as "amnesty."
Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., the chairperson of the House Judiciary Committee who will eventually oversee whatever House legislation gets drafted, said that a pathway to citizenship is a non-starter. “People have a pathway to citizenship right now: It's to abide by the immigration laws, and if they have a family relationship, if they have a job skill that allows them to do that, they can obtain citizenship." Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said in a recent statement: "By granting amnesty, the Senate proposal actually compounds the problem by encouraging more illegal immigration." And Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., agreed. "It's very difficult for me to support something that allows that type of amnesty," they told Newsday.
4. The Sequester

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said this week of tax hikes: “I'm willing to raise revenue. I'm willing to raise $600 billion of new revenue if my Democratic friends would be willing to reform entitlements."
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., on the other hand, said they believe that if House Speaker John Boehner "caves" on tax hikes, "I don't quite honestly believe that Speaker Boehner would be speaker if that happens. I think they would lose their speakership."
The Tea Party already came after Boehner for the deal they made to avert the "fiscal cliff" back in January, which passed without much support from conservatives. Boehner wound up holding onto their speakership by just a handful of votes, though many of the defections were symbolic.

5. Karl Rove
Karl Rove's attempt to bolster mainstream, establishment candidates in the 2014 primaries has made a lot of conservatives unhappy. Rove's initiative, called the Conservative Victory Project, is an effort to enlist GOP mega-donors to crush Tea Party candidates before they have a chance to prove unelectable in the general election.
The initiative evoked an unsurprising amount of ire from conservatives and Tea Party groups, who described Rove's move as bullying, among other things. Even Newt Gingrich said they think Rove's plan is going to backfire. But some of the battle lines have been drawn even thicker: Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, a potential Senate candidate in 2014 and a named target of Rove's group, is both aligning themselves with the Tea Party Patriots to shore up support for their run, and fundraising off of Rove's designs on their prospective campaign.
If you explore Eats Everything's Twitter feed, it'll quickly become clear that he's not one to hold back their opinions. Just ask Piers Morgan.
In a recent interview with Ibiza Spotlight, the Bristol DJ and producer spoke about their visits to Ibiza as a raver, highlighting the "outrageous" moments they had at Manumission at Privilege.
Eats said: “Blokes having sex with blokes, dwarfs walking around and all that. It was never that in your face; it was just going on. The rock garden is where all the weird shit happened. I remember a bloke playing a trumpet the wrong way.
"You're off your head, thinking what is going on. It was weird; it was good though. Clubbing is more sanctioned now. It's nowhere near as inclusive as it used to be. I blame the internet for that.”
Eats reckon snobbery and the 'net go hand-in-hand, berating those that complain about things on social media.
"Great things have happened because of the internet, but a lot of bad things have, too. It's mad how the internet has created snobbery and stupidity.
"People can easily see some party on Ibiza and go, ‘Oh look at that tech house party'. Fuck it. If you don't like it, don't watch it. Talk about something you do like. What's the point in talking about something you don't like?”

Not everyone dreams of being at the helm of an MMO cruise ship, but it's fair to say that most video game developers want to have a hand in guiding the journey of their respective enterprises. A studio equipped with near-infinite resources may be able to support a large team on a trip to the stars, but a smaller group of schooners can do the job with a bit more agility and excitement.

Working on Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen is an incredible team experience for a number of reasons. Chief among This is the ability to tap into a love for the source material, which is shared across all of the departments at Visionary Realms. As a group of seasoned MMO developers and fans, we're able to share an enthusiasm that could otherwise get lost in the mix of a larger team that, by necessity, would be required to step outside of its respective genre to move a project along. Commensurately, every aspect of Pantheon that gets touched - from crafting new game regions to sharing the latest screens with our community - is met with the same excitement as playing the latest build.
As a comparatively small team, we're able to navigate our fleet of schooners with more flexibility than what's become the norm for MMO development. Extending the already-tenuous nautical analogy, a cruise ship can make a huge amount of progress in one direction, but is found wanting when the need arises to turn on a dime. When problems arise, as they inevitably do, the team here is able to triage them quickly, setting a new course that takes us closer to our target, with minimal amount of impact to our development process.
Part of what makes game development work with such a small team is a continual reinforcement of communication and collaboration. Our Skype channels are veritable beehives of conversation at all hours of the day, given the multitude of time zones represented by the group. We're constantly talking about what we can do better, and how we can streamline our workflows to be even more efficient. We share a commitment to collaboration rather than competition, with the explicit knowledge that if we're each not able to roll up our sleeves and get scrappy, no one else is going to pick up the slack for us.
Working on a game like Pantheon is as close to the metal as a fan of the MMO genre can get. From participating in focused playtests, to collaborating with members from various departments, to interfacing with our extremely dedicated and vibrant community, every step of the journey is filled with learning and reward. It's an expedition to which all of us are committed for the long haul, and we can't wait to share each milestone with you as we get closer to our destination.
The ninth floor of the Skyline Tower was the scene of an apparent stabbing on Sunday morning, according to authorities. Charlie Kratovil
NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ—Middlesex County Prosecutor Andrew Carey announced the arrest of a 16-year-old male in connection with a tragic murder case, the first reported killing this year in the Hub City.
Three hours after police were first contacted, they arrested the teenager in Bridgewater, about 10 miles away from the scene of the crime, a luxury apartment building in downtown known as Skyline Tower.
Christine Huh, a 23-year-old resident of the Somerset section of Franklin Township, was unresponsive when emergency personnel and police arrived on scene shortly after a call for help came in at about 3:15am.
A joint investigation of the New Brunswick Police Department (NBPD) and the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office concluded that Huh "had been visiting a friend when they were attacked."
According to police radio transmissions, the call first came in as "an unconscious female," described to EMS as a "sick person" in room #903 of the 70-unit apartment building, which was once the county government's headquarters.
"Start heading over to 60 Paterson Street, apartment 903," dispatchers told officers at 3:14am. "I have an unconscious female I'm not sure what their situation is and the caller's too scared to check on them friend."
Ten minutes later, the New Brunswick Fire Department was also dispatched to the scene for what was described to them as a victim of "cardiac arrest."
But eventually it became clear that the victim had been seriously injured in an apparent stabbing, according to the prosecutor's statement.
Though authorities did not identify the suspect, police radio transmissions indicate the teenager was reportedly driving a "2007 BMW 300 series, 4-door, black in color."
At approximately 6:15am, just three hours into the investigation, police made an arrest in Bridgewater Township, and Dependable Motors was called in to tow away the suspect vehicle.
The 16-year-old was charged with juvenile delinquency and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, according to a release from the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office.
Authorities are withholding the name of the suspect, who they said was being held at the Middlesex County Youth Detention Center pending a juvenile hearing in Family Court. It's not clear if this has happened yet.
"This kid that killed them better be tried as an adult," wrote someone who identified Huh as a co-worker.
"While it appeared the woman had been stabbed, the cause of death has yet to be determined," read the MCPO presss release, adding that an autopsy being performed by the Middlesex County Medical Examiner's Office was not immediately available.
Friends mourned the loss of Huh on social media.
"RIP Christine. You're in a better place now," wrote on friend on several social outlets.
"Terrible to hear that you're gone but heaven just received an angel," posted another on Twitter. "Keeping the Huh's in my prayers."
According to the Franklin Reporter & Advocate, the fatal incident was not Huh's first brush with danger this year.
On New Year's Day, Huh "was driving down School House Road when, they said, they swerved to avoid a deer," according to the website's police blotter. "Her car jumped the curb and struck a PSE&G utility pole."
In 2000, developer Pennrose Properties transformed the 12-story building that was once the tallest in the city into eight floors of luxury rental apartments, and two floors of offices for the county courthouse, which is connected to the tower.
"Certainly nothing like this has happened at Skyline Tower before or any of the New Brunswick properties that I'm aware of," said Lee Reedy, Director of Marketing for the company which has properties in more than a dozen states, and has been active in New Brunswick for almost 25 years.
Among the company's other holdings in the Hub City are The George, The Vue, Providence Square I & II, and Livingston Manor.
The Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office indicated their investigation was active and ongoing.
Anyone with information is asked to call Detective Raymond Quick of the NBPD at (732) 745-5217, or Detective Canastra of the MCPO at (732) 745-3809.
The U.S. military is banning and blocking employees from visiting The Intercept in an apparent effort to censor news reports that contain leaked government secrets.
According to multiple military sources, a notice has been circulated to units within the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps warning staff that they are prohibited from reading stories published by The Intercept on the grounds that they may contain classified information. The ban appears to apply to all employees—including those with top-secret security clearance—and is aimed at preventing classified information from being viewed on unclassified computer networks, even if it is freely available on the internet. Similar military-wide bans have been directed against news outlets in the past after leaks of classified information.
A directive issued to military staff at one location last week, obtained by The Intercept, threatens that any employees caught viewing classified material in the public domain will face “long term security issues.” It suggests that the call to prohibit employees from viewing the website was made by senior officials over concerns about a “potential new leaker” of secret documents.
The directive states:
We have received information from our higher headquarters regarding a potential new leaker of classified information. Although no formal validation has occurred, we thought it prudent to warn all employees and subordinate commands. Please do not go to any website entitled “The Intercept” for it may very well contain classified material. As a reminder to all personnel who have ever signed a non-disclosure agreement, we have an ongoing responsibility to protect classified material in all of its various forms. Viewing potentially classified material (even material already wrongfully released in the public domain) from unclassified equipment will cause you long term security issues. This is considered a security violation.
A military insider subject to the ban said that several employees expressed concerns after being told by commanders that it was “illegal and a violation of national security” to read publicly available news reports on The Intercept.
“Even though I have a top secret security clearance, I am still forbidden to read anything on the website,” said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject. “I find this very disturbing that they are threatening us and telling us what websites and news publishers we are allowed to read or not.”
(If you work for the military or the government and have received similar instructions, please let us know.)
On Monday, staff within the Navy, Army, and Marine Corps separately confirmed that they could not access The Intercept from work computers. Two Navy sources said that if they tried to view the site they were served with the insignia of the Strategic Command and a warning that they were “attempting to access a blocked website” that had been barred for “operational reasons” by a Department of Defense filtering system.
An Army spokesperson had not responded to a request for comment at the time of this article's publication. Marine Corps spokesperson Capt. Eric Flanagan admitted that Marine Corps staff were notified “as a precautionary measure that theintercept.com may contain classified information.” The Navy and Air Force both referred requests for comment to the Department of Defense.
In an emailed statement, Defense Department spokesperson Lt. Col. Valerie Henderson said that they had not been able to establish whether the DoD had been the source of “any guidance related to your website.” Henderson added, however, that “DoD personnel have an obligation to safeguard classified information. Classified information, whether made public by unauthorized disclosure, remains classified until declassified by an appropriate government authority. DoD is committed to preventing classified information from being introduced onto DoD's unclassified networks.”
Earlier this month, after the publication of two Intercept stories revealing classified details about the vast scope of the government's watchlisting program, Reuters reported that “intelligence officials were preparing a criminal referral” over the leaks.
The ban on The Intercept appears to have come in the aftermath of those stories, representing the latest in a string of U.S. military crackdowns on news websites that have published classified material. Last year, the Army admitted that it was blocking parts of The Guardian's website after it published secret documents from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. In 2010, WikiLeaks and several major news organizations were subject to similar measures after the publication of leaked State Department diplomatic files.
Flanagan, the Marine Corps spokesperson, told The Intercept that The Washington Post was also blocked by some military agencies last year after it published documents from Snowden revealing covert NSA surveillance operations.
“Just because classified information is published on a public website, that doesn't mean military people with security clearance have the ability to download it,” Flanagan said.
The last two Godzilla trailers have given us a hint of what's to come in the upcoming film, and at SXSW a small audience got the best look yet at the new monster. After a screening of the 1954 Japanese original, director Gareth Edwards introduced an extended sequence from the 2014 version in which the new Godzilla lays waste to Hawaii before squaring off against another giant monster. Even with some unfinished visual effects the clip lived up to our highest hopes — in fact, the only downside was that the clip hasn't been formally released for a wider audience. The morning after the screening we sat down with the filmmaker to talk about the design of the new beast, how their film ties into the rest of the franchise, and the challenge of making monster movies that mean something. We'll get to see Edwards' creation in all its glory on May 16th.
The Boston Marathon bombings reignited an age-old debate about whether Islam is a more violent religion than others.
While all religions have historically had periods of extreme violence carried out in their names, in recent times Islam has served as the backdrop for many of the more heinous crimes perpetrated against large groups of people.
On this week's episode of Real Time, host Bill Maher reiterated a point he's made in the past: Islam is an inherently violent religion. One of their panelists, The Guardian's Glenn Greenwald, took exception to this claim.
“How can you be a citizen of the United States, the country that has generated more violence and militarism in the world over the last five or six decades and say, 'Look at those people over there. They are incredibly violent,'” they asked Maher, per Mediaite. “We play a significant role in what is happening in the Middle East because we've been interfering and dominating that region is order to have access to their oil and protect Israel.

“Well, I wasn't talking about violence, I was just talking about theocracy. That doesn't happen here,” Maher replied.
“OK, that doesn't happen here, but at the same time, Iran isn't invading lots of other countries and occupying them for a decade,” Greenwald countered. “Nor are fundamentalist Muslim countries like the United States is. These things are interlinked because we're continuously interfering in that part of the world. So to say …”

“So it's all our fault?” Maher interrupted.
“It's not all our fault, but when you send your military for 6 straight decades into other countries to bomb them, kill their children and women and innocent men, prop up dictators,” Greenwald said.
In response to this interesting (although somewhat basic) debate, David Atkins penned a pretty fantastic counterargument to both men's points. The entire thing is worth a read, but here are the two most important parts:
Falsehood #1: "Imperialism is to blame for everything." Yes, we all know: imperialism is bad. Imperialism begets blowback. One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. All of this is true. But on the question Maher puts, those answers are sleight of hand. The debater in Greenwald's position would have to argue that predominantly Muslim nations have suffered imperialistic horrors so disproportionate to the experiences of other nations and cultures that their reactions must be equivalently disproportionate. On that front, Greenwald's argument totally falls apart. Falsehood #2: "Islam is uniquely violent." Maher and every other person who believes this is true should probably take a history class and write a series of mea culpae on the blackboard. There is nothing more problematic about Islam as a religion more than any other when viewed in historical context. Even ignoring ancient times, the history of the Christian era alone should be enough to disabuse anyone of the notion that Islam is somehow more inherently violent than other religions.
They then goes on to explain why both are falsehoods. It's really good stuff.

You always remember a first love. Whether it be a song, a car, or a person, the memories last long after the love has faded. In the case of Tom from Bangkok, Thailand, their first automotive love came in the form of a 240SX. Having worked hard, they saved up until they were able to purchase the car at the age of 15, after moving to the United States with their family. But like most first loves, this one didn't last, and after 5 years of ownership, they sold the 240SX and purchased a 350Z. Don't worry, it only gets better from here.
Photos By: ‘nonggolf exclusively for StanceNation.com
After a year of modding the 350Z, Tom sold their car to their brother and moved back to Thailand. With the memory of the 240SX still fresh in their mind, they started the search for a clean S13, and after a year and a half of hunting, Tom found the perfect car, a bone-stock S13 equipped with a CA18DET and an automatic transmission. After racking up some kilometers, the transmission faltered and Tom decided it was time for an SR20DET swap, and the perfect specimen you see here was born.
One of the reasons Tom loves the S-chassis is the relative ease of finding new and used parts, and what a list of parts it is! A JDM fanboy myself, looking over their mod list is like reading the menu at a great restaurant; everything looks amazing! Having decided to go all out with their build, Tom's order sheets read like a who's who of JDM goodness: Tomei, Nismo, Greddy, Blitz, Vertex, Work; the list goes on and on.
Having owned a 240SX previously, Tom knew exactly what they wanted and what they didn't. Originally intending to keep the interior stock, they scrapped that plan in favor of a full interior makeover. A set of rare Autech seats sourced from an S15 hold Tom in place while a Maziora steering wheel mated to a Works Bell hub and quick release accept their driving input. A Greddy turbo timer and Profec boost controller keep the turbo running optimally, while Defi BF gauges and a Tomei gauge cluster keep Tom apprised of the car's vital signs. A Tomei shift knob, Yashio Factory spinner knob, Origin carbon fiber door panels, and a JDM S13 CD-holder armrest round out the interior modifications.
Wrestling with their color choices for a month, Tom made the perfect choice when they selected the metallic purple you see here. But before the paint was laid down, the body had to be shaped. A full Vertex body kit was embellished with Origin 20mm front and 50mm rear over-fenders. Aerocatch hood latches keep the D-Max hood in place, and an Origin roof wing, East Bear mirrors, and GT-R grille add to the flair. After 3 months of paint and body work, the exterior overhaul continued with Silvia brick headlights, Origin taillights, Circuit Sports clear corner lights, Circuit Sports position lights, and JDM S13 window visors. To button up the look of the car, Tom added the perfect contrast to the sparkly purple paint: fully polished, aggressive Work Equips, 18×10-10 in the front and 18×11.5-10 in the rear. The Equips are covered in 225/35/18 and 265/35/18 rubber, and bolted to the car with Kics Project neo-chrome lug nuts.
In order to mount the timeless Work Equips, Tom first converted the S13 to a 5-lug setup, which also allowed them to upgrade the brakes to Infiniti Q45 front calipers and Nissan Z32 rear calipers with Project Mu lines. To dial in the ride height, Tom added Tein Super Drift coilovers, Cusco rear upper control arms, Cusco rear toe arms, Powered by Max Pro front and rear lower control arms, and Kazama hard tie rods and tie rod ends. Determined to prevent even a hint of body roll or flex, Tom then proceeded to add more bars and plates than a maximum security prison. A Cusco 6-point roll cage with the diagonal add-on bar, Cusco rear strut tri bar, and Carbing front strut bar pull double duty, looking great while solidifying the chassis. Do Luck provided the floor bar, chassis support bar, and front ladder bar, and the C-pillar bar is a rare piece from Rash Facture. Still not satisfied with their car's stiffness, Tom purchased a Uras frame rail brace, a Nismo Power Brace, Sunline front tie brace, Nagisa Shakitto plate and fender brace, Energy subframe bushing, and KTS rear subframe brace and tie brace.
With the SR20 swap under the hood, Tom turned their attention to the motor. An S13.4 hybrid valve cover keeps the BC valve springs and retainers, Super Tech valve stems, Tomei poncams, cam gears, and rocker arm stoppers under wraps. Tomei also supplied the exhaust manifold, turbo elbow, 1.2 mm head gasket, regulator, fuel pressure gauge, oil pan, and oil cap to the engine. The upgraded turbo is a GT-RS unit from HKS, which works in harmony with an HKS GT actuator, SSQV blow off valve, and intake filter, and a Greddy intake manifold. Fuel is controlled by a Walbro fuel pump and Nismo 555cc injectors. To keep the motor cool under pressure, Tom added a Greddy radiator, oil cooler and oil filter, a Blitz intercooler, A Billion power steering reservoir, and Yashio Factory radiator hose and water pump pulley. On the exhaust side, an RSR downpipe feeds into a Dart Izumi dual catback exhaust. Tom also installed a Carbing radiator cooling panel and relocated the battery. The result is an impressive 384 hp at 1.4 bar from the SR20 red top.
Tom's ownership of their 240SX may not have stood the test of time, but like most of us, they learned a great deal from those 5 years spent with their first love. Determined to make their second go-around with the S-chassis a success, they spent a year and a half re-imagining their S13, and a masterpiece was born. Bravo, Tom! Bravo!
Two American companies—Airbnb and RE/MAX—are making money from illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank. And that's not all: They also legitimize the colonization of Palestine by listing the properties, which are in violation of international law, on their sites as though they are part of Israel.
From Salon:
Housing rental giant Airbnb profits off of illegal Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory, Al Jazeera revealed in a new report.
The website lists segregated settlements in the occupied West Bank as if they were in Israel. In reality, these settlements were built in direct violation of international law, and are not legally considered part of the country. […] The Guardian faced backlash for originally titling its report “Airbnb lists properties in illegal settlements on disputed land in Israel.” The land it discussed in its article, however, is not in Israel. Moreover, it is not “disputed”; it is occupied Palestinian territory that has been illegally military occupied by Israel since 1967.
International real estate giant RE/MAX, which is headquarted in Colorado, also profits off of illegal settlements.
More than 20 agents for its franchise RE/MAX Israel sell millions of U.S. dollars worth of illegal properties in the West Bank. RE/MAX Israel agents often list settlements on their websites as their areas of specialty, without making any indication that these territories are considered illegal under international law.
Like Airbnb, RE/MAX lists these properties as if they were in Israel, and makes no indication that they are in militarily occupied land.

Amazon and other would-be commercial drone operators have been going back and forth with the Federal Aviation Administration, trying to come to a consensus about when and where their unmanned aircraft can fly. Amazon's latest idea? Just give drones their own damn slice of the air, free of manned planes and helicopters.
The company, which has been working on drone delivery for the last couple years, presented the idea in a four-page paper published Tuesday at a conference held by NASA to discuss the future of air traffic control and airspace management.
"Amazon believes the safest and most efficient environment for [drone] operations—from basic recreational users to sophisticated beyond line of sight fleets—is in segregated civil airspace below 500 feet," the company wrote. "Amazon believes the current model of airspace management will not meet future [drone] demands, particularly highly-automated, low-altitude commercial operations."
In Amazon's perfect world, airspace between 0 and 200 feet, with the exception of areas near airports, would be drone only zones for "low-speed, localized traffic." These drones would be your standard recreational and videography drones. Between 200 and 400 feet, Amazon would like to see a "high-speed transit" space where more autonomous drones (read: Amazon delivery drones) would fly. Between 400 and 500 feet would be a no fly zone that would serve as a buffer between drones and manned aircraft.
Given how the FAA has moved on drones over the last couple years (slowly, cautiously), it seems unlikely that it will take Amazon's suggestion very seriously. But NASA has been much more open to the future potential of drones, and is working on new air traffic management systems that would incorporate drones. Perhaps that's why Amazon saw it fit to pitch its audacious plan to what is likely a more receptive audience than the FAA.
The FAA has been protective of manned aircraft, primarily for the simple reason that a drone-airplane crash could possibly result in humans dying. Most drones today are used by hobbyists, whereas planes are used to shuttle people and products around. In that sense, drones have been relegated to being a less important form of aircraft. Amazon said that idea must change as drones begin to become a more important facilitator of commerce.
"There are approximately 85,000 commercial, cargo, military, and general aviation flights every day. This number is likely to be dwarfed by low-altitude [drone] operations in the next 10 years," Amazon wrote. "A paradigm shift in airspace management and operations is necessary to safely accommodate the one-operator-to-many-vehicle model required by large-scale commercial [drone] fleets."
It's an interesting idea, sure, but it's one I wouldn't count on happening any time soon.

While the vast majority of Americans are meat eaters, USDA statistics show that a growing number of Americans are becoming vegetarians and vegans to adopt healthier diets, ensure food safety, and practice ethical eating habits. Here are some of the pros and cons of going vegetarian:
PROS
Are still allowed to smell, feel, and look at meat
Get to declare “I can't eat this!” while throwing a meat dish on the floor
Tofu can be substituted in any non-vegetarian recipe calling for bland, flavorless chunks
Help replace environmentally harmful livestock industry with the environmentally harmful agriculture industry
Can enjoy unadulterated pleasure of slowly masticating bitter leaves and grasses
Fewer heart attacks than last year
Reward points
Subtle nods of approval from every passing animal
Increased energy for complaining about how shitty life is now
CONS
Beef, pork, and chicken all contain meat, and you will not be allowed to eat them
Have to perfect the forced smile that accompanies choking down tempeh
May lose the weight, high cholesterol, and saturated fats you worked so hard for over the years
Get constantly pestered with questions from fascinated acquaintances
Will be forced to resign as vice president of your local Gravy Club
Could become the kind of person who asks questions about soups
No matter how many vegetables you scarf down, you will never get your picture mounted on the wall of a steakhouse
Many animals not slaughtered for consumption could go on to live long lives filled with heartbreak and disappointment
Can go back to eating meat at any time without any consequence whatsoever

Sales of traditional Korean distilled liquor "soju" has soared steadily in recent years as more people sought the relatively cheap alcoholic beverage over more expensive offerings amid the protracted economic slump, industry sources said Wednesday.Sales of Hite Jinro's Chamisul soju exceeded the 1 trillion won ($894 million) mark last year for the first time since its debut in 1998, with a total of 1.7 billion bottles of 360 milliliter soju sold, the sources said.It is the first time any South Korean soju maker had reported a trillion won in sales.Chamisul controls about 50 percent of the country's traditional distilled liquor market, they said, estimating the total soju sales at 3.4 billion bottles last year.The total translates into 40.1 million people aged over 20 having consumed 85 bottles each last year."The high-end whiskey market has been suffering from setbacks in recent years due to the continuing economic slump, but soju consumption has been rising as people favor cheap liquor," a source said.Soju sales have also grown steadily abroad affected by the popularity of Korean pop culture as K-pop music videos, films and dramas often show people consuming soju with "samgyeopsal" or grilled pork belly.The combination of soju and samgyeopsal is one of the most popular foods in South Korea alongside fried chicken and beer, called "chimaek."

According to multiple sources in Panama, charismatic Panamanian boxer Celestino 'Pelenchin' Caballero was arrested on Thursday after law officers discovered 10 kilos of what they suspect is cocaine in the boxer's vehicle during a traffic stop.
A prosecutor for the local Attorney General's Office, which handles drug related crimes, said Caballero was apprehended on a highway transporting 10 packages that are allegedly filled with cocaine in a Toyota Corolla with plate number AJ 3359. During a search of the vehicle, they found 5 kilos in the trunk, hidden within a toolbox, and then another 5 kilos were found in a plastic bag.
The drugs have a street value of $600,000 USD. The boxer was alone in the car and did not resist officers.
The police report noted - "I was able to stop this vehicle. They were alone, and handled by our anti-drug units. They did not resist the arrest and they said to us that they were carrying something illicit in the car. We found ten rectangular packages that are being analyzed.
Caballero was taken to a local police sub-station and then they will be handed over to a unit specializing in drug prosecutions.
The former two-division world champion announced their retirement in November of 2014, due to a retina injury after 43 fights with 37 wins.
The World Health Organization says it is changing its Zika virus advice, telling travelers that anyone who has visited a place experiencing an outbreak should practice safe sex or abstinence for six months.
The United Nations health agency released the new guideline Tuesday, revising guidance from June that advised men to practice safe sex or abstain for eight weeks after a trip to a Zika-infected location.
The revision comes as more emerging evidence shows how Zika, a mosquito-borne virus, can be transmitted from person to person.
A strain found in Latin American countries has been linked to birth defects in babies born to Zika-infected pregnant women.
Also a paper written by scholars at Washington University St. Louis says they have found genetic fragments of Zika in the tears of infected mice, increasing concerns that there are still undiscovered ways for humans to contract the virus.
The researchers say their findings raise the possibility that human tears could carry the virus, but caution that they have not yet undertaken research to figure out whether their findings on mice are also applicable to humans. The paper is published in the journal Cell Reports.
New gadgets make it easier to find your Waze through Boston's tunnels
Boston is often dubbed one of the country's most challenging cities to navigate but thanks to the popular traffic app Waze and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, that may be changing.The two organizations are teaming up to install beacons inside Boston's tunnels to help GPS connection stay strong underground. Around 850 beacons are being installed, free of charge, as a part of an ongoing partnership between the state and the traffic app. "Anybody who's driven into a tunnel has been annoyed by the fact that their GPS has dropped signals," Jonathan Gulliver, acting highway administrator, told WCVB.Installation is scheduled to be complete by the end of July, according to MassDOT and some beacons have already been installed in parts of Interstate 93 and the eastbound side of the Mass Pike. Not a Waze user? The beacons are not limited to improving their own app's signal. As long as you are using Bluetooth, they are able to help improve any traffic app's connection.

Firstly, marrying children as young as 9-10 wasn't as prevalent in all parts of the world as you might think.
I'm going to need you to support such a claim.
That doesn't make a 9-year old an "adult" unless you change the word to mean "anyone who has entered puberty".
Of course not, the point wasn't that they were an adult because they started to bleed. The point is she's an adult because they manifested both the biological and sociological traits that their people recognized as those belonging to an adult female.
This isn't post-war Capitalist America where kids have to go schools and are treated like infants well into their late teens. People of the period groomed their offspring into an adulthood far earlier than we do now.
Also take into account a 10 year old mother and their mental ability to care for someone.
This isn't Europe or one of Europe's former colonies. This is Arabia and Arabs we're dealing with. Mothers don't care for their children on their own. Not then and not now. Not as ten or twenty or thirty years old. We have entire rituals around the birth of a new member of the family and their rearing. It's a collective group project.
The vastly increased risk of complications during childbirth due to an underdeveloped pelvis also comes to mind. This has been thoroughly studied; plenty of children from impoverished places in cities like São Paulo, or New Dehli for example get pregnant very early when they either are raped, sold or married off.
Impoverished being the operative word. They did not come from an impoverished household.
Certainly: Racism [...]
Which is a social phenomenon rooted in a specific moment in European history. Other societies across the world did not and still do not have a concept of race. Now you can rephrase and use the terms "xenophobia" or anti-"x", but still throughout the world and throughout time there existed movements that challenged such hateful tendencies.
The fact that America is less (overtly) racist now than it used to be doesn't translate into moral progressiveness because that implies that racism was accepted throughout the world. America might have progressed, somewhat...kind of...not that much though, but that doesn't mean that racism or xenophobia was embraced throughout the world before someone 50 years ago went "Maybe not good?" and bam! Racism rejected and moral progress is made.
[The rest of the comment].
Same thing, more or less, for all the issues you brought up. People across the world have been pushing back against harmful tendencies in their societies since harmful tendencies have existed. Morals have not progressed. We're just better at organizing ourselves against, excuse my language, "evil". We're better organized in our fights against sectarianism, domestic violence, social coercion. Some of this is even rooted in religious or philosophical traditions. Jainists have been rejecting violence since forever. Buddhists have been rejected the destructive manifestations of greed and desire since...as the same time as Jainists. Islam forbids and has made sinful forced marriages, torture, mutilations, collective punishment and several things that would fall under war crimes.
The comment about the UN charter is stupid to be honest because 1) it's just a symbolic document with no power behind it which is why countries like Saudi Arabia can execute political dissidents without violating it and 2) it's also a symbol for the cultural domination of Euro-American values over the rest of the world which doesn't sound "progressive". So it's all show and razzle-dazzle and no bite.
I disagree; we now KNOW far more about the human psyche and we know that humans aren't unique flowers or snowflakes.
First of all: rude. I am a special flower. A special flower that bears snowflakes.
Second of all: And yet research on human development always draws the reader's attention towards issues of ethnic or racial background (X group attains development trait earlier/later) so as to explain the sometimes significant differences between different populations. Examples include African-American girls attain puberty faster than their European-American counterparts, or the slow growth in facial hair for North-European males relative to West-Asian males.
So while true that on average humans are the same there are still noticeable difference in development between different population groups. There's also the impact of sociological development, but that's another topic for another time.
They were a child of marriageable age, just because a law or custom might make it legal doesn't make it any more "right".
No. They were a woman at that age. They were an adult at that age. What people now think is irrelevant.
You don't get to decide at what point in a human's development is that human an adult. That's a decision undertaken by that individual's society. There's a baseline people agree to which is puberty, but that varies from individual to individual, and there's also a sociological threshold which fluctuates depending on the circumstances.
Now people wouldn't dream of letting their children be married at 18 or 21 years of age even though that's the legal threshold for adulthood. Why? Well we have graduate and postgraduate studies to endure as well as job ladders to climb. However in other parts of the same nation people are fine with their children getting married at such young ages since the sociological thresholds are different.

OKLAHOMA CITY - An Oklahoma organization and senator are teaming up to take on a law that focuses on a child's ability to read.
Right now, Oklahoma third graders are required to take the Reading Sufficiency Act before they can move on to the fourth grade.
But, not everyone supports the law.
“Tests serve a purpose, but they should never be the one time on one date to define a child,” said Katherine Bishop, vice president of the Oklahoma Education Association.
The Oklahoma Education Association and some lawmakers think the law punishes the child too much.
“The test doesn't do anything positive for the school, the students or the parent,” said Oklahoma Sen. J.J Dossett.
Dossett has introduced a measure eliminating the requirement third grade students be held back under the Reading Sufficiency Act.
However, they said it maintains support for struggling readers.
At the same time, Dossett wants to toss out the U.S. History assessment for high school students.
"I taught U.S. history for years at Owasso High School," Dossett said. "The test doesn't do anything positive."
“Our teachers, our students, our parents want more time on learning and less on testing," Bishop said.
However, other state leaders contend the Reading Sufficiency Act works.
In 2015, tests showed 85 percent of third graders passed the test and were prepared for fourth grade.
In a statement, Oklahoma State Superintendent Joy Hofmeister said "Our focus on early learning reading is working. Through RSA, we are reaching schoolchildren who need help the most. It is important that we continue to build momentum with literacy by fostering parent engagement with strategic interventions for students."
But, like most things in education, testing comes at a cost.
“Last year, we spent more than $17 million on state testing. Those are resources we need to give back to the classroom,” Bishop said.
The history test is not federally mandated like math, science and English.
Opponents we spoke with in the past fear, if students aren't tested on it, it won't be taught.
When you think of the most astute minds of our time, you might well think of Ray Bradbury's — but you probably don't think of them as one of the most astute terrorist minds of our time. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, however, saw things differently. Collaborative news site MuckRock found that out through files "released to former MuckRocker Inkoo Kang [which] document the decade the Bureau spent trying to determine if Bradbury was, if not a card-carrying Communist, at least a sympathetic 'fellow traveler.'" See snippets of documents here from 1959.
You can view the files themselves, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, at MuckRock. There, the site's JPat Brown also summarizes the organization's basis for suspicion against the author: their "membership in the Screen Writer's Guild, as well as their vocal opposition to McCarthyism, drew particular attention," as did the use in The Martian Chronicles of the "repeated theme that earthmen are despoilers and not developers." Not just Bradbury's work but the whole of science fiction, which informant Martin Berkeley calls a possibly "lucrative field for the introduction of Communist ideology," comes in for an indictment.
"Communists have found fertile opportunities for development," Berkeley says, "for spreading distrust and lack of confidence in America [sic] institutions in the area of Science Fiction writing." Another, unsurprisingly clearer view of the genre comes from Bradbury himself, quoted disapprovingly in the file from a 1959 Women's Legislative Action Bulletin. There, they said they use the medium of science fiction to "try to bring to light some of the current fallacies in human values today" — the one thing, as the author of Fahrenheit 451 must have known full well, that the powers that be the least want anybody to do.

Have you ever searched for a contact on LinkedIn only to have the networking site automatically prompt you to look up a man with a similar name? You're not alone. A recent investigation by the Seattle Times revealed a pervasive gender bias within the site's search algorithm that pointed users toward male profiles when they searched for some of the most common female names.
The Times cited the relatively-common female name "Stephanie Williams." Rather than yield results for the 2,500 women of the same name, a search for Stephanie would instead bring up a prompt asking if the user meant to search for "Stephen Williams" instead. Similar situations occurred when searching for an "Andrea Jones" (users are asked if they're looking for "Andrew Jones"), as well as for women named Danielle (Daniel), Michaela (Michael), and Alexa (Alex). But when users searched for men with one of the 100 most common male names, the site did not ask if they were looking for a female user with a similar name.
LinkedIn, however, denies any gender bias in its search tool. "The search algorithm is guided by relative frequencies of words appearing in past queries and member profiles, it is not anything to do [with] gender," a spokesperson told the BBC.
But, to make absolute certain that no such bias exists, the professional networking site has updated its search algorithm to remove any prompts suggesting alternative names. We can only assume this will mean big things for all the Stephanie Williamses of the world who missed out on countless new and exciting professional opportunities because recruiters couldn't actually search for them.

In the beginning, Gov. Cuomo was so very proud of SAFE that they wanted to claim credit for it. Now that it's unpopularity is becoming undeniable, they want to share the responsbility:
“… A Cuomo administration source is flatly denying the governor's claim that their new anti-gun SAFE Act was carefully drafted, saying the governor themselves wasn't even aware of some provisions when it was hastily enacted into law … “Much of what's in the law was drafted by people connected to Mayor Bloomberg and the Brady Center, not by the governor's staff,” the source said. “That's why there are so many problems with it.'' …”

Saskatoon, Saskatchewan resident Steve Simonar lost both of their arms in a tragic sailing accident almost 30 years ago. But it hasn't stopped them from living a normal life. They run a construction company, takes care of a family, and even manages to drive every single day. They have a modified vehicle that allows them to steer the car with their feet. But there are still some things that they simply can't do because of their disability. For instance, when they get into their modified car, they can't put on their seat belt. They have no arms, so it's an impossible task.
That didn't stop a Saskatoon police officer from giving Simonar a ticket for not wearing a seatbelt recently, though. Although Simonar says that most police officers who have pulled them over in the past for not wearing a seatbelt have let them off the hook, they were handed a $175 fine by an officer last week during an area-wide crackdown on drivers not wearing seat belts. And now, he's appealing the summons and wants the officer who wrote them the ticket to rip it up.
"I'm a rare bird," they said earlier this week, "and that's what kind of makes this whole thing stupid. I'm the exception to the rule and it has to be treated that way."
POST CONTINUES BELOW
We have to agree. We know that, by law, Simonar should be wearing a seatbelt. But simple logic explains why that's not possible. So why not cut the guy a break? Is the $175 really worth all the bad publicity the local police department is getting right now? Probably not.

[via Edmonton Journal]
"Will they or won't they?" has been the classic tantalizing question behind the romantic tensions between TV couples. It's the same for pandas, except there's more at stake.
Hopes were high among conservationists that female panda Tian Tian (Sweetie) and male panda Yang Guang (Sunshine) would mate during breeding season at the Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland. It appears they have "hit it off" and are attracted to each other, but so far they haven't actually had sex, and a successful mating between them has become more unlikely, according to a zoo statement released this week.
Experts had determined, based on hormone testing and behavioral observation, that this was the right time for the two exotic and adorable animals to meet. But, as the zoo stated, it was "close, but no cigar."
Pandas are an endangered species. There are less than 1,600 in the wild, and climate change threatens their natural habitat. That's why conservationists are so keen on the production of baby pandas - not just for more cuteness in the world, but to help the survival of the species.
Why is it so hard for pandas to have sex?
It's been long known that panda females experience sexual excitement only before ovulation, in a narrow window of time that occurs once a year. The window is open only 24 to 72 hours, sometime between February and May.
A new study in Papers-in-Press of the journal Biology of Reproduction suggests that seasonality also plays a role in male pandas' ability to mate in many important ways that have not been so closely examined before.
For instance, male pandas' sperm generally improves during the winter, reaches its best quality in March and April and declines in May; sperm production abruptly ends in June. Production of the male hormone testosterone, and other male reproductive indicators, also follow that pattern.
This seasonality is what's found in China, and is correlated with the number of hours of sunlight per day, said Copper Aitken-Palmer, veterinarian at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute and study leader.
"The more we understand what's normal, the better we are able to identify in captivity animals that may be different, and maybe identify the ones that are not as reproductively successful," they said.
In Australia, where seasons are reversed, pandas are still most reproductively fit in spring, even though the specific spring months are different in the southern hemisphere. The latitude of Scotland, being different from China, may even affect pandas there, they said.
"The more we're able to learn about giant pandas in general, the better we're able to provide or implement guidelines for their protection, or guidelines for their management in captivity," Aitken-Palmer said.
Update: A number of readers asked about artificial insemination in pandas. This is a common practice for captive pandas, Aitken-Palmer tells us. For instance, every baby panda born at Zoo Atlanta has been the result of artificial insemination, and most groups with giant pandas in the United States, Europe and China participate in assisted reproduction techniques.
So, the big news is that alongside Erosion Mod integration and the new health/medical system we've got a third prong to the Build 30 trident – the return of local split-screen co-op and fixed gamepad controls! More on this in but a few paragraphs' time!
Current Build
After having it on the brew for what feels like an ice-age, we had a few last minute hang-ups with releasing 29.4 into the wild last week – rather predictably just after saying we'd likely release it on Tuesdoid and ‘all systems go yay'. It's been in our public IWBUMS test group over the weekend, and showed no major signs of misbehaving – so now it's released! We're aware you heard the same thing last week, and apologise again for this, but as long as the wider Steam audience doesn't flag anything then Build 29 can now be considered final and we can finally update Desura.
Build 30
Build 30 [current addition and changelist here] is in quite good nick – not yet in internal testing, but good enough that we allowed lovely Tooks to stream a playthrough over the weekend. You can have a peek at their two dabbles here and here. This, in turn, flagged up a load of now-fixed bugs, so pushing it into a state where a proper internal test build doesn't feel far away at all.
Given the number of additions and complexity of what's going into Build 30 we anticipate that its internal testing will be slightly longer than that experienced by its predecessors – but once it hits public IWBUMS testing it should've been worth the wait.
To keep your anticipating engines running RJ and EP are going to try to hook up another super-french preview video for you next Mondoid.
Split-Screen Co-Op and Gamepad Control: The Return
The redoubtable EasyPickins has been hard at work polishing and improving on the old model of split-screen that we first bundled into our Rezzed build all that time ago. What can you expect aside from four player split-screen play and improved controller support?
Tap ‘A' on a controller and you'll get some options that will let you: take over an existing on-screen player 1, add a new player via the character creation screen and (if previously created) add in an existing co-op character.
All co-op characters are now saved automatically, just as they are in SP. They appear in the game's save directory in files called map_p1.bin, map_p2.bin etc
It is now possible to play split-screen MP online. The first player logs in to a server, then co-op players hit the A button once in-game just like in SP. Co-op players don't need to log in, but we do have to juggle issues like MP co-op players having the same username – likewise we'll have to work out what to do with in-game chat.
Sleeping in local co-op will now work in that players can go to sleep separately, but time will only speed up when you're both asleep. This currently leads to hilarity [well, slight amusement] as the player snoozing first does so standing up.

The growing role of Edward O'Callaghan, who until six weeks ago served as co-chief of the terrorism and national security unit of the U.S. attorney's office in New York, illustrates just how seriously the McCain campaign is taking the so-called "troopergate" inquiry into Palin's firing last summer of Walt Monegan, Alaska's Public Safety Commissioner.
O'Callaghan emerged publicly for the first time this week when they told reporters at a McCain campaign press conference, in Anchorage, that Palin is "unlikely to cooperate" with an Alaskan legislative inquiry into Monegan's firing because it had been "tainted" by politics. That new stand appeared to directly contradict a previous vow, expressed by their official gubernatorial spokesperson on July 28, that Palin "will fully cooperate" with an investigation into the matter.
But O'Callaghan (who resigned from the U.S. attorney's office at the end of July to join the McCain campaign) is doing more than just public relations when it comes to "troopergate." They told NEWSWEEK that they and another McCain campaign lawyer (whom they declined to identify) are serving as legal "consultants" to Thomas Van Flein, the Anchorage lawyer who at state expense is representing Palin and their office in the inquiry. "We are advising Thomas Van Flein on this matter to the extent that it impacts on the national campaign," they said. "I'm helping out on legal strategy."
The Disneyland Resort is in the middle of an average summer season. The crowds are swelling, schools are shuttering for the season, and the parks are becoming packed with locals and visitors alike. There is still plenty to do and enjoy, but it takes a little planning and patience. Still, Disneyland and California Adventure really look wonderful and as smoothly as can be expected with the increased level of crowding. Let's stroll through both parks and see what happened this week.
DISNEYLAND DOING WHAT IT DOES BEST
It happens every summer: the schools let out, the pass holders swarm, and the tourists converge. Yet, somehow, Disneyland absorbs huge crowds and still maintains its sense of charm and intimacy.
Main Street U.S.A. is bustling with traffic, both human and otherwise. Being the first impression anyone gets of the park, it sets the right tone for things to come.
The premium prices to get into the park is almost always a shock to visitors. But, once they see such beautiful care given to the horticulture and sets on display, it certainly softens the blow.
BIG THUNDER REFURB
The wildest ride in the wilderness continues on its scheduled refurbishment as details return to the attraction. Along the track, more of the ornamental railroad ties are being carefully installed to give it the authentic, mine train look. Along the load and unload area, Rainbow Ridge is nearing completion and work is well underway at the station.
No official date for the return of the attraction has been set, but Disney has said that it will come back sometime in the fall. We will keep you posted.
NEW ORLEANS SQUARE TRAIN STATION
The newly refurbished New Orleans Square is just now enjoying a stunning blossom display from its newly planted flowers. New Guinea Impatiens, known for their deep hued, vibrant leaves and blossoms, now blanket the hillside with a blaze of magentas and reds.
The relaunched Disney California Adventure has now officially been operating for a full year. As indicated by the Theme Park attendance numbers recently released, the park has exceeded every expectation. This proves that if you build a quality theme park, guests will appear.
Even all the way to the far ends of Paradise Pier, the property is teaming with visitors. The Walt Disney Company should be very proud of what they have accomplished at DCA. But there is still much to be done in the park to bring all areas up to the Cars Land/Buena Vista Street standard.
BLUE SKY CELLAR LOOKS TOWARD THE PAST
All compliments aside, the Imagineers really need to shift their focus onto the Blue Sky Cellar. The last change came in January, when it began featuring the Princess Fantasy Faire and Mickey and the Magical Map. But now, with both of those attractions finished and opened, the exhibit serves little purpose.
Will we see a closure soon to feature a Monsters Inc Door coaster ride? Heck, even an exhibit featuring the new Disney Fantasy cruise ship would be an improvement (though, we'd like to see this space remain theme park centric).

Zoo Knoxville officials said Saturday that 33 reptiles died at the zoo, including rare and endangered species, from an unknown event earlier in the week.
Zoo workers found 30 snakes and a lizard, all housed in the same building in the zoo's reptile area, dead on Wednesday morning. The zoo's animal clinic and veterinarians from the University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine were called in to investigate. The surviving animals were evacuated from the building.
Lisa New, president and CEO of Zoo Knoxville, said Sunday night that the zoo believes the deaths were not due to disease but "an environmental cause," although additional autopsy results are pending.
New said in a news release Saturday that the loss was a tragic event for the zoo, as several endangered or threatened species breeding programs were lost.
“This is a devastating and catastrophic loss to our zoo,” they said. “These animals were important ambassadors who helped so many people understand the role snakes and lizards play in the balance of nature.

“We also lost breeding programs for several endangered and threatened species,” they added. “It is especially difficult for our herpetologists who have dedicated their careers to caring for and advocating for these animals.”

The building where the event happened was home to 52 animals before the event and has been closed while an investigation continues. No other buildings in the reptile area were affected. Three critically endangered species were lost during the event, the Louisiana pine snake, the Catalina Island rattlesnake and the Aruba Island rattlesnake. Popular snakes killed included a forest cobra and an albino Eastern diamondback rattlesnake.
Zoo officials said the building was under inspection by KUB and other agencies to try to determine what caused the deaths. What caused the deaths, however, did not target just snakes, but the building housed a majority of the snake population.
Some of the animals lost were on exhibit in the building, but others were not. So far, no correlation has been drawn between exhibit status and survival.

1. Before Thor had even debuted at the box office Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige announced that "Don Payne is working on story ideas for a part two", something which at the time was "news to me" for original movie director Kenneth Branagh.In the end Branagh decided to withdraw from directing any sequel because they felt "it was a long time [making the first film] and [Marvel's production schedule was] way too quick for me to get straight back into another". And so on October 13th 2011 Marvel announced that Patty Jenkins (Monster) would direct the Thor sequel.2. At this time Feige revealed that Thor 2 would be "primarily about the journey of [Thor] and Jane Foster and how the new dynamic with their father is working out". Natalie Portman revealed how excited they were about the story direction and working with Patty Jenkins, and then 6 weeks later Jenkins backed out of the project due to "creative differences". Portman was publicly upset about this and some sources even claim they tried to get out of their contract and not reprise their role of Jane Foster. Unfortunately (for her, or the rest of us - you pick a side!) they aren't successful.3. By the end of 2011 Alan Taylor had come on board as director. At this time Loki was not featured in Don Payne's original treatment, with the focus said to be more on Malekith and the Dark Elves, but by January 2012 Robert Rodat had been bought in to rewrite the sequel, and also under instruction to include Loki. After early test screenings for The Avengers showed how much audiences liked Loki, the script was rewritten again to give them an even bigger role.4. One of the plot lines that was dropped to make more room for Loki was to feature Jane Foster turned into a villain by the Aether and destroying Svartalfheim as a show of their power before going to Earth. Rodat felt that ti has three villains would be overkill, and take more focus away from Malekith.5. Talking of Malekith, before Christopher Eccleston was cast Mads Mikkelsen was offered for the role. But they dropped out due to being offered the TV show, Hannibal.6. Josh Dallas was supposed to return as Fandral but their commitment with to the TV show Once Upon a Time prevented them from returning, so they were replaced with Zachary Levi, who just happened to be the original choice for the role back during casting of Thor.7. When Thor: The Dark World started shooting it went under the working title Thursday Mourning. This was also the code name the film when it was shipped to theaters. And if you've not brushed up on your Norse then one of the origins of Thursday is after their Thordagr (Thor's Day)8. The scene where Jane Foster and Thor first meet and they slap them had to be shot several times because Natalie Portman kept 'fake slapping' them Chris Hemsworth to avoid actually hurting him. By the end of it, after about 30 takes, they were slapping them for real.Likewise, as revealed on the DVD bloopers section, the scene where Jane Foster first meets Loki called for them to punch him. In the end Portman actually did hit him, hard! But this time around it only took their five takes to get it right.9. During the shoot Joss Whedon was brought in to do some uncredited rewrites for a few scenes, including the extremely brief encounter with the stone creature (which was originally a much longer scene) and the scene with Loki briefly masquerading as Captain America in a hallway conversation with Thor.10. Finally according to Natalie Portman they were not available to film the post-credit scene where Thor and Jane Foster finally kiss, only seeing it for the first time when the movie premiered. They revealed that their stand-in for that shot was Elsa Pataky, Chris Hemsworth's actual wife.

Calling imprisoned Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti a Palestinian leader and parliamentarian is like calling Syrian President Bashar Assad a pediatrician, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated in a press release Tuesday. "These are murderers, these are terrorists and we will not lose clarity," they added.
Israeli politicians from across the political spectrum fiercely condemned The New York Times for publishing an op-ed by Barghouti that neglected to mention that they are in prison for murder, not their political views.
The NY Times adds an Editors' Note at the bottom of column by convicted murderer Marwan Barghouti clarifying that he's a convicted murderer. pic.twitter.com/ig9iaF7Lh8 — Yair_Zivan (@Yair_Zivan) April 17, 2017
Barghouti was convicted in June 2004 of five murders and an attempted murder, including that of a Greek Orthodox priest they mistook for a rabbi. They were sentenced to five consecutive life sentences and 40 additional years in prison. But the newspaper's tagline on the article called them a Palestinian leader and parliamentarian.The Times later added on its website that Barghouti was a convicted murderer.Palestinian prisoners in Israel prepare for a massive hunger strike. (Reuters)"This article explained the writer's prison sentence but neglected to provide sufficient context by stating the offense of which they were convicted," the Editor's Note clarifies in its addendum."They were five counts of murder and membership in a terrorist organization. Mr. Barghouti declined to offer a defense at their trial and refused to recognize the Israeli court's jurisdiction and legitimacy," it added.Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Michael Oren (Kulanu) compared Barghouti to Dylann Roof, an American mass murderer and white supremacist convicted of killing nine people in the June 2015 Charleston church shooting.“Shame on NYT for printing libelous op-ed by convicted killer Barghouti, the Palestinian Dylann Roof,” Oren wrote on Twitter. “Americans would be horrified. So are we.”Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely said the Times' decision to “print an article by a terrorist without mentioning that they killed Jews in cold blood just because they were Jewish is not freedom of expression but anarchy."“When a newspaper that considers itself important grants murderers a platform it gives legitimacy and a prize to terror,” Hotovely said.Bayit Yehudi chairperson Naftali Bennett posted on Facebook a picture of Yoela Chen, a mother of two who was murdered at a gas station on their way to a wedding by terrorists under orders from Barghouti. Bennett noted that as the commander of Fatah's Tanzim paramilitary offshoot, Barghouti was behind the murders of dozens of Israelis.“Marwan Barghouti is not just an enemy,” Bennett wrote. “He is a lowly murderer who should rot in prison until the day they die.”Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid wrote in The Times of Israel that “the attempt by The New York Times ‘to be balanced' amuses Barghouti, who understands that this sacred attempt at balance creates equal standing between murderer and murdered, terrorist and victim, lie and truth."“Instead of saying to them – as a responsible newspaper should – that if they don't have a shred of evidence to support their stories then they can't be published, The New York Times published them in its opinion pages and didn't even bother to explain to its readers that the author is a convicted murderer of the worst kind,” Lapid wrote.Transportation and Intelligence Minister Israel Katz called for the death penalty for terrorists on Twitter, stating, "When a despicable murdered such as Barghouti protests for improved prison conditions, while the relatives of the murdered are still hurting, there is only one solution- the death penalty for terrorists."Katz told FM103 that they support the death penalty for terrorists that commit extreme murders such as the murderers of the Fogel family.

Seal has revealed that they and Heidi Klum still love each other and are good friends following their separation, making everyone wonder exactly why the Hollywood couple have decided to part ways.
Not only did Seal gush about Heidi on television interview, but they have been snapped wearing their wedding ring while out in LA.
They told Ellen Degeneres: “Yes, I am still wearing my ring. I think it's just pretty much a token of how I feel about this woman. We have eight years.
“Just because we have decided to separate doesn't necessarily mean you take off your ring and you're no longer connected to that person.
“We will be connected in many ways ‘til the rest of our lives…. through our children and also through this tremendous admiration, respect and love that we have for each other.”
The singer is currently promoting their album in the US and gave a number of interviews yesterday following the official announcement of their separation.
(Image: Telepictures/Ruckas Pictures)
Although many thought that Seal would be angry following the split – with Heidi apparently being the one who will file for divorce – the Brit was happy to talk about it and said nothing but lovely things about their estranged supermodel wife.
Seal also chatted to Tavis Smiley on PBS, telling the host that and they and Heidi will remain civil and professional throughout their separation.

They said: “What one has to do in this situation is to remain civil, to retain one's dignity, to be professional, and to understand that we are not the only people on this planet that are going through this.
“Of course it's a difficult situation that we have to handle right now and it's never easy. In terms of our love and respect for each other, that hasn't changed at all.
“Just because you decide to separate, I don't think you all of the sudden stop loving each other. I don't think you all of the sudden stop becoming friends.”
Firstly, it's all of A sudden. Secondly, why the hell are these two splitting up if they feel this way about each other?
Saying that, Heidi may not feel the same way – according to rumours they decided to end the marriage because Seal had an 'inability to control their temper', which was starting to affect the children. TMZ claimed that they were also sick of their ‘hard partying'.
Seal and Heidi released a joint statement yesterday morning, which said the pair had simply grown apart. It read: “While we have enjoyed seven very loving, loyal and happy years of marriage, after much soul-searching we have decided to separate. We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart.
“This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition. We thank our family, friends, and fans for their kind words of support.
“And for our children's sake, we appreciate you respecting our privacy.”

Le terrorisme effraie et exaspère. Il marque les esprits, influence les lois, les comportements de certains, et a un coût économique notable (personnel de surveillance, impact sur le tourisme…). Mais il n'a pas atteint son objectif.
Un objectif stratégique clair
L'objectif de l'État islamique (EI) est le califat mondial, c'est-à-dire le gouvernement des populations de la planète, musulmanes ou pas, par un héritier du Prophète. Les non-musulmans y auront un statut inférieur. Cela par la conquête, comme l'ont fait les premiers califes au 7è siècle, ce qui est cohérent avec le retour à l'islam de cette période, prêché par les salafistes.
El Bagdhadi, qui s'est auto-désigné calife à Mossoul le 29 juin 2014, le rappelle dans ses discours et l'enseigne à ses troupes. Cette désignation n'a été reconnue par aucune autorité musulmane ni par aucun groupe djihadiste, à part le sien.
Ce califat est évidemment une utopie, qui ignore notamment le nationalisme des grands pays musulmans, à commencer par la Turquie voisine, et plus encore le mode de fonctionnement des sociétés occidentales. Mais cette utopie nourrit le terrorisme.
À plus court terme, l'EI étant en mauvaise posture militaire, il s'agit de décourager les pays qui luttent contre lui, tant sur son territoire syro-irakien que sur ses prolongements au Sud, où il se trouve notamment face à l'armée française au Sahel. Il cherche donc à affaiblir ces pays, et cela par deux moyens s'agissant des pays occidentaux : perturber gravement leur fonctionnement et déclencher des représailles anti-musulmanes pour les affaiblir encore plus par une guerre civile « asymétrique ».
Une perturbation très limitée en Occident
« Très limitée » ? N'est-ce pas du mépris pour les victimes ? C'est simplement la constatation que si leur vie et celle de leurs proches est effectivement bouleversée, cela n'empêche pas le fonctionnement des pays touchés.
Il y a eu quelques dizaines de terroristes, la plupart du temps des délinquants fraîchement « radicalisés » et des centaines de victimes dans l'ensemble des pays occidentaux. C'est-à-dire rien par rapport aux 900 millions d'Occidentaux dont environ 30 millions de musulmans, d'ailleurs eux aussi victimes des attentats.
Même le 11 septembre et ses milliers de victimes, œuvre d'El Qaïda et non de l'EI, n'a perturbé que psychologiquement la vie américaine, et encore de façon limitée et provisoire. Matériellement, ni l'économie ni même la finance, métier principal des victimes, n'ont cessé de fonctionner normalement.
Et y aurait-il demain 2 voire 3 fois plus de terroristes et de victimes que ça ne changerait rien. L'impact sur le tourisme ne devrait pas être durable, d'autant que les étrangers constatent que les attentats ont lieu dans tous les pays et notamment dans le leur. Donc que voyager n'est pas plus dangereux que de rester chez soi. Les principaux indicateurs de l'économie française sont d'ailleurs en progression depuis quelques mois.
Pas de cycle de représailles
En Orient et ailleurs, la tradition ancienne et profondément enracinée des représailles ouvre des cycles sans fin de violences réciproques, qui finissent par faire s'écrouler des clans, des tribus voire des régions entières. L'EI espère donc susciter des réactions anti musulmanes violentes puis des contre-représailles pour aboutir à un enchaînement se terminant par une guérilla généralisée.
Ce serait une guerre « asymétrique » contre laquelle une armée régulière est peu efficace, et qui nécessite des effectifs très nombreux du côté du maintien de l'ordre. Mais la société occidentale est différente de l'orientale, les crimes et autres actions violentes y donnent lieu à des réactions juridiques et non à des représailles physiques, du moins tant que la démocratie fonctionne.
Et ni la masse des Européens, ni celle des musulmans occidentaux n'a visé physiquement l'autre communauté. L'individualisme des sociétés occidentales, souvent dénoncé par toutes les religions, va ici dans le bon sens.
Néanmoins une frange des Occidentaux, déjà plus qu'agacés par les tenants du relativisme et du multiculturalisme, commence à s'impatienter. Souhaitant aller au-delà des mesures nécessaires à une meilleure efficacité de la lutte contre les terroristes, elle ne se rend pas compte qu'elle fait exactement ce qu'ils souhaitent en inondant les réseaux sociaux d'injures anti musulmanes. Et là, l'EI a marqué un point : la suspicion puis le rejet des réfugiés, qui aggravera la haine de l'Occident.
Par ailleurs, les djihadistes affaiblissent leur propre religion.
L'évolution religieuse
Dans un premier temps les réactions des musulmans d'Occident ont été « Nous ne sommes pas concernés, ces terroristes ne suivent pas le véritable islam ». Aujourd'hui, le vocabulaire religieux du terrorisme devient un repoussoir et on note le passage d'un nombre croissant de musulmans vers l'athéisme ou le christianisme, évangélique surtout.
Les missionnaires de ce protestantisme sont actifs dans le monde entier et le terrorisme leur donne des arguments de conversion. Ce troisième échec du terrorisme est resté discret jusqu'à présent, s'agissant d'évolutions personnelles pouvant couper de la communauté, quoique dans l'autre sens, la conversion permette une intégration sociale dont les pays comme l'Allemagne où le protestantisme est vivace. Beaucoup de musulmans qualifiés étaient d'ailleurs venus en Occident pour échapper à la pression socio-religieuse dont l'EI est le promoteur extrême.
Analyse n'est pas complaisance
Pour être efficace dans la lutte anti-terroriste, il faut commencer par analyser et comprendre, non seulement le contexte social et religieux, mais aussi l'extrême décentralisation de l'action de l'EI, qui se contente souvent d'inspirer plus que d'organiser : « Le terrorisme est ubérisé » nous dit le criminologue Alain Bauer. La maison mère se borne à quelques – très efficaces – vidéos de propagande, et le terroriste se procure lui-même des armes très simples : une camionnette, un marteau, un couteau.
Analyser et comprendre est une étape nécessaire que l'on confond trop souvent avec la complaisance. Cette dernière existe effectivement dans certains cercles : le terme « multiculturalisme » y est proclamé comme l'enrichissement qu'est la connaissance d'autres cultures, alors qu'en pratique il s'agit au contraire d'un « multi-monoculturalisme » c'est-à-dire la cohabitation de groupes ignorant la culture des autres.
La complaisance en repli
Mais cette naïveté ou complaisance semble en repli. Par exemple avec la découverte à gauche « du racisme de l'antiracisme » (accepter un comportement communautariste sous prétexte que ladite communauté est victime du racisme). Ou, à l'extrême gauche, avec les doutes sur « l'islamisme acteur révolutionnaire », qu'il fallait naguère soutenir pour détruire la société contre laquelle on lutte.
Il semble donc qu'une convergence soit possible et que l'on puisse éviter le piège des réactions communautaristes tout en menant une lutte intelligente et adaptée. Donc sans hystérie xénophobe, mais sans compromis ni complaisance.
L'ennemi veut abattre les fondements de nos sociétés : liberté religieuse, laïcité, liberté d'expression, droits de l'homme, égalité des sexes. Cette lutte doit toucher tous les domaines, du principal, l'éducation, aux plus quotidiens comme la présence des femmes dans les cafés.
Je suis optimiste quant à l'issue de ce combat, l'islamisme, et pas seulement sa version violente, le djihadisme, étant d'abord une réaction à la modernisation des sociétés musulmanes, or cette modernisation me semble irréversible en Occident et souvent amorcée au Sud.

Five years ago, as crowds of Egyptians, Tunisians, Libyans, Syrians, Bahrainis, and Yemenis rose up to demand the fall of their regimes, Palestinians were often seen as sitting out the upheaval. Only now is it apparent that events in Palestine do fit into a broader regional pattern — institutions have decayed; authoritarianism anchored in security services more nakedly dominates governance; youths show signs of political alienation; and political activists show far greater success at challenging existing authorities than in replacing them.
Why the protests failed
Back in 2011, attempts by Palestinian activists to jump-start their own uprising fizzled. It was not for lack of trying. Whereas all other protest movements in the region sought isqat an-nizam (the fall of the regime), Palestinians sought inha' al-inqisam (the end of the division between the West Bank and Gaza) and later al-‘awda ila Filastin (return to Palestine). On March 15, Palestinian youth rallied against the split and organized demonstrations in Gaza and the West Bank. On May 15, protests turned their attention to marching on Israel's borders from Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and within the West Bank and Gaza. Both efforts attracted much attention but led to little follow-through.
The failure of the protests is easy to explain: first, Palestinians have little faith in revolution as a means of ending the five decades-long occupation. Neither the mass-led first intifada, the armed second intifada, successive rocket salvos from Gaza nor the recent spate of stabbings and car rammings have led Palestinians to believe in the promises of revolutionary activity, or risk the high costs.
Second, the Palestinian national leadership in 2011 was – and still is – deeply divided, weak on legitimacy and incapable of guiding Palestinians on tactics, let alone grand strategy.
Third, Palestinians had no clear target for protests; disaffected by the Palestinian Authority (PA), Hamas and Israel protesters could not agree on which regime to undo.
Palestinian leaders and institutions have lost legitimacy
But if Palestine's rulers in Ramallah and Gaza won the battle of 2011, they may now be losing the war. It is just not clear who, if anybody, is winning. Deep changes are at work in Palestinian society and politics.
In a recent paper for the Carnegie Endowment, we show how official Palestinian institutions and leaders have lost their moral legitimacy in the eyes of the Palestinian people. The PLO, the Palestinian Authority, Fatah and even Hamas — the movements and institutions that have emerged over decades to speak on Palestinians' behalf and lead them — have lost their moral claims in the eyes of their own people. They are seen as ineffective and even co-opted; while those who head them continue to occupy positions of authority, they can no longer lead.
The “peace process” that gave birth to the PA works only now in the area of security coordination between PA forces and Israel; in Gaza, Hamas has lost standing but similarly retains control through security forces and political controls that silence other voices.
The new moral vanguard
There is leadership in Palestinian society, but it takes new forms. Since Israel began construction of a wall in 2003, a robust civil society rooted in the discourse of international law has acted independent of Palestinian institutions — and with great effect. Groups like the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), the Palestinians Grassroots Anti-Apartheid Wall Campaign (also known as Stop the Wall), the Popular Struggle Coordinating Committee (PSCC) and, most vocally, the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement serve as a loosely organized network of the new moral vanguard, pitching ethical standards to a diverse audience of consumers, laborers, politicians, educators, artists, farmers, and business leaders.
The new moral vanguard is in no position to unseat the official leadership — nor does it wish to — but the new leaders' emphasis on international law has made an indelible mark on resistance discourse.
The future of Palestine
Where are the decline of the old institutions and the rise of a diffuse new moral vanguard leading Palestinians? That is not clear for two reasons — and the despair with the current situation and the desire for something to change means that not everybody is unhappy that the direction is unclear.
First, there has been a shift in Palestinian attention from national strategy and ends to shorter-term tactics. The whole raison d'être of the Palestinian national movement for generations; the effort to build a Palestinian state no longer exercises its former hold. Yes, there is some debate among Palestinians about ultimate goals and strategy, with the two-state solution and diplomacy losing their prominence. But nothing is clearly replacing them.
While we cannot deny that there is some growing interest in various one-state alternatives somehow combining Israelis and Palestinians, what seems more significant is the tendency to defer questions of solutions in favor of developing tactics that can improve the Palestinian position — such as new forms of resistance and boycott.
A new generation of Palestinians that is not cowed by memories of the tribulations of the last uprising is stepping forward. It is already having deep political effects but seems uninterested or unable — at least for now — in leading Palestinians toward any particular strategic goal.
Second, the new forms of politics seem to avoid institutions, at least the ones that exist. Rights-based activists are justifiably concerned that official leadership institutions might coopt and defang their initiatives, much like Jibril Rajoub, a Fatah strongman, did when they championed — and eventually abandoned — the Palestinian effort to eject Israel from FIFA.
Activists have been careful to avoid linking with the PA, PLO, or any of the factions for the preservation of their own autonomy, but they pay a price: with a set of movements that operate outside of official structures, Palestinians will find it difficult to develop strategies, make decisions that bind skeptics or negotiate authoritatively. Like other activists in the Arab world, Palestine's vanguard seems adept at challenging official structures, but incapable of supplanting them.
Only hints of actual change
The current wave of contention — a low-grade and unorganized series of violent attacks against Israeli soldiers, police, and civilians — reflects a tremendous political malaise: leaders are devoid of strategy, incapable of stopping the violence or guiding it toward a specific end; institutions are anemic; and rights-based activists continue their struggle with little chance of undoing the many regimes they oppose.
The result mirrors the status of contentious politics across the Arab world five years after the Arab Spring: robust but diffuse activism, stubborn but tested authoritarianism and only hints of actual political change.

A private member's bill from a Liberal MP to strengthen Canada's animal welfare laws has gone down in defeat after most of their Grit colleagues, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, voted against it.
Nathaniel Erskine-Smith's Bill C-246 — the Modernizing Animal Protections Act — was defeated Wednesday in second reading by a vote of 198 to 84. Thirty-six New Democrats and two Conservatives — Calgary's Michelle Rempel and Len Webber — voted in support.

A total of 117 Liberal MPs voted against the bill.
The Toronto MP told The Huffington Post Canada that they knew all along that private member's bills don't often become law. While many are “symbolic,” they said, their proposal tried for some substantive changes.
“The goal of a private member's bill, first and foremost, is to put an issue on the government's agenda that wasn't on the government's agenda before,” Erskine-Smith said.
The MP said they were confident that Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould will act to improve animal protection laws.
“And that's better, in the end,” they said. “It's better for a government to take action, consult, and have legislation that will garner the support of more members in the House.”
Sought to change several laws
Their proposed legislation originally sought to ban the import of shark fins, as well as the sale of cat and dog fur in Canada. It also attempted to amend Criminal Code provisions related to animal abuse, negligence, fighting, and bestiality.
If passed, the bill would have created a new offence for individuals who cause suffering to animals through “gross negligence.” It's currently a crime to cause animal pain through “willful” neglect, something the lawyer said is difficult for Crown prosecutors to prove.
Veteran Conservative MP Robert Sopuck blasted the bill shortly after it was tabled in February as “fundamentally flawed.” Sopuck also said it was an omnibus bill because of the many laws it sought to change in one shot.
Sopuck helped found the Conservative hunting and angling caucus in 2012, a group of Tory MPs who advocate for hunters, anglers, and trappers. They also serve as their party's critic for wildlife conservation and Parks Canada.

The Tory MP voiced concerns last March about the idea of moving animals out of the property section of the Criminal Code and placing them into the public morals section. They said such a step would have “drastic implications” for farmers, hunters, trappers, anglers, and medical researchers.
Sopuck took to Twitter Wednesday to say the House voted “overwhelmingly” against the “terribly flawed bill.”

In an attempt to save the bill and get it to committee for further study, Erskine-Smith proposed amendments to their colleagues last week that would abandon moving animal cruelty laws to the property section of the Criminal Code and outlaw “brutal and vicious” killings of animals, The Toronto Star reports.
The MP told the House of Commons they were ready to see the bill gutted at committee to focus on three things:
The “gross negligence” provision
Expanding the definition of animal fighting
Changing the definition of bestiality in light of the Supreme Court's decision in June that the crime must involve penetration. Erskine-Smith's bill would define bestiality as, simply, sexual activity between a person and animal.
Erskine-Smith also took to Facebook last week with a video endorsement from hockey commentator Don Cherry.
“Canada has the worst laws about our poor animals than any other place in the Western world, believe it or not,” Cherry said.
Erskine-Smith maintains that Canada's animal welfare laws haven't been substantively changed since 1892.

Everybody has joined this party.
From Centennial Hills to Southern Highlands, and from Summerlin to Sunrise Mountain, home values in every local ZIP code soared in 2013.
That's according to a new housing appreciation map from real estate research company SalesTraq, which shows double-digit percentage gains in all but one area ZIP code.
It's important to note that the numbers are averages, and your specific house value may have risen more or less depending on everything from the number of foreclosures on your block to how tricked out your home interior is.
But in general, widespread appreciation offers broad economic benefits to the Las Vegas Valley.
To understand how broad, look first at how many home values in each corner of the valley improved.
WHAT HAPPENED
Every ZIP code enjoyed a 2013 boost, ranging from a low of 6.9 percent in Boulder City's 89005 to a high of 53.2 percent in 89107, around Decatur Boulevard and U.S. Highway 95.
Improvement was “quite broad,” said Heidi Kasama, president of the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors.
“It's a very healthy appreciation map,” they said.
The ZIP code map also tracks what association numbers show the market has been doing, with average annual gains of 20 percent to 30 percent in the past year.
“Appreciation helps stabilize homeowners' personal balance sheets,” said Brian Gordon, a SalesTraq principal. “It moves a significant number of borrowers from the red into the black in terms of home equity. The financial profile of local homeowners has improved dramatically as a number of folks finally have their head above water. From a psychological standpoint, it has consumers feeling better about the economy and their personal financial situation.”
You can see the economic effects in other indicators, Gordon said. Take taxable sales, which have seen healthy growth for more than two years, driven largely by increased consumer spending on furniture, cars and meals out.
Before you get too excited, remember that values are up a lot only because they fell so much during the recession.
The median price of a local existing home peaked at $290,000 in June 2006, and plunged to a low of $100,000 in January 2012, SalesTraq data show. In 2008 and 2009, every ZIP code saw double-digit percentage pricing declines.
The median recovered to $158,000 by February, up 21.5 percent from $130,000 in February 2013. That, in turn, was up 28.7 percent from $101,000 in February 2012.
So even though the percentages look strong, market values are nowhere near their apex.
The market's appreciation is also a function of collapsing bank-owned inventory, said local real estate agent Tim Kelly Kiernan, broker-owner of Kelly Realty Group at Re/Max Extreme. Nevada's Homeowners Bill of Rights took effect Oct. 1, making it harder to foreclose on delinquent loans. Combine that slumping supply with relatively strong investor demand, and an appreciation spike was inevitable, they said.
But not everyone equally felt 2013's upward bump.
ZIP-BY-ZIP
Some ZIP codes are considerably closer than others to pre-recession pricing, despite smaller 2013 percentage gains.
In Summerlin's 89138, appreciation clocked in at 21.1 percent — about half of the rate of some city center ZIPs. Yet, 89138 posted Southern Nevada's highest median price, at nearly $285,000.
The story was similar in 89135, also in Summerlin. There, appreciation was 15.8 percent, even as the median reached $282,000. In Anthem's 89052, prices jumped 15.9 percent, to a median of $269,000.
Meanwhile, the opposite happened in the urban core, where percentage gains were white-hot even as median prices languished well below pre-recession levels.
In downtown's 89101 ZIP, prices spiked 49.7 percent, to a median of $69,000. Around Sahara Avenue and Valley View Boulevard, homes in 89102 appreciated 41.2 percent, to $120,000. In 89107, where prices soared 53.2 percent, the median was still just $95,000.
The city's center may have had better percentage gains than the suburbs in 2013, but that's because the core is still trying to catch up to the outskirts, where values have been improving for three years.
“It's a shift from what we saw in 2012, when more mature ZIP codes in the central and eastern parts of the valley struggled to maintain values,” Gordon said. “It's a function of timing. Those areas are lagging some of the earlier gains we saw in areas that stabilized much more quickly. So in 2013, areas that were harder-hit started to see greater gains in percentage terms. Suburban areas have less catching up to do.”
Homeowners in the urban center and suburban areas shouldn't expect the party to last through 2014.
And that's not a bad thing.
MODERATION IS GOOD
Remember 2004 and 2005? Gordon does, and they said it wasn't pretty — or sustainable.
“We were witnessing double-digit appreciation on top of double-digit appreciation, and prices during that time frame escalated well beyond the buying power of consumers. Incomes were not aligned with values at that time, and that, combined with the economic downturn, made conditions throughout the valley shift the other way. We went from the country's fastest-appreciating market to its fastest-depreciating market.”
Yet, even if the latest numbers mirror appreciation rates in 2004, that doesn't mean the market is vulnerable to another bubble, Gordon said.
“Absolute price points have adjusted, and have aligned much more with where incomes are today, and the buyer profile is starting to adjust. The amount of speculation and investor acquisitions in the market are starting to subside, and investors are divesting themselves of some assets. Distress is leaving the market.”
The mix of properties on the market is also changing. Two-thirds of local properties sold today are equity or nondistressed sales — a reversal of trends three years ago. Also, three out of 10 local homeowners are underwater, down from more than six in 10 in 2012.
“All of that suggests a much more stable environment,” Gordon said. “The supply-and-demand dynamics in the Las Vegas housing market are much more stable than they've been probably at any time in the last decade.”
Given that stability, don't expect 2014's appreciation map to keep up with 2013's version.
Because the market has worked through a big chunk of its inexpensive, distressed homes, investor interest is starting to wane, Gordon said. Sales will be driven more by people who are buying a place to live in.
“As availability creeps north, and the demand side of the equation becomes more sustainable, overall price appreciation is likely to slow,” they said.
Kasama noted that appreciation has already slowed noticeably in the past seven months, with the median single-family home price hovering at $185,000 to $195,000 since September, according to the Realtors' association.
“We might see small, steady increases, but I don't think you can have the type of appreciation we had in 2013 again in 2014,” they said.
Still, while no ZIP code will see a surge of 20 percent to 40 percent this year, some codes should fare better than average.
Expect stable prices in the suburbs, and perhaps a little more ground gained in the city's center, as the urban core's “absolute price position” attracts investors and owner-occupiers alike, Gordon said.
But Kiernan forecasts flat to “minimal” appreciation rates across the board.
For-sale inventory has more than doubled, from 4,200 units in April 2013 to 9,000 today. Another 48,000 homes remain in some stage of foreclosure, they said.
“I think we're still going to have to take another hit of some kind, hopefully not one as bad as we took in the last recession,” Kiernan said. “If those 48,000 homes go through foreclosure or short sale, common sense says we'll have to take a value hit. We could see the roller-coaster, peak-and-valley thing get going again.
“We'll be back to normal when those homes flush through the system, but how long that takes is anyone's guess.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration forged ahead with healthcare reforms on Wednesday, announcing a November 16 deadline for state governments to submit proposals showing how they intend to operate health insurance exchanges in 2014.

The Department for Health and Human Services released a detailed blueprint of the legal and operational requirements states must meet in their proposals if they expect to win federal approval to begin operating regulated insurance markets, in whole or in part, by January 1, 2014, when the 2010 law is scheduled to come into full force.
President Barack Obama's embattled Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act calls on states to establish exchanges that would offer federally subsidized health coverage to an estimated 16 million people who currently do not have health insurance. The exchanges would allow consumers to purchase their insurance from an easy-to-understand menu of competing plans, at premiums set on a sliding scale according to the buyer's income.
But progress at the state level has been uneven, with many states waiting to see how healthcare reform fares in a U.S. Supreme Court ruling anticipated in June that could overturn the law. The main case before the court was brought by 26 states that believe the reforms exceed the federal government's constitutional powers.
Healthcare reform also faces a political test in the November 6 election, which falls 10 days ahead of the new filing deadline for healthcare exchanges. Obama's re-election bid is being challenged by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who has vowed to repeal healthcare reform if elected.
Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters that 34 states, including some that want healthcare reform overturned, and the District of Columbia now have accepted federal grant money to help establish the insurance exchanges.
The administration announced another $181 million in grant awards for Illinois, Nevada, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee and Washington.
“What this shows are that states are making real progress in delivering quality, affordable health coverage to their residents and they want to be up and running by January 2014,” Sebelius said.
Only about 15 states have actually moved to establish exchanges, either through legislation or executive order.
The administration also released guidelines for assisting states that could be unable to offer full exchange services by 2014 and for establishing federal exchanges in states that are unwilling to participate.
Officials said the administration would partner with state governments in two areas: certifying health insurance providers for the exchanges and helping consumers apply for coverage and enroll in an appropriate plan.
BOSTON, MA - In an extensive study of sleep monitoring and sleeping pill use in astronauts, researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, Harvard Medical School, and the University of Colorado found that astronauts suffer considerable sleep deficiency in the weeks leading up to and during space flight. The research also highlights widespread use of sleeping medication use among astronauts.
The study, published in The Lancet Neurology on August 8, 2014, recorded more than 4,000 nights of sleep on Earth, and more than 4,200 nights in space using data from 64 astronauts on 80 Shuttle missions and 21 astronauts aboard International Space Station (ISS) missions. The 10-year study is the largest study of sleep during space flight ever conducted. The study concludes that more effective countermeasures to promote sleep during space flight are needed in order to optimize human performance.
"Sleep deficiency is pervasive among crew members," stated Laura K. Barger, PhD, associate physiologist in the BWH Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, and lead study author. "It's clear that more effective measures are needed to promote adequate sleep in crew members, both during training and space flight, as sleep deficiency has been associated with performance decrements in numerous laboratory and field-based studies."
Despite NASA scheduling 8.5 hours of sleep per night for crew members in space flight, the average (mean) duration of sleep during space flight was just under six (5.96) hours on shuttle missions, and just over six hours (6.09) on ISS missions. Twelve percent of sleep episodes on shuttle missions and 24 percent on ISS missions lasted seven hours or more, as compared to 42 percent and 50 percent, respectively, in a post-flight data collection interval when most astronauts slept at home.
Moreover, the results suggest that astronauts' build-up of sleep deficiency began long before launch, as they averaged less than 6.5 hours sleep per night during the training interval occurring approximately three months prior to space flight.
The research also highlights widespread use of sleeping medications such as zolpidem and zaleplon during space flight. Three-quarters of ISS crew members reported taking sleep medication at some point during their time on the space station, and more than three-quarters (78 percent) of shuttle-mission crew members used medication on more than half (52 percent) of nights in space.
"The ability for a crew member to optimally perform if awakened from sleep by an emergency alarm may be jeopardized by the use of sleep-promoting pharmaceuticals," said Barger. "Routine use of such medications by crew members operating spacecraft are of particular concern, given the U. S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) warning that patients using sleeping pills should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination, including potential impairment of performance of such activities that may occur the day following ingestion of sedative/hypnotics. This consideration is especially important because all crew members on a given mission may be under the influence of a sleep promoting medication at the same time."
Charles Czeisler, PhD, MD, FRCP, chief, BWH Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, and senior study author, adds: "Future exploration spaceflight missions to the moon, Mars or beyond will require development of more effective countermeasures to promote sleep during spaceflight in order to optimize human performance. These measures may include scheduling modifications, strategically timed exposure to specific wavelengths of light, and behavioral strategies to ensure adequate sleep, which is essential for maintaining health, performance and safety."

British actor Benedict Cumberbatch — best known for their portrayals of “Khan” in Star Trek Into Darkness and “Sherlock Holmes” on the BBC's Sherlock — took to reddit's “Ask Me Anything” forum as part of their publicity tour for The Fifth Estate, in which they play Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.
One of the first questions addressed Assange's open letter to Cumberbatch, in which the Wikileaks founder wrote:
You will be used, as a hired gun, to assume the appearance of the truth in order to assassinate it. To present me as someone morally compromised and to place me in a falsified history. To create a work, not of fiction, but of debased truth. Not because you want to, of course you don't, but because, in the end, you are a jobbing actor who gets paid to follow the script, no matter how debauched. Your skills play into the hands of people who are out to remove me and WikiLeaks from the world.
Cumberbatch's long response, characterized as “proof against a Benedict Twitter account,” in part reads:
To have the man you are about to portray ask you intelligently and politely not to do it gave me real cause for concern, however, it galvanized me into addressing why I was doing this movie. They accuse me of being a “hired gun” as if I am an easily bought cypher for right wing propaganda. Not only do I NOT operate in a moral vacuum but this was not a pay day for me at all. I've worked far less hard for more financial reward. This project was important to me because of the integrity I wanted to bring to provocative difficult but ultimately timely and a truly important figure of our modern times. The idea of making a movie about someone who so far removed from my likeness or situation who brought about an ideal through personal sacrifice that has changed the way we view both social media, the power of the individual to have a voice in that space, and be able to question both the hypocrisies and wrongdoings of organizations and bodies of powerful people that rule our lives… This resonated deeply with my beliefs in civil liberty, a healthy democracy, and the human rights of both communities and individuals to question those in authority. I believe that the film, quite clearly, illuminates the great successes of wikileaks and its extraordinary founder Julians Assange. As well as, examining the personalities involved and what become a dysfunctional relationship within that organization. While the legacy of their actions and the organizations continue to evolve and only history will be the true judge of where this is leading us. The Fifth Estate is a powerful, if dramatized, entry point for a discussion about this extraordinary lurch forward in our society. I wanted to create a three dimensional portrait of a man far more maligned in the tabloid press than they are in our film to remind people that they are not just the weird, white haired Australian dude wanted in Sweden, hiding in an embassy behind Harrods.
Cumberbatch also tackled less significant issues, such as whether they and the current Doctor, Matt Smith, engage in “cheek bone polishing parties.”
“We like nothing better than buffing our Zygoma,” they replied. “And imagining a horny time traveling long overcoat purple scarf wearing super sleuth nordic legend f**k fantasy. Get to work on that, internet.”
When asked about their “weirdest encounter with a fan,” Cumberbatch wrote that it involved “Ted Danson at a pre-Oscar party screaming across a floor of people like Leonardo DiCaprio, Ray Liotta, Kristen Stewart, Kirsten Dunst, et al while pushing past them and knocking their drinks. ‘OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! IT'S F**KING SHERLOCK HOLMES!'”
OLYMPIA, Wash. -- State officials at the Department of Ecology say there seems to be no end in sight for our historic drought. The dry conditions are causing a lot of problems across the state.
"As of today, 98.6 percent of our state is in severe drought," said Maira Bellon, the director at the Washington State Department of Ecology.
The drought is projected to impact all 39 counties in our state before summer's end. In all, 747 wildfires have burned 74,000 acres across Washington so far this year. That's twice as much charred land as this time last year.
"It is unlike a drought we've seen before in the state of Washington," said Bellon.
For the first time ever, hundreds of irrigators from across Eastern and Western Washington have been ordered to turn off their diversions and stop watering crops all together. State officials say fruit and vegetable crops are smaller and are getting scorched by the sun.
"The heat in and of itself, the lack of precipitation and the overall dry climate we are having right now is affecting our agricultural economy in a really big way," said Bellon.
On Saturday, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife will enforce fishing restrictions on more than 30 rivers all because of the drought.
"What we see with low stream flow is strandings of steelhead and salmon as they're trying to migrate up to spawn or migrate down to get out to the ocean," said Joe Stohr, the deputy director of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.
With river flows at records lows and temperatures in some rivers too high - fishing for many will have to wait until our rain returns.
"No one wants to see the resource diminished as a result of drought," said Stohr.
Some restrictions include complete closures on some rivers and reduced hours on others.
A full list of impacted rivers is available here.
Do you remember when comedian Louis CK mocked younger generations for being spoiled by the abundance of great technology?
Everything is amazing right now and nobody's happy. Like, in my lifetime the changes in the world have been incredible… Flying is the worst because people come back from flights and they tell you…a horror story…They're like: “It was the worst day of my life. First of all, we didn't board for twenty minutes, and then we get on the plane and they made us sit there on the runway…”
Oh really, what happened next? Did you fly through the air incredibly, like a bird? Did you partake in the miracle of human flight you non-contributing zero?! You're flying! It's amazing! Everybody on every plane should just constantly be going: “Oh my God! Wow!” You're flying! You're sitting in a chair, in the sky!
I was on an airplane and there was Internet. That's the newest thing that I know exists. And I'm sitting on the plane, and I'm watching YouTube clips. It's amazing. And then it breaks down and they apologize. The guy next to me goes “pua! this is bull****!” Like how quickly the world owes them something they knew existed only 10 seconds ago? Now we live in an amazing, amazing world and it's wasted on the crappiest generation of just spoiled idiots that don't care.
This was about nine years ago, just around the moment when the genesis block of the Bitcoin blockchain had seen the light of day. The tech's adolescence is over and the narrative has completely changed ever since. There are no generation gaps worth mentioning, no claustrophobic attitudes towards personal computing even among elders. Everybody's finally online. Seniors and hipsters only differ by what software they choose. And, as a matter of fact, today Louis CK is wrong twice and the world does owe us something.
“Internet access” has turned into the “freedom to connect” and has gained the status of a ‘basic need'. The problem is that each essential human need must have a public version and this one doesn't.
The issue of public versions may be a murky business. Consider fresh water accessibility. On one hand, as human society develops, fresh water has become almost guaranteed. There are the governments, ‘nonprofit' organizations, and private corporations whose efforts still target the issue in more problematic parts of the world, and not for free, by the way.
On the other hand, as far as the ‘golden billion' of the global population is concerned, the problem has taken the shape of the bottled water marketing pressure which many experts consider as the biggest scam in history (hint: we might not need it and most of it is from a faucet anyway).
Similarly, living in Europe, we never hear that someone is “thirsty” and cannot get onto the Internet. On the contrary, we see 3G turning into 4G and other seemingly positive endeavours. Ok, fine. That's a ‘bottled water' version and we buy it, in both senses. But where's a moderately safe ‘faucet water' version?
Where is the internet access of the commons? I don't expect it to be the quality that comes from a $20 crystal bottle, but I do want it to be fairly good and reliable. It doesn't have to be completely free, but it has to be common, not branded and controlled by ‘Aquafreshes' and ‘Perriers'. This is not any sort of end-user inspired ‘demand', the one you could read about in economy and marketing textbooks. This is a matter of principle.
Fragility of Being Technology's Pets
If you think I exaggerate or even invent the problem, here is a non-pathetic presentation for you. The following actually happened to me a few weeks ago. I arrived in a foreign city and my data roaming was off for some reason. I needed the money in my account to accept the calls I expected, so I decided not to call the GSM operator at once and bought a SIM card at a grocery store. Note: it wasn't in the airport. It was a random mall, so that SIM card package wasn't targeted to tourists.
The country I arrived in happened to be obsessed with anti-terrorism, so I couldn't get to use the SIM card until I arrived at my hotel, registered online with the operator and, the next morning (!), video-chatted with a government-authorized person to prove my identity.
When I finally succeeded in gaining the mobile Internet and drove off to the meeting, it was only to find out that 1MB of data was something around half a Euro and my new ten-Euro prepaid SIM had taken me about ten miles away with Google Maps navigation.
So, I needed to get online again (my mobile internet access is down by now, remember?) and buy a normally priced “data package” for another twenty Euro (PayPal is the only payment option, but that's another sad story). I cursed the provider, threw the SIM away with thorough enjoyment, downloaded the map of the whole country into my mobile Google Maps, and online-detoxed myself from hotel to hotel, without GSM-based Internet access.
Moral of the Story
A public domain version of an ISP would have saved my week, but what is the real moral of the story? It is not a technical issue we need to solve. It is the modern reality of cheap corporate cheating that has become so common. You will find it everywhere, in many fine prints of many Terms of Use. They try to cheat you on small things that, when aggregated, become large. And the irritation multiplies when THERE IS a technical problem, after all.
Of course, you might say, in that story, that was largely my fault and I should have read about the data plans beforehand or avoided the problem with my local provider in the first place. However, the advancement of technology not only gives us something, it deducts too. With technology, we naturally become less responsible. That's normal and harmonizes with earned sentimentality. That's what technology is for — to feel more relaxed.
When no GPS navigation was available, I was not quite happy to deal with paper maps, but I was never disappointed with anything since I had only myself to blame. Today, if I encounter any roaming, connectivity, geo-positioning, identification, map update, or any other problem, I feel completely mad. Mad! I blame every employee in every involved company and I blame myself too, for not having a normal map in my car any longer.
Hotspots of the World, Unite!
The “freedom to connect” is indeed the correct title for a fifteen-year-old movement. There were multiple attempts to break free at the fundamental infrastructure level. For over a decade, few wealthy corporations keep reporting on their plans to cover the planet with stratospheric balloons, nanosatellites, etc.
However, the traffic sent is still zero. Several less resourceful enterprises have tried to do the job through mesh networking when a signal propagates across a dense community of user devices. That did not fly either, albeit it was a timely invention when governments try to disintegrate protestors by cutting off ISPs.
Apparently, WiFi hotspots on top of regular landlines is the only feasible technical solution for now. So why hasn't FON or Boingo or any other provider like that gone global? Taking a wild guess, I get the feeling that building a controlled and compliant corporate network is presumably too expensive and simply doesn't pay back in the current competitive landscape. To fix that, one needs to abolish a substantive fragment of fixed costs spreadsheet.
The blockchain technology can help us do just that! It can help build a community of hotspots that would belong to no one. That fact alone can boost the coverage — people think twice before partnering with someone in particular but they easily join the crowd.
Another important advantage of a decentralized approach is that it helps to avoid the critical mass [threshold] problem. A network can grow organically. Since it does not have any critical minimum traffic to compensate the fixed costs, it may allow itself to add users at any tempo, without risking its future. Be it twelve hotspots or twelve million, technologically there's no difference. Of course, one must have taken the native token to at least one of the popular exchanges, but that mission looks pleasant and interesting.
Please, greet IUNGO, the token-governed swarm of Wi-Fi hotspots. IUNGO is a public crypto economy that delivers ubiquitous internet access to its participants through the token-governed community of Wi-Fi hotspots. We build not a vertically integrated solution, but a smart middleware.
Unlike most of the crypto projects that have emerged lately, IUNGO is a natural fit for what the blockchain technology got in its chest. The system will be ‘politically' decentralized since there is no point of central governance or single manufacturer dependance.
It will also be architecturally decentralized because a single IUNGO-connected router technically represents a complete and healthy cluster of the community. It is not “logically” decentralized, though. It can't be cloned and for a sound purpose — otherwise, segments of the community could be overtaken by unfair competition.
I would be very glad to hear your comments and questions.
Last night I attended a public meeting about changes to the intersection of Bay and Bloor, including a proposal by the City to remove the pedestrian scramble. Opinions at the meeting seemed divided about evenly between those who wanted to remove it (mostly local residents frustrated by traffic delays) and those who wanted to keep it (including some local residents who pointed out that the number of people living — and walking — in the area is set to increase significantly as new condo buildings go up).
The City wants to remove the scramble because they have done a study that shows it is under-performing compared to the other two scrambles (Bloor/Yonge and Yonge/Dundas). The City says that, unlike to the other two, few pedestrians use the diagonal there, it's not heavily used outside peak hours, there is no danger of crowding because the sidewalks are wide, and the traffic delays it causes are more severe.
Unfortunately, the City has not actually released this study, so there was no information for the public to judge for themselves the City's assertions. The chart above comparing pedestrian and car numbers was the only set of numbers provided. It really doesn't seem viable to make this decision, or even for the public to comment on it, until the actual numbers are available. Releasing the study would also, from what was said at the meeting, show that the other two pedestrian scrambles are working well.
As well, the study would provide the basis for a set of criteria to look for alternative intersections where scrambles would be successful. Experience with pedestrian streets has shown that it's not worth implementing pedestrian infrastructure unless it's viable — some poorly thought-out early pedestrian malls discredited the concept until better-considered ones showed they could be successful. In Toronto, for example, testing three university pedestrian streets showed that two were successful (Gould and Willcocks) while one wasn't (Devonshire) and was not continued. People might be more willing to consider losing a scramble if they can see a commitment to keeping the successful ones and finding locations for new ones where they will be more successful.
The City really needs to release the full study before making a decision, needs to reiterate its commitment to at least the two clearly successful scrambles, and needs to use this opportunity to establish the criteria for adding new ones in the future.
One last item — a few people at the meeting said that the scramble should work like older ones in some other cities, where pedestrians can only cross on the all-directions phase and cars can turn freely during their phase. The point of the Toronto scrambles is to provide better service for pedestrians at intersections where they significantly outnumber vehicle traffic. Restricting them to only one cycle would actually create worse service to the pedestrians who are the majority users of these intersections, who would have to wait for two whole cycles before they crossed (a longer wait even if the traffic cycles were shortened).
Not only would it be a bad experience in retail districts where the pedestrian experience is part of their appeal, but studies have shown people would be more likely to get impatient and try to cross against the red, creating a safety problem. As well, it would make the crowding that happens at these intersections (see photo above), with people spilling out onto the street while they wait, much worse (bear in mind that reducing this dangerous crowding was a key reason for implementing the scrambles in the first place). Finally, at Yonge and Dundas, there were already no turns allowed at all before the scramble went in, and they were already heavily restricted at Yonge and Bloor, so turning is not really an issue at these core scramble intersections. City staff also emphasized that the CNIB, in consultations, was strongly against this concept because it would run against the traffic training of the visually impaired. The pedestrian-priority scramble has been clearly successful in at least two intersections in Toronto, improving safety and the experience of the pedestrian majority of users and creating some excitement — it makes sense to keep these at least, and figure out where else it would be successful too.

Many of today's manufacturers of AR-15/M16 parts and accessories claim to be selling "mil-spec" parts. Unfortunately, either they don't truly know what military specification is required for a particular component or feature, or they don't care to try and hit the spec because doing so would increase production costs beyond an acceptable limit.
This diagram calls out the dimensions with tolerances for the profile of a correctly manufactured mil-spec M1913 rail.
A great example is the M1913 accessory rail, more commonly called a Picatinny rail after the Picatinny Arsenal where much of the development work was carried out. But is every rail called a Picatinny rail truly mil-spec?
If a Picatinny rail is mil-spec it must be manufactured to certain specifications and/or dimensions with tolerances.
An example of the difficulty measuring for mil-spec is the .835-inch dimension is required to be in position to datum –C– within .006 inch at maximum material condition. The maximum material condition requirement means the .835-inch dimension can be out of position as much as .006 inch—if it is .835 inch. If, in the manufacturing process, this dimension is made smaller than .835 inch, it must be closer to its required position.
So you see, this kind of dimensional tolerance can be difficult for the average guy to check.
However, some dimensions are easier to verify, like those on the profile of the rail—the .367-inch minimum, the .835-inch maximum and the .617-inch maximum.
Cross slots should be .206 inch (with a tolerance of +.008 inch/-0 inches) and be on position to datum J within .006 inch at maximum material condition. This means the slots can vary more in their .394-inch center to center position if they are wider than .206 inch with a maximum width of .214 inch. Depth is held to .118 inch with a tolerance of +.008/-0 inch.
This drawing shows the dimensions most commonly missed or ignored by manufacturers.
If you want to check these dimensions, use calipers (preferably an electronic model) to measure the width and depth of the recoil grooves. The spacing is a little more difficult, however, once you have established the widths of the recoil grooves, you can measure the inside distance between two grooves with one lug in between them. Then, subtract half of the width of each of the grooves. Take three or four measurements and use light but firm pressure on your calipers.
When measuring the depth of the grooves, use the caliper's depth gauge or, better yet, a depth micrometer.
The reason all of this may be important to shooters is many of us cannot afford a high-end scope for each of our rifles. Once throw-lever bases or other mounts are set to a particular receiver or rail, we might want to mount them on another railed upper for a trip to the range. It can be very frustrating to have to set the rings on your scope for the first rifle, and then to reset them again to put them on a second gun.
Another issue I have encountered is the depth of the cross slots cut too shallow, causing the cross lugs or bolts on the underside of the mount to bottom out without gaining secure attachment to the 45-degree-angle bearing surfaces on the rail. Accuracy will suffer and things can break, especially in the higher-recoiling chamberings.
Staying with higher-end AR receivers and rails will generally get you a true mil-spec rail platform for mounting optics or other accessories, but it is always a good idea to check, especially if you are spending your hard-earned money on a product that claims to be mil-spec.
In order to achieve levels of nanotechnology depicted in science fiction, we need to build machines one atom at a time. We're not there yet, but now we've got a powerful, indirect way to manipulate individual atoms.
Before this new breakthrough, the closest we had gotten to individual atom manipulation was to rather clumsily push atoms around using a scanning tunnelling microscope, or STM. This microscope has a stylus that is only one atom thick, from which it shoots electrons to obtain images on the atomic scale. Although this method did allow direct control of individual atoms, it was a rough, inefficient process that didn't offer much hope of acquiring the precision necessary for nanotechnology.

That may be about to change, thanks to Richard Palmer, Peter Sloan, and Sumet Sakulsermsuk of the UK's University of Birmingham. They placed the stylus of an STM in a tiny indent on a thin slice of silicon, and then emitted electrons from the stylus. The electrons burrowed into the silicons and traveled like a quantum wave function. This allowed them to avoid surface imperfections that would otherwise obstruct their path. The researchers have dubbed this electron wave a "quantum submarine."
Now, here's the important part as far as nanotechnology is concerned. The electrons broke the chemical bonds holding chlorobenzene molecules to the surface of the silicon crystal. With those molecules dispatched, it's now possible to manipulate the atoms on the silicon surface. The researchers suggest one could manufacture silicon wafers using just this method, in which tiny pits are created on the surface into which electrons can be injected.

The resulting electron waves would then shape and pattern the surface according to the placement and power of the wave, allowing precise manipulation of the silicon's individual atoms, which would be a huge step towards eventually achieving the nanotechnology of science fiction.

This photo from the Nikolayev newspaper website on July 2, 2013, shows Irina Krashkova, a 29-year-old woman from the town of Vradiyevka, Ukraine, in the hospital after they say they were raped and beaten. (Photo11: Novosti-N.mk.ua via AP) Story Highlights Woman, 29, says 2 cops raped and beat her, aided by a driver
The officer they said was the main perpetrator remains free
The case has galvanized protests in Ukraine
KIEV, Ukraine (AP) — Protesters hurling firebombs stormed a local police station unit in southern Ukraine after authorities refused to detain one of two police officers implicated in the brutal gang-rape of a young woman.
Residents of Vradiyevka, some 330 kilometers (200 miles) south of Kiev, continued to rally outside the station Tuesday, booing the local governor and vowing to continue their vigil until the officer is arrested. During the storming late Monday, protesters smashed windows, broke doors and set fire to the building, while police fought back with tear gas.
The case has caused widespread anger among Ukrainians, who say that corruption, lawlessness and the impunity of government officials and their wealthy friends has increased markedly since President Viktor Yanukovych came to power three years ago.
The victim, a 29-year-old local woman, was returning home from a bar last Wednesday when they say they were shoved into a car, driven to the woods, raped and savagely beaten by two police officers, aided by a driver. The woman remains in the hospital in a serious condition, having sustained multiple fractures to their skull and bruises all over their body.
One of the police officers and the driver have been detained, but the second police officer — whom the woman identified as the main perpetrator — has remained free, claiming they were on duty at the local police headquarters when the crime happened.
But the victim, identified as Irina Krashkova, said in a video interview with local media that the police officer was lying.
"This is not true, I know 100 percent that they were there. Why? Because they were the first to rape me; they beat me and called me all kinds of names," Krashkova said, in a low, timid voice sitting on a hospital bed. Them head was shaven and bandaged after surgery, and their face was swollen and bruised.
The Associated Press does not generally identify victims of sexual assault, but makes an exception where the victim has publicly identified herself, as Krashkova has done.
Two senior regional police officials and a prosecutor have been fired for failing to properly respond to the crime. President Yanukovych ordered a thorough investigation and Interior Minister Vitaly Zakharchenko was summoned to the parliament.
Zakharchenko put the blame on their subordinates, saying they initially withheld the fact that police officers were implicated in the crime. They said authorities were now checking a surveillance video from the police station, which the alleged perpetrator claims proves their alibi. Zakharchenko also called for a reform of the Interior Ministry and a boost in its funding to provide incentives for the best people to serve in the police.
The minister expressed their condolences to the victim and their family, though they stopped short of an apology.
The speech caused anger among the opposition. "I do not believe your words that you want to reform anything, same as your party," said opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk. "Do a heroic deed, write a letter of resignation."
The crime brought to back memories of last year's brutal attack on an 18-year-old in the same Mykolayiv region. Oksana Makar was raped, strangled and set on fire by three young men, some of whom had well-connected relatives. They died of their burns two weeks later.
Two of the three suspects were initially released and were re-arrested only after nationwide protests. The case galvanized Ukrainians fed up with the corruption that allows people with money and connections to avoid punishment, whether for violating traffic laws or for more serious crimes.

CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas - A total of 14 Corpus Christi residents are now in custody and face up to life in prison for their alleged roles related to the activities of the Aryan Brotherhood of (ABT), announced DEA Houston Division Special Agent-in-Charge Will Glaspy and Acting U.S. Attorney Abe Martinez.
The charges include conspiracy to participate in racketeering activity involving the ABT, violent crimes in aid of racketeering activity, and conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute methamphetamine.
A federal grand jury returned the indictment on November 29, 2017 against: James Randall Ross aka Silver, 45; David Wayne Frost aka Spider, 47; Michael Lee Craig aka Rooster, 44; Mark Clairborne Pennington aka Shiloh, 59; Brian Russell Campbell aka Iceman aka Loyalty, 35; Johnny Glenn Voiles aka Panhead, 47; Jimmy Curtis Mullenax III aka Curt, 40; Kenneth Brandenburh aka K-Dog, 44; Matthew Jay Thompson aka Pie Face; 33, Pedro Campos aka Pete, 59; Abby Telge, 28; Johnny Hagensick, 49; Randy Stasney, 60; and Allen Saunders, 35.
The indictment against these 14 individuals was unsealed today.
Ross made their initial appearance this morning, at which time they were ordered detained pending trial set for January 8, 2018. With the exception of Voiles, who is not as yet in custody, the remaining defendants are expected to make their initial appearances before U.S. Magistrate Judge B. Janice Ellington at 2:00 p.m. today. Voiles are believed to be in the Houston area. Anyone with information about their whereabouts is asked to contact Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security (HSI) at 1-866-347-2423.
The indictment charges Ross, Frost, Craig, Pennington, Campbell and Voiles in with conspiracy to participate in racketeering activity involving ABT activities between 1995 and November 2017. The indictment alleges they and others known and unknown were members and associates of the ABT, a criminal organization whose members and associates engaged in the illegal trafficking of controlled substances, extortion, murder, attempted murder, assault with a dangerous weapon and other acts of violence and intimidation. They allegedly operated throughout Texas, including the Corpus Christi Division of the Southern District of Texas and elsewhere. In addition, one of the purposes of the criminal enterprise was allegedly to keep victims in fear of the enterprise and in fear of its leaders, members and associates through threats of violence and actual violence.
Ross, Frost, and Craig are also charged with violent crimes in aid of racketeering activity in September 2015.
All 14 arrested today are charged with conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute methamphetamine between July 2012 to November 2017.
All face up to life in prison. The racketeering charges also carry a possible $250,000 maximum fine, while the drug trafficking conviction carries a possible maximum $10 million fine upon conviction.
DEA; Homeland Security Investigations; The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms and Explosives;; Texas Department of Public Safety; Nueces County Sheriff's Office; Corpus Christi Police Department and the U.S. Marshals Service conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Lance Watt and Julie K. Hampton are prosecuting the case.
An indictment is a formal accusation of criminal conduct, not evidence.
A defendant is presumed innocent unless convicted through due process of law.

IC 5067 in the Pelican Nebula
Image Credit & Copyright: César Blanco González
Explanation: The prominent ridge of emission featured in this dramatic skyscape is cataloged as IC 5067. Part of a larger emission nebula with a distinctive shape, popularly called The Pelican Nebula, the ridge spans about 10 light-years following the curve of the cosmic pelican's head and neck. This false color view also translates the pervasive glow of narrow emission lines from atoms in the nebula to a color palette made popular in Hubble Space Telescope images of star forming regions. Fantastic, dark shapes inhabiting the 1/2 degree wide field are clouds of cool gas and dust sculpted by the winds and radiation from hot, massive stars. Close-ups of some of the sculpted clouds show clear signs of newly forming stars. The Pelican Nebula, itself cataloged as IC 5070, is about 2,000 light-years away. To find it, look northeast of bright star Deneb in the high flying constellation Cygnus.
It's been nearly 4 years since I left the beliefs of my childhood behind. The dust has settled for the most part. I have long since developed a new perspective, a new philosophy, a new moral foundation. In many ways, arguably the most important ways, I am still the same person as I always was. I act on my convictions wherever they might lead me. When I was 16 they led me to choose to become baptized in my community's church. When I was 20 they led me away from everything I had ever known.
The settling of the dust that coloured the long and arduous transition phase revealed something that would not fade away into distant memories. It was a new structure, a product of the transition of my beliefs. It was a structure of sadness. The sadness of loss.
The bright new world that I saw through my brand-new perspective was lacking something that I had become accustomed to having, so accustomed that I had taken it completely for granted. I had always had the support of my family and the religious community I grew up in. I belonged there. I was related to nearly everyone in the community in one way or another, but more significantly I shared something with them that bonded us all together. Shared belief is social glue. Shared religious belief is home. It belongs.
It's an odd feeling of homelessness, not having a supportive community of family and friends to rely on in hard times. While it may be true that I can still go “home” and be with these people, my home is gone. Home is where you are loved and accepted for who you are. Home is where you can relax, because nobody is going to come up to you and remind you that they fundamentally reject the person that you are and the life choices you've made. My “home” is home in name only. “Home” is where I feel that I am surrounded by a pack of hungry lions, eager to show off how superior their beliefs are to mine in one way or another, by being annoyingly nice or by pretending that their “relationship with Jesus” makes them more happy than the average human being. There is an agenda in every interaction and the agenda is to change me. Some are more subtle and more clever than others, but it all boils down to the same thing.
I don't go “home” anymore. I can't. Before the dust had settled I could because I believed in words. I believed that I could communicate to these people that I was still the same person as before and they could continue going about their business and not concern themselves with my change in philosophy. I thought I could communicate that I wasn't interested in “converting” them to my new beliefs, that I still respected them and only wished for the same in return. At times I even thought I could explain the details of my transition in such a way that they'd approve of my decision. Thousands upon thousands of words were spilled, attempts at explanation, attempts at patient understanding.
The era of words is over. Everything that can be said has been said. It is clear where I stand and it is clear where they stand. We are at an impasse. It's over. The contract of insurmountable differences has been signed. In the absence of words only sadness remains.
The structure of sadness holds a place in the landscape of my mind among a myriad of other things. It is often hidden by other structures–confidence, excitement, contentment, happiness–but it holds its place in my mind, and visits me on occasion. It is never a pleasant visit but I do not resent it. I lost something all those years ago and sadness is a natural response. Fortunately the visits are shorter and less frequent than they used to be, but the sadness is still very real.
I am building a new home now. A network of people who are accepting, people that I can relax around and not feel a need to defend myself to, a new family. Won't you join us?

As Tropical Storm Harvey continues to flood many areas of Texas and Louisiana, Buddhists in the Houston area are pitching in with disaster relief work.
The storm, which at more than 50 inches of rain has already set an unofficial record for the most rainfall during a single storm, made a second landfall in southwestern Louisiana early Wednesday morning. Harvey has been responsible for about 46 deaths so far, according to Texas officials.
On the ground, members of the Houston Zen Center are volunteering at the George R. Brown Convention Center in downtown Houston, which is sheltering some 9,000 people who evacuated or were rescued from their homes.
Gaelyn Godwin Roshi, abbot of the Houston Zen Center, told Tricycle that they and other members of the center had been volunteering since Monday.
“Walking into the convention center felt like a release. People felt relieved,” Godwin said. “The kids were well-protected and the adults could finally sleep.”
Godwin said that the Zen Center, where they live, is safe and dry. The center was prepared to welcome displaced people, but the neighborhood was cut off by flooded roads. To help, they recommend donating to the Houston Food Bank or directly to the Houston Zen Center.
The abbot also added that local Buddhist centers are staying in touch and seem to be faring well.
“My plan is to drive around today [Wednesday] and see for myself,” Godwin said.
Raul Teran, vice region leader for the Soka Gakkai International's Houston Buddhist Center, said there are about 30 affected households from their local community of 1,500 practitioners.
Teran said the center is organizing supplies, such as water, canned food, toiletries, deodorant, soap, towels, first aid, and pet food, for their members.
The center itself was not impacted by nearby flooding, but has canceled activities and meetings this week as they “try to get back to normalcy.”
Dawn Mountain, a Tibetan Buddhist Center located in Houston, is also structurally safe from the storm. Myokei Caine-Barrett, bishop of the Nichiren Shu order of North America and resident minister of Myoken-ji Temple, said the center is dry and has power and water. We will provide updates on other centers as that information becomes available.
Other Buddhist temples around the city are providing shelter to displaced Houstonians.
Brandon Lamson, a member of the Houston Zen Center who also teaches at the University of Houston, said that they had recently moved to “The Heights,” a neighborhood in northwest central Houston that is about 30 feet higher than downtown.
“Our streets turned into rivers for a couple of nights, but we're really fortunate compared to other parts of the city,” Lamson said.
Lamson, who is also a meditation teacher, said they started checking in with other members of their Buddhist community shortly after the storm hit. He's already led a Facebook Live meditation class and has another one planned for Friday, in addition to volunteer work at the convention center.
“I think people are looking for stability in the midst of everything,” Lamson said, adding that their guided meditations have focused on lovingkindness practice for the city, as well as helping practitioners feel grounded in their body.
Do you gravitate towards the color blue? Find yourself decorating with blue home accents or always wearing cool colored clothes? Do you feel peaceful under the sky or staring out into the ocean? This is probably why…
Actually, before we get into it, let's talk a little bit about the history of the color blue. Up until fairly recently, what we perceive as the color blue didn't actually exist. What we “see” as blue, early texts describe very differently: the ocean being a “dark wine” color and the sky “colorless.” About 4,500 years ago, the majority of cultures around the world did not have a word for “blue.” So it begs the questions: if there wasn't a word for it, did it really exist? Could they just not see it? Or is it all perception? At that time, most languages had words for the other colors including (in order of most commonly used) black, white, red, yellow and green, but alas, no blue.
Jules Davidoff, a psychologist, had gone to Namibia to carry out an experiment with the Himba tribe. They did not have a word to describe the color blue in their vocabulary so when asked to point out a blue square in a group of green squares, they had extreme problems. Do we all see different colors or do we just describe them differently, especially if we have incomparable points of reference. Davidoff says that without a word for a color, without a way of identifying it as different, it is much harder for us to notice what is unique about it.
The Egyptians were the only ancient culture to have a word for the color. Not surprisingly, they were also the only culture to know how to produce blue dye from the semi-precious stone lapis lazuli. It was used for jewelry and later to make the pigment ultramarine, the most sought-after and expensive of all pigments. Ok, now it's all making sense.
So what were we talking about before all of this history stuff? Ah, yes, what the color means. Because of its rarity and “newness,” blue is one of the most popular colors around the world today. It is used to describe emotion, energy, and personality. Keep reading to see what blue says about you.
What does the color blue mean?
Blue is closely associated with harmony and peace. It is a color that evokes trust, honesty, loyalty and confidence. It reduces stress and creates a sense of relaxation, tranquility and calm. It is the color of trust and responsibility. According to Color Wheel Pro, “light blue is associated with health, healing, tranquility, understanding, and softness. Dark blue represents knowledge, power, integrity, and seriousness.” In addition, blue symbolizes faith, truth and wisdom.
Is your favorite color blue? It could mean you…
– Are conservative, reliable and trustworthy.
– Are a thinker, not impulsive. You like to figure it out before you act.
– Are genuine and sincere.
– Have a deepened need for peace and harmony.
– Want to live your life according to your ideals and beliefs.
– Have a deep need to be trusted.
– Don't like to be the center of attention — you prefer to be behind the scenes.
– Can be emotional but are sensitive to others' moods and feelings.
– Are approachable and friendly.
– Like to have direction and order — unpredictability can tend to overwhelm you.
The deepest need for blue personalities is to find inner peace and truth.

How to Start a Data Science Project in Python
The follow-up on this blog is 'Write less terrible code with Jupyter Notebook'.
This article is featured in the free magazine "Data Science in Production - Download here
Many blog posts show complicated machine learning methods and cutting edge technologies, putting Data Scientists around the world in a constant state of FOMO. But what are the fundamentals? How should you structure your project? What is the minimum set of tools you need? This post gives a few pointers for setting up your projects so that you will reach Product Ready Data Science as soon as possible.
Project Structure
Project structures often organically grow to suit people's needs, leading to different project structures within a team. You can consider yourself lucky if at some point in time you find, or someone in your team finds, a obscure blog post with a somewhat sane structure and enforces it in your team.
Many years ago I stumbled upon ProjectTemplate for R. Since then I've tried to get people to use a good project structure. More recently DrivenData (what's in a name?) released their more generic Cookiecutter Data Science.
The main philosophies of those projects are:
A consistent and well-organized structure allows people to collaborate more easily.
Your analyses should be reproducible and your structure should enable that.
A project starts from raw data that should never be edited; consider raw data immutable and only edit derived sources.
I couldn't help to invent my own project structure and my minimal structure looks something like this:
example_project / ├── data / <- The original , immutable data dump. ├── figures / <- Figures saved by notebooks and scripts. ├── notebooks / <- Jupyter notebooks. ├── output / <- Processed data , models , logs , etc. ├── exampleproject / <- Python package with source code. │ └── __init__.py <-- Make the folder a package. └── process.py <-- Example module. ├── tests / <- Tests for your Python package. └── test_process.py <-- Tests for process.py. ├── environment.yml <- Virtual environment definition. ├── README.md <- README with info of the project. └── setup.py <- Install and distribute your module.
You can find an example here.
It mostly follows the other structures:
raw data is immutable and goes to data/ ;
; processed data and derived output goes to different folders such as figures/ and output/ ;
and ; notebooks go to notebooks/ ;
; project info goes in the README.md ;
; and the project code goes to a separate folder.
I try to make a full-fledged Python package (plus tests) out of my project structure so that the step between prototyping and productionizing is as small as possible. The setup.py allows me to install the package in a virtual environment and use it in my notebooks (more on this in a later blog post).
It doesn't really matter which structure you pick, as long as it fits your workflow and you stick with it for a while. Try to understand the philosophies of the projects and pick the structure that suits your needs.
Virtual Environment
Projects should be independent of each other: you don't want your new experiments to mess up your older work. We do this partly by putting the files of different projects in different folders but you should also use separate Python environments.
Virtual environments are isolated environments that separate dependencies of different projects and avoid package conflicts. Each virtual environment has its own packages and its own package versions. Environment A can have numpy version 1.11 and pandas version 0.18 while environment B only has pandas version 0.17. I like conda virtual environments because they're well suited for Data Science (read here why).
Create a new conda virtual environment called example_project with Python 3.5:
$ conda install --name example_project python = 3.5
Make sure your virtual environment is activated (leave out the source if you're on Windows):
$ source activate example_project
... and you're now ready to install your favourite packages!
$ conda install pandas numpy jupyter scikit-learn
When you're switching to a different project, run a source deactivate and activate the project's virtual environment.
Once you get the hang of to activate - deactivate -flow, you'll find that a virtual environment is a lightweight tool to keep your Python environments separated. By exporting your environment definition file (i.e. all installed packages and their versions) your projects will also be easily reproducible. If you want a more detailed discussion, check Tim Hopper's post.
Git
Every project should have its own Git repository. Having a repo per project allows you to track the history of a project and maintain complex version dependencies between projects.
Alternatively, you can choose to have one repository with multiple projects, putting all the knowledge in a single place. The downside is, however, that it often ends up with ugly merge conflicts: Data Scientists are generally not that fluent with Git. In addition to a lot of Git frustrations, it makes your projects less independent of eachother.
The easiest way to set up Git is by creating a new git repository on your Git host (e.g. GitHub or GitLab) and cloning that:
$ git clone https://github.com/hgrif/example-project.git
You can then setup your project structure in this empty folder.
If you followed this guide and already created a folder with some files, first initialize a git repository on your machine:
$ git init
Then create a new git repository on your host, get its link and run:
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/hgrif/example-project.git
This adds the remote repository with the link https://github.com/hgrif/example-project.git and names it origin . You probably have to push your current master branch to origin :
$ git push --set-upstream origin master
Add a .gitignore to your project directory so that you don't accidentally add figures or data to your repository. I generally start with a .gitignore for Python and add the folders data/ , figures/ and output/ so that Git ignores these folders.
Now that Git is set up, you can git add and git commit to your heart's content!
Tooling
You can get away of some of the repetitive tasks by using some tooling!
The Python package cookiecutter automatically creates project folders based on a template. You can use existing template such as the Cookiecutter Data Science or mine, or invent your own.
The easiest way to use virtual environments is to use an editor like PyCharm that supports them. You can also use autoenv or direnv to activate a virtual environment and set environment variables if you cd into a directory.
Conclusion
Having a good setup for your Data Science projects makes it easier for other people to work on your projects and makes them more reproducible. A good structure, a virtual environment and a git repository are the building blocks for every Data Science project.

Tesla has established itself pretty firmly as the leader of the electric car pack, but it may have to watch its back as more conventional car companies look to get into the green car game. According to reports, Porsche looks to be the latest contender with engineers now at work on an all-electric sedan of their own. But how will Porsche rival Tesla's formidable Model S P85D?
According to a report in Car Magazine, Porsche is at work on an all-electric luxury sedan, tentatively called the 717. As for the 717's looks, sources tell Car that “we can expect a sporty four-door, four-seater with clear 911 overtones, wrapped in a more compact footprint than a Panamera's.” In other words, something that looks ostensibly like everything else Porsche has produced for the past several decades.

What will set the 717 apart from other Porsche models, and from the Tesla Model S, is its battery configuration. In the Tesla Model S, the battery serves as structural reinforcement and floorpan. In the Porsche 717, Car reports would go for something far more ambitious:
“Instead of a single, square-mattress-shaped energy cell which is relatively easy to cool and to connect, the battery arrangement proposed for the 717 looks more like a mountain range with the centre tunnel acting as peak ridge, with a pair of tall bulkhead walls and smaller agglomerations in the sills, the footwell and the overhangs.
In total, a reported 108 battery pouches need to be accommodated by the body-in-white. All 717 models will feature 4wd, four-wheel torque vectoring and four-wheel steering. As a rule, there is one electric motor per axle which will either be steel-sprung or feature an electrically-controlled air suspension system.”
It's important to note that, at present, Porsche has not confirmed that it's working on an all electric car—let alone confirmed any of these details. But, according to Car, we could see the 717 launch sometime in 2019. And there's good reason for electric car enthusiasts to be excited—Porsche could stand to present the best competition to Tesla's luxury electric sedan.
There's no mention of the price for the rumored 717, but with the Tesla P85D retailing at $106k, it's safe to assume that many of us will be more hotly anticipating Tesla's more affordable sedan—and its competition.

Cheat from Emacs 9th August, 2007
Update: I had inadvertently used string-join , a function provided by something in my ~/.emacs.d. The script has been updated to work with a vanilla Emacs (23, but should work with 22 as well).
Update #2 [2007.08.10]: Editing cheats and diffs have been implemented.
Update #3 [2007.08.21]: I added completion to cheat.el. The file linked on this page is still the latest version.
We all know and love to cheat. Now you can cheat without leaving Emacs (and without using a shell in Emacs).
Just save cheat.el in ~/.emacs.d and then (require 'cheat) in your ~/.emacs. I also bind C-z C-c to cheat , you may want to do something similar.
You can't do everything you can do with cheat on the command line yet , and for most of the commands the cheat command itself is used. Now you can do everything the command line client does from within Emacs, though you may need to revert to using cheat-command (described below).
Here's the rundown:
Any time you enter a cheat name there are both completion and a cheat-specific history available. Unless you are adding a new cheat. In that case you should use a new, unique name (duh).
cheat – Lookup a cheat sheet interactively ( cheat <name> )
– Lookup a cheat sheet interactively ( ) cheat-sheets – List all cheat sheets ( cheat sheets )
– List all cheat sheets ( ) cheat-recent – List recently added cheat sheets ( cheat recent )
– List recently added cheat sheets ( ) cheat-versions – List versions of a cheat sheet interactively ( cheat <name> --versions )
– List versions of a cheat sheet interactively ( ) cheat-clear-cache – Clear all cached sheets.
– Clear all cached sheets. cheat-add-current-buffer – Add a new cheat using the specified name and the contents of the current buffer as the body. ( cheat <name> --add )
– Add a new cheat using the specified name and the contents of the current buffer as the body. ( ) cheat-edit – Retrieve a fresh copy of the named cheat and display the body in a buffer for editing.
– Retrieve a fresh copy of the named cheat and display the body in a buffer for editing. cheat-save-current-buffer – Save the current cheat buffer, which should be named cheat-<name> .
– Save the current cheat buffer, which should be named . cheat-diff – Show the diff between the current version and the given version of the named cheat. If the version given is of the form m:n then show the diff between versions m and n. ( cheat <name> --diff <version> )
– Show the diff between the current version and the given version of the named cheat. If the version given is of the form m:n then show the diff between versions m and n. ( ) cheat-command – Pass any arguments you want to cheat interactively.
(Added) I may add support for --diff and --edit in the future.
Please do send me your patches so everyone can benefit from them.
GTU WTAD Practical 2 : Write a JavaScript that demonstrates the use of +=,-=,*=,/= operators
This program demonstrates use of JavasScript advance operator. JavaScript supports all operator which are supported by general purpose language. But here in this example I am going to discuss the special operator supported by JavaScript that is +=, -=, *=, and /=. This operator is actually combinations of two operators, lets learn by example.

The U.S. consumer financial watchdog on Tuesday accused PayPal of illegally signing consumers up for an online credit product without their permission and directed the company to pay a total of $25 million in fines and consumer redress.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said PayPal, eBay's electronic payments division, signed customers up for its PayPal Credit product instead of the user's preferred payment method, engaged in deceptive advertising and mishandled billing problems.
Under a proposed order filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, which needs a judge's approval to become final, PayPal would refund $15 million to consumers and pay a $10 million penalty to the government, the CFPB said.
“Online shopping has become a way of life for many Americans and it's important that they are treated fairly,” consumer bureau Director Richard Cordray said in a statement.
Amanda Miller, a spokesperson for PayPal, said the company takes consumer protection seriously.
“Our focus is on ease of use, clarity and providing high-quality products that are useful to consumers and are in compliance with applicable laws,” they said in a statement.
PayPal, which is in the process of being spun off from eBay, allows users to pay for online purchases or electronically transfer money to others.
Its PayPal Credit option is similar to a credit card, where customers make purchases and repay the debt later, and can incur interest or late fees.
The consumer bureau said some customers who tried to start a standard PayPal account were enrolled in the credit product without realizing it. Some of them discovered the mistake only after receiving billing statements or debt collection calls, the bureau said.
The CFPB said PayPal Credit also failed to honor some promotions it advertised, and it charged late fees in some cases when website problems prevented consumers from making payments.
PayPal neither admitted nor denied the allegations, according to the CFPB's proposed consent order.

By By Dan Arel Dec 18, 2013 in Politics How did it happen that we are allowing the conservatives to label The Affordable Care Act (ACA) as socialized medicine and or socialism? Are they trying to hide just how capitalistic the ACA really is? The ACA is not socialized medicine simply for the fact that the customer is still buying insurance. Socialized medicine is not an insurance plan — it is a health plan. Under socialized medicine, you do not worry about bills and deductibles, you go to the doctors or hospital and get your care and walk away. Socialized medicine is also single payer, zero subsidies are offered because you simply have health coverage by being a citizen, and taxpayer money is used to cover everyone. The ACA on the other hand does not cover those who is a opt-out, or who do not qualify for coverage. Greg Pason, the national secretary of the Socialist Party USA said in a recent This is an actual socialist, commenting on the ACA. Not a capitalist trying to sell it off as socialism, but an actual socialist, who believes in the socialist ideals, laying it out plain and simple. Calling the ACA socialism is harmful to anyone who wishes to properly criticize the faults of the ACA, regardless of whether you are for or against it, any critique must be made with an educated argument. The second someone makes the claim that it is nothing more than Obama's attempt to push their “socialist agenda” on the American people, all credibility is lost because they have demonstrated they do not have a basic fundamental understanding of what socialism is. The ACA is capitalism, and it is going to make a lot of people very rich. The ACA is an idea developed in the minds of The ACA is a gift horse to capitalists. It develops competition in each state between private insurance companies, the textbook definition of capitalism. Granted, this isn't free market capitalism based on the regulations, but any American knows the US is not run on free market capitalism, as it would never work in the real world.The ACA is not socialized medicine simply for the fact that the customer is still buying insurance.

This runs directly counter to Nunes's statements on March 22. Before they went to the White House, a reporter asked Nunes whether the White House should be briefing him, rather than the reverse.
“Well, the administration isn't aware of this, so I need to make sure I go over there and tell them what I know, because it involves them,” they replied.
The revelation underscores complaints that Nunes, a California Republican and close ally of the president, is too close to the administration or is even working at its behest. It also sheds new light on a strange incident preceding the Wednesday revelation. Nunes visited a National Security Council sensitive-information room at the White House complex to view classified information, but they claimed—somewhat implausibly—that White House officials were unaware of their visit, and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has deferred questions to Nunes, saying they have no information about the visit. If the Times report is correct, it casts doubt on the truthfulness of Nunes's story on that count, too. The chairperson said their information came from an intelligence official, although Ellis is a Navy Reserve intelligence officer.
Speculation about Nunes's source had already begun to focus on Ellis, who was general counsel for Nunes's House Intelligence Committee before moving to the White House earlier in March. Cohen-Watnick is a protege of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who was forced to resign after leaked intelligence reports showed they had lied to the vice president and the American people about contacts with the Russian ambassador. Flynn's successor, General H.R. McMaster, reportedly wanted to remove Cohen-Watrick but was overruled by Trump.
Nunes's conduct has become a target for widespread criticism. Their decision to hurriedly brief the president, without having shared information with either Republican or Democratic members of the committee, elicited curiosity and Democratic fury. Since then, Ranking Member Adam Schiff and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi have been among several Democrats who have called for Nunes to recuse themselves from the Russia investigation. Despite putatively being the head of an independent investigation, they told Fox News's Sean Hannity that they felt obliged to brief the president because Trump was subject to heated press criticism.
The actual content of Nunes's claims remains unclear. They said the surveillance appears to be lawful snooping on foreign nationals and did not involve Russia. They said, however, that Trump transition team officials were “incidentally collected,” the term used to describe when U.S. nationals are heard during surveillance of foreigners. Typically, their names are supposed to redacted, or “masked,” before intelligence is spread. Nunes claims masking was insufficient. But it has since become clear that Trump team members may not have been directly incidentally collected, but were merely mentioned during conversations—which would hardly be surprising, since they were part of the incoming presidential administration.
When it comes to ideas that feel good but fail when stupid old reality sets in, having solar panels on a road has to rank at the top if only for the enormous amount of public support. In Amsterdam, a company called SolaRoad (smart name, right?) doubled down and installed a solar bike path and ran it for six months. Here's how it fared.
For the newbies that don't regularly give to or aren't aware of snake oil cash grabs like Solar Roadways, let me fill you in. There's an idea that installing a solar panel array as a drivable, maintainable road instead of regular asphalt would solve the nation's energy problems, provide eons of free energy and allow us to work on things more suited to our enormous brains, like how the hell to get followers on Periscope without being a swimsuit model and what color two-piece bathing suit to wear on your modeling audition.
The initial project got crowdfunded to the tune of more than $2 million, without as much as a proof of concept in an actual road application. The scientific community ripped this apart with astonishing fervor, with our own typer-monkeys covering the point-by-point takedown.
Well, it turns out that you can't fight warm feelings with cold facts, because boffins in Amsterdam in a company called SolaRoad have decided to give this worthwhile idea a go in the form of a 70 meter-long roadway that accommodates bikes as well as pedestrian traffic. And joy of joys, they've been running it for six months and have already generated an output of over 3000 kilowatt-hours, which is enough to power a home for an entire year!
Advertisement
To put that number in context, here's a video from YouTuber Dave Jones on their channel EEVBLOG.
What do we find? Not only is the real-world output of the solar bike path about the same as expectations (~24.5 kWh per sq. meter, versus 25 kWh per sq. meter), but having solar cells in the same vicinity on a roof curved optimally towards the sun yields twice the power output without having it also double as a freaking road that can break, which it definitely does.
Advertisement
Also, as far as cost, SolaRoad received 3.5 million Euros from its investors to play with. Converted to Freedom Bucks, that's about $3.82 million. The average price for a kWh in this country is 12 cents per. If we do some math regarding the annual ~6,000 kWh that SolaRoad will create, that's ~$720 per year of energy savings.
If the company only used 10 percent, or $382,000 of its funding to make this pilot bike path, it would take them 530 years to break even. The future is now!

As far as what a working solar bike path would look like, here it is:
This is a bike path from Daejeon to Sejong, Korea made in the middle of a highway, unobstructed from the sun. Not only are the panels curved towards the angle of maximum efficiency, the path provides shade and protection from rain for the bikers.
Advertisement
There is zero danger of the biker falling or breaking the panels, and the entire structure will enjoy the long life cycle of a regular, run-of-the-mill roof solar panel because that's exactly what it is.
Although I'm sure that solar roadways will rear its ugly head once more with funding that shafts taxpayers at the benefit of clueless architects who think that the laws of physics don't apply to kickstarter projects, at least we're at a point now where more of the public is aware of the rampant and unadulterated snake oil con-job bullshit it truly is.

“This isn't high school.”
That was the entirely fair and factually accurate criticism someone tweeted at me after I delighted in “Clique Up,” LeBron's post-win, Kevin Love–less Instagram post.
Except, what happens when a team's best player — the best player in the league! — has spent their whole career striving to re-create the camaraderie of high school?
Chemistry has always mattered. But it's only recently that teams have begun openly trumpeting their team chemistry. Part of that is simply the proliferation of social media, but it's also a cultural shift within the NBA.
Team sports are, on the most basic level, a series of personal interactions. A 2010 study titled “Tactile Communication, Cooperation, and Performance: An Ethological Study of the NBA” found a possible correlation between teammates touching one another — high-fiving, chest-bumping, multi-stage handshakes and the like — and wins. Their methodology was admittedly imperfect, but their conclusion makes sense. Who wants to chest-bump someone they hate?
This isn't to say that teams with personality conflicts can't be successful. The Cavs are an elite offensive team and in the top 10 in net rating regardless of whether LeBron waits until Love is in the bathroom to set up group pictures. Shaq and Kobe three-peated despite despising each other before their relationship eventually devolved into freestyle scat boasts. Rajon Rondo and Ray Allen famously didn't get along, and it didn't seem to affect the Celtics, outside of stirring up Doc Rivers's acid reflux. The Bad Boy Pistons fought each other with such regularity that “beat writers no longer treated the skirmishes as news.” They won back-to-back titles.
Other teams come apart with the speed and finality of the Humphries – Kardashian union. The most infamous example is the 1996 Mavericks dissolving, in part, because Jason Kidd and Jimmy Jackson fell out over the finite romantic attentions of Toni Braxton. That ignominious affair's legacy is that whenever a team inexplicably falls apart — the 2009-10 Cavaliers, the 2013-14 Pacers — conspiracy theorists quickly look for cuckoldry. More recently, the Suns went from surprise fringe playoff team to even more surprising cautionary tale when Goran Dragic decided they didn't like sharing the basketball with two other point guards.
The difference, it seems to me, between the two types of teams — those that can handle chemistry problems and those that are ultimately scuttled by them — is leadership. The Celtics' Big Three were veterans, with Kevin Garnett as the fulcrum. Isiah Thomas thrived on — and promoted — ruthless intrasquad competition. Shaq and Kobe may have hated each other, but both guys understood they needed each other to win — at least for a while. And they had the benefit of superstar-whisperer Phil Jackson.

Great players don't just set the tone for their own teams, though; they dictate the culture of the entire league. When Michael Jordan was on the mountaintop, they faced a series of armed camps, with the nihilist hatchetry of the Pistons pointing the way forward for anyone trying to challenge Chicago.
In the Jordan era, no one cared about teams getting along, because the league was about alpha-male posturing and ruling through fear. Those were the actual Jordan rules. MJ and Scottie Pippen went out of their way to humiliate Toni Kukoc on the international stage, and Jordan reveled in reminding the Croatian about it after they joined the team.
In 1997, then-Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy accused Jordan of using their friendships with other players in the league as a kind of psychological weapon. “I don't think what I'm saying is so outlandish,” Van Gundy said. “Everyone knows that it's true. I don't have a problem saying it. Their way is to befriend them, soften them up, try to make them feel they care about them. Then they go out there and tries to destroy them. The first step as a player is to realize that and don't go for it. Compete against them as hard as they compete against you.” Was Jordan really that ruthlessly calculating or was Van Gundy just trying to motivate their team by playing on MJ's serial killer image? Probably both.
I don't think it's any coincidence that as the grizzled figures of the '90s retired or transitioned into punditry, and the focused sociopathy of Kobe gave way to the bonhomie of LeBron, we suddenly began to hear the critique that NBA players are now too friendly, too buddy-buddy. Too many players share the same agents, and this ongoing wussification is somehow sapping the competitive animosity out of the league.
Maybe so, but Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning managed to train together every summer, with Ewing going so far as to offer Zo one of their kidneys when Mourning fell ill, and that never stopped the Knicks and the Heat from letting their hands go whenever they got the chance. The culture of the league changed because the players changed.
It's been observed many times before — by long-time LeBron-ologist J.R. Moehringer, among others — that LeBron is constantly trying to re-create their high school experience. They thrive when he's surrounded by friends. Personality-wise, he's the anti-Jordan. They put the lie to the myth that you need to be a single-minded, relationship-rending sociopath in order to be a great basketball player. Crackpot theory alert: I think it bothered LeBron to see the Instagram videos of the Warriors hanging out, gambling, and partying on their team plane, all in love with the coco.
That's the vibe they want for the Cavs.
I think it annoys LeBron that Love isn't more sociable. Their relationship is fascinating, whatever the product on the court looks like. When has a player ever gone out of their way to name an opposing player the MVP? Love recently admitted they and LeBron were not “best friends.” Coworkers rarely are. But playing in the NBA is a special job, and playing with LeBron seems to require participating in a special relationship. When they were asked about their absence from the group Instagram pic, Love said, “I'm sure he's going to have me in the next one.”
I'm sure LeBron is hoping Love will actually want to be in the next one.
The has quashed a rape case after the victim took a stand that they had married the accused and was now happily staying with him.
The ruling was delivered by a bench headed by Justices and which last week set aside a rape complaint filed against a city resident by their girlfriend.
The boy had filed a petition in the High seeking quashing of FIR dated February 18, 2014, at Khar police station for offences of alleged rape and cheating.
Counsel for the petitioner Mahesh Vaswani submitted that the girl and the boy had a love affair and the complaint was filed by the former due to some misunderstanding. Now, both are happily married and were staying together, they argued.
The girl, who was also present in the court, said they had no objection to the quashing of the complaint filed by them as they had married the petitioner and was staying with him. Them lawyers Latika Nevrekar and Dharni Nagda also filed an affidavit making the same submission.
The judges noted, "We are otherwise satisfied that the offence punishable under Sections 376 (rape) and 420 (cheating) of Indian Penal Code is not made out, even if the allegations made in the complaint are accepted at its face value."
"Respondent No 2 (the victim) was 22 years old when they had an affair with the petitioner and they had given consent for having physical relations with the petitioner. Under these circumstances the petition is allowed and the complaint filed by them is quashed and set aside," said the judges.
During their keynote speech at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas two years ago, Bruce Springsteen reminded their audience of a famous remark made by rock critic Lester Bangs at the time of Elvis Presley's death in 1977: "Lester said that Elvis was probably the last thing we [the worldwide audience for pop music] were going to agree on."
Springsteen was making a point about the diversity of the music being played today, and the consequent splintering of the audience into factions. "There is no keynote," they said. "There is no unified theory of everything." They were too modest to point out that the figure closest to undermining Bangs's prophecy is himself, a New Jersey singer, guitarist, songwriter, bandleader and campaigner who turned 64 in September, the week after concluding their latest world tour.
No one else, not even Bob Dylan, combines the role of entertainer with that of social conscience as diligently and effectively as Springsteen, or with such generosity of spirit. During the six months of the Wrecking Ball tour – named after their 2012 album, in which they raged against bankers and their political accomplices – they had played to 3.5 million people at 133 concerts across 26 countries. Fans in Helsinki were regaled with the longest of the many marathon shows they have given over the past 40 years, lasting four hours and six minutes – not including the 30-minute acoustic set they had performed two hours before the scheduled start, for the benefit of early arrivals.
Their energy was not spent when the tour finished in Rio de Janeiro. Two weeks later, presumably having got their laundry done, they were turning up with an acoustic guitar at Madison Square Garden in New York to perform at a benefit for Stand Up for Heroes, a charity set up to help injured veterans of the Iraq war. A frequent performer at events held to promote or raise funds for causes they support, they retain an air of unaffected naturalness and seldom attracts the snide disapproval aimed at some of their contemporaries who are seen as seeking personal publicity for their good works.
Their public activism began in 1979 with the No Nukes concert in New York. In 1985 they and Willie Nelson campaigned against the closure of 3M's audio/video tape factory in Freehold, New Jersey. Twenty concerts for Amnesty International in 1988, in cities from Buenos Aires to New Delhi, were followed by a benefit for Sting's Rainforest charity in 1995. They campaigned for John Kerry on the Vote for Change tour during the 2004 US presidential election, appeared at Barack Obama's rallies four years later, and performed at an Autism Speaks fundraiser at Carnegie Hall in 2009. The following year they could be seen on telethons raising money for victims of the Haitian disaster – more than $60m – and Hurricane Sandy. In 2012 they joined the Obama re-election bandwagon. After last year's bomb explosion during the Boston marathon they helped a local punk band, the Dropkick Murphys, to raise funds for the victims.
Two weeks from today, they and the E Street Band will be in Cape Town for the first of 17 dates taking them from South Africa to Australia and New Zealand. This is called the High Hopes tour, named after their new album, to be released tomorrow. As usual, great anticipation surrounds its appearance. Their 18th studio album since their debut in 1973 comes at a time when they are expected to produce something that politicians are reluctant or too embarrassed to provide: an honest assessment of the state of things.
"I don't have some big idea," they said in 1996. "I don't feel like I have some enormous political message I'm trying to deliver. I think my work has to come from the inside. I don't start from the outside – 'I have a statement to make, ladies and gentlemen!' – I don't like the soapbox thing, so I begin internally with things that matter to me personally and maybe were a part of me in some fashion."
Nevertheless Wrecking Ball faced that challenge head on, dripping with anger and irony in songs such as We Take Care of Our Own ("From Chicago to New Orleans/ From the muscle to the bone/ From the shotgun shack to the Superdome/ There ain't no help, the cavalry stayed home"); Jack of All Trades ("The banker man grows fat/ The working man grows thin/ It's all happened before/ And it'll happen again"); and American Land ("They tried to get here 100 years ago/ They're still dyin' now/ The hands that built the country/ We're always tryin' to keep out").
Their moral compass first came into view on Darkness on the Edge of Town, the 1978 album in which they transformed themselves from a celebrant of a semi-mythical neon-lit America of stripped-down hot rods and high-school sweethearts into a kind of pathologist of the American dream, investigating its corroded hulk and examining the lives of the dead and injured. In 1982 a harsh, bare-bones solo album called Nebraska took its tone from Terrence Malick's film Badlands, the story of teenage killers inspired by the Charlie Starkweather murder spree of the 1950s. Two years later they were outraged when the title track of Born in the USA, written in the voice of an embittered Vietnam veteran, was appropriated by the Republican party, who mistook its deceptively exultant chorus and tried to use it as a flag-waving campaign anthem for Ronald Reagan. That sort of misunderstanding, they vowed, would never happen again.
In 1995 they won a Grammy for Streets of Philadelphia, a subdued song written for Jonathan Demme's Philadelphia, the first mainstream Hollywood film to confront the Aids epidemic. In 1996 they gave an interview to the Advocate, an LGBT magazine, in which they endorsed gay marriage, comparing it to their own second wedding, to the singer Patti Scialfa: "It's very different than just living together. First of all, stepping up publicly – which is what you do; you get your licence, you do all the social rituals – is part of your place in society, and in some way part of society's acceptance of you. Those are the threads of society; that's how we all live together in some fashion. There is no reason I can see why gays and lesbians shouldn't get married."
The shooting of the unarmed Amadou Diallo, an immigrant from Guinea, by four NYPD officers inspired their 1999 song American Skin (41 Shots), costing them support among those who had misconstrued their music and taken them for a symbol of beer-drinking, gun-owning all-American manhood. In The Rising, which came a year after 9/11, they made the significant gesture of adding a group of qawwali singers from Pakistan to one song, Worlds Apart. In 2006 they renewed their creative spark and paid homage to the folk hero Pete Seeger by assembling a new band to play traditional folk and protest songs on an album called We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions, a move so successful that the raucous spontaneity and home-made texture of the music was allowed to influence all their subsequent efforts.
High Hopes, assembled from cover versions, songs left off recent albums and new versions of old favourites, appears on the surface to have no central message to impart. But its individual songs, although drawn from a variety of sources, nevertheless convey an impression of a confused America licking its wounds and looking for salvation. Several songs, including a storming remake of The Ghost of Tom Joad, feature Tom Morello, the 49-year-old singer and guitarist formerly with Rage Against the Machine, a political activist whose presence seems to have provided their temporary employer with a burst of fresh energy.
Springsteen loves their job, which is one of the reasons their concerts are such delirious fun, but they are well aware that their chosen milieu, the entertainment business, is "a world of illusions, a world of symbols". Nevertheless their new album finishes with a stirring cover of a great song, Dream Baby Dream, written and recorded 35 years ago by the New York electro-punk band Suicide. Your finest dreams, they are saying, don't have to be illusions. They really can change the world.
A fan of 2NE1's CL has been gaining attention after making a generous donation for Nepal's earthquake relief.
On October 12th, international relief agency Oxfam Korea revealed that a man named Lee Jung Hyun donated 25 million won for the relief operation in Nepal and made the sponsorship under CL's name.
According to Oxfam Korea, a number of people in Nepal suffered from the damage brought by the recent earthquake. The agency continues to rebuild the affected areas by rebuilding houses and communities, dissemination of sanitary facilities as well as livelihood recovery. The recovery efforts continue until optimum well-being and livelihood are restored.
Mr. Lee Jung Hyun, the fan who made the donation under CL's name, decided to support the charity as a way of supporting CL's upcoming debut the United States. As they are able to enjoy the arts and culture being a fan of CL, they hope that this donation are able to restore hopes in the lives of the victims once more.
Meanwhile, CL remains focused in their activities in the United States and gradually appeared in a number of appearances including Mad Decent's Block Party.

Recently?Bought a L930, in the past had gotten a lot of users to switch.Right now WM10 is getting there but it is not quite there in terms of a cohesive UX for instance in certains apps you have long pressed the screen to get the copy and paste bar, then long press again to paste. Other apps, long press you get a copy dialogue box and the paste icon above the keyboard. But it's getting there, the anniversary update should bring a even more cohesive experience as the core apps slowly being universal.For me personally the beauty of the live tiles is that every user can have their home screen how they want it, sure on android you have your widgets but these widgets are almost the same for pretty much a lot of people as not everyone uses customs roms or deviates from the standard boxed widgets. With tiles you could have very large medium tiles or plaster your start screen with mini tiles like a mosaic.People who frequent forums like these are not your typical audience, they can tell the difference between the statement "my phone is a samsung running on ee" and "my phone is a samsung s5 running android on the ee network" for example. The former is a statement made by people who stick to what they are comfortable with and that is the bog standard widgets on android with sporadic icons stretched across many home screens.Furthermore not all millennials are tech savy although they like to think they are - given the insane number gadgets some wear or carry lol.But as it stands right now, it's perception that is the key and Microsoft retrenching is making people click those doom and gloom posts.There are a lot of misinformed users out there and that is partly down to Microsoft as well - for instance I saw comment that stated the 950 doesn't support VoLTE - both the 950 and XL do - as stated in the FAQ but it needs carrier support first... sadly. They should just enable it in on firmware for all phones out of the box and if the carrier supports it on their network - then great - if not - no loss.In the grand scheme of things, UX aside WM10 at it's core is a marvel and feat of engineering as if they could add Ethernet over USB to phones via an update (presuming there is hard support baked in of course during the planning stages). The question is what else they could add / have hidden inside the 950 and XL :P.Edit: Well finally they have gotten round to adding GATT Server API's... welcome news. Hence why I say WM10 will get better over time, unfortunately I know many don't have the patience any more and that is understandable.
The written history of the Cape Colony in what is now South Africa began when Portuguese navigator Bartolomeu Dias became the first modern European to round the Cape of Good Hope in 1488.[1] In 1497, Vasco da Gama sailed along the whole coast of South Africa on their way to India, landed at St Helena Bay for 8 days, and made a detailed description[2] of the area. The Portuguese, attracted by the riches of Asia, made no permanent settlement at the Cape Colony. However, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) settled the area as a location where vessels could restock water and provisions.
First settlement [ edit ]
The Dutch East India Company settlement in the area began in March 1647, with the shipwreck of the Dutch ship Nieuwe Haarlem. The shipwreck victims built a small fort that they named the "Sand Fort of the Cape of Good Hope." They stayed for nearly one year, until they were rescued by a fleet of 12 ships under the command of W. G. de Jong.
After their return to Holland some of the shipwrecked crewmates tried to persuade the Dutch East India Company to open a trading center at the Cape.
A Dutch East India Company expedition of 90 Calvinist settlers, under the command of Jan van Riebeeck, founded the first permanent settlement near the Cape of Good Hope in 1652. Jan van Riebeeck was on one of the rescue ships that had come to rescue the shipwrecked sailors, and upon seeing the land, they decided to return. They arrived in the harbour of modern-day Cape Town on 6 April 1652 with five ships:
Reijer, Oliphant, Goede Hoop, Walvisch, Dromedaris.
The settlers initially built a clay and timber fort, which was replaced between 1666 and 1679 by the Castle of Good Hope, which is now the oldest building in South Africa. The Colony began properly in 1671 with the first purchase of land from the Khoikhoi (called "Hottentots" by the settlers) beyond the original limits of the fort built by van Riebeeck.
Sketch of Castle of Good Hope Courtyard in 1680
A long term policy of the VOC was to limit the growth of the colony to a small clearly defined area. Initially the VOC had hoped to employ a small number of servants and employees to produce food close to the fortress whilst obtaining cattle from the local Khoikhoi. However repeated crop failures convinced company officials to release nine servants to become semi-independent burgers who would produce food on free hold farms. Land grants were limited until the arrival of the colony's new commander Simon van der Stel in 1679.[3]:31
Van der Stel pursued an expansionist agricultural policy which was continued by their son William thereby increasing the number of farms in the colony to 258 by 1705. The number of free hold farms almost doubled by 1731 to 435 farms. Income inequality increased rapidly in the early years of the colony's development and by 1731 only 7% of the colony's small free settler population controlled over half of all the private property in the colony.[3]:31
The earliest colonists were, for the most part, from the lower, working class and displayed an indifferent attitude towards developing the colony, but after a commissioner that was sent out in 1685 to attract more settlers, a more dedicated group of immigrants began to arrive. French refugees began to arrive in the Cape after leaving their country after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. This small body of immigrants had a marked influence on the character of the Dutch settlers. Owing to the policy instituted in 1701 of the Dutch East India Company which dictated that schools should teach exclusively in Dutch and strict laws of assembly, the Huguenots ceased by the middle of the 18th century to maintain a distinct identity, and the knowledge of French disappeared. By the late 1700s the Cape Colony was one of the best developed European settlements outside Europe or the Americas.[4]
Economy [ edit ]
The two pillars of the Cape Colony's economy for almost the entirety of its history were shipping and agriculture. Its strategic position meant that prior to the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 almost every ship sailing between Europe and Asia stopped off at the colony's capital Cape Town. The supplying of these ships with fresh provisions, fruit, and wine provided a very large market for the surplus produce of the colony.[4]
Further expansion [ edit ]
Expansion of the Dutch Cape Colony.
The Cape colonists gradually acquired all of the land of the Khoikhoi to the north and east of their base at Cape Town. Besides those who died in warfare, whole tribes of Khoikhoi were severely disrupted by smallpox epidemics in 1713 and 1755. A few remaining tribes maintained their independence, but the majority of the Khoikhoi took jobs with the colonists as herdsmen. The Dutch East India Company government passed a law in 1787 subjecting the remaining nomadic Khoikhoi to certain restrictions. The direct effect of this law was to make the Khoikhoi even more dependent upon the farmers, or to compel them to migrate northward beyond the colonial border. Those who chose the latter encountered the hostility of their old foes, the San, who inhabited the plains from the Nieuwveld and Sneeuwberg mountains to the Orange River.
Conflicts with the Dutch East India Company [ edit ]
Neither the hostility of the natives, nor the struggle to make agriculture profitable on Karoo or veld, slowed the progress made by the colonists as much as the narrow and tyrannical policy adopted by the Dutch East India Company. The Company stopped the colony's policy of open immigration, monopolised trade, combined the administrative, legislative and judicial powers into one body, told the farmers what crops to grow, demanded a large percentage of every farmer's harvest, and harassed them. This tended to discourage further development of industry and enterprise. From these roots sprung a dislike of orderly government, and libertarian view-point that has characterised the "boers" or Dutch farmers for many generations. Seeking largely to escape the oppression of the Dutch East India Company, the farmers trekked farther and farther from the seat of government. The Company, to control these emigrants, established a magistracy at Swellendam in 1745 and another at Graaff Reinet in 1786. The authorities declared the Gamtoos River as the eastern frontier of the colony, but the trekkers soon crossed it. To avoid collision with the bantu tribes advancing south and west from east central Africa, the Dutch agreed in 1780 to make the Great Fish River the boundary of the colony. In 1795 the heavily-taxed boers of the frontier districts, who received no protection against the Africans, expelled the officials of the Dutch East India Company, and established independent governments at Swellendam and at Graaff Reinet.
The Netherlands fell to the French army under the leadership of Napoléon Bonaparte in 1795. Reacting to the weakness of the Dutch East India Company holdings, a British army under General Sir James Henry Craig set out for Cape Town to secure the colony for the Stadtholder Prince William V of Orange against the French. The governor of Cape Town refused at first to obey any instructions from the prince, but after the British threatened to use force, they capitulated. The boers of Graaff Reinet did not surrender until an army had been sent against them, and in 1799 and again in 1801 they rose in revolt. In February 1803, as a result of the Peace of Amiens, the colony came under the control of the Batavian Republic.

Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.
The Ministerial Committee on the Integration of Israeli Citizens of Ethiopian Descent into Israeli Society authorized a NIS 55 million dedicated multi-year program on Monday aimed at facilitating the integration of Ethiopians into Israeli society.
The program, submitted by the Economy Ministry, will be spread over four years and aims primarily to better integrate 3,600 people of Ethiopian origin into the job market.
“The program approved today by the ministerial committee is the result of a long process that included cooperation between various units within and outside the Ministry, fruitful consultation with people of Ethiopian descent, and an analysis of the current situation in the economy,” said Michal Fink, Senior Director for Strategy and Policy Planning at the Economy Ministry.The government initiative aims to focus on increasing employment rates, finding high-quality jobs, increasing salaries, developing and advancing human capital and increasing the number of business enterprises for Ethiopians.“While the participation rate [in the workforce] for those of Ethiopian origin is similar to that of the general population, their unemployment rate is higher (8.8% as against 5.9% in the general population), and the gaps in salary are significant: there is a 40% gap as compared to the general population, irrespective of education,” they explained.Among other elements, the program includes guidance for better employment, providing vouchers for vocational training, the launch of a dedicated enterprise fund, an incentives program for employers to employ those of Ethiopian origin at high salaries, and a track for job placement for academics.The Economy Ministry committee was created following Government Resolution 1300 in February 2014, which obligated the government ministries to recommend a new policy for advancing the best possible integration of those of Ethiopian origin in Israeli society, as well as Resolution 324 from July 2015, which authorized the acceptance of the program's cornerstones.The Prime Minister's Office will coordinate the ministerial programs, while a joint committee of a representative of the Economy Ministry and representatives of the Ethiopian community will be established to implement the program.As part of the initiative, an inter-ministerial program jointly operated by the Senior Deputy Director-General and Head of Employment, the Israel Small and Medium Businesses Agency, the Investment Center and the Commission for Equal Employment Opportunities was also established.“I believe that our professional work in cooperation with the community representatives will lead to the advancement of those of Ethiopian origin and the achievement of significant targets in their integration in high-quality positions in the job market,” added Fink.

Do you love ("very") high-level languages? Like Lisp, Smalltalk, Python, Ruby? Or maybe Haskell, ML? I love high-level languages.
Do you think high-level languages would run fast if the stock hardware weren't "brain-damaged"/"built to run C"/"a von Neumann machine (instead of some other wonderful thing)"? You do think so? I have a challenge for you. I bet you'll be interested.
Background:
I work on the definition of custom instruction set processors (just finished one).
It's fairly high-end stuff (MHz/transistor count in the hundreds of millions).
I also work on the related programming languages (compilers, etc.).
Whenever application programmers have to deal with low-level issues of the machine I'm (partly) responsible for, I feel genuine shame. They should be doing their job; the machine details are my job. Feels like failure (even if "the state of the art" isn't any better).
…But, I'm also obsessed with performance. Because the apps which run on top of my stuff are ever-hungry, number-crunching real time monsters. Online computer vision. Loads of fun, and loads of processing that would make a "classic" DSP hacker's eyeballs pop out of their skull.
My challenge is this. If you think that you know how hardware and/or compilers should be designed to support HLLs, why don't you actually tell us about it, instead of briefly mentioning it? Requirement: your architecture should allow running HLL code much faster than a compiler emitting something like RISC instructions, without significant physical size penalties. In other words, if I have so many square millimeters of silicon, and I pad it with your cores instead of, say, MIPS cores, I'll be able to implement my apps in a much more high-level fashion without losing much performance (25% sounds like a reasonable upper bound). Bonus points for intrinsic support for vectorized low-precision computations.
If your architecture meets these requirements, I'll consider a physical implementation very seriously (because we could use that kind of thing), and if it works out, you'll get a chip so you can show people what your ideas look like. I can't promise anything, because, as usual, there are more forces at play than the theoretical technical virtue of an idea. I can only promise to publicly announce that your idea was awesome and I'd love to implement it; not much, but it's the best I can deliver.
If you can't think of anything, then your consistent assertions about "stupid hardware" are a stupid bluff. Do us a favor and shut up. WARNING: I can't do hardware myself, but there are lots of brilliant hardware hackers around me, and I've seen how actual chips are made and what your constraints are. Don't bullshit me, buddy.
Seriously, I'm sick and tired of HLL weenie trash talk. Especially when it comes from apparently credible and exceedingly competent people.
Alan Kay, the inventor of Smalltalk: "Just as an aside, to give you an interesting benchmark—on roughly the same system, roughly optimized the same way, a benchmark from 1979 at Xerox PARC runs only 50 times faster today. Moore's law has given us somewhere between 40,000 and 60,000 times improvement in that time. So there's approximately a factor of 1,000 in efficiency that has been lost by bad CPU architectures." … "We're not going to worry about whether we can compile it into a von Neumann computer or not, and we will make the microcode do whatever we need to get around these inefficiencies because a lot of the inefficiencies are just putting stuff on obsolete hardware architectures."
Jamie Zawinski, an author of Mozilla: "In a large application, a good garbage collector is more efficient than malloc/free." … "Don't blame the concept of GC just because you've never seen a good GC that interfaces well with your favorite language." Elsewhere: "it's a misconception that lisp is, by its nature, slow, or even slower than C" … "if you're doing a *big* project in C or C++, well, you're going to end up reinventing most of the lisp runtime anyway"
Steve Yegge, a great tech blogger: "The von Neumann machine is a convenient, cost-effective, 1950s realization of a Turing Machine, which is a famous abstract model for performing computations." … "There are various other kinds of computers, such as convenient realizations of neural networks or cellular automata, but they're nowhere as popular either, at least not yet". And… "The Von Neumann architecture is not the only one out there, nor is it going to last much longer (in the grand 400-year scheme of things.)"
Wow. Sounds dazzling and mind-opening, doesn't it? Except there isn't any technical detail whatsoever. I mean, it's important to be open-minded and stuff. It really is. The fact that something doesn't seem "practical" doesn't mean you shouldn't think or talk about it. But if something isn't even a something, just a vague idea about Awesome Coolness, it poisons the readers' minds, people. It's like talking about Spirituality of the kind that lets you jump over cliffs at your mighty will or something (I'm not that good at New Age, but I think they have things like these in stock). This can only lead to three results:
Your reader ignores you. Your reader sits on a couch and waits to gain enough Spirituality to jump around cliffs. Congratulations! Your writing has got you one fat fanboy. Your reader assumes he's Spiritual enough already and jumps off a cliff, so you've got a slim fanboy corpse.
It's the same with this Great High-Level Hardware talk. I can ignore it, or I can wait forever until it emerges, or I can miserably fail trying to do it myself. Seriously, let's look at these claims a little closer.
Alan Kay mentions a benchmark showing how lame our CPUs are. I'd really like to see that benchmark. Because I've checked out the B5000 which they praised in that article. And I don't think a modern implementation of that architecture would beat a modern CPU in terms of raw efficiency. You see, RISC happened for a reason. Very roughly, it's like this:
You can access memories at single cycle throughput.
You can process operands in registers at single cycle throughput.
And that's pretty much what you can do.
Suppose you want to support strings and have a string comparison instruction. You might think that "it's done in the hardware", so it's blindingly fast. It isn't, because the hardware still has to access memory, one word per cycle. A superscalar/VLIW assembly loop would run just as quickly; the only thing you'd save is a few bytes for instruction encoding. On the other hand, your string comparison thingie has got you into several sorts of trouble:
Your machine is larger, with little gain – you don't compare strings most of the time.
Your machine is complicated, so optimizing the hardware is trickier.
Compilers have trouble actually utilizing your instructions.
Especially as the underlying hardware implementation grows more complicated and the performance of assembly code gets harder to model.
When people were supposed to write assembly programs, the inclusion of complicated high-level instructions was somewhat natural. When it became clear that compilers write most of the programs (because compilation became cheap enough), processors became less high-level; the points above hopefully explain why.
And don't get me started about the tagging of data words. B5000 had polymorphic microcode – it would load two words, look at their type bits and add them according to the run time types. Well, B5000 didn't support things like unsigned 8-bit integers, which happen to be something I need, because that's how you store images, for example. Am I supposed to carry tag bits in each frigging byte? Let me point out that it has its cost. And I don't think this sort of low-level polymorphism dwarfs the cost of Lisp or Smalltalk-style dynamic binding, either (B5000 was designed to run Algol; what would you do to run Smalltalk?)
There's another angle to it: Alan Kay mentions that you almost couldn't crash the B5000, which suited the business apps it was supposed to run quite well. I think that's just awesome, I really do (I shoveled through lots of core dumps). In fact, I think people who implemented modern desktop operating systems and web browsers in unsafe languages on top of unsafe hardware are directly responsible for the vast majority of actual security problems out there. But (1) in many systems, the performance is really really important and (2) I think that security in software, the way it's done in JVM or .NET, still has lower overall cost than tagging every byte (I'm less sure about part 2 because I don't really know the guts of those VMs). Anyway, I think that hardware-enforced safety is costly, and you ought to acknowledge it (or really show why this fairly intuitive assumption is wrong, that is, delve into the details).
JWZ's Lisp-can-be-efficient-on-stock-hardware claim isn't much better than Smalltalk-can-be-efficient-on-custom-hardware, I find. Just how can it be? If you use Lisp's static annotation system, your code becomes uglier than Java, and much less safe (I don't think Lisp does static checking of parameter types, it just goes ahead and passes you an object and lets you think it's an integer). If you use Lisp in the Lispy way that makes it so attractive in the first place, how on Earth can you optimize out the dynamic type checks and binding? You'd have to solve undecidable problems to make sense of the data flow. "A large project in C would implement the Lisp run time?" Oh really? You mean each variable will have the type LispObject (or PyObject or whatever)? Never happens, unless the C code is written by a deeply disturbed Lisp weenie (gcc and especially BetaPlayer, I'm talking about you). The fact that some people write C code as if they were a Lisp back-end is their personal problem, nothing more, nothing less.
The dynamic memory allocation business is no picnic, either. I won't argue that garbage collection is significantly less efficient than manual malloc/free calls, because I'm not so sure about it. What I will argue is that a good Lisp program will use much more dynamic allocation and indirection levels than a good C program (again, I ignore the case of emulating C in Lisp, or Lisp in C, because I think it's a waste of time anyway). And if you want to make your objects flat, I think you need a static type system, so you won't be much higher-level than Java in terms of dynamic flexibility. And levels of indirection are extremely costly because every data-dependent memory access is awfully likely to introduce pipeline stalls.
Pure functional languages with static typing have their own problem – they lack side effects and make lots of copies at the interface level; eliminating those copies is left as an exercise to the compiler writer. I've never worked through a significant array of such exercises, so I won't argue about the problems of that. I'll just mention that static typing (irregardless of the type inference technique) characterizes lower-level languages, because now I have to think about types, just the way imperative programming is lower-level than functional programming, because now I have to think about the order of side effects. You can tell me that I don't know what "high-level" means; I won't care.
Now, the von Neumann machine business. Do you realize the extent to which memory arrays are optimized and standardized today? It's nowhere near what happens with CPUs. There are lots of CPU families running lots of different instruction sets. All memories just load and store. Both static RAM (the expensive and fast kind) and dynamic RAM (the cheap and slower kind) are optimized to death, from raw performance to factory testing needed to detect manufacturing defects. You don't think about memories when you design hardware, just the way you don't think about the kind of floating point you want to use in your numeric app – you go for IEEE because so much intellectual effort was invested in it on all levels to make it work well.
But let's go with the New Age flow of "von Neumann machine is a relic from the fifties". What kinds of other architectures are there, and how do you program them, may I ask? "C is for von Neumann machines". Well, so is Java and so is Lisp; all have contiguous arrays. Linked lists and dictionaries aren't designed for any other kind of machine, either; in fact lots of standard big O complexity analysis assumes a von Neumann machine – O(1) random access.
And suppose you're willing to drop standard memories and standard programming languages and standard complexity analysis. I don't think you're a crackpot, I really don't; I think you're bluffing, most probably, but you could be a brilliant and creative individual. I sincerely don't think that anything practiced by millions can automatically be considered "true" or "right"; I was born in the Soviet Union, so I know all about it. Anyway, I want to hear your ideas. I have images. I must process those images and find stuff in them. I need to write a program and control its behavior. You know, the usual edit-run-debug-swear cycle. What model do you propose to use? Don't just say "neural nets". Let's hear some details about hardware architecture.
I really want to know. I assume that an opinion held by quite some celebrities is shared by lots and lots of people out there. Many of you are competent programmers, some stronger than myself. Tell me why I'm wrong. I'll send you a sample chip. I'll publicly admit I was a smug misinformed dumbass. Whatever you like. I want to close this part of "efficient/high-level isn't a trade-off" nonsense, so that I can go back to my scheduled ranting about the other part. You know, when I poke fun at C++ programmers who think STL is "high-level" (ha!). But until this "Lisp is efficient" (ha!) issue lingers, I just can't go on ranting with clear conscience. Unbalanced ranting is evil, don't you think?
We reported earlier this month that Almería in the south of Spain (some 150 miles as the raven flies from Seville and its ‘Water Gardens') was being scouted as a potential location and an almost certain pick (even before that, Girona and Peñíscola were confirmed as the first two new locations for Season 6).
Now Almería has been unofficially confirmed as a shooting location by the sources at Los Siete Reinos, via Ideal.es. Everything is supposed to be moving along smoothly, and the casting of extras is scheduled for July 9th and 10th.
Our friends at Los Siete Reinos find the extras casting curious as everything is pointing in the direction of filming taking place on locations in the countryside (the Tabernas desert in particular) and not in the city. For now, all we can do is speculate. Perhaps we will learn more when we get wind of some details from the mass castings in July (Girona and Peñíscola are scheduled already for next week, on July 1st and 2nd).
A law from 1978 is suddenly the labels' No. 1 threat as everyone from Village People to the Eagles can now snatch back their music rights.
The music industry just can't catch a break. Major record labels, which cautiously celebrated a slight uptick in U.S. album sales in 2011 after revenue from recorded music fell a whopping 52 percent from 2000 through 2010, are now facing a new threat to their bottom lines -- and it's not online pirates or an Apple device. It's a quirk in U.S. copyright law that is about to allow a whole bunch of top artists to snatch back rights to their music, potentially forcing labels to pay big money to reacquire songs they have owned for decades.
In 1976, Congress, sympathetic to musicians who often sign away rights for a pittance before they become stars, wrote Section 203 of the Copyright Act, which gives those who sell music rights an opportunity to "terminate" grants after 35 years, provided they give proper notice between two and 10 years in advance. The law went into effect in 1978 -- the same year The Bee Gees' Saturday Night Fever soundtrack ruled the Billboard charts -- meaning that in 2013, the first crop of compositions and sound recordings comes up for termination.

The ticking clock has led to a gold rush of sorts as such industry heavyweights as Bob Dylan, Tom Waits and Tom Petty have raced to file termination notices with their labels and music publishers. Companies including Copyright Recapture have even popped up offering to help relatively small-time musicians like Jim Peterik, co-writer of Survivor's 1982 rock anthem "Eye of the Tiger," navigate the ins and outs of the rules. With classic songs still generating hundreds of thousands of dollars per year in sales and licensing revenue, the sense among top music lawyers is that millions of dollars in lucrative song rights could soon revert to their original creators, creating big trouble for the traditional owners.
"The record labels are going to start losing some very valuable albums," says Los Angeles music attorney Lee Phillips, who reps several top acts, including the Eagles, that recently have filed termination notices. "I'm sure the labels are having a hundred business affairs meetings saying, 'What do we do?' "

The rights grab doesn't necessarily mean that superstar rockers are planning to go into the music publishing or distribution business on their own. But taking back rights to music that has become part of the culture will allow artists to renegotiate much more favorable deals, often with the same companies that successfully exploited their work for years. Songs like Funkadelic's 1978 classic "One Nation Under a Groove," whose writers and performers might once have been paid pennies on the dollar for music sales, could soon receive dimes, nickels or even quarters, given how often that song is played.
So far, some record companies have responded as they often do -- with litigation. The dizzying complexity of the Copyright Act leaves several gray areas when it comes to determining whether artists are entitled to terminate rights grants. So-called works for hire don't fall under the rule, for instance, and music publishers have argued that a co-author of a work can't terminate their or their grant unless the rest of the co-authors are on board as well, which some lawyers say is akin to herding cats because rights often are owned by heirs or others who no longer work together.

One case being watched closely involves Victor Willis, the original Village People singer who wrote many of the group's biggest hits, such as "Y.M.C.A.," "Macho Man" and "In the Navy." Willis filed paperwork in 2011 to regain control of their share of 32 of the band's songs, including "Y.M.C.A.," which alone has generated millions of dollars since its 1978 release. After Willis delivered the bad news to Scorpio Music and Can't Stop Productions, their publishing administrators took them to federal court, arguing that the termination is improper because, among other reasons, the songs were created by several Village People and might have been a work for hire.
The Willis case, which is still being hotly litigated, raises several issues, chief among them: If one co-author can grab back rights without their fellow authors also terminating, the floodgates might open. "The unilateral right to terminate would become massive," says Los Angeles litigator Miles Feldman, who has filed notices for several musician and songwriter clients. "My sense is that the word already is going around and that artists are becoming more aware of these rights. This is only the beginning."
Start those patriotic cheers, because the U.S. can now claim the record for most electric cars in one place.
A judge from the Guinness Book of World Records certified on Saturday that 507 electric cars were gathered at an event in Cupertino, California, beating the total set at an event in Germany earlier this year.

Only battery-electric cars were counted toward the total. While there were many plug-in hybrids on hand, the record only applies to vehicles that use electricity as their sole source of energy.
Even electric bikes were left out of the tally, because they have a secondary source of power in the form of pedals.
There was still a wide variety of vehicles present, including examples of the Nissan Leaf, Tesla Model S, Toyota RAV4 EV, and Kia Soul EV.

Also participating was Stella, a solar-powered "energy-positive car" built by students from the Eindhoven University of Technology in The Netherlands.
According to its creators, this experimental vehicle can absorb twice as much energy through its solar panels as it needs per day.
The rally was part of National Drive Electric Week, a series of nationwide events that promote electric cars.
Organized by advocacy group Plug In America in concert with other national organizations like the Sierra Club and Electric Auto Association, National Drive Electric Week encompassed 152 events in 35 states, as well as Canada, Italy, and The Netherlands.

The Cupertino rally was organized by the San Francisco bayLEAFs and the Silicon Valley chapter of the Electric Auto Association.
The 507-car total achieved there surpasses the 481 cars gathered at a rally in Stuttgartt, Germany, earlier this year.
Organizers originally claimed to have assembled 507 vehicles--which the California event would have merely tied--but Guinness would not recognize that figure.

German heavyweights Mucke Motorsport will run four drivers in the 2016 Italian F4 championship; Mauricio Baiz, Ye Yifei, Devlin Defrancesco and Aldo Festante.
After enjoying a successful maiden season in the series in 2015 taking second in the teams championship, and with drivers Robert Shwartzman and David Beckmann finishing third and fourth in the series respectively, Mucke has signed four different drivers for its 2016 Italian campaign.
Baiz will be returning to the series after undertaking a full season last year with Euronova Racing. The Venezuelan took a single podium and a handful of points scoring finishes on their way to 12th in the standings.
Ye will also be a returnee joining mid-way through the 2015 season with RB Racing. Their best result was a seventh place finish at Imola. The 15-year-old from China had also taken part in a full season of French F4 alongside the Italian series, where they enjoyed better results including two wins towards the end of the season.
Canadian Defrancesco, who recently finished tenth overall in the 2016 Toyota Racing Series championship, spent the latter half of 2015 in the Ginetta Junior Championship and will undertake their Italian F4 duties alongside a drive with Carlin in the British-based MSA Formula series.
Italian Festante will be a rookie to single seater racing after spending the past few years in karts. They competed in both the WSK Champions Cup and CIK-FIA European Championship last season.
While last year Mucke ran drivers across the German and Italian F4 series, its 2016 quartet for the latter championship are not among the trio of drivers it announced for Germany last month.
Televangelist Pat Robertson today put a new spin on former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell's failed “throw the wife under the bus” defense strategy: comparing McDonnell to Adam. “The 700 Club” host explained that just as Eve seduced Adam into eating fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, McDonnell's wife, Maureen, likewise led the governor astray.
“He's like Adam, you know, Eve was the one that got seduced by the snake but Adam ate the fruit and I think Bob McDonnell got seduced,” they said.
Robertson, reacting to the sentencing of McDonnell to two years in prison, also repeated their previous allegation that the Republican governor was the victim of a political prosecution.
McDonnell attended Robertson's Regent University (then Christian Broadcasting University Network University), where they wrote their notorious thesis on “The Republican Party's Vision for the Family,” and has remained close to the televangelist. A Robertson-led charity offered McDonnell a job as a way to help them avoid jail time.

You may be planning to wear green this St. Patrick's Day. Green, the color of kissing the Irish! The color of money! The color of… horrible, horrible death.
At least when it came to green dyes through the Victorian age.
In 1814, a company in Schweinfurt, Germany, called the Wilhelm Dye and White Lead Company developed a new green dye. It was brighter than most traditional green dyes. It was bolder. The shade was so jewel-like that it quickly began being called "emerald green." And women loved it. Largely because it was during this time that gas lighting, rather than candlelight, was being introduced. When women went out to parties at night, the rooms were considerably brighter than they had been only a few decades before. These party-goers wanted to make sure they were wearing gowns that stood out boldly — gowns in a shade like emerald green. People also began using it for wallpaper and carpeting. Victorian Britain was said to be "bathed in… green."
Unfortunately, the reason that dye was so striking is that it was made with arsenic, as it a topic that Alison Matthews David covers extensively in their book, Fashion Victims: The Dangers of Dress Past and Present.
The effects of arsenic exposure are horrific. In addition to being deadly, it produces ulcers all over the skin. Those who come in close contact with it might develop scabs and sores wherever it touched. It can also make your hair fall out, and can cause people to vomit blood before shutting down their livers and kidneys.
So, this is probably one of the worst chemicals for a society to be "bathed in."
This was obviously unpleasant for women who wore green apparel. In 1871, one "lady who purchased a box of green-colored gloves at a well-known and respectable house" was horrified to find that their hands broke out in blisters after putting them on. Unless the dye was sealed, sweaty palms could cause the dye to run onto the wearer's skin. Other accounts from this era tell of babies dying in their nurseries after playing on green carpets or rubbing up against green wallpaper. One foreign dignitary even told Queen Victoria that the green wallpaper in Buckingham Palace had made them ill. This sounds like a ridiculous dig at their taste in decor until you realize that they were absolutely correct. Queen Victoria, clearly less sensitive than I would have been, had the wallpaper removed, though perhaps because when the dye was applied to wallpaper, a "mouse-like odor" was produced. Ironically, when people in these nurseries or rooms became sick, they were often put to bed in those very spaces, where the arsenic would ultimately kill them.
And if you think the effects were terrifying for the people who merely brushed against these fabrics, wait until you hear what happened to the women who manufactured them, working with the dye every day. Matilda Scheurer, a 19-year-old woman who applied the arsenic green dye to fake flowers, died in a way that horrified the populace in 1861. They threw up green vomit, the whites of their eyes turned green, and when they died, they claimed that "everything they looked at was green." When people began investigating such workshops, they found other women in similar distress, like one "who had been kept on [working with] green... till their face was one mass of sores."
And doctors knew this was happening. They began talking about the "great deal of slow poisoning going on in Great Britain" as early as 1857. Before long, illustrations were being run in newspapers depicting skeletons dancing in green dresses. The Times pondered, following a case where arsenic poisoning was spread through socks, "What manufactured article in these days of high-pressure civilization can possibly be trusted if socks may be dangerous?" I mean, to be honest, the ones that were not green. Those were the ones that could be trusted.
The Victorian slang for an attractive person — "killing" — even took on new meaning, with the British Medical Journal remarking: "Well may the fascinating wearer of it be called a killing creature. They actually carry in their skirts poison enough to slay the whole of the admirers they may meet with in half a dozen ball-rooms."
You would think that these stories would have caused people to immediately stop wearing the color, but, of course, they didn't. Consumers throughout history have engaged in all manner of wildly unhealthy behaviors for the sake of fashion. And production of the color was a huge industry! So for years, some people were willing to put up with these grotesque deaths if the alternative was muted shades, or, as one proponent of green dye described them, "abominable grays, hideous browns, and dreadful yellows."
Some people tried to tell themselves that they'd be safe provided they did not lick the fabric or wallpaper, which was, unfortunately, not true. Others claimed that the doctors were simply lying, because some people will always believe that science is just not real. All this in spite of the fact that every Victorian household probably had a jar of arsenic to poison rats, so they knew it was poisonous.
This backlash meant it took until 1895 for regulations to be put in place regulating conditions in factories where workers would be exposed to arsenic. Fortunately, by then, "in the absence of government intervention, the people of Britain had used the power of their pocketbooks" to demand alternatives to the arsenic-based dye.
Thank goodness they did.
To this day, green dye has a bad reputation among seamstresses. Women who work with fabrics at Chanel believe that is linked to "bad luck." Fortunately, the green dye on your clothing is no longer made with arsenic. Although, if this St. Patrick's Day you notice a "mouse-like odor" emanating from your outfit… well, someone probably just spilled Guinness on it. But if you want to strip naked just to be safe, far be it from us to stop you.

With the cancellation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an estimated 200,000 children are at risk of losing their parents.
In September, the Trump administration announced it was rescinding DACA pending a six-month delay. The program is an Obama-era initiative that shields undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children from deportation, and allows them to work legally in the country. Unless the Republican-controlled Congress passes a law granting them legal status, they could soon be subject to deportation. That uncertainty has instilled fear among many of the nearly 700,000 DACA recipients, but particularly those who are parents of U.S. citizens.
“It's been really tough, it's been a rollercoaster of emotion,” said Eliana Fernandez, a DACA recipient and mother of two children, ages 10 and 5. “What's going to happen with my life, with my work, with my children? I've been trying to process everything.”
An alleged jihadist arrested in June on charges that they plotted to blow up Times Square may also be the fiend who stabbed a 9-year-old Staten Island boy in the neck five months earlier in what some investigators now believe was a botched ISIS audition.
But NYPD detectives investigating the Jan. 9 knife attack have been frustrated by the feds, who won't give them access to terror suspect Fareed Mumuni, said a source familiar with the probe.
Mumuni, 21, lived only 600 yards from Jermaine Culver, who was stabbed as they walked to school in the Mariners Harbor section of Staten Island.
A surveillance camera on a home across the street captured a stocky attacker as they stalked the boy from behind on Union Avenue before grabbing them around the neck and stabbing them in their back, head, neck and arm.
Jermaine is seen stumbling a few steps before they regain their footing and runs.
“It looks like he's trying to kill that kid,” said Luis Padilla, 44, the home's owner. “He went straight for the jugular.”
Following the savagery, Jermaine was afraid to leave the hospital. The shell-shocked boy was eventually sent to live with an aunt in Atlanta.
“But he's alive and fine and well,” said their 21-year-old brother, Shawn Williams.
Williams said the family remains in the dark about their case a year later.
“We still don't know,” they said. “It seems like the cops gave up on it.”
In the days after the attack, cops distributed fliers reading, “Wanted for Assault 1,” with a surveillance photo of the attacker running down Leyden Avenue. The NYPD also stationed a mobile command unit at the corner of Union and Leyden.
“They came up with less than zero,” the source said.
Cops got their first break in the case when federal agents with the Joint Terrorism Task Force foiled an alleged four-man, New York-New Jersey terror operation in June. The group had been under surveillance since at least April.
Munther Omar Saleh, 20, of Queens, was arrested on June 13 and charged with plotting to use a pressure-cooker bomb to attack Times Square or One World Trade Center. They had also been spotted surveilling the George Washington Bridge.
Mumuni, who was studying social work at the College of Staten Island, and Saleh, a student at Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology in Queens, had met multiple times in May, according to court documents.
They were captured on phone recordings and “exchanged electronic communications in which they discussed attacking members of law enforcement,” the papers say.
Four days after Saleh's arrest, the task force descended on Mumuni's Mersereau Avenue home at 6:35 a.m. to execute a search warrant.
Mumuni tried to bury a kitchen knife in an agent's chest, authorities said. The blade was stopped by the agent's body armor.
Mumuni, court documents say, “espouses violent jihadist beliefs.” They allegedly told authorities that they had pledged allegiance to ISIS and that if they failed to join the group in the Mideast, they planned to attack law enforcement.
Investigators believe that if Mumuni was the man who knifed Jermaine, the attack could have been Mumuni's audition for the ISIS, the bloodthirsty terror group that has released a series of videos of hostage decapitations.
“If you look at the video, it looks like they were trying to slit their throat,” the source said.
NYPD detectives want to quiz Mumuni in the assault, describing the purported jihadist as a “person of interest.”
They have a physical “similarity to the description in the video, they lived three blocks away, and they like to play with knives and attempted to stab a federal agent,” the source said.
Detective Edward Patterson of the 121st Precinct on Staten Island is assigned to case.
Mumuni's attorney, Anthony Ricco, could not be reached for comment.

The US has no national electricity grid. Instead, it has a patchwork of grids, operated as closed-off regional and local fiefdoms with little trade among them.
One of the most important steps America can take to integrate more wind and solar power is to connect and expand those grids.
California is trying to take a small step in that direction. In the process, it is revealing the kinds of political tensions that stand in the way of grid integration.
California needs somewhere to put all its solar energy
The story comes to us via an excellent report by Lauren Sommer at KQED Science. It's about a problem that's beginning to hit in California — and will hit in other places in years to come, as renewable energy spreads.
Every so often, solar panels in California produce more solar energy than the grid needs. When these oversupply events occur, grid operators manually "curtail" solar production, cutting some panels off from the grid, effectively letting clean, zero-carbon energy go to waste.
This doesn't happen all that often yet — roughly 2.2 GWh of renewable energy were curtailed due to oversupply in 2014, relative to the 44,000 GWh of renewable energy the grid used — but the problem is expected to get worse than wind and solar expand in the state.
This illustrates the key challenge that wind and solar (together known as variable renewable energy, or VRE) pose to self-contained grids: their intermittency. A lot of solar comes flooding in at midday, and then it all goes away at night. Sometimes it can go away all at once and come back a few minutes later (a phenomenon known as "clouds"). Wind can come all at once and then die down all at once.
It's a challenge for today's grids to handle both the quantities involved at peak VRE production times and the steep "ramps" up or down in supply and demand that come with VRE.
There are many ways to tackle the challenges of integrating VRE. I've written about the big picture here and more fine-grained, near-term solutions here.
But perhaps the easiest way to solve the problem, or at least postpone it, is to make the grid bigger. The larger the geographical area the grid covers, the more variations in supply and demand can be smoothed out. When one area is at peak VRE production, it can ship power to other areas rather than curtail it.
That's just what the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) wants to do: link up California's grid with those around it. "You're operating your little piece of the system," CAISO VP Keith Casey told Sommer of KQED, "but if you can operate it as an integrated whole, you can just operate the system more efficiently."
Conceptually, this makes all the sense in the world. When it comes to the details, though, the politics can get sticky.
California's clean grid meets PacifiCorp's dirty one
There are a number of grid "balancing authorities" (grids run by particular utilities) near California, to which it could theoretically connect:
(Follow the link to see what all those acronyms stand for.)
CAISO's first partnership is with PacifiCorp, a utility that runs a grid in Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, and Oregon.
(Earlier this year I wrote about Oregon's pledge to go coal-free and how it would affect PacifiCorp.)
There are already some (currently little-used) power lines strung between the two regions, which could be used for greater coordination between CAISO and PacifiCorp. So they are planning an integration of their operations, scheduled to be in effect by 2019:
A PacifiCorp-funded study found that the integration would benefit ratepayers across both regions. And it would certainly help CAISO find a way to export (rather than curtail) its excess solar energy.
But there's a wrinkle.
If CAISO and PacifiCorp become one big grid, it opens up all sorts of regulatory and legal questions. Who manages an interstate grid? Who regulates it? Do California's laws apply to it? Can they, legally speaking?
PacifiCorp is a big owner of coal plants — 60 percent of its energy comes from coal. All that coal will now effectively be on California's grid. California has worked hard, economically and politically, to clean up its grid. What will happen to that progress?
These concerns led several state lawmakers to write the governor laying out a list of "significant unanswered questions" and requirements related to the integration.
They want to ensure that California's pollution and greenhouse gases continue to be reduced, that California's renewable energy mandates continue to be met, that California ratepayers benefit, and that investment not be shifted into PacifiCorp's territory at California's expense.
And because CAISO and its board were created by the legislature, presumably a new act of the legislature would be required to expand them, so these legislators will have to be heard and satisfied. (I asked a top staffer if their questions had been answered to their satisfaction; they have not.)
These parochial concerns make complete sense. These politicians are, after all, representing Californians.
But the bigger picture remains: Grid expansion has to happen eventually. The climate certainly doesn't care about California's emissions; it only cares about total emissions. If sharing VRE with PacifiCorp lowers overall emissions, it is to the good, even if Californians consume less VRE than they might otherwise have. Somehow, the economics and politics of grid expansion have to be worked out.
The perils of state-based climate and energy policy
California's experience reveals some of the dysfunctions that come with the US lacking a coherent national climate policy. When each state with green ambitions has its own regulations, its own targets, its own mandates, even its own grid, it can feel protective of its own progress and loath to dilute it by hooking up with more laggardly states.
And California legislators are not crazy to feel that way. Wyoming and Utah are fighting tooth and nail against Obama's Clean Power Plan. Wyoming is deeply invested in coal production. Oregon-based PacifiCorp is heavily invested in coal plants (though it is moving away from them). Opening CAISO's grid to possible federal oversight also opens it to various federal lawsuits, many launched by laggardly states, meant to stop clean energy regulations.
Then again, it's the laggardly states that need the renewable energy, and the clean states that have got it — in California's case, at least temporarily, too much of it.
Hooking up into larger and larger grids is part of the logic of transitioning to clean energy. It is necessary in order for California to hit its ambitious 50 percent renewables target. And it's probably necessary in order for the US to hit the targets it promised in Paris.
On some time scale, a national grid is both necessary and inevitable.
Transmission is a one-time fix
Variable renewable energy poses what you might call "whole system" challenges to energy grids. Once VRE rises to a certain level of penetration, it begins to swing between producing more energy than the system needs to and producing, in periods of extended calm or clouds, almost none.
Unless you can do something about those huge peaks and valleys, you need almost 100 percent redundancy — enough backup power plants to supply 100 percent of demand in the event that VRE is providing none.
But big coal and nuclear plants can't just turn off in the morning and turn on in the evening. Even where they are physically capable, it's too expensive. So you end up needing lots and lots of natural gas plants. Not ideal.
The way states and countries have achieved high VRE penetration to date is by cheating these whole-system problems. They cheat it by making the system bigger, hooking up transmission to surrounding grids so that they can offload the their occasional VRE surplus and import power to back up their VRE.
That's what Denmark did, linking its grid to Sweden, Norway, and Germany so that it can export wind power when it has more than it needs and import power when the wind is idle.
That's what CAISO is trying to do, linking to surrounding Western states.
But note that this is a one-time-only way to postpone the problem. Eventually states or regions are going to reach a point where there are no bigger grids to hook up. And then the whole-system problems return. At that point, the system can't be made any bigger, so the problems have to be solved some other way.
We still have to sort out storage and shift demand
One way to tackle the problems is cheap and effective energy storage, to absorb the midday VRE surplus and return power at night or when it's cloudy.
The other big one is figuring out ways to shift demand so that it coincides better with periods of peak VRE production. There are lots of ways to do that, from incentives that change human behavior to automated networks of electric vehicle batteries to ... water heaters.
California is smart to set its sights on a bigger grid. It will ease the immediate problem. But the state should also be pushing as hard as possible toward better storage and better demand shifting (and all the other strategies I covered here), because sooner or later the whole-system problems have to be solved, and the sooner they are, the greater the long-term payoff.

“I think most of the smart people are saying there's not going to be a [brokered] convention,” they said. “Interestingly, the ones who say there's going to be a [brokered] convention — usually they're the pundits that have been wrong forever, the ones who have been wrong about me.”
The Howard County Public School System's 12 high schools should be excluded from the impending redistricting in the 2018-2019 school year, according to Interim Superintendent Michael Martirano, whose recommendations to the Board of Education Tuesday called for halting high school redistricting at least until the county's new, 13th high school opens in 2022.
To address the number of elementary students feeding into middle schools as well as the opening of Elementary School 42 in August 2018, Martirano proposed moving approximately 313 students at the middle school level and about 1,900 students at the elementary school level. These students would shift from schools in the eastern part of the county to underutilized schools in the western region.
Martirano's recommendation cuts the feasibility study's earlier proposed redistricting numbers by nearly a quarter, which suggested redistricting about 8,800 students. After Martirano first introduced the fast-tracking of High School 13 last month, the Attendance Area Committee's original recommendation to redistrict 6,500 students dropped to 5,600 students.
In their proposal before the board Oct. 3, Martirano included their plan to open High School 13 two years earlier, which would add more seats at the high school level and reduce overcrowding, they said.
Thirty-five Howard County schools currently fall outside the board policy's target utilization, which limits building capacity to between 90 and 110 percent. Martirano said they included input from the Attendance Area Committee and more than 8,000 public surveys and three alternative plans to compile their recommendations.
The language immersion program Martirano had previously proposed to alleviate some redistricting in elementary schools was “never meant for implementation” in 2018 due to limits from the Capital Improvement Program, they said Tuesday. However, the language immersion programs would be implemented within the next decade, Martirano said.
If high schools were redistricted for the next school year, they said, the county would have to redistrict again in 2022 when High School 13 opens.
“I don't want to put the county through two redistricting [processes],” Martirano said.
To provide some relief at the high school level for the upcoming year, Martirano proposed expanding the Jump start initiative, which allows high school students to take community college classes under dual enrollment, in an effort to attract students away from overcrowded high schools and to increase enrollment at under-capacity high schools.
Early college programs are currently offered at Oakland Mills High and the Applications and Research Lab, where students can earn up to two years of college credits while paying half the tuition.
Martirano proposed expanding the program offerings at Oakland Mills High and introducing programs at River Hill High. The two schools rank among those with the least overcrowding problems. Martirano said about 350 students would then voluntarily move from Long Reach, Centennial and Howard high schools, the county's most overcrowded high schools. This also helps create a partnership between the public school system and Howard Community College, Martirano said.
“As we're bringing the capacity down at those three overcrowded schools, I'm now increasing capacity at the two lowest schools at the high school level,” Martirano said. “I will provide transportation for those students to move from those three high schools to the two high schools. … There's enticement because it's providing a different set of course offerings that are not provided at their current schools.”
William Barnes, the school system's chief academic officer, said every high school in Howard County offers some college-level courses. The early college program — a STEM program — was introduced at Oakland Mills High two years ago, with about 40 students enrolled.
Martirano's recommendation would allow high school students to effectively graduate with 60 college credits and begin their college years as juniors, Barnes said.
“We're going to work with teams to figure out what programs of interest might exist,” Barnes said. “While kids can pick up four or five college courses at other schools, Oakland Mills and River Hill will have upward of 20 courses available to students. It's an incredible savings to families and students.”
Martirano said these program implementations were successful during their time as superintendent of schools in St. Mary's County.
“We were able to offer better programs and balanced enrollments at the same time,” they said. “This has got a history of success in other districts. It's just something that Howard County has chosen not to do at an accelerated level.”
Collaborative Community Plan
The day before Martirano's presentation, the community group United for HoCo Schools released its alternative plan for balancing enrollment in Howard County schools, with ideas such as open enrollment and partial redistricting.
Titled the “Collaborative Community Plan,” Cynthia Fikes, one of the plan's authors and a member of the group, said they saw a lack of community outreach and transparency by the school board and Attendance Area Committee during the process of analyzing possible solutions for redistricting.
Their plan called for opening not only High School 13 in 2022, but a 14th high school in 2023, and stops comprehensive redistricting except at the elementary school level until after the completion of High School 13.
As an alternative to large-scale redistricting, the plan includes the implementation of open enrollment at the high school level, which would allow students to apply for attendance at a high school outside their school district in the county, as long as the desired building is below school capacity level.
“Elementary redistricting needs to happen, that's moving forward. We're looking at stopping the major disruption until we have some knowns in place,” Fikes said. “There is no happy answer to redistricting, but at least people need a voice.”
Martirano's final recommendations clashed with the Attendance Area Committee's latest findings to “scale back” the countywide redistricting, moving 10 percent of students at all school levels — about 5,656 students. The committee still suggested a countywide comprehensive redistricting, but limited high school redistricting to only incoming ninth-graders, unless they had an older sibling already attending that high school.
The AAC proposed that limiting redistricting to elementary schools would accommodate the opening of Elementary School 42 in August 2018 in Hanover and relieve overcrowding in schools that are above 120 percent capacity – a max capacity set by school board policy.

To many a sentimental Canadian, maple syrup evokes scenes of towering maple trees in quiet forests, the drip-drip of sap into metal buckets and steamy sugar shacks where sap is boiled into the golden nectar we drizzle on everything from pancakes to salmon. But that notion of the iconic sugar bush could soon be joined by a radically different landscape, thanks to a discovery by Vermont researchers.
Maple trees in the sugar bush at the Kortright Centre are tapped using the old-fashioned spout and bucket method. ( RICK EGLINTON / TORONTO STAR FILE PHOTO ) University of Vermont researchers Abby van den Berg and Tim Perkins have found a way to extract sap from maple saplings that could change the future of the maple syrup industry. ( Sally McCay ) Maple syrup of the future may come from plantations of saplings outfitted with a special "sap cap" and tubing to extract significantly more sap. ( Sally McCay, University of Vermont )
Picture this: plantations featuring row upon row of saplings, tops cut off and fitted with caps to suction sap from their stems. It's a revolutionary new process the researchers say could boost syrup yields at a much faster pace and one day be a viable alternative for certain producers. “This is very, very different from standard methods,” says Tim Perkins, research professor and director of the University of Vermont's Proctor Maple Research Center, who developed it with colleague Abby van den Berg.

“It would allow producers to fairly rapidly increase production, but not have to go out and buy a lot more land to do it.” Maple trees are typically tapped once they are full grown at 35 to 40 years old. A standard maple sugar operation might have 80 mature trees per hectare and produce an average of 150 gallons of maple syrup. But a plantation of 6,000 saplings per hectare, which could start producing as soon as seven years after planting, might make 10 times that amount, the researchers predict. Still, they are treading carefully in an industry steeped in tradition, where you can find producers managing the same forests cared for by their great-great grandparents. Perkins stresses that they don't expect maple syrup-makers to run out and cut down their mature trees to convert to this new method. But it may be an important option for supplementing existing operations, or to generate income from old farmland or existing lots of saplings. It could also be an alternative when existing forests have been damaged in storms or by pests like Asian long-horned beetles. “It's not something we're thinking should take over the maple world,” says Perkins. “We think of it as a tool producers can use if the circumstances are right for them.”

They and van den Berg, who've been working on the process for four years, first went public with it last October at a meeting of maple syrup makers in Moncton, where it was greeted “with a mixture of intrigue and skepticism,” says forestry expert Chris Dickie, one of the conference organizers. They've given five presentations since, which rippled through the maple syrup world, though the “sap cap” device they invented to extract sap from sapling stems won't be available until 2016 at the earliest. The research centre has applied for an international patent. It's hardly surprising that the innovation would be greeted with raised eyebrows in a business with such a quaint and sentimental history. Not only is maple syrup a national symbol in Canada, it's also a hot commodity that was recently at the heart of an $18-million heist in Quebec — soon to be the subject of a motion picture. The plantation approach “is a complete departure,” says Dickie, executive director of Infor in Fredericton, which works with the province on forest management. They say while it might one day be used in certain regions like southern Ontario where land is expensive and maple forests are scarce, they don't see a future for it in New Brunswick, where producers tap trees on Crown land and there is no shortage of mature trees. Ontario producer Ray Bonenberg, who has been making maple syrup all their life, doubts a revolution is on the way. “If people think they're going to plant a plantation and make a pile of money they're sadly mistaken in my view,” says Bonenberg, president of the Ontario Maple Syrup Producers Association and owner of Mapleside Sugar Bush in Pembroke, Ont., which runs about 1,400 taps each season. Like many producers, they have a small sapling stand and says it might make sense to try there for a bit of supplemental income. But they believe the yield would be limited, and so would the lifespan of saplings subjected to the process. The University of Vermont discovery goes back to 2010 when Perkins and van den Berg chopped the top off a maple sapling in order to study sap flow and the vacuum systems commonly used to increase it. After the spring thaw they noticed something unexpected. Conventional wisdom is that sap depends on moisture flowing down from the crown of a maple tree. Yet the sap from the topless tree, flowing from its stem into a sealed plastic bag, kept running. And running. It continued long past the point of depleting its own moisture supply. Their conclusion: the process was pulling moisture up from the ground through the tree roots, picking up the sugar in its trunk and travelling out the stem. The discovery caused “quite a lot of excitement,” says Perkins. “So we started to discuss what kind of implications this could have.” Costs of production would be comparable to existing sugar bushes, they say, with the higher yields offset by higher costs of equipment and labour for many more trees. “But if you have to start buying land to increase sugar operation, this method is far cheaper because it requires one-tenth a fraction of the acreage.” As growers develop stocks of sweeter seedlings, that could boost the potential further. There could be other advantages for an industry at the mercy of Mother Nature. Syrup production in mature forests depends on freeze-thaw cycles to create sap flow and on deep freezes to convert the starch in root systems into sugar needed for sweet sap. Using the researchers' vacuum pressure technique, the saplings wouldn't need the same stimulus to make sap flow. And their smaller root systems freeze more quickly, making them less vulnerable to the effects of warmer winters caused by climate change. The process could also be applied to other trees with sweet sap such as birch, walnut or palm. While some in the industry say the plantation approach faces an uphill battle, Perkins notes it's an evolving business. The old pails have given way to networks of plastic tubing from trees, vacuum pressure is used to extract sap, and reverse osmosis has shortened the lengthy process of boiling sap into syrup. The days of farmers in flannel shirts collecting sap with horses and wooden pails are pretty much gone, said Perkins, although some old-fashion sugar bushes remain for tourists and school kids .
Gaddafi's glamorous blonde lawyer daughter joins soldiers on the front line
Fleeing rebels pushed out of Ras Lanuf
Ragtag opposition seems incapable of holding ground without air strikes
David Cameron says they have not ruled out arming rebels
Five Libyan diplomats expelled from the UK
Officials downplay 'flickers' of Al Qaeda involvement in rebel forces
'Claudia Schiffer of North Africa' rallies troops
Colonel Gaddafi has unleashed their latest weapon against Libya's revolutionaries - their glamorous blonde daughter.
The tyrant today continued to press home a counter-attack in the east of the county, pushing fleeing rebel forces back out of Ras Lanuf - a town they had only regained with the help of international air strikes a couple of days ago.
And they now hope to rally fresh support among weary troops with the help of their pretty 34-year-old daughter Aisha.
Woman of war: Colonel Gaddafi's glamorous daughter Aisha, 34, wears a veil and waves their father's flag as they conjure support among Libyans weary from weeks of conflict
The lawyer - who once represented Saddam Hussein - has been pictured in Tripoli waving the leader's green flag and dressed in a veil.
The traditional costume is a far cry from their usual look caked in make-up and wearing the latest designer clothes. The flashy outfits have earned them a reputation as 'the Claudia Schiffer of North Africa'.
They have reportedly been spurred on to take part in the fight to seek revenge over the reported death of their younger brother Khamis.
The 27-year-old is believed to have been killed by a kamikaze fighter pilot during air strikes earlier this month. However Libyan state TV yesterday claimed they were alive.
It came as Gaddafi's forces today launched a heavy bombardment that had rebel forces fleeing Ras Lanuf - as the opposition seems incapable of making any headway, or even holding ground, without constant air strikes.
The rapid reverse comes just two days after the rebels raced westwards along the all-important coastal road in hot pursuit of the government army that had its tanks and artillery demolished in five days of aerial bombardment in the town of Ajdabiyah.
Aisha has become known as the 'Claudia Schiffer of North Africa' for their love of designer clothes and their high-flying career as a lawyer which saw their work for Iraq tyrant Saddam Hussein
Family: Aisha was reportedly spurred on by the death of their brother Khamis Gadaffi (left).  They are said to have been killed when a rebel jet crashed into their compound. Right, U.S. aircraft deployed above Libya
Gaddafi's army first ambushed the insurgent pick-up convoy outside the dictator's hometown of Sirte, then outflanked them through the desert, a manoeuvre requiring the sort of discipline entirely lacking in the rag-tag rebel force.
On the offensive, government tanks and artillery have unleashed a fierce bombardment on towns and cities which has usually forced rebels to swiftly flee. That tactic appears to have worked once again in Ras Lanuf, an oil terminal town, 230 miles east of the capital Tripoli.
'Gaddafi hit us with huge rockets. They have entered Ras Lanuf,' said rebel fighter Faraj Muftah. The rebels also claimed French aircraft were bombing Gaddafi's forces around the town.
There is mounting speculation that Western forces will arm the rebels, as U.S. President Barack Obama today said they would not rule the move out.
Speaking in the Commons David Cameron also said supplying weapons had not been ruled out, but that no final decision had been taken.
They also announced that five Gaddafi loyalists at the Libyan embassy in London had been expelled from the country amid concerns that they pose a 'security risk'.
Any decision to supply arms will worry analysts who yesterday said the 'flickers' of Al Qaeda and Hezbollah involvement had been detected in the rebel movement - but British officials denied any link.
Aisha, who married their cousin in 2006, still bears a resentment of the West after their adopted sister Hanan, nine, was killed by a U.S. raid on Tripoli during the last bombardment of the oil-rich state.
They said at the time: 'I woke up to the screams of my sister, with blood splattered all over me.'
Aisha has supported the IRA and worked as a lawyer for Saddam Hussein. In an interview in October last year they told of the charity work that they do in Libya for women's rights.
Fans: Aisha was mobbed by supporters of their father when they made the public appearance at the Bab Al Azizia compound in Tripoli
Chants: Aisha shouted to the crowd that their father was a 'great man and leader' as coalition air strikes on the dictator's strongholds continued across the country
Asked about human rights abuses in the country's justice system they said that 'criticisms are completely groundless' and they 'can't understand why people say that'.
They also defended their support of Saddam Hussein and the IRA and said their love for their father was 'beyond description'.
'People forget that before they are a great man and leader, they are also my father, my friend and my brother.  They are very close to me, and I feel so safe when I am with him,' they told the Daily Telegraph.
Since the Libyan protests started Aisha has been stripped of their role as a UN Goodwill Ambassador due to their support of their father's massacre of thousands of Libyan's in the country's brutal civil war.
Plumes of smoke and fire could be seen in the air yesterday as missiles rained down over the Taiura suburb of Triopoli, near one of the Libyan dictator's residences.
In addition to the attack on the Libyan leader's home, since Monday afternoon the U.S. has launched 22 Tomahawk cruise missiles from the Mediterranean at Gaddafi's military targets.
Resistance: Hundreds of resurgent Libyan rebels gather near Nofilia, 62 miles from Sirte yesterday as Gaddafi forces pushed them back further east
The Wildrose Party has set June 6 as the date for its leadership contest, meaning it could be choosing its new leader only after a provincial election that is looking increasingly likely to be held this spring.
The party also confirmed Friday that it will not allow controversial Conservative MP Rob Anders to run for leader as it tries to pick up the pieces from the unprecedented defection of nine MLAs, including leader Danielle Smith, to the Progressive Conservative government.
Wildrose president Jeff Callaway said in an interview that the party's executive committee had decided on the first Saturday in June for a leadership convention in Calgary, with members able to vote in person or by mail-in ballot.
With Premier Jim Prentice refusing to rule out a spring election that many observers expect will be called this March, Callaway said the Tory government should stick to its own legislation, which schedules the next vote for the period between March 1 and May 31 of 2016.
Nevertheless, they said Wildrose is ready to contest the election with interim leader Heather Forsyth, who has said they won't run again, at the party's helm.
“We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,” said Callaway, noting the party expects to have close to 30 candidates in place by the end of next week.
Callaway said they expect to see as many as five contenders — who will have to pony up a $20,000 non-refundable deposit — vying for the Wildrose leadership.
Wildrose MLAs Drew Barnes and Shayne Saskiw, Calgary lawyer Richard Jones, former Strathcona County mayor Linda Osinchuk and former Canadian Taxpayers Federation Alberta director Derek Fildebrandt are among those considering entering the race.
But Callaway said one candidate who won't be on the ballot is Anders, who has landed in hot water numerous times for controversial comments and actions over their 17 years as MP for Calgary West.
The party will require potential contestants to have been Wildrose members for six months before the vote, though a waiver may be granted for individuals who hold jobs that require them to be non-partisan.
Callaway said a waiver will not be granted to Anders — who has made noises about running for leader — because they were not a Wildrose member as of January 10.
“There would be no waiver for him,” said Callaway.
“He would not qualify to run for the leadership of the party.”
Anders, who lost two federal Conservative nomination races last year, could not be reached for comment. They said earlier this week it should be up to Wildrose party members, not party officials, to determine whether they want them as leader.
Barnes, the MLA for Cypress-Medicine Hat, said they will make their own decision whether to run in the next week or so.
They said they wouldn't second-guess the party executive on Anders and said they had no worries about a June leadership vote, even if it does come after a spring vote.
“I think June 6 is a good pick and that gives us time to go out and engage Albertans,” said Barnes, one of five remaining Wildrose caucus members.
Barnes said the party will be ready if an election is called but former Wildrose leader Paul Hinman, who is seeking the party's nomination again in Cardston-Taber-Warner, said it has been left in a tough spot.
“Prentice gets to call (an election). We're on our back and our belly is exposed and they want to take full advantage of that,” they said.
Hinman said that if the writ is dropped in March, there is no way Wildrose could get a leader in place by that point.
They said they argued for a September leadership vote to give more time for the party to rebuild and Prentice to face the consequences of potentially unpopular tax hikes and spending cuts.
Pollster and political analyst Janet Brown expects the Wildrose leadership committee and executive considered all possible scenarios for having a new leader able to fight a spring election, only to find them logistically impossible.
But they said the party will be at a big disadvantage if it has no permanent leader during a campaign.
“It's a strange situation,” said Brown.
“The thing is, the leader is so important in defining what a party is, that it's going to be hard for voters to really know for sure they understand the Wildrose and whether they should or shouldn't be voting for them.”
Brown said one positive sign for Wildrose is the number of candidates who have expressed interest in running for the party's top job.
The cut-off date for entering the Wildrose race is a month ahead of the vote. Wildrose has set a $30,000 limit on donations, the same amount used in last year's Tory leadership race that selected Prentice.

How NAFTA Drove The Auto Industry South
President Bill Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement into law 20 years ago on Dec. 8, 1993. One of the clear beneficiaries over the past two decades has been the Mexican automobile industry.
ARUN RATH, HOST:
One of the clear beneficiaries of NAFTA in these two decades has been the Mexican automobile industry. Ford, Nissan, Honda and Audi are just some of the companies expanding production south of the border.
As NPR's Sonari Glinton reports, it's all been part of a southern shift in North America over the last 40 years.
SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: Mexico has had an auto industry since the '20s, but it really started getting big after NAFTA brought down many trade barriers between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
GARY HUFBAUER: The transformation of the auto industry in Mexico, as a result of NAFTA, was nothing short of dramatic. It was, in fact, the biggest transformation of any industry in all three of our countries.
GLINTON: Gary Hufbauer is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank in Washington, D.C. Hufbauer says Mexico has grown in part because, well, it had the most room for growth.
HUFBAUER: Because if you go back to the pre-NAFTA era, the auto industry in Mexico was highly protected - and I mean highly protected. The production was quite small and auto prices were two or three times higher than in the U.S.
GLINTON: Not only were the cars in Mexico more expensive, exporting or importing finished cars or parts was tough. Shipments got delayed at the border and were difficult to move around in an industry where, well, speed is of the essence.
Jack Nerad is a vice president and industry analyst at Kelley Blue Book. They say NAFTA changed a lot of that.
JACK NERAD: The American car industry was really the U.S. car industry, and there was a separate car industry in Mexico, and to some extent a separate car industry in Canada. And now, the North American car industry is, in a lot of ways, one in the same.
GLINTON: So if you were a global automaker and you wanted to sell cars in North America, the most important market for autos, you had to take a hard look at Mexico. There was access to the U.S. market. And the lowest paid Mexican worker makes less in a day than the highest paid American worker does in a hour.
So before NAFTA, there were only a handful of carmakers, now there are nearly a dozen major automakers in Mexico, and add to that, an explosion of suppliers. With all that, you might think, U.S. car jobs would just move wholesale to Mexico.
STEPHANIE BRINLEY: What is not happening is we're not closing plants in the United States and moving them to Mexico.
GLINTON: Stephanie Brinley is an analyst with IHS Automotive. They say Mexico has actually grown it's own auto industry by improving its infrastructure, its quality, and there's another reason: other free trade agreements.
BRINLEY: It's not just the North American Free Trade Agreement that allows trade between Mexico and Canada and the United States, but it's also some of Mexico's agreements with Europe and with Brazil and South America.
GLINTON: Many of the nearly three million cars a year that are produced in Mexico go to Europe and South America. While Mexico has come a long way, it still falls far behind the U.S. in productivity and, in many ways, quality. Jack Nerad with Kelley Blue Book says manufacturing autos in Mexico can still be a double-edged sword.
NERAD: There are infrastructure problems. There are problems with crime, corruption. Even sticking to contracts are a problem in Mexico. And so there are challenges there, certainly.
GLINTON: Nerad says NAFTA helped the Mexican auto industry reach its adolescence, and it's just going to keep on growing from there. Sonari Glinton, NPR News, Culver City.

Kerala Nurses New Salary 2017 Update:
Kerala has issued the government notification to change private hospital employees salary including Staff Nurses (Diploma and Bsc). Salary will be based on the type of category of the Hospital. The government decided to categorise each private hospitals into 4 categories based on their bed strength. New salary shall be paid with effect from 01st October 2017. Before finalising this notification any objections shall be informed to the concerned department within 2 months from the date of publication of this notification.
Government Notification November 2017: Kerala Nurses and Other Private Hospital Employees New Salary 2017
Earlier Updates:
After previous proposal rejected by Nurses union, today (20th July, 2017) new minimum wage has been fixed for nurses in Kerala. As per the new minimum salary nurses will get minimum Rs 20,000/- (Twenty Thousand Rupees) in a small hospital.
New minimum wages for nurses will be paid with effect from 01st August, 2017.
New committee will be formed to study feasibility of higher wages for Nurses. This committee has to report their findings with in a month. United Nurses Association has called of strike in the view of this decision.
10 July 2017: Ministry of Labour under Kerala government finally revised minimum wages of Staff Nurses to bring an end to the ongoing nurses' strike in the state in a crucial bilateral meeting held on Monday afternoon (10-07-2017).
Kerala Labor minister P. Ramakrishan chaired the bilateral meeting in which representatives of Nurses mainly United Nurses Association and of private hospital managements participated and raised their views.
Nurses salary were earlier revised in the year 2013. That time the government promised to revise it again within a year after government appointed committee's advice, but that did not happen. The Supreme Court in 2016 stipulated a salary scale for nurses equivalent to the government sector Nurses. A panel appointed by the apex court had recommended equal salaries for government and private sector nurses. The agitation in Kerala started after Association of Hospital management announced that this salary scale cannot be implemented in the state.
Final Decisions will be made on 20-07-2017
New minimum wages for the nurses in Kerala will be as follows:
Minimum Salary
Up to 300 bedded hospital-
Total Salary- Rs. 20014/- (minimum)
Up to 301-500 bedded hospital
Nursing Allowance- Rs. 1200/-
Additional Allowance- 15 % of Basic Salary
Total Gross Salary- Rs. 20950/- (minimum)
Up to 501- 800 bedded hospital

Gordon Brown has suffered a devastating collapse in their public standing, according to a new survey published in The Observer today which will put their leadership under intensified pressure.
As the Prime Minister begins their fightback with new proposals entitling mothers to more flexible working hours, the research shows that only one in five voters thinks they are doing a good job.  They are rated worse than David Cameron on every key leadership quality, including competence, decisiveness, fairness, likeability, trustworthiness and strength.
A unique opinion tracker using a panel of 5,000 voters, much larger than conventional opinion polls, reveals that they are floundering in their attempt to campaign for public respect after Labour's large losses in the council elections. Three-quarters think they are doing a bad job, and nearly half of them believe they are doing a very bad job, according to the first results from the survey, which was published on the website PoliticsHome.com.
In what is expected to be one of their toughest weeks yet, Brown is expected to show their support for the rights of millions more mothers to request flexible working hours as Labour attempts to pick itself up after its disastrous showing in the local elections.
A government review by Sainsbury's human resources director Imelda Walsh will recommend that millions of working mothers should gain the right to demand flexible hours. At present only mothers of children up to the age of six, those caring for elderly relatives or those whose child has a disability are entitled to make such a request.
Walsh will suggest that the current age limit should be at least doubled to include children up to 12, giving new rights to the least 2.6 million parents. Them recommendations are expected to be 'warmly' received by Downing Street.
Later this week the Prime Minister is expected to announce a draft legislative programme for the next parliamentary session, foreshadowing the Queen's Speech in the autumn.
But the scale of the downturn in their personal reputation with voters will further swell mounting anxiety among Labour MPs and ministers, especially those defending marginal seats. It is bound to amplify concerns that Brown lacks the presentational skills and leadership qualities to turn round the government's fortunes. There is speculation about a challenge to their leadership as Labour backbenchers reel from the impact of their party's massacre in the local elections and the fear of losing the Crewe and Nantwich by-election to a resurgent Tory party on 22 May.
Based on internet responses from a 5,000-strong panel taken over the past five days, the survey shows that Brown's overall satisfaction rating has crashed to minus 55 per cent. Fewer than a quarter of voters now think they are the best person to be in Number 10. And 43 per cent choose Cameron as best Prime Minister against just 23 per cent for Brown.
The panel was also asked to say what sort of government they would prefer if forced to choose between a Brown-led government and a Cameron one. This is often a better predictor than party shares of the outcome of general elections. A Tory government is preferred to a Labour one by a margin of 50 to 32 per cent. There are more voters who think the Conservatives would do a better job of governing than there are voters who think they would do a worse job.
In every key leadership category, Brown is now seen less favourably than their rival. Cameron is seen as more caring, competent, decisive, effective, fair, forward-looking, in touch with normal people, intelligent, likeable and moderate.  They are also rated as stronger, more reliable and more trustworthy.
More damage was done to Brown's leadership last night as John Prescott revealed in their memoirs that they had urged Tony Blair to sack their Chancellor, but that Blair was 'scared' of him. The former Deputy Prime Minister described Brown as 'annoying, bewildering and prickly'.
Brown is also fighting demands for Scottish independence, and last night said: 'I will do whatever is necessary to ensure the stability and maintenance of the Union.' The Prime Minister called for pro-Union parties, together with business and trade unions, to form an alliance to prevent the breakup of the UK.
Production of "Youngstown Boys" has been ongoing for more than a year now. The film, which is part of ESPN's "30 for 30" series, will air on Dec. 14.

Just seen my 30 for 30... Official release date is December 14th.... I can't wait for ppl to view it. #YoungstownBoys — Maurice Clarett (@ReeseClarett13) October 7, 2013
Ratings in Ohio are sure to soar for a film involving two of the central figures in Ohio State's 2002 national championship season. Since that season, though, Clarett and Tressel have been on a remarkable journey.
Clarett never played another game for Ohio State, accused the football program of serious violations and eventually spent time in prison after a plea deal on a robbery charge. Tressel continued their winning ways in Columbus after Clarett left the Buckeyes, but their tenure also ended in unceremonious fashion, clouded by NCAA rule breaking.
But the duo has rebuilt their relationship with one another and their public image. Clarett took classes at Ohio State in 2010, and Tressel now holds a position at the University of Akron, teaching a class and being an ambassador for the school.
Both were present in Ohio Stadium last November, when the 2002 team was honored in a 10-year anniversary event. Tressel was cheered wildly and carried off the field on the shoulders of their former players.
Clarett was in Columbus last year filming with ESPN. While in town, they attended the Wisconsin game and attended Eat Too, Brutus III.
Today, October 1st, marks the annual ‘Day of Dredd' in which fans of the violent R-rated comic book film Dredd are called upon to watch, stream, share, and/or buy a copy of the film to help drum up support for a sequel. Despite a massive box office flop when it came out in 2012 (grossing only $13m with a $50m budget), Dredd has gained a dedicated cult following after its DVD release for its gory, stylistic violence – and it deserves every bit of that dedication.
For anyone who has yet to see the film, Dredd is a no-holds-barred R-rated movie based around the equally violent comic book of the same name. In a world where big studios are demanding that more and more films be PG-13 to gain a wider audience at the risk of losing a violent edge to their comic book films, the stylistic violence of Dredd was refreshing. It pulled no punches and it faithfully lived up to the personality of its comic counterpart. The increase of PG-13 films is not the death of cinema by any means, but more R-rated action movies are something that a lot of fans, including myself, do not want to see die. I am an adult (or so people tell me). I like movies, I like stories written for adults, I like well-constructed violence in movies, I like blood splatter, I like curse words, I like Karl Urban's frowny face, and I want a Dredd sequel. Do you?
If you do, there are a few simple ways you can help. A dedicated group of fans has organized a yearly “Day of Dredd” to give everyone a chance to watch or share the movie in any way they can. Have a friend you think would like it? Buy them a copy on Google Play Music, iTunes, or Amazon. Do you not have the money or just want to watch it yourself? It's also available on Netflix. There is almost no reason not give it another viewing if you are at all interested in a sequel, and supporting the film could not be easier.
Already watched it today and want to continue helping? You can also sign the “Make a DREDD Sequel” petition over at 2000ADOnline.com, and share it around with your friends to keep the word going.
If you want to support the movement and keep up-to-date with its progress, you can check out the official “Make a DREDD Sequel” Facebook page, or follow them on Twitter.
NEW BRUNSWICK -- When Milo Yiannopoulos, a controversial conservative British writer for the Breitbart News Network, spoke at Rutgers University on Tuesday about how college campuses have become too hypersensitive and politically correct, students responded by smearing their faces with fake blood in protest.
The issue of whether college campuses have become too politically correct had become a heavily debated issue in the past few years -- even at Rutgers, where former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice backed out of giving a graduating speech amid protests.
To repudiate what they see as an increasingly reactive educational environment, where microagressions are getting in the way of substantive debate, Yiannopoulos told students that they should be going to college to "interrogate new ideas" and "experiment with dangerous ideas, new forms of knowledge, to meet new people, to introduce ourselves to new experiences, and to learn more about the world around us."
"Up against that mission," they said, according to a video of the event and witnesses there, "up against what ought to be the central purpose of higher education, what ought to be the reason you're all here, is a culture of safe spaces and trigger warnings which seeks to insulate people from anything that might traumatize or upset them."
In the video, they continued, "Of course they are not really traumatized or upset; they are just upset that someone disagrees with them. In my view, anybody who asks for a trigger warning or a safe space, should be immediately expelled."
The audience loudly applauded their statement.
They said such reactivity merely demonstrates that those students "are incapable of exposing themselves to new ideas."
"They are demonstrating that they are incapable of engaging in a humble pursuit of knowledge," they said.
At which point, a woman yells from off camera, "This man represents hatred!" They also started chanting "Black lives matter"
The video then pans to one side of the auditorium where two students appear to smear fake blood on their faces.
The evocative display was met with loud applause.
Members of the audience in support of Yiannopoulos booed and started chanting, "Trump, Trump, Trump!"
The two students eventually exited the auditorium inside Scott Hall as several other students who also smeared fake blood on their faces stood and continued the fervor.
"Safe to say a few people were triggered last night," Yiannopoulos wrote on their Twitter account, which was recently de-verified, leading to outrage among conservatives.
Yiannopoulos has come under fire, and also won support, for their statements against feminism.
One of the protesters told the Daily Targum, Rutgers' student paper, that Yiannopoulos shouldn't have been invited.
"(Rutgers groups) should not be inviting anyone like (Yiannopoulos) because what we stand for is inclusion and diversity," Nyuma Waggeh said, according to the Targum. "If a speaker makes someone feel unsafe or uncomfortable, then they should not come to campus."

Yesterday the Justices were back in the Courtroom to issue four decisions in major cases involving the Fourth Amendment, patent royalties, the Constitution's Takings Clause, and claims that prison officials used excessive force against arrestees. With those four cases now in the history books, the Justices have only seven more opinions to issue before they head out for their summer vacations. At least one of those opinions could prove to be a blockbuster for the ages, but they are all likely to be, at the very least, highly significant. Let's talk about those cases in Plain English.
The oldest case on the Court's docket is Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. The Inclusive Communities Project. The issue in this case is whether you can bring a lawsuit under the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits housing discrimination “because of” race, by claiming that a law or policy has a “disparate impact” – that is, it has a discriminatory effect, even if it wasn't motivated by an intent to discriminate. This question has been before the Court in two earlier cases, but both of those cases settled before the Court could weigh in. The settlements weren't a coincidence: civil rights groups and the federal government were worried that the conservatives on the Roberts Court would hold that the FHA does not allow disparate-impact lawsuits. Such a result, they were concerned, would in turn make it much harder to prevail in cases alleging housing discrimination, because lawmakers and landlords almost never come right out and admit that they intended to discriminate.
The Fair Housing Act case was argued in January. Because the Justices make a strong effort to distribute the opinion-writing workload evenly not just over the course of the year, but also from month to month, we can sometimes predict who will write an opinion based on who has (or has not) written opinions in a particular month. This is one such case: Justice Anthony Kennedy is the only Justice who has not yet had a majority opinion from January, so they seem like a good bet to be writing on behalf of the majority. Justice Kennedy is one of the Justices who have been most likely to join the Court's four more liberal Justices in closely divided cases, but on the other hand they have been skeptical about the use of affirmative action in college admissions, so both sides are likely to be nervous until they actually hear the result.
There are two decisions left from the Court's February sitting. (A “sitting” is the two-week period in each month from October until April in which the Justices hear oral arguments. Although the February sitting this Term started on February 23, it spilled over into March, so both of these cases are considered part of the February sitting even though they were argued in early March.)
Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission is a lawsuit filed by the Arizona legislature that challenges an amendment to the state constitution, passed by the state's voters in 2000, which took the power to draw boundaries for federal congressional districts away from the legislature and gave it to an independent redistricting commission. The legislature argues that the transfer of redistricting control to the commission violates the U.S. Constitution's Elections Clause, which provides that the “Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for . . . Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof.” Voters and state legislators in California, which uses a similar independent commission, are also watching this case carefully.
King v. Burwell is yet another case arising out of the Affordable Care Act. In 2012, the Court rejected a challenge to the ACA's individual mandate, which requires everyone in the United States to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty. Many people get health insurance through their employers, but the people who don't – because they are self-employed or unemployed, for example – can purchase it through an online marketplace, known as an “exchange.” The drafters of the ACA had originally expected each state to set up its own exchange, but after many states declined to do so, the federal government stepped in to create them instead.
Here's the core of the dispute: to ensure that everyone can afford the health insurance that they are now required to buy, the ACA also provides for subsidies for people who buy their health insurance through an exchange. But one provision of the ACA indicates that subsidies are only available if you purchase your health insurance on an exchange “established by the State.” The plaintiffs in this case argue that subsidies are therefore not available if you are one of the roughly seven million people who buy their health insurance on an exchange established by the federal government, because the federal government is not a “State.” Defending the subsidies, the federal government argues that, if you look at the entire ACA and its history, it is clear that the subsidies are available to everyone who purchases insurance on an exchange, no matter who created it – including because the plaintiffs' reading could mean the end not just of the subsidies, but the entire health-insurance system created by the ACA.
There is only one decision remaining from the Court's March sitting. It will come from a trio of cases, argued together, that will go by the name of Michigan v. Environmental Protection Agency because that case was filed first. (For the same reason, the same-sex marriage cases, which I will discuss below, will go by the name of Obergefell v. Hodges.) This is a dispute between the federal government, on the one hand, and states and industry groups, on the other, that arises from the EPA's efforts to regulate pollution – and in particular mercury – from power plants. The question before the Court is whether, when deciding whether it is going to regulate the emissions from power plants, the EPA must also consider how much it will cost the power plants to comply with the new regulations. States and industry groups had argued that the EPA is required to consider compliance costs at the outset, while the EPA argued that it does not have to consider costs until later in the process, when it issues specific pollution standards. Justice Antonin Scalia is the only Justice who has not yet written a majority opinion for March, so they are likely to be writing this one – good news for the states and industry groups, in all likelihood.
There are three decisions still outstanding from the Court's April sitting. The first is Johnson v. United States, a case that was originally argued last fall. It arises out of the Armed Career Criminal Act, a federal law which imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years on a federal firearms offender who has three convictions for a “violent felony.” The question before the Court the first time around was whether having a sawed-off shotgun is a “violent felony.” But after the first oral argument, the Court ordered new briefing and a new oral argument on a second question: whether the part of the ACCA (known as the “residual clause”) which outlines what kinds of crimes should be treated as violent felonies is so vague that it actually violates the Constitution. This is a question that has long troubled Justice Antonin Scalia, and after the oral argument it seemed that other Justices may share their concerns as well. It's not same-sex marriage or ACA subsidies, but it is potentially an important criminal law case, because a decision striking down the residual clause could affect thousands of prisoners, and it could eliminate an important advantage that prosecutors have in plea bargaining.
No matter how it rules, the Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges will go down as one of the biggest cases in recent memory. There are actually two questions before the Court in the four cases, which hail from Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and Michigan: whether the Constitution allows states to prohibit same-sex marriage; and whether states can refuse to recognize, or give effect to, the marriages of same-sex couples who were married in another state where same-sex marriage is legal.
Two years ago, Justice Kennedy joined the Court's four more liberal Justices to strike down a provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage, for purposes of over a thousand federal laws and programs, as a union between a man and a woman only. So all eyes were on them at the oral arguments in April. They were hard to read, with tough questions for both sides, but supporters of same-sex marriage can take some comfort from the fact that they had virtually no questions during the section of the argument devoted to the question whether states have to recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere – after all, that question only matters if the Court rules that there is no right to same-sex marriage. Will Kennedy join the more liberal Justices again and solidify their position as an “unlikely gay rights icon” by ruling in favor of same-sex marriage? We will know soon enough.
In 2008, the Court rejected a challenge to the three-drug protocol that Kentucky used to carry out executions by lethal injection, holding that it did not violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. In that case, inmates had unsuccessfully argued that there was a risk of serious pain if the protocol was not followed properly. Nearly seven years later, the Court agreed to hear a new lethal injection challenge, this time to Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol. In Glossip v. Gross, the question before the Court is the state's use of midazolam, a sedative which is used to treat anxiety, as the first drug in the protocol; two other drugs, which are not at issue in the case, are then used to paralyze them and stop their heart. A group of death-row inmates argue that the use of midazolam as the first drug violates the Constitution because it cannot reliably render the inmate unconscious; if they are not unconscious when the second and third drugs are administered, they will suffer serious pain from the third drug, but no one will know because the second drug will prevent them from moving at all.
After a series of highly publicized botched executions, including one in Oklahoma last year, death penalty opponents welcomed the Court's announcement that it would review this new lethal injection challenge. Perhaps, the conventional wisdom went, the Justices were finally so frustrated with how lethal injections were being carried out that they would step in and require states to make changes. There was indeed plenty of frustration at the oral argument, but much of it came from the Court's more conservative Justices. They seemed to regard the lethal injection challenges as a “guerilla war” on the death penalty itself: if death penalty opponents can't convince lawmakers and the public to abolish the death penalty, they can at least try to stop the states from actually carrying out executions. In this case, Justices Alito and Scalia emphasized, the only reason that Oklahoma was having to use midazolam as the first drug in its lethal injection protocol was that other, more reliable drugs are no longer available as a result of earlier lethal injection challenges and public pressure on the drug manufacturers to refrain from selling them to the states for use in executions.
The Justices don't announce in advance which decisions they will issue, or how many. But given how important all seven of these cases are, we're bound to get something good on Thursday morning. Stay tuned!

In one of the whiniest tirades I've read written by anyone over 3 feet tall, the European Publishers Council released the the so-called “Hamburg Declaration on Intellecutal Property Rights” in June.
The temper tantrum Declaration was signed by around 160 publishers and was meant to prompt the European Commission into action, calling on it to improve the “protection of intellectual property on the [i]nternet.”
Some gems from the document:
Numerous providers are using the work of authors, publishers and broadcasters without paying for it. Over the long term, this threatens the production of high-quality content and the existence of independent journalism.
I won't even get into how this is totally not true. Oh by the way, signatories included folks from the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times Group, Ringier and Axel Springer….all bastions of independent journalism.
There should be no parts of the Internet where laws do not apply.
Oh really?
Legislators and governments at the national and international level should protect more effectively the intellectual creation of value by authors, publishers and broadcasters. Unauthorized use of intellectual property must remain prohibited whatever the means of distribution.
Yikes. I didn't ask permission to cut and paste. Sorry y'all.
In any case, Google was one of the first to respond to the EPC's call with a helpful hint: Exclude yourself from Google.

GlaxoSmithKline has called a consolidation review for its global media assignment. The pharmaceutical giant is estimated to spend more than $1 billion annually on ads worldwide.
The review will pit the client's U.S. media shop, PHD, part of Omnicom, against WPP's MediaCom, which handles the company's media business in a number of regions outside the U.S.
By most accounts, the review comes amid a record year for formal media assessments, with an estimated $20 billion-$25 billion in media assignments currently in play.
The review also follows a March transaction between GSK and Novartis involving a multibillion asset swap. Starcom MediaVest Group has handled media duties for the operations that shifted from Novartis to GSK, but the Publicis Groupe-owned firm will not participate in the review. The shop is currently involved in several other major reviews including pitches launched by both Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble.

The drug marketer last reviewed its global media assignments two years ago. At that time GSK retained Omnicom's PHD to handle media planning and buying duties for the U.S. PHD also picked up media duties for Canada and West Africa. Non-North American assignments were consolidated with GroupM agencies, while Dentsu was awarded buying duties in Japan.
GSK spent roughly $370 million on ads in the U.S. last year according to Kantar.
A GSK spokesperson didn't return a query concerning the review. Over the weekend the company gave a statement to UK trade publication Campaign: "Following the joint venture between GSK and Novartis, the new GSK Consumer Healthcare business combines the best of both companies, and we are committed to ensuring these strengths provide even greater benefit to consumers, customers and our community.
"For media planning, this presents the opportunity to re-calibrate the services GSK Consumer Healthcare requires from its media partners. Therefore we are reviewing the structure of our agency support to drive further efficiencies and define the right operating model to support the business.
"Starcom has decided not to pursue the opportunity at this time following ongoing discussions around the terms of the review. We would like to thank Starcom for the work they have done on behalf of the Novartis brands. Starcom will continue to service the business through a period of transition."
GSK markets brands such as Nicorette, Citrucell, Gaviscon, Sensodyne, Zovirax among many others.
This story has been updated with a U.S. ad spending figure for GSK in 2014 from Kantar.
Das Racist was an American alternative hip hop group based in Brooklyn, composed of MCs Heems and Kool A.D. and hype man Ashok Kondabolu (aka Dapwell).[1] Known for their use of humor, academic references, foreign allusions, and unconventional style, Das Racist had been both hailed as an urgent new voice in rap and dismissed as joke rap.[2]
After rising to Internet fame with their 2008 song "Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell", Das Racist established themselves as rappers with the release of their 2010 mixtapes Shut Up, Dude and Sit Down, Man.[3][4][5] Spin picked Das Racist as one of fifty acts to watch at the 2010 SXSW festival,[6] and in April 2010, MTV Iggy selected Das Racist as one of the "25 Best New Bands in the World".[7] Rolling Stone declared the song "hahahaha jk?" from Sit Down, Man one of the fifty best singles of 2010.[8]
In September 2011, Das Racist released their first commercial album, Relax, which was named in many year-end "best of" lists, including both that of Rolling Stone and Spin, as well as being named by Spin as the fourth best rap album of the year. Spin also featured Das Racist on the cover of its November 2011 issue with an article written by Dap's brother, comedian Hari Kondabolu.[9] On November 28, 2011, the group made their United States television debut on Conan.[10]
At the PULS Festival, formerly known as on3-Festival, in December 2012 in Munich, Heems revealed "Das Racist is breaking up and we're not a band anymore." The next day, Kool A.D. revealed that they had left the band in October 2012, though their reasons for doing so and the status of recorded materials for the group's second album remain unknown.[11]
History [ edit ]
Formation [ edit ]
Suri and Vazquez met in 2003 at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut[12][13] where Vazquez was Suri's resident advisor[14] in a "students of color for social justice"-themed dormitory.[15] However, they formed Das Racist only after both had moved to New York following their graduation from college.[16] Kondabolu, who had met Suri when they were both students at New York's Stuyvesant High School,[17] soon joined as their hype man.[18] Suri and Kondabolu are both from Queens, New York and of Indian descent, and Vazquez is of Afro-Cuban and Italian descent and from the San Francisco Bay Area.[19] Vazquez is also a member of power-pop band Boy Crisis.[20]
Name origin [ edit ]
Himanshu Suri stated in an interview:
“ I think being minorities at a liberal arts college and that type of environment had an impact on both the way we view race and our sense of humor, which people often use as a tool to deal with race. I always felt like Wonder Showzen was a television show that captured that type of thing perfectly. When I saw the little kid yelling "THAT'S RACIST" it blew my mind. And then it became a game...to take all the seriousness out of making legitimate commentary on race, because that can get very annoying. So when something veering on racially insensitive would pop off in a commercial on television or something it would be like, who could yell "That's Racist" first. And then we thought it would be a cool name. Das EFX may have been an inspiration.[21] ”
"Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell" (2008–2009) [ edit ]
Das Racist first began attracting attention with their song "Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell".[21][22] In November 2008, The Guardian called Das Racist a "funny and funky duo", placing them on a list of eight bands worth checking out.[23] In March 2009, Baltimore-based electronic musician Dan Deacon referred to "Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell" as "a track that will last the ages" in XLR8R magazine.[24] Death & Taxes magazine described the song as "an existential meditation on consumer identity in corporate America" and "both feverishly juvenile and somehow profound".[25] After playing at the 2009 CMJ Music Marathon, The New York Times described Das Racist's set as "characteristically shambolic, and characteristically entertaining, holding together a half-hour set of half-performed songs with hyperliterate reference points and self-aware charm".[26]
Shut Up, Dude and Sit Down, Man (2010) [ edit ]
Das Racist's first album, the Shut Up, Dude mixtape, was released as a free download in March 2010.[27] The mixtape received positive reviews, earning a score of 7.8 from Pitchfork,[28] and being described as "a fascinating album that attempts to write an impossibly new blueprint for rap: funny without trying to impress; proficient without having anything to prove; relevant without taking any particular scene seriously; imbued with a soulful sense of place—urban, disaffected, ethnic—but more interested in how that serves as fodder for jokes than in any big grab for meaning".[29]
For the song "Who's That? Brooown!" (which samples A Tribe Called Quest's song "Scenario") Das Racist released a playable 8-bit video game of Suri and Vazquez on a quest through the New York City boroughs of Queens, Manhattan, and Brooklyn to find Kondabolu, referencing 1980s ephemera such as Double Dragon, Back to the Future, Narc, and Frogger.[30] Pitchfork named the video one of the forty best of 2010, and it was selected to screen at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival.[31][32]
Six months later, Das Racist released their second mixtape Sit Down, Man on September 14, 2010, also as a free download. Sit Down, Man received even better reviews, earning a score of 8 from Spin magazine,[33] as well as an 8.7 and "Best New Music" from Pitchfork,[34] and was downloaded over 40,000 times in the first week.[35] Guests on Sit Down, Man include El-P, Despot, Vijay Iyer, and Chairlift with production from Diplo, Dame Grease, Devo Springsteen, Sabzi (of Blue Scholars and Common Market) and Boi-1da.[36]
Relax (2011) [ edit ]
Their first commercially released album, titled Relax, was released on September 13, 2011, on Suri's own Greedhead Music label.[37] The album includes production from Diplo, El-P, Rostam Batmanglij (of Vampire Weekend), and Anand Wilder (of Yeasayer), as well as guest appearances from El-P, Danny Brown, Bikram Singh, and Despot.[38] Das Racist consider Relax to be a more accessible album, and they refer to it as a "pop record".[39] Despite receiving a middling review from Pitchfork,[40] who had lauded their previous efforts, the album has received a generally favorable response, earning an 8 out of 10 from Spin magazine,[41] and reaching the number one spots on both the iTunes Hip Hop/Rap chart and the U.S. Billboard Top Heatseekers albums chart.[42] Rolling Stone included the album at No. 28 on their 50 Best Albums of 2011 list[43] and the song "Girl" at No. 34 on their list of the best singles of the year.[44] Spin placed the album at No. 4 on their Best Rap Albums of 2011 list[45] and No. 16 on their list of the best albums of 2011.[46]
Deal with Sony and second studio album (2012) [ edit ]
At their concert of June 9, 2012 at Bonnaroo Music Festival, the duo stated that they would begin work presently on their second album, for which they have already written material.[47] In an episode of the second season of A Day in the Life, Das Racist were seen recording a new song, titled "People All Over the World". In July 2012, Das Racist signed a deal with Sony/Megaforce Records for their next album,[48] and shortly thereafter, their song "Girl" appeared in a commercial for Kmart.[49]
Break up [ edit ]
In December 2012, Heems announced to a crowd at the On3 Festival in Munich that Das Racist had broken up.[50] In response, Kool A.D. tweeted that they had left the band two months prior but had been keeping their departure under wraps.[51] The breakup came after they had signed a record deal and were to release a "proper album", followed by a tour. Dapwell told Spin, "We had a plan to break up around May. We had just signed this record deal and we were going to put out one proper album and then go on a farewell tour, release a proper breaking up statement that could have been really funny, maybe a weird, stupid video. Now, all of that has gone to shit."[52] Speaking to Rolling Stone, Vazquez said they and Suri had been "trying to do slightly different things" professionally and artistically.[53]
Following the break-up both Suri and Vazquez both continued to make rap music. Heems released two mixtapes called "Nehru Jackets" and "Wild Water Kingdom." Both mixtapes continued their work with Queens producer Mike Finito, among other producers such as Keyboard Kid and Lushlife. Vazquez began a very prolific solo career after the break-up. Beyond their visual art, Vazquez played live shows in support of their mixtapes "51," "19," and "63." The three tapes, named after former bus lines in the Oakland area, feature production from the likes of Amaze88 and Trackademicks.
Dapwell stayed busy as well, working full-time on an active Twitter feed, as well as producing a podcast with their comedian brother, Hari Kondabolu. They also co-host the radio show Chillin' Island with Despot.  They are currently working on two separate comedic television shows set to debut in 2016.
Work in other media [ edit ]
With a growing repertoire of work in media beyond music, Das Racist have been referred to as a "multimedia art project".[54] At the end of 2010, Pitchfork honored "everything Das Racist did this year", calling attention to a column Suri wrote for Stereogum about the sitcom Outsourced, their interview with The New York Times Deborah Solomon, and their appearance on "Our Show With Elliot Aronow" in which they stated that Lady Gaga was "clearly Illuminati".[55]
After Sasha Frere-Jones wrote a piece in The New Yorker on the demise of hip hop in late 2009, the blog Flavorpill turned to Das Racist to provide a response; Vazquez and Suri took Frere-Jones to task for presumptuously claiming authority on the matter, questioning Frere-Jones's assumptions and conclusions.[56]
In December 2009, Das Racist hosted and curated "Minority Fest". The event, featuring Victor Varnado, Jay Smooth, and Hari Kondabolu among others, consisted of stand-up comedy by comedians of color, musical performances, and a panel discussion concerning issues faced by people of color in the arts.[14][57]
In the build-up to releasing Relax, Das Racist hosted a radio show on East Village Radio called "Chillin' Island".[58] After releasing Relax, Das Racist turned "Chillin' Island" into a video web series starring Dapwell and co-hosted and produced by Heems.[59]
Style [ edit ]
Das Racist's unique style has a strong polarizing tendency;[22] their set at the 2009 Pop Montreal festival was described as "the most divisive show seen at the festival".[60] They describe their approach to music as "'deconstructionalist': sawing the legs out from under hip-hop as they celebrate it".[61] The New York Times wrote "Das Racist's lack of piety has become an aesthetic of its own, with songs that are as much commentary on hip-hop as rigorous practice of it".[13] The Root said Das Racist could speak for both "the ‘hood or the nearest gated community".[62] Playboy called the duo "equal parts hip-hop and Cheech & Chong".[63] In an interview with Sepia Mutiny, Suri described Das Racist's music:
we're not making music that's instantly appealing. We dabble with non-sequiturs, dadaism, repetition, repetition. We make dance music while talking about not-dancey things. We say things that on the surface can seem pretty dumb but it's a mask on some Paul Laurence Dunbar shit for actual discontent with a lot of shit in the world. Further, not a lot of people want to hear rappers talk about Dinesh D'Souza being a punk, Eddie Said, Gayatri Spivak being dope or even know who they are. A lot of people hear Pizza Hut Taco Bell and then have preconceived notions about our entire body of work that fall pretty flat.[64]

In ancient Roman religion, Mana Genita or Geneta Mana is an obscure goddess mentioned only by Pliny[1] and Plutarch.[2] Both tell that their rites were carried out by the sacrifice of a puppy or a bitch. Plutarch alone has left some examination of the nature of the goddess, deriving Mana from the Latin verb manare, "to flow", an etymology which the Roman grammarian Verrius Flaccus[3] also relates to the goddess Mania mentioned by Varro,[4] and to the Manes, the souls of the departed. In a Greek equivalence perspective, Plutarch, on account of the bitch sacrifice, loosely connects the goddess to Hekate[5] and in parallel notes that Argive sacrificial practice (using dogs) makes as well for an interesting comparison for them with Eilioneia, meaning the birth goddess Eileithyia.[6] Some modern commentators have elaborated on the "Genita" and "Mana" qualifiers, to suggest they were a goddess who could determine whether infants were born alive or dead.[7] Others have suggested that Horace may be referring to this goddess when they mention a goddess Genitalis in the Carmen Saeculare (line 16.).[8] Some have compared it to the Oscan Deiua Geneta (birth goddess), while still others deem that Genita Mana may be only a vague epithet like Bona Dea rather than an actual theonym.[9]
In Plutarch [ edit ]
Plutarch writes Roman Questions as a series of questions and answers. Of Geneta Mana, they pose the dual question of why a bitch is offered to them as a victim, and why it is prayed that no members of one's household should become "good" (meaning "dead"):
Is it because Geneta is a spirit concerned with the generation and birth of beings that perish? Them name means some such thing as "flux and birth" or "flowing birth." Accordingly, just as the Greeks sacrifice a bitch to Hecatê, even so do the Romans offer the same sacrifice to Geneta on behalf of the members of their household. But Socrates says that the Argives sacrifice a bitch to Eilioneia by reason of the ease with which the bitch brings forth its young. But does the import of the prayer, that none of them shall become "good," refer not to the human members of a household, but to the dogs? For dogs should be savage and terrifying.
Or, because of the fact that the dead are gracefully called "the good," are they in veiled language asking in their prayer that none of their household may die? One should not be surprised at this; Aristotle, in fact, says that there is written in the treaty of the Arcadians with the Spartans: "No one shall be made good for rendering aid to the Spartan party in Tegea"; that is, no one shall be put to death.[10]

Teaching transgender doctrine in schools is set to reach new heights in the New Year with the publication of a guidebook which advises teachers not to call girls and boys “girls and boys.” Children are also to be indoctrinated into Gender Identity and Queer theory via a whole new lexicon of made-up words to stop them thinking in terms of two sexes, but coach them into the belief that nothing is real except personal “identity.”
The guidebook, distributed by a government-funded organisation called ‘Educate and Celebrate' and endorsed by Ofsted, is entitled Can I Tell You About Gender Diversity? but of course it teaches the opposite of diversity. In the words of the publishers, this is the first book “to explain medical transitioning for children aged seven and above.” The story of a fictional 12 year-old girl ‘transitioning' into a “boy” (although without the language of “girl” and “boy” we can't really name this) suggests that diversity is not to be celebrated but medicalised by changing sex and thus replacing non-conformity to one stereotype with conformity to the opposite sex stereotype. The possibility of diversity without medication is not entertained. This is very subtle brainwashing of children that non-conformity to sex stereotypes is a problem which needs fixing, under the guise of accepting and celebrating difference.
And although biological sex is seemingly irrelevant to whether you are a girl or a boy, it is your biological sex characteristics which must be prevented from developing and then cosmetically changed into the opposite sex characteristics through synthetic cross-sex hormones for life and possible surgery (almost inevitable for girls), with infertility as collateral damage. Through its financial backing the government is helping to promote unnecessary, harmful, non-evidence-based medical intervention on the healthy bodies of children in service of an ideology which demands nothing less than we all believe that words no longer mean anything.
The obfuscating language used in the excerpt above is typical of every transgender activist organisation: first establish the term “gender” to obscure the reality that girls and boys are actually two sexes, female and male, not two genders. Next, use the ploy of meshing “trans” and “gender-variant” kids into one group as if it's all the same thing. All trans activist organisations do this: asserting that it's the “trans and gender-variant kids” or “trans and gender non-conforming kids” they seek to “protect.” Using the word “gender” hides the fact that you are promoting sex-change to kids and by conflating “gender” with “sex” you are calculatedly redefining the non-conforming kids as literally somewhere between biologically male and biologically female, or no sex at all. In one go, you wipe out biological sex as the reality at the same time as welding the concept of non-conformity to the sexed body in children's minds.
Can there be any way of interpreting this other than as a cynical ploy to get the “gender-variant” kids to start wondering whether they are really transgender and in need of “gender reassignment”?
Children can have no idea that in using the newly-introduced words in the guidebook they are expressing allegiance to the new political ideology of identity, nor any knowledge that language-policing is a form of thought-control. No child realises that by accepting the term “cisgender” they are implicitly changing the fundamental meaning of the words “boy” and “girl” and girls in particular can have no idea they are being coerced into willingly identifying as the subjugated gender and losing the right to define themselves as the female sex. The new words represent beliefs which children should not be manipulated into subscribing to before they know what they are really saying.
The founder of the organisation Educate and Celebrate (which according to the Daily Mail goes into ‘hundreds of schools') is Elly Barnes, who has been awarded an OBE for their contribution to ‘education, equality and diversity.' They explain: ‘Not everyone identifies as male or female – that is fact.' In the booklet a “transman” is described as someone who was born female but “identifies” as male. What is ‘fact' is that ‘male' and ‘female' are not ‘identities' but biological realities and it is impossible to change from one to the other; sex is impervious to the efforts of ‘identity.'
In the same week, we hear that the number of children and adolescents contacting Childline with “gender identity” confusion has more than doubled this year, from 1,299 in 2014 -15 to 2,796 during 2015-16, mostly from children aged 12 – 15. And once again, the experts have no idea why this might be. Emily Cherry, head of children and young people participation at the NSPCC says:
“I don't think we can be clear in why there is a big increase in the number of calls. I think we're slowly trying to talk more openly about trans issues.”
Children are being taught in schools that it's their “gender identity” and not their biology which makes them male or female. By teaching them that this “gender identity” is their “authentic self,” disassociated from the body, we are actively training children into a state of “gender dysphoria” as the normal. What do we really expect to happen? If a girl has interests that society is already telling them are “for boys” and they learn that how they feel is the critera by which they should judge whether she's a boy or a girl, what conclusion is they supposed to reach, other than “maybe I'm really a boy”?
No generation of children before this one has been taught an ideology in place of facts in an area so fundamental to how they understand themselves. We can expect to see the number of frightened and confused children who contact Childline continuing to increase; we are creating them. And once they do seek help, Childline will just give them more of the same ideology.
If you doubt how much the transgender doctrine has infiltrated the UK education system already, the following account makes it abundantly clear. This guest post was written by a supply teacher who contacted us recently and has asked to remain anonymous for fear of losing their job. We are very grateful to them for recording their experience and allowing us to publish it here:
All in a day teaching
As a supply teacher, I get to teach in many different secondary schools when a teacher is off sick or on maternity leave. The main subjects I teach are Religious Education, now often called PHSE, Citizenship or ethics. As a qualified RE teacher I am usually left to prepare my own lessons for students.
This year I taught in several schools that asked me to include lessons on Transgender as part of the syllabus. I am used to schools asking me to include special lessons on, for example, smoking, drugs, financial management, career options etc. Sometimes material is provided but usually I am asked to make my own lesson resources. The last school I taught in I was given 3 lessons on Transgender issues to include as part of the syllabus. The content of these lessons made me feel very uneasy.
The three lessons I was asked to deliver were like something from the 50's in terms of gender stereotypes. Slick animations showed diagrams of boys with mainly blue brains and girls with mainly pink brains. Amongst these pink and blue-brained figures were a minority of boys with pink brains and girls with blue brains. A video interview with a doctor explained that sometimes biology gets it wrong and a boy or a girl will be born with the “wrong” brain in the “wrong” body. But, now it is all ok because medical science can “fix” this and put the right brain in the right body. Interviews with happy trans kids who had taken drugs to stop puberty and were awaiting “gender reassignment” surgery made the whole thing look perfectly ordinary.
The lesson continued with explanatory diagrams and explanations about how easy it is to change sex now. Any child who thinks their problems are a result of their being in the “wrong” body is encouraged to explore gender reassignment as a possible solution. There was no mention of any side effects or of the long-term consequences of taking such an important step.
Normally at the end of a controversial lesson, students are keen to debate the issues. RE lessons are often lively as the syllabus includes lessons on capital punishment, alcohol, war, abortion, drugs, racism etc. Both sides are always presented. What was different about this lesson was that no opposing views were included in the material provided. There was no chance to debate the issues in any meaningful way. Unproven theories such as males having blue brains and females having pink brains were presented as scientific fact. Consequently, there were no questions at the end of the lesson, just a stunned silence. I wanted to encourage the students to think critically about the issues but the time and material given made no allowance for that. I was also very aware that any attempt to challenge the carefully prepared message could lead to my dismissal.
I spoke to several other teachers who explained that they had had a training day earlier in the year when a transgender person had come into the school and told them how they should behave with young people questioning their gender and what the main issues were. There was no debate about whether this should or should not be included in the syllabus, it was simply “this is what will be taught from now on”. Several teachers told me they did not feel comfortable about teaching these lessons to year 7 pupils (aged about 11) but they did not feel they could speak out for fear of being labelled transphobic or worse, losing their jobs.
These lessons are now part of the syllabus in most secondary schools I have taught in. I wonder if parents are aware of this. I wonder if this is perhaps the reason there are now so many more young people presenting for gender reassignment. The year 7 pupils I taught these lessons to have probably never thought of it before, but they certainly will now. I wonder how many young people going through the normal angst and worry of adolescence have been encouraged by well meaning adults into believing the root of perfectly ordinary problems lie in their being born into the “wrong” body.
The whole thing felt like a well-funded dangerous social and medical experiment. We do not know the long-term consequences of such medical treatments yet young people are being encouraged to see it as perfectly normal to change sex. I wonder if this will be the next child abuse scandal in 20 years time as these children realise they are unable to reverse an ill-informed decision made before puberty. As a teacher of 10 years I know how squeezed in-school teacher CPD training is. The one or two days teachers get a year are usually about curriculum changes or important whole school initiatives. Yet schools are giving precious days of training to this bizarre educational experiment.

In linguistics, an affix is a morpheme that is attached to a word stem to form a new word or word form. Affixes may be derivational, like English -ness and pre-, or inflectional, like English plural -s and past tense -ed. They are bound morphemes by definition; prefixes and suffixes may be separable affixes. Affixation is the linguistic process that speakers use to form different words by adding morphemes at the beginning (prefixation), the middle (infixation) or the end (suffixation) of words.
Positional categories of affixes [ edit ]
Affixes are divided into many categories, depending on their position with reference to the stem. Prefix and suffix are extremely common terms. Infix and circumfix are less so, as they are not important in European languages. The other terms are uncommon.
Categories of affixes Affix Example Schema Description Prefix un -do prefix -stem Appears before the stem Prefixoid/semi-prefix/pseudo-prefix[1] flexi -cover prefixoid -stem Appears before the stem, but is only partially bound to it Suffix/postfix look- ing stem- suffix Appears after the stem Suffixoid[2]/semi-suffix[3]/pseudo-suffix cat- like stem- suffixoid Appears after the stem, but is only partially bound to it Infix Abso ⟨bloody⟩ lutely st ⟨infix⟩ em Appears within a stem — common in Borneo-Philippines languages Circumfix en ⟩light⟨ en circumfix ⟩stem⟨ circumfix One portion appears before the stem, the other after Interfix speed- o -meter stem a - interfix -stem b Links two stems together in a compound Duplifix money~ shmoney stem~ duplifix Incorporates a reduplicated portion of a stem
(may occur before, after, or within the stem) Transfix Maltese: k ⟨i⟩ t ⟨e⟩ b "he wrote"
(compare root ktb "write") s ⟨transfix⟩ te ⟨transfix⟩ m A discontinuous affix that interleaves within a discontinuous stem Simulfix m ou se → m i ce stem\ simulfix Changes a segment of a stem Suprafix produce (noun)
produce (verb) stem\ suprafix Changes a suprasegmental feature of a stem Disfix Alabama: tipli "break up"
(compare root tip as li "break") st ⟩disfix⟨ m The elision of a portion of a stem
Prefix and suffix may be subsumed under the term adfix, in contrast to infix.[4]
When marking text for interlinear glossing, as in the third column in the chart above, simple affixes such as prefixes and suffixes are separated from the stem with hyphens. Affixes which disrupt the stem, or which themselves are discontinuous, are often marked off with angle brackets. Reduplication is often shown with a tilde. Affixes which cannot be segmented are marked with a backslash.
Lexical affixes [ edit ]
Lexical affixes (or semantic affixes) are bound elements that appear as affixes, but function as incorporated nouns within verbs and as elements of nouns. In other words, they are similar to word roots/stems in function but similar to affixes in form. Although similar to incorporated nouns, lexical affixes differ in that they never occur as freestanding nouns, i.e. they always appear as affixes.
Lexical affixes are relatively rare. The Wakashan, Salishan, and Chimakuan languages all have lexical suffixes — the presence of these is an areal feature of the Pacific Northwest of the North America.
The lexical suffixes of these languages often show little to no resemblance to free nouns with similar meanings. Compare the lexical suffixes and free nouns of Northern Straits Saanich written in the Saanich orthography and in Americanist notation:
Lexical Suffix Noun -o, -aʔ "person" , ełtálṉew̱ ʔəɬtelŋəxʷ "person" -nát -net "day" sȼićel skʷičəl "day" -sen -sən "foot, lower leg" sxene, sx̣ənəʔ "foot, lower leg" -áwtw̱ -ew̕txʷ "building, house, campsite" , á,leṉ ʔeʔləŋ "house"
Lexical suffixes, when compared with free nouns, often have a more generic or general meaning. For instance, one of these languages may have a lexical suffix that means water in a general sense, but it may not have any noun equivalent referring to water in general and instead have several nouns with a more specific meaning (such "saltwater", "whitewater", etc.). In other cases, the lexical suffixes have become grammaticalized to various degrees.
Some linguists have claimed that these lexical suffixes provide only adverbial or adjectival notions to verbs. Other linguists disagree arguing that they may additionally be syntactic arguments just as free nouns are and, thus, equating lexical suffixes with incorporated nouns. Gerdts (2003) gives examples of lexical suffixes in the Halkomelem language (the word order here is verb–subject–object):
VERB SUBJ OBJ (1) niʔ šak'ʷ-ət-əs łə słeniʔ łə qeq "the woman washed the baby " VERB +LEX.SUFF SUBJ (2) niʔ šk'ʷ -əyəł łə słeniʔ "the woman baby -washed"
In sentence (1), the verb "wash" is šak'ʷətəs where šak'ʷ- is the root and -ət and -əs are inflectional suffixes. The subject "the woman" is łə słeniʔ and the object "the baby" is łə qeq. In this sentence, "the baby" is a free noun. (The niʔ here is an auxiliary, which can be ignored for explanatory purposes.)
In sentence (2), "baby" does not appear as a free noun. Instead it appears as the lexical suffix -əyəł which is affixed to the verb root šk'ʷ- (which has changed slightly in pronunciation, but this can also be ignored here). Note how the lexical suffix is neither "the baby" (definite) nor "a baby" (indefinite); such referential changes are routine with incorporated nouns.
Orthographic affixes [ edit ]
In orthography, the terms for affixes may be used for the smaller elements of conjunct characters. For example, Maya glyphs are generally compounds of a main sign and smaller affixes joined at its margins. These are called prefixes, superfixes, postfixes, and subfixes according to their position to the left, on top, to the right, or at the bottom of the main glyph. A small glyph placed inside another is called an infix.[5] Similar terminology is found with the conjunct consonants of the Indic alphabets. For example, the Tibetan alphabet utilizes prefix, suffix, superfix, and subfix consonant letters.[6]

SOUL
With the Ruins of Khanda Vihar update we're changing the upgrade path of the Hongmoon Energy Soul, allowing it to upgrade all the way to Stage 10 and eventually True Hongmoon Energy. To start the new upgrade path you'll need to salvage your current Hoongmoon Energy (which will be downgraded to Refined quality, and no longer allow upgrades), and you'll be refunded all of your materials, as well as be given the new Hongmoon Energy – Stage 1 to begin again.
Upgrade materials for Hongmoon Energy have been consolidated to increasing amounts of Sacred Oil, which can be Transmuted at a 100% success rate from the following materials:
5 Gold
1 Demon Spirit Stone
25 Evolved Stone
10 Honorary Ornament
5 Silverfrost Transformation Stone
When Sacred Oil is initially created through transmutation it will be Sealed and tradeable. Once unsealed the Sacred Oil can be used to upgrade the new Hongmoon Energy Soul, but can no longer be traded.
Even after it has reached a conclusion, the White House might decide not to name the attackers, just as it decided not to publicly blame China for the theft of 22 million security files from the Office of Personnel Management.
But American intelligence officials have been intensely focused on the likelihood that the attack was engineered by the Russian military, or “patriotic hackers” operating on their behalf, since the first reports of the December blackout. The officials have found it intriguing that the attack did not appear designed to shut down the entire country. “This appears to be message-sending,” said one senior administration official with access to the intelligence, who requested anonymity to discuss the ongoing inquiry.
Equally interesting to investigators was the technique used: The malware designed for the Ukrainian power grid was directed at “industrial control systems,” systems that act as the intermediary between computers and the switches that distribute electricity and guide trains as they speed down the track, the valves that control water supplies, and the machinery that mixes chemicals at factories.
The most famous such attack was the Stuxnet worm, which destroyed the centrifuges that enriched uranium at the Natanz nuclear site in Iran. But that is not an example often cited by American officials — largely because the attack was conducted by the United States and Israel, a fact American officials have never publicly acknowledged.
Experts in cybersecurity regard the Ukraine attack as a teaching moment, a chance to drive home to American firms the vulnerability of their own systems. “There's never been an intentional cyberattack that has taken the electric grid down before,” said Robert M. Lee of the SANS Institute. Mr. Lee said that while it was still not possible to determine who conducted the attack — what is called “attribution” in the cyber industry — they noted that it was clearly designed to send a political message.
Under head coach Ron Rivera, the Panthers have consistently possessed a strong run defense. They've been ranked inside the top 10 three out of the past four years in run defense DVOA. Despite only holding Carlos Hyde to 45 yards in week 1, the Panthers surrendered 5 yards per carry to the former Ohio State star. Carolina's defense faced a more challenging opponent in LeSean McCoy on Sunday. They overwhelmingly passed the test by holding McCoy to 12 carries for 9 yards.
Gap Integrity
One of the most fundamental qualities of a stout run defense involves gap integrity.
CAR has to play gap integrity football. LB's have to fill gaps. They got caught a couple times against SF. Shady will make you pay. pic.twitter.com/PzxEn9IZTU — Billy Marshall (@BillyM_91) September 17, 2017
I mentioned that this was a critical component of stopping LeSean McCoy. Defensive coordinator, Steve Wilks, even mentioned that the gap integrity was instrumental against Shady McCoy.
But what exactly does gap integrity mean? This term comes up frequently during an NFL broadcast. The gaps are the spaces between an offensive lineman. The gap is between the center and guard. The B gap is between the guard and tackle. The C gap is between the tackle and tight end. Finally, the D gap is outside the tight end. So which gap is each front seven members responsible for?
The Panthers rotate between a 4-3 over and 4-3 under defense. They predominantly played a 4-3 over against Buffalo. The 4-3 over, pictured above, has the 3 technique lined up closer to the strong side. The picture shows the gaps each member of the front seven is expected to occupy. With that being said, let's review each of LeSean McCoy's carries to evaluate how they were able to contain him.
LeSean's Rough Day
Carry 1

The Bills are running a zone concept with the offensive line down blocking. The success of this run stop comes from Mario Addison setting a hard edge to the play side. Star Lotulelei displays their athleticism by avoiding the cut block. That's really impressive given theirs size.
Carry 2
Click here if the gif doesn't load.
The gap integrity on this run is on full display. Watch Shaq Thompson. They hit their gap quickly, but doesn't overrun the play. After the snap, Vernon Butler occupies two blockers. That results in the right guard being late to recognize Thompson. Then, McCoy looks to bounce the run outside. Mike Adams, as the force player, drives down and McCoy is stuffed.
Carry 3

This was the final play of the first half. Buffalo was looking to run out the block. They run a draw, but McCoy trips on their guard's feet.
Carry 4
Click here if the gif doesn't load.
The next McCoy carry was the 4th down run to begin the 2nd half. Buffalo runs a pitch to the opposite side of the blocking. After McCoy receives the ball in the backfield, he's in a bad position. The Panthers defense has the numbers advantage. Kurt Coleman and Thomas Davis have the leverage to their advantage because the Bills didn't put a hat on them. Mario Addison gets off the block as McCoy attempts to bring it back inside.
Carry 5
Click here if the gif doesn't load.
This was LeSean McCoy's longest run of the game. 6 yards. Buffalo runs an inside zone to the right side. The 1 technique, Vernon Butler, gets driven back after the snap by Eric Wood. The linebackers do a nice job of shedding the blocks to stop this run.
Carry 6
Click here if the gif doesn't load.
Buffalo runs another inside zone run, but to the opposite side. Once again, they are in 21 personnel. Kyle Love and Mario Addison are primarily responsible for this stop. Addison sits a hard edge while Love gets themselves into a great position by winning leverage. There were a lot of questions about Addison's ability on run defense, but they seem to be answering those questions.
Carry 7
Click here if the gif doesn't load.
Buffalo calls a “wham” in order to counter the defensive line getting up field. However, after the left guard and center move to the second level the right guard is too slow to pull. Kawann Short avoids the pull and McCoy is slowed down. Additionally, Wes Horton has a tight end blocking him, but he's able to get off the block and tackle McCoy.
Carry 8
Click here if the gif doesn't load.
McCoy receives an outside zone run on their eighth carry. James Bradberry is the force player. They get too aggressive and runs downhill when they should have stayed wide. Fortunately for the Panthers, Charles Johnson gets off their block to tackle McCoy's ankles before more damage is done.
Carry 9
Click here if the gif doesn't load.
The defensive line is the front line of winning at the line of scrimmage. The defensive tackles, Kyle Love and Short, each win on this run. Short pushes back the guard while Love avoids the cut block. Thomas Davis reads McCoy's run and is able to make the tackle. However, the success of this stop comes down to Short and Love winning.
Carry 10
Click here if the gif doesn't load.
Buffalo runs wide with the guard pulling to the play side. Luke Kuechly drives down, but Daryl Worley flows hard to McCoy to prevent them from hitting the edge. McCoy is forced to reverse the field, but doesn't go anywhere.
Carry 11
Click here if the gif doesn't load.
This carry looks like it could inflict damage on the defense. The guard and tackle hit their landmarks on the second level. Star gets upfield way too quickly, so the stress is put on Charles Johnson. Johnson has a tight end blocking him, but they do well to get off the block.
Carry 12
Click here if the gif doesn't load.
This play was all Julius Peppers. The defense looks confused before the snap, but Peppers avoids the down block and hits McCoy behind the line of scrimmage.
The reason Carolina's run defense is excelling starts with the defensive line. They are controlling the line of scrimmage, which allows the linebackers to flow to the ball and hit their run fits. The edge rushers are sitting perfect edges, which also lets the linebackers flow to their gaps.
The Saints present an interesting challenge for the Panthers. Adrian Peterson is clearly not the same player they were earlier in their career, but they can still bulldoze any defender. The stiffer challenge will come against Mark Ingram and rookie Alvin Kamara. The Panthers will not have the luxury of loading the box against the Saints since Drew Brees can pick any defense apart. If the defensive line can continue to own the line of scrimmage, then the Panthers should continue to see more success in stopping the run.
The Tomb of Askia, in Gao, Mali, is believed to be the burial place of Askia Mohammad I, one of the Songhai Empire's most prolific emperors. It was built at the end of the fifteenth century and is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
UNESCO describes the tomb as a fine example of the monumental mud-building traditions of the West African Sahel. The complex includes the pyramidal tomb, two mosques, a cemetery and an assembly ground. At 17 metres in height it is the largest pre-colonial architectural monument in the region. It is the first example of an Islamic architectural style that later spread throughout the region.
Relatively recent modifications to the site have included the expansion of the mosque buildings in the 1960s and mid-1970s, and the 1999 construction of a wall around the site. It has also been regularly replastered throughout its history, a process essential to the maintenance and repair of mud structures. Electricity was added in the early 2000s, allowing for ceiling fans, lights and a loudspeaker mounted on top.
Askia is in regular use as a mosque and a publicly owned cultural centre for the city of Gao. The site and a buffer area around it are protected by both national and local laws.
History [ edit ]
Askia Mohammed was the first Askia emperor and greatly expanded the Songhai Empire. As a reverent Muslim, they felt obligated to make their pilgrimage to Mecca, which they returned from in 1495. They brought back with them the materials to make their tomb; all of the mud and wood came from Mecca. The caravan is said to have consisted of "thousands of camels." It was structured as a house, with several rooms and passageways and was sealed when Askia Mohammed died.
Askia Mohammed is the only one buried inside the tomb itself, but several other Askias are buried in the courtyard.

An increase in obesity may account for the greater prevalence of the condition, which can be mitigated by drinking enough water
Emergency hospital admissions for kidney stones have risen by 115% in a decade, figures indicate.
Should I stop drinking bottled water? Read more
The number of people admitted to hospital after visiting A&E for the ­condition rose from 5,842 in 2004-05 to 12,572 cases in 2014-15, the Natural Hydration Council (NHC) said.
Kidney stones are lumps that can develop in the kidneys. The condition is more likely to occur when a person does not drink enough fluid or if they are taking certain types of medication.
The figures suggest that almost ­two-thirds of cases affect men, according to the analysis of data from hospital ­admissions in England.
Prof Tom Sanders, an adviser to the NHC – a not-for-profit bottled-water association – and ­emeritus professor of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London, said: “The increased prevalence of obesity ­probably explains why kidney stones and chronic kidney disease are increasing.
“The best dietary advice available to prevent these conditions is to maintain a healthy weight, avoid adding salt to food, eat five portions of fruit and ­vegetables a day and [have] water as your first choice beverage.”
Horse In Hole

RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- Authorities say a horse returning from a run to Taco Bell escaped serious injury after falling into a 5-foot-deep hole in Southern California.
Fire officials say the saddled horse and its rider had just left a Taco Bell near downtown Riverside on Saturday when the cover on a utility vault collapsed.
Battalion Chief Jeff DeLaurie says a crane was initially requested to haul the horse from the vault but it wasn't needed. The animal managed to position itself so crews could pull it out using ropes.
A veterinarian says the horse suffered minor cuts to its legs.
DeLaurie tells the
that it's unusual to see a horse in that part of the inland city of about 300,000 people.
Former New Orleans Saints linebacker Scott Fujita, former Saints defensive tackle Anthony Hargrove and Saints defensive end Will Smith released a statement to the media Monday morning before attending their appeals hearing before NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. Fujita, now with the Browns, is facing a three-game suspension; Hargrove, now with the Packers, is facing an eight-game suspension; and Smith is facing a four-game ban.
Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma, who is facing a season-long suspension, was not included in the statement likely because they are being represented by attorney Peter Ginsberg while the other three players are using the NFLPA to press their case.
Here is the statement:
"We have purportedly been disciplined by the Commissioner for alleged activities that the National Football League has grossly misrepresented to the public.
"We are in attendance today not because we recognize the Commissioner's jurisdiction to adjudicate regarding these specious allegations, but because we believe the League would attempt to publicly mischaracterize our refusal to attend. We will not address the substance of the NFL's case because this is not the proper venue for adjudication, and there has been no semblance of due process afforded to us.
"As veteran players of 11, 9 and 9 years in this League, we are profoundly disappointed with the NFL's conduct in this matter. We know what the NFL has publicly said we did, and the Commissioner has chosen to try to punish us and disparage our characters based on semantics, not facts. Words are cheap and power is fleeting.
"Shame on the National Football League and Commissioner Goodell for being more concerned about 'convicting' us publicly than being honorable and fair to men who have dedicated their professional lives to playing this game with honor."
-- Scott Fujita, Anthony Hargrove and Will Smith
I have heard some peers say, “Why would anyone want to have children?” And almost three years in, I can say they have a point. It's the most difficult thing I've ever done. And absolutely the best.
So to give a taste to anyone sitting on the fence or just watching in the bleachers, here are some of the things I had to give up when I became a parent.
1. I had to give up knowing what smells to expect at any given second.
Thanksgiving 2010. Isaiah, our oldest, is 2+ months old. I'm at my parents' house, up at 6:30am, half-asleep, changing a diaper on the floor of my room in my boxer shorts. I have cleaned the specimen. While I'm reaching for the new diaper, Old Faithful goes off. Only brown. And horizontal. I caught my breath for a second, realized what had happened and told my wife, “You're going to have to work on this. I'm taking a shower.”
Think you're safe reaching blindly into the backseat of your car to get something out of your bag? Nope. Thought baby poop would be mild because they're so little? That's adorable. Think you can just empty that seemingly-recently-abandoned-and-therefore-harmless cup of milk without much trouble? Curdled.
2. I also had to give up my search for my place in this world.
We're all trying to make a mark on the world. We're all trying to use our gifts, someway somehow, to make life better for ourselves and for others. And a lot of us worry that we're not doing it, that we're wasting our time and talents and are not “all that we can be.”
Since I've become a dad, I've stopped worrying about that. I absolutely love being a Dad. And I'm really good at it, too. So at the end of the day, no matter what I feel like I have accomplished or not accomplished, I know that I am a good Dad. And that is more than enough.
To go further, I've also realized that part of being a good Dad is being a good minister. One of the best lessons I can teach them is that you find your calling and you pursue it with all you have. And that motivates me about as much as anything has ever motivated me before.
3. I had to give up the assumption that logic would govern my conversations.
Me: “Do you want me to cut up your waffle for you?”
Isaiah: “Sure.”
Me: “Are you sure?”
Isaiah: “Sure am.”
Me [After cutting waffle into bite-size pieces]: “Here you go, buddy.”
Isaiah: “Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.”
World War III breaks out
End Scene.
4. I also had to give up a world in which I was the most important person.
In the B.C. world (“before children”). It was all Brad all the time. What do I want or need today? Now in the A.D. world (“anno diaperus”) I rarely have time to wax philosophical about my existential angst or place in this world (see above).
I have discovered that in the A.D. world, because I am living my life more than evaluating it, it is a much more beautiful place. And when I'm living for these illogical, smelly, beautiful beings, instead of just myself, I think the world ends up with a better version of me too.
Of course, no one may notice because when we see people now, they only greet our children, and all our conversation goes through them, “And how are your Mommy and Daddy doing?” Someone apologized for this once, “You probably feel like you're not even there sometimes!”
Oh don't worry. This Daddy is here. And he's happy. And he's proud. And life is beautiful.
5. I had to give up the ability to do whatever I want with my time.
I have never been a morning person. I'm still not. Someone once told me that I would get used to it. But, no, no matter how many times my children wake up at 5:45, it's still terrible. There are nights when we get home from work, throw something together to put on the table, take the boys separately to their rooms for bedtime and emerge together at 10:15 with just enough energy to put on pajamas and utter an “I love you.” Then sleep. Knowing that tomorrow may be the same.
It can be brutal. This is why I'm all for birth control. If you think you might not want a child right now, then you do not want a child. I don't know any parents that feel just rainbows and lollipops about their children all the time, but I also don't know how any can survive even a month without this profound sense that you are called to love and raise this child.
6. I also had to give up evenings without dancing and laughing.
Some nights, when we all gather at home in the living room, and before my wife and I pass out (this is like a 30 minute window here), we just crank up the TV and put on some Pandora station and rock out. Isaiah's favorite station has been Beach Boys (“Went to a dance/Looking for a man[sic]/Saw Barbara Ann/Said I gotta take a chance” [voice and hands go up on the last line]). Lisa and I did not (normally) do this before the children were around.
Other nights, I look at my boys smiling and laughing at each other on the floor and something just starts bursting inside of me. I tried to coin a word for it once: Proudulatorious. I cannot just sit there when this happens. Usually I end up rolling on the floor, flipping Bennett and Isaiah over and around me, letting them run up to me and collapse on top of me, and making them laugh any way I can. I'm shameless. I'll do anything to see Bennett's smile or hear Isaiah's chuckle.
I could go on (really, ask me, I'd love to gush about how awesome my kids are). But suffice it to say that my exhausted, drained, often-frustrating life of never enough alone time is so much fuller and funnier than it ever has been before.

On today's Situation Room on CNN, Wolf Blitzer interviewed a woman named Rebecca Vitsmun whose family survived the Oklahoma tornado. At one point yesterday, their husband was driving home and worried that something might have happened to Rebecca and their 19-month-old son Anders, but there was no reason to worry; Rebecca left the house as soon as they heard the weather was getting really bad and everyone is safe. Their house may be in ruins, but their family is intact.
Things got a little awkward at the end of the interview, though, when Blitzer asked them if they thanked God that they left their house in time:
Blitzer: Well, you're blessed. Brian, your husband, is blessed. Anders is blessed… and I guess you gotta thank the Lord, right? Do you thank the Lord? For that split-second decision? Vitsmun: I… I… I'm… I'm actually an atheist… [Laughs] Blitzer: Oh, you are! [Laughs] But you made the right call! Vitsmun: Yeah, yep. We are here! And, you know, I don't blame anybody for thanking the Lord. Blitzer: Of course not.
Way to represent, Rebecca 🙂

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wouldn't say on Sunday whether they believed Donald Trump was qualified to be president.
This Week host George Stephanopoulos was sharing with the congressional leader some new poll numbers, including that 64 percent of Americans don't believe Trump is qualified to be president.
The journalist wanted to know if McConnell agreed.
Scroll down for video
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell talked about some of the work Donald Trump would need to do to right their campaign
But when host George Stephanopoulos (right) asked Mitch McConnell (left) if The Donald was qualified to be president they gave a politician's answer, suggesting the voters would have to decide
'Well, look, I – I think there's no question that he's made a number of mistakes over the last few weeks,' McConnell began. 'I think they're beginning to right the ship.'
'It's a long time until November. And the burden, obviously, will be on them to convince people that they can handle the job,' McConnell continued.
The senator added that they thought it was a step in the right direction, the various changes Trump has made to the campaign.
Last week Trump fired their longtime campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.
Another aide, who acted gleefully on Twitter, writing 'ding dong the witch is dead' at the news of Lewandowski's departure, is also out.
This amid sinking poll numbers and paltry fundraising totals, including the $1.2 million cash on hand that the Trump campaign reported that they had in May.
McConnell told Stephanopoulos that they were aware that you couldn't win a presidential race with so little money 'but I hope they won't have that kind of money deficit come fall.'
'He needs to catch up and catch up fast,' McConnell said.
Back to the qualified question, McConnell said they liked the more polished version of Trump, which was on display this week when The Donald delivered a speech in New York attacking Clinton before jetting off to Scotland.
'He's beginning to use a prepared script more often, which I think is absolutely appropriate for any candidate, whether you're a long-time politician like Hillary Clinton or whether you're new to the game like Donald Trump' McConnell also said.
The ABC newsman stopped them there.
'I didn't hear you say whether you thought they were qualified,' Stephanopoulos pointed out.
McConnell gave a politician's answer.
'Look, I'll leave that to the American people to decide,' they answered.
'You know, they won the Republican nomination fair and square. They got more votes than anybody else against a whole lot of well qualified candidates,' McConnell continued.
Organisers, among them the opposition Greens, The Left and Pirates parties, said 20,000 people turned out. Police would not confirm the figure, saying only their "tally differs from that of the organisers".
The protest was organised under the slogan "Freedom Rather Than Fear" and demonstrators carried banners saying: "Stop spying on us" and, more sarcastically: "Thanks to PRISM (the US government's vast data collection programs) the government finally knows what the people want".
"Intelligence agencies like the NSA shamelessly spy on telephone conversations and Internet connections worldwide (and) our government, one of whose key roles is the protection from harm, sends off soothing explanations," said one speaker, Kai-Uwe Steffens.
On Thursday, newly leaked documents alleged that US and British intelligence agencies have cracked the encryption that secures a wide range of online communications -- including emails, banking transactions and phone conversations.
The documents provided by former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden
to The New York Times, ProPublica and The Guardian suggest that the spy agencies are able to decipher data even with the supposedly secure encryption designed to make it private.

[leiningen] [ANN] Leiningen 2.8.0 released
From: Phil Hagelberg <phil@xxxxxxxxxx>
To: leiningen@xxxxxxxxxxxxx
Date: Tue, 17 Oct 2017 17:42:14 -0700
Hello, everybody.
Did you know today is the 8th birthday of Leiningen[1]? It's a great
day to announce the release of Leiningen 2.8.0.
There are only three changes since the release candidate:
* Support `LEIN_USE_BOOTCLASSPATH` for users on Java 8. (Phil Hagelberg)
* Disable bytecode verification in Leiningen's own JVM for Java 9
compatibility. (Ghadi Shayban)
* Infer values for pom `<scm>` tag from `.git` directory. (Nicolas Berger)
The first two issues are related and could benefit from some
explanation: we have long used a hack of putting Leiningen on the
JVM's boot classpath to speed up launch time, but the module system in
Java 9 breaks this[3]. We have switched to another method of speeding
it up (-Xverify:none) which gives anywhere from 95% to 70% of the same
speed boost depending on the machine on which you're running it. So
some users will notice a performance regression. We hope to go back to
the old method once Clojure 1.9.0 is released with a workaround, but
in the meantime if you are not using Java 9, you can go back to the
bootclasspath hack with this setting:
export LEIN_USE_BOOTCLASSPATH=y
Since most folks are going to be upgrading from 2.7.x, I'll include
things from the release candidate announcement[4] as well:
The biggest change is that we went from using an old abandoned version
of Aether to the one under the Apache organization which has ongoing
support. This involved some changes to the package names of underlying
classes, which ideally is just an implementation detail, but we decided
it would be better to proceed with a release candidate to flush out
possible problems.
Other nice things include a number of handy subcommands for the `deps`
task for getting quicker answers to your dependency questions. We have
also rewritten the `search` task so that it uses remote search of Maven
Central and Clojars; no more waiting for half an hour for hundreds of
megabytes of indices to download.
Here's a full list of user-visible changes:
* Project middleware, hooks, and the `:test` profile are considered deprecated.
(Phil Hagelberg)
* Help output no longer includes TOC output. (Irina Renteria)
* The `vcs` task allows the commit message to be customized. (Toby Crawley)
* JVMs on 8u131 and newer will default to using cgroups settings for memory
limits. (Phil Hagelberg)
* Add `:query` subcommand to `deps` to quickly find the latest versions. (Phil
Hagelberg)
* Fix a bug where dependency resolution wasn't cached correctly. (Phil
Hagelberg)
* Warn when `$CLASSPATH` is set. (Phil Hagelberg)
* Default to requiring TLS for remote repositories. (Phil Hagelberg)
* Remove warning when running as root. (Phil Hagelberg)
* Add `:why` subtask to `deps` for tracing individual deps. (Phil Hagelberg)
* Remove clj-http and cheshire dependencies, reducing likelihood of conflict
(Phil Hagelberg)
* Warn when plugin dependencies conflict with Leiningen's own. (Phil Hagelberg)
* Fix a bug where repls outside a project were not run in Leiningen's own
process. (Phil Hagelberg)
* Add `:plugin-tree` and `:tree-data` subtasks to `deps`. (Ken Restivo)
* Support skipping bootclasspath for Java 9 compatibility. (Phil Hagelberg)
* Allow `vcs` task to skip signing tags. (Nicolas Berger)
* The `search` task no longer downloads indices but hits live search APIs.
(Phil Hagelberg)
* Remove duplicate exclusions in `lein deps` (Emlyn Corrin)
* Leiningen is now installable again via chocolatey (Florian Anderiasch)
* Dependency names can be specified as strings in addition to symbols (Wes
Morgan)
For those who manually installed, `lein upgrade 2.8.0` will pull in
this version, and `lein downgrade 2.7.1` will back it down to the
previous version if you run into any issues.
Thanks to all the contributors who made this happen!

CNN seems to have access to McCain's cattiest advisors. The other day, they got the "Diva" slam on Palin. And yesterday, they got the news that Palin had gone "rogue" with their statements about their rent-a-wardrdobe in Tampa.
Ensuring that news of the Republican National Committee's sartorial spending spree will remain in the headlines for at least one more news cycle, Sarah Palin on Sunday sounded off on the $150,000 wardrobe that was purchased for them in September, denouncing the report as "ridiculous" and declaring emphatically: "Those clothes, they are not my property." A senior adviser to John McCain told CNN's Dana Bash that the comments about their wardrobe "were not the remarks we sent to their plane this morning." Palin did not discuss the wardrobe story at their rally in Kissimmee later in the day.
Now, aside from the latest rumor–that Mitt's advisors are the source of the anti-Sarah leaks–I am fascinated by the lingering damage of WardrobeGate.
Former Mitt Romney presidential campaign staffers, some of whom are currently working for Sen. John McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin‘s bid for the White House, have been involved in spreading anti-Palin spin to reporters, seeking to diminish their standing after the election. "Sarah Palin is a lightweight, they won't be the first, not even the third, person people will think of when it comes to 2012," says one former Romney aide, now working for McCain-Palin. "The only serious candidate ready to challenge to lead the Republican Party is Mitt Romney. He's in charge on November 5th." [snip] Some former Romney aides were behind the recent leaks to media, including CNN, that Governor Sarah Palin was a "diva" and was going off message intentionally. The former and current Romney supporters further are pushing Romney supporters for key Republican jobs, including head of the Republican National Committee.
You see, it amazes me that, given how badly WardrobeGate damages both McCain and Palin, McPalin campaign staffers are still addressing it. Sure, McCain tried to squelch any discussion of it early on, and if CNN's correct and Palin went "rogue" with their extended comments yesterday, then they're still trying to shut down discussion of the issue, even while insisting that they didn't quite spend $150,000, after they sent the returns back to the store.
So perhaps it's just a matter of Sarah, now invested more in their future going forward, trying to absolve themselves of any responsibility for the $150,000 wardrobe.
Still, I can't help but wonder how it became such a big issue. In the original story on this, Jeanne Cummings doesn't describe any insiders tipping them to the expenditure; rather, it looks like they stumbled upon it doing old-fashioned reporting.
According to financial disclosure records, the accessorizing began in early September and included bills from Saks Fifth Avenue in St. Louis and New York for a combined $49,425.74. The records also document a couple of big-time shopping trips to Neiman Marcus in Minneapolis, including one $75,062.63 spree in early September. The RNC also spent $4,716.49 on hair and makeup through September after reporting no such costs in August. The cash expenditures immediately raised questions among campaign finance experts about their legality under the Federal Election Commission's long-standing advisory opinions on using campaign cash to purchase items for personal use. Politico asked the McCain campaign for comment on Monday, explicitly noting the $150,000 in expenses for department store shopping and makeup consultation that were incurred immediately after Palin's announcement. Pre-September reports do not include similar costs. [my emphasis]
In other words, the only potential sources they list who might have tipped them off are the campaign finance people–the only McCain camp contacts they lists are formal requests for comment.
Still WardrobeGate is the nugget that has set McCain and Palin off at each other, and I can't help but wonder whether there's something more to its continued currency as a story.
By now, most people are probably aware of the shooting death of a silverback gorilla at the Cincinnati Zoo. A three year old loudly announced to their mother that they were going to join "the gorilla in the water", and did just that when their mother was temporarily distracted. They crawled through a substantial barrier and dropped down a 15-foot wall into the gorilla's enclosure, landing in a foot of water. Two females gorillas responded to the zoo attendant's call to return to their indoor enclosure, but the third, a 17 year old, 400 lb male, named Harambe, didn't. Instead, they decided to investigate this strange event that had just occurred in their territory.
According to witnesses and a videotape made of the event, Harambe appeared to behave protectively toward the boy. The boy landed in a corner, and Harambe hovered over him, looking up at the screaming crowd above him. They apparently decided to move the boy to a safer place. They did this as a gorilla would, dragging the child with them through the water by an ankle and up a ladder to a more secure place. They then righted the boy and held their hand gently while looking around for somewhere else to take him. They decided to drag them again through the water to a more secluded part of the enclosure. You can see a video of Harambe's encounter taken by a bystander and uploaded to YouTube here.
First responders interpreted the gorilla's actions differently. According to zoo officials, the responders claimed the gorilla was behaving roughly and threateningly toward the child, tossing them about as though they were a toy. Fearing for the child's life, no rescue was attempted. Instead, a decision was made to shoot Harambe as the boy sat between their legs. Harambe's dead body fell away from the child rather than on him, which would have certainly crushed him.
The shooting death of Harambe immediately sparked controversy, which neatly divided into three camps. There are those who insist that a human's life is more important than an ape's, so the zoo was correct in shooting rather than attempting a rescue. These folks justify their view either by interpreting the ape's actions as menacing and threatening, or by insisting that even if the ape intended no harm, the potential for great harm existed. Others insist that it was wrong to kill an animal that had shown no sign of trying to harm the child but instead was trying to protect him. They demand to know why a rescue was not attempted by, say, lowering a rope or halter to the child while keeping a rifle trained on the ape in case anything went wrong. That, they insist, would have allowed for the possibility of a win-win outcome. The third camp includes those who were more interested in assigning blame to the zoo for it's presumably inadequate habitat barriers or to the mother for their perceived negligence.
Controversies aside, however, there are three lessons to be learned to avoid these tragedies in the future.
1. We vastly underestimate the intelligence of apes, and vastly overestimate their predilection for violence.
Gorillas are highly intelligent, intensely social, and for the most part peaceful. Primatologist Frans de Waal describes them this way:
I should also clarify, since people on have said that gorillas are dangerous predators, that this is entirely wrong. A gorilla doesn't look at a human child as something edible. The species is not interested in catching moving objects the way cats are. Lions or tigers are predators, but gorillas are peaceful vegetarians. They prefer a juicy fruit over a piece of meat any time of the day. The one thing that reliably makes a gorilla male mad is another male who enters their territory or gets too close to their females and young. Haramba surely knew that they were not dealing with , hence had no reason to attack. There are several previous cases of toddlers falling into gorilla enclosures, one at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago and another at Jersey Zoo (UK). In both cases, the children survived the of the apes, in one case even receiving assistance from them. At Rotterdam Zoo, a gorilla jumped the moat to get close to a woman who often visited, and also here the incident ended without a gorilla death.
Here is a video of the incident at the Brookfield Zoo in which a female gorilla carried an child to the zookeeper's gate so that a human could retrieve the child.
Here is a video of the incident at the British zoo in which a child fell into the gorilla enclosure, and they gorillas gently touched and guarded him, returning to their indoor enclosure when they were called.
2. If they are that smart, then they can be trained (like children are) on how to respond to this kind of situation.
Rather than fretting over how to make the barriers stronger, higher, and more dangerous in order to keep humans out, why not capitalize on primate to develop a strategic training response to this kind of situation? Apes are already trained by zookeepers to return to their indoor enclosures when they hear a particular call or alarm, as the females in Harambe's group did. So why not train them to do the same thing when something unexpected drops from above into their enclosures? Lifelike mannequins or other human-like objects could be used in the training. Or, for the truly courageous, trained personnel who can be quickly lowered and raised via halter.
3. The ingenuity of human children should not be underestimated.
If there is a way over it, under it, around it, or through it, a child will find it. So zoos must ensure that barriers are unclimbable. Even with such a fence, however, assume that there is an appreciably non-zero probability that a child, a teenager taking a selfie, or a drunk adult is going to fall into the enclosure at some point in the future (see point 2).
4. In crisis situations, people too often fall back on a "humans are more important than animals" bias that leads invariably to tragedies.
Once this is activated, the likelihood of seeking win-win, nonviolent solutions to threatening or potentially threatening situations plummets. Some people deliberately invoke this bias to justify killing animals even when humane solutions are possible.
Conclusion: The case of Harambe in many respects is a modern day version of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. seems to have been the primary factor underlying the decision to shoot rather than attempt a rescue—fear of a gorilla's superhuman strength, fear for the child's safety, fear of the unknown. The best antidote to fear-based is information. The more we know about other species and how they view the world, the wiser we can be in our decisions regarding them.

Tabletop Game Manufacturing Companies
I've personally used half a dozen card and board game Manufacturers over the last few years making our dozen or so games. I will share my personal thoughts / opinions below on these companies. But I have also contacted other publishers to get their first-hand feedback on other board game Manufacturers.
These Manufacturers are primarily for cards and board games but most can do dice and miniatures too. Usually, they can get other things done as well (like our Foam Dice or Metal Coins). But that's the niche I know and so that's what I write about.

Corey Bellemore obliterated the beer mile world record, unofficially, by almost eight seconds in Windsor, Ont. on Thursday. The Canadian university indoor champion ran 4:39.56 to better fellow Canadian Lewis Kent's mark of 4:47.17. Beermile.com will have to verify the video in order for the time to be considered an official beer mile world record.
Footage
The video contains some profanity
Read our exclusive interview with Bellemore here.
The beer mile was run at St. Joseph's Catholic High School in southern Ontario. The 21-year-old is an accomplished middle-distance runner having eclipsed the 1:48 mark in the 800m and the 3:44 mark in the 1,500m.
RELATED: Canada's drinking and running team heads overseas for beer mile world classic.
A beer mile is a 1,609m race, just over four laps of a standard 400m track, and involves drinking one 355 mL beer before the start of each lap. The beer must be five per cent alcohol and there is a limit as to how much beer can remain after each beverage is consumed. Too much residue results in disqualification.
Just ran a 4:39 BM — Corey Bellemore (@CoreyBellemore) July 29, 2016
Beers cannot be opened in advance and no tampering of the cans or bottles is permitted. Bellemore used bottles for their beer mile run. Impressively, they used a bottle opener for all four Kingfisher beers.
If an athlete vomits, they must do a penalty lap making the race 2,009 metres. According to Justin Bellemore, Corey's brother, the unofficial record came after the beer miler worked an 11-hour work day.
Hop on the #TeamCB train now, mans just ran a 4:39.56 beer mile after an 11 hr work day !!! — Justin Bellemore (@JBbellemore) July 29, 2016
Bellemore tweeted out that he's in the offseason but that didn't stop them from setting a record.
Off season tings — Corey Bellemore (@CoreyBellemore) July 29, 2016
Kent, of London, Ont., is currently overseas and is set to contest the beer mile world classic on Sunday in England.  They are the defending men's champion in the event, one of two global championships along with the FloTrack beer mile world championships. Kent is sponsored by Brooks and is an ambassador for the national beer mile circuit, a position that could pay them in the six figures.
Only two men, Kent and Canadian Corey Gallagher, had previously run under 4:50 for the four-lap, four-beer race. Canada is arguably the world's top country in the event and the town of Kingston, Ont. is known as the birthplace of the beer mile.
Great article in the latest edition of @canadianrunning on the history of the beer mile. Pumped to be racing in the @brooksrunning kit again soon. A photo posted by Lewis Kent (@lewis.kent) on Mar 11, 2016 at 11:03am PST
American Erin O'Mara holds the women's beer mile world record at 6:08.51.
Bellemore recently competed for Canada at the North American, Central American and Caribbean (NACAC) under-23 championships in El Salvador. There, Bellemore won a bronze medal in the men's 800m.
The beer mile has grown considerably since 2014 when the first world championships were held in Texas. Variations have emerged including the beer two-mile, which involves drinking eight beers and running eight laps of a 400m track.
Relative to its auto-industry "peers," Tesla has a pitiful amount of available cash. The carmakers that Tesla has challenged in market capitalization in 2017 — General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles — have each amassed war chests. FCA has almost $20 billion, GM has nearly $25 billion, and Ford has socked away close to $40 billion.
Tesla has just over $3 billion
Tesla is also currently burning through over a billion per quarter. If we just go by cash and exclude other financing instruments, such as Tesla's revolving credit lines, the company can't make it through 2018.
It's worth noting that Tesla is running thin on cash at a time when the US economy is at full employment and the US auto market is running near an all-time sales high.
Do the math: Tesla needs more money. And it will likely obtain that funding through another capital raise. It's past two raises were a return to Wall Street to sell more stock; and a first foray into the junk-bond debt markets.
The smart money, such as it is, would likely bet on Tesla doing another equity raise in 2018, given that shares are still above $300. Each new raise, however, highlights Tesla's poor execution on the manufacturing front. FCA, Ford, and GM also spend a billion per quarter, but they manage to produce millions of vehicles worldwide. Tesla produces a fraction of that.
There is an assumption among Tesla bulls that this pattern will at some point reverse in the future, as the Model 3 sedan, priced to start at $35,000, ramps toward full production and Tesla starts to draw in revenue from something like 400,000 pre-orders.
But while that would be cause for celebration at Tesla, attention would then turn to how much money Tesla is making on the Model 3. Mass-market sedans have notoriously skinny profit margins and have plummeted in popularity as consumers have turned to crossover SUVs.
There's no question that cash will be Tesla's biggest challenge in 2018.
President Donald Trump's tweet earlier Wednesday alleging that Amazon.com Inc. does not pay what they call “internet taxes” is off the mark.
In fact, the company today collects sales taxes in every state that has such a tax — that's 45 states or commonwealths plus the District of Columbia. Five states — Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon — don't have a sales tax.
The #AmazonWashingtonPost, sometimes referred to as the guardian of Amazon not paying internet taxes (which they should) is FAKE NEWS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 28, 2017
In the past, Amazon AMZN, +0.21% was aggressive in fighting to ensure that online purchases remained tax-free. The company benefited from tax rules obliging retailers to collect sales tax only in those states in which they have a physical presence, or “nexus,” such as a store or warehouse. But the company dropped that resistance in recent years after greatly expanding the number of distribution centers, warehouses and data centers that it operates across the U.S. to improve delivery times.
Amazon offers a full explanation of its sales-tax policies on its website.
Don't miss: Meet Amazon's first customer — this is the book they bought
One loophole that continues to irk lawmakers is that third-party vendors who sell products on the Amazon platform are not subject to sales tax, although that is expected to change. At least eight states, including New York, are introducing or considering measures to force Amazon and other online retailers to collect sales tax from their third-party vendors or to force sellers to report their own sales, according to the National Assocation of State Budget Officers, as the Wall Street Journal has reported.
That is expected to disrupt the operations of smaller retailers, in particular, who are not currently equipped to track where their goods are bought and sold or how to deal with the tax implications when items are returned.
Amazon shares were up 0.5% Wednesday and have gained 31% so far in 2017, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.08% has risen about 9%.

WASHINGTON — Black Lives Matter organizers who have disrupted politicians on the campaign trail in 2016 have heard the call, mostly from Democrats: Why not protest Republicans, either?
The one-sidedness of the protesters' confrontations has been a source of consternation inside campaigns and among Democrats watching the movement closely. Some Black Lives Matter activists have argued that their movement is better served by keeping their Democratic allies accountable.
Enter Donald Trump.
On Saturday, an Alabama man identified by multiple news outlets as Mercutio Southall Jr., was reportedly punched, tackled and kicked Saturday during a Trump rally in Birmingham, Alabama. Southall had been chanting, "Black lives matter!" Trump, as he's done before when disrupted at rallies, called for the protester's removal. "Throw them out!” the Republican presidential candidate said from the podium.
Inside the Black Lives Matter movement, activists said the melee in Alabama strengthened a closely-held belief that confronting Republican candidates at rallies attended by hundreds, sometimes thousands of people, could be dangerous.
"Roughed up? Maybe they should have been roughed up," Trump said on Fox News Sunday when asked about the incident. “I had 10,000 screaming people in the room yesterday. Because it was absolutely disgusting what they were doing.”
“This was not handled the way Bernie Sanders handled their problem, I will tell you that," Trump continued.
Marissa Johnson, one of the organizers who protested Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in Seattle this past summer, said the danger they and another activist, Mara Willingford, encountered at the Sanders rally did not compare to what Trump's supporters seemed ready to dish out.
“It's legitimately like showing up to a KKK rally,” they said.
“Look at their base,” Johnson continued. “It's nothing new. Just an escalation in the political climate that has brought a lot of stuff to light.”
Avery Jackson, a Morehouse College student and a protester with the Atlanta-based #AUCShutItDown, which disrupted a Hillary Clinton event at Clark Atlanta University last month, said the people who engage in disruption and similar tactics “are not disposable" and the Trump incident was evidence that those who engage in protest are putting themselves at risk.
“It's crazy that at a presidential campaign rally this would go down and there would not be any sanctions or statements on the behalf the party that they want to represent as the nominee," Jackson said. "There's not any sort of large outcry besides the one coming from the people who support the guy who was victimized."
Jackson said he's heard the calls for Black Lives Matter to protest Republicans — but even if he'd considered that before, they and others are probably thinking twice now.
“I think this shows what kind of risk that is,” Jackson said. “I think it's important for people to recognize that the people who involve themselves in protest and disruption on behalf of this movement have to be strategic about the way in which we do things.”
DeRay Mckesson of Campaign Zero said Trump's campaigning is built on ideas of bigotry and encourages violence. You don't remember their tax plan for instance, Mckesson said what's remembered is not Trump's tax plan, for instance, but their talk about building a border wall or creating a database on Muslim citizens.
"There's this impact to the language of bigotry, and we saw that impact be physical violence at the Trump rally," Mckesson said. "If Trump is not espousing the values of the Republican party, and if their supporters with their endorsement are physically assaulting a black man at a rally, then I wonder why then no one in the party is condemning it."
On Monday, the Washington Post reported that there would be not yet be charges filed against either Southall or the rally-goers who reportedly assaulted him.
Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz shared in the activists' sentiment in a statement released Tuesday, saying Trump, without mentioning them by name, contributed to hostility when they said the protester "maybe ‘should have been roughed up."
"There is no place for violence in our public discourse and certainly no place for irresponsible leadership in presidential campaigns more worried about playing to the ugliest elements of their party's base than about doing what's right," they said. "Every Republican presidential candidate ought to speak out against violence against protesters if they're serious about wanting to lead America."
Bryan Mone will return to the football field in three weeks after going down with an injury in Michigan's 63-3 win over Hawaii, according to Isaiah Hole of 247Sports.
Source tells me Bryan Mone should be back in about three weeks. — Isaiah Hole (@isaiahhole) September 6, 2016
Mone, along with defensive end Taco Charlton, will not play on Saturday against Central Florida.
"I don't think either one (of those guys) will be available this week," Harbaugh said Monday afternoon. "I don't think Bryan Mone or Taco will be out ... It's hard to say at this point. It's hard to say at this point. I don't have an update on how long they'll be out, but I don't anticipate them playing this week."
Ryan Glasgow, a defensive tackle for Michigan, said that they do not think Mone's injury is one that will end their season.
Ryan Glasgow says they didn't think Mone's injury is a season-ender. They actually played some on whatever knee injury they have. — Nick Baumgardner (@nickbaumgardner) September 5, 2016
The defensive tackle left with a leg injury and received an MRI after the game.
During summer camp last year, Mone broke their left leg and missed the 2015 season. Mone made nine tackles (two solo tackles) in the 2014 campaign with the Wolverines.

This is especially true of babies, especially if you're a guy. People, for reasons that aren't clear to me, love watching other people hold babies. Passing newborn babies around from person to person is a longstanding tradition that a lot of folks seem to really love, but the awkward man fears. If you don't want to hold one, I promise you, there is not a single combination of words you can string together to communicate this point to anyone.
You:"Oh, no, I really- Please, I'm sure I would drop it. Just everywhere."
Them:"Oh, nonsense, you're just nervous, you'll be fine, here it's easy!"

You:"No, thank you, I'm just not at all fond of babies."
Them:"Oh, you're so funny. Here just hold her, they won't bite."
You:"You don't know that!"
-
You:"Actually my whole family was killed by babies, and I swear to God if you hand me that child I will-"
Them:"Look, they like you! They wikes their Uncle Danny, doesn't he?"
-
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
You:"For reasons that aren't clear but are probably related to my general life awkwardness, I am very uncomfortable in this situation, do not hand me your baby."
Them:"You're just shy, you'll be great at it"
"Look, they seem nice, but can I just put them somewhere? Do they have... like a drawer, or basket?"
Everyone always assumes you're shy, or embarrassed, or nervous, even though deep down you really want to hold that baby. But here's the truth: the socially awkward man genuinely has no affection for your child. Further, they are terrified that there are several unspoken baby rules and that they will break every single one of them. He'll hold its head in a way that makes babies blind, or it'll start crying because they accidentally pinched a nerve that only babies have, or he'll make a face that scars them for the rest of their life.

None of this goes away when the children get older, either. Being around someone else's child at any age is confusing, because there is always a different set of rules and the lingering fear that you will have an impact on this child's life, which is terrifying because you are so, so dumb. The socially awkward can barely navigate their own life, and suddenly they're face-to-face with a four-year-old that's peed itself and there's no one else around. The child complains about pants-wetting and all you can think to say is "Look, this is clearly a situation but I'm not- I don't really know what my jurisdiction is, legally, when it comes to, like, your pants. You're not my property and I have no interest in your future. Please go somewhere until this issue resolves itself."

"Just keep your head down, and believe in yourself, and be far away from me."
Little children recognize no boundaries and feel no shame, and those two things define the socially awkward human.
Socially awkward guys don't want anything to do with a baby or child based on the very understandable fear that they will somehow do it wrong, (and also because babies aren't interesting). Not everyone sees a baby and thinks "That's so precious I need to hold it now, but how do I ask?" Some guys just see a baby and think "You are a baby."
Please don't make them hold your baby. Just let them sit quietly in the corner, mentally complaining about their haircut and wondering how everyone else learned how to dance when they didn't.

UPDATE: Hear Silverchair's Daniel Johns Feature On What So Not's New Track ‘Be Ok Again'
ORIGINAL STORY: Former Silverchair frontman Daniel Johns has revealed that he's been working on new music with Aussie producer What So Not, and their first collaboration will be released in less than 24 hours.
Sharing a photo of themselves with What So Not (Chris Emerson) today, Johns said, “Been working with this guy on some tracks for a fine record. 1st single at midnight.”
In a statement, Emerson says the collaboration came about after a chance encounter, when Johns happened to walk past a studio in which Emerson was “jamming in a session with Slumberjack”.
“Dan seemed intrigued and started joking they had to leave before they decided to cancel their plans and track vocals with us for the next 10hrs,” Emerson says.
“A few days later, they reached out via a mutual friend and invited me up the coast to stay and work with them out of their home studio.
“We clicked instantly on concepts, character development, sonics and writing styles, then locked onto one song in particular. ‘Be Ok Again' was a really personal track for me. I was kind of embarrassed to show someone of their calibre as I had written and sung my own topline to feel out the idea. To my surprise, they loved it and not only was they happy to re-sing my parts, they encouraged me to keep my voice on the record.
“I ended up doing a bunch of writing trips to Daniel's studio and safe to say he's become quite a good friend and mentor. I can't wait to share this song with you tomorrow and everything else I have in store for 2018.”
Johns and Emerson's debut collaborative single will be the first piece of new music we've heard from Johns since their band Boom Tish released a cover of ‘Hello, How Are You' by The Easybeats last month.
Stay tuned to Music Feeds to hear Johns and Emerson's debut single in full.

The key problem is that water from the Flint River is highly corrosive to iron and lead, and, unfortunately, these pipe materials are widely used throughout Flint. Herein, we discuss the higher corrosivity of Flint River water to iron, and the associated problem maintaining chlorine disinfectant in the system.
Why is Flint River water more corrosive compared to Detroit water? Flint River water has about 8 times more chloride (Cl–) in it than Detroit water. Chloride is generally considered to be very corrosive to iron. For instance, chloride present in road salts applied in the winter causes iron in cars and bridges to rust. Detroit also adds a corrosion inhibitor chemical (orthophosphate) to their water that helps to reduce corrosion of metals such as iron and lead. So, current Flint water is not only more corrosive, but there is also no corrosion inhibitor present.
Iron corrosion can cause a serious problem for meeting Federal standards using Flint River Water, because iron corrosion consumes chlorine. Chlorine is added to the water to prevent growth of microorganisms that cause disease, and maintaining a chlorine residual is the best way to protect public health against human pathogens.
To illustrate how iron corrosion is problematic for maintaining a chlorine residual, we collected a sample of Flint water. We put some of that sample into a clean glass container, and some more of it into an identical container with a piece of iron to simulate the effect of water on iron pipes in Flint. We then measured the decay of chlorine over time (Figure 1). The initial level of chlorine was 1.15 milligrams per liter (mg/L), and it stayed pretty high when it was in a glass container. It only dropped to 0.95 mg/L over 12 hours (blue line). Thus, if Flint had a glass (or plastic or concrete) pipe system, chlorine would stay high as it was transported to homes. But when we did the same test with iron present, the chlorine dropped faster due to the corrosion, and was all gone after only 12 hours (red line). After 6 days of doing the test, the chlorine dropped even faster, and was below the minimum required chlorine residual of 0.2 mg/L in just about 1 hour in our test system (green line). The key point is that Flint River water is corroding iron pipes, and that will cause the chlorine to disappear very quickly.
When we did the exact same test using water from Detroit (collected on the outskirts of Flint), the chlorine in the container without the iron stayed high at about 0.6 mg/L over a 12 hour test (blue line below). When iron was present, chlorine dropped, but much slower than in the Flint River water (red line and green line). Ironically, Detroit water started with only about 60% of the chlorine initially present in Flint water, but ended up with much more chlorine after 12 hours because there was less iron corrosion. What is more, comparing Day 1 to Day 6, Flint water ate up more chlorine the longer the test was run, whereas Detroit water ate up less chlorine the longer the test was run.
Figure 3 shows a picture of Flint water and Detroit water after reacting in the glass containers described after the first 5 days of the test. This also illustrates why residents have been complaining of “red” or discolored water after the switch to the Flint River source.
At present, as a rough estimate which we will elaborate on later, it looks like Detroit water is about 5 times less corrosive to iron pipe than Flint River water. This also probably means that the iron pipes in the city of Flint system will fail 5 times faster using the Flint River water rather than the Detroit water. In fact, this is probably already occurring as evidenced by increased rates of water main leaks and breaks. While an economic analysis cannot yet be done based on our limited data, it is possible (and even likely) that the economic damage to the Flint pipe system due to corrosion is going to cost the city tens of millions of dollars more in pipe repair costs in the coming years compared to what they would have paid if they had stayed on Detroit water.
Conclusion: The high rates of iron corrosion from using Flint River water as a drinking water source are damaging the Flint distribution system. The corrosion is also causing chlorine to disappear quickly, which may make it more likely for harmful bacteria to grow in the water. Furthermore, it is possible that with the existing unlined iron pipe system in Flint, and the relatively low water demand (due to declining population, loss of GM – which used a lot of water – as a water customer, and high rates), that it will be very difficult to meet Federal standards for minimum chlorine levels no matter what is done to treat the water.

People think that what makes us “Hard Workers” get good grades is the motivation to work, the reality can't be any further from the truth. If we only relied on motivation to work we would only revise once a week and never hand assignments in on time. Motivation doesn't last, it doesn't persist when things get difficult. Granted, it may give you the momentum to start working, but what truly keeps the hard work engines fueled is the discipline that most of us have developed. Discipline is what allows us to win the IB marathon, it keeps us running even when we want to quit. This discipline is hard to build, but it isn't impossible, as a matter of fact you can develop it overnight. The problem is however, if you get out of your working trend, you may find it difficult to resume all that hard work. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't take time off during holidays, it means that you have to be aware that you will be more reluctant to resume working. This is why I suggest you completely cut out on any sort of distraction during the few months leading up to the exams. These distractions include but are not limited to: Video games, TV shows, Movies, Going out, Drinking (you have to become a social mole, digging deep through your books).
Now let's get to the most important part of this blog, how do you develop your discipline overnight? Firstly you require a catalyst to get you motivated and the ball rolling, this usually presents itself in the form of a bad grade or test score. You have to use that crappy feeling that is eating away at your heart to motivate yourself to work. The problem is however that you will tell yourself “I will prepare better for the next test”, but the next test is in a month and you will have lost that motivation. What you have to do is us that painful feeling and get working the very same day. Start preparing for your next test a month in advance, go over class notes, do extra question, basically: go above and beyond. This will almost ensure that you will score highly on the next test, and that good grade, that 7/7 will create a dopamine rush in your brain making you feel happy. Use that happiness and get addicted to the good grade and understand that the only way you can achieve that good grade is through the discipline you have showed that past month.
I also set daily goals for working, I suggest 3 hours a day (but you know best). I record the times I have worked on a spread sheet and when I hit or exceed the daily goal I feel happy and this acts as a micro step towards a larger goal (visualizing progress helps you move forward). I can also see if I haven't reached the daily goal which will act as negative reinforcement tool that will get me back to work. This timing and timetable idea might sound rather weak, but trust me, it helps.
Just a few kilometres north of the thriving Chinese border city of Dandong, a daily routine plays out that highlights the huge gap between Asia's two socialist allies.
Every hour during the day, dozens of Chinese boats speed off from a jetty on the Yalu river, packed with tourists, cameras and selfie sticks.
They speed down the water into North Korean territory, past fishermen, soldiers and agricultural workers tending bullock-carts.
As they stare at their neighbours, a tour guide explains through a crackly speaker that North Korea isn't as economically developed as China.
This appears to be the main drawcard for the thousands of Chinese tourists who come here every year.
"Everyone says North Korea is very poor, so I want to go there and take a look myself at how poor they actually are," said a 74-year-old tourist who only gave their surname, Zhu.
The latest UN sanctions against North Korea, if enforced, will strip an estimated $940 million of income from Kim Jong-un's regime by banning the export of textiles.
It will also cap, but not stop, the flow of oil that China pumps in a pipeline under the Yalu River.
There's not much talk of international politics as the tourist boats pass a village and several watch posts dotted along a continuous wire fence on the North Korean side.
There is more interest in the armed soldier patrolling the shore and the children playing among the corn stalks.
After a few kilometres, the boats turn around and allow North Korean traders to pull up alongside and peddle cigarettes and souvenirs.
The guide warns everyone on board not to take photos, and there is an angry response from the trader when they see our camera.
Locals in Dandong say North Korea allows the cross-border trips to get a cut of the revenue.
After the latest sanctions, Chinese tourism to North Korea is now one of the few remaining ways for Pyongyang to legally bring in income.
It's estimated about 100,000 tourists — the vast majority Chinese — enter the country each year.
But many more come to Dandong for cross-border day trips and to watch North Korean waiteres perform song and dance routines at joint-venture restaurants.
Those joint ventures have now been banned in the latest round of UN sanctions — raising a question on whether they can legally continue to operate as fully Chinese-owned businesses.
There are signs that local business people are finding ways to get around previous sanctions, such as the importation of North Korean seafood.
"The controls by the Chinese side are now very strict, but there are usually some Chinese fishing boats that are still willing to buy seafood from North Korean trawlers," said one trader at the Donggang port wholesale market near Dandong.
North Korea has made it clear it will continue to work towards the goal of being able to threaten the US with a long-range nuclear missile.
But international gamesmanship seems a world away from the villagers toiling alongside the Yalu River at the border.
Some Chinese tourists yell and wave at them as the boats pass by, hoping for a reaction.
Not once did any of the North Koreans — adults and children alike — show the slightest interest in waving back.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein's office confirmed that they will be introducing in the Senate Thursday a new version of the so-called assault weapon ban. A spokesperson said the full text will be released at a press conference on Thursday.
The California Democrat intends to expand on the ban that expired in 2004, by including handguns and shotguns, in addition to rifles. They would decrease from two to one the number of cosmetic features on a gun to have it be considered an “assault weapon.” This means that if a gun has just one item like a pistol grip or bayonet lug, then it is illegal. Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed into law the same ban in New York last week.

Furthermore, instead of grandfathering in current firearms, they would create a national gun registry for the government to track lawful gun owners. Magazines would again be limited to 10 rounds.
The Clinton-era bill was not renewed by Congress after the Federal Bureau of Investigation and law enforcement agencies reported that it was ineffective in reducing crime.
President Obama said that a top priority is to get “an assault weapons ban that is meaningful” passed this year.
A summary of Mrs. Feinstein's legislation is below.
Bans the sale, transfer, importation, or manufacturing of: 120 specifically-named firearms; certain other semiautomatic rifles, handguns, shotguns that can accept a detachable magazine and have one or more military characteristics; and semiautomatic rifles and handguns with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds.
Strengthens the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban and various state bans by: Moving from a 2-characteristic test to a 1-characteristic test; eliminating the easy-to-remove bayonet mounts and flash suppressors from the characteristics test; and banning firearms with “thumbhole stocks” and “bullet buttons” to address attempts to “work around” prior bans.
Bans large-capacity ammunition feeding devices capable of accepting more than 10 rounds.
Protects legitimate hunters and the rights of existing gun owners by: Grandfathering weapons legally possessed on the date of enactment; exempting over 900 specifically-named weapons used for hunting or sporting purposes; and exempting antique, manually-operated, and permanently disabled weapons.
Requires that grandfathered weapons be registered under the National Firearms Act, to include: Background check of owner and any transferee; type and serial number of the firearm; positive identification, including photograph and fingerprint; certification from local law enforcement of identity and that possession would not violate State or local law; and dedicated funding for ATF to implement registration.

Astrophysicist Eric Davis is one of the leaders in the field of faster-than-light (FTL) space travel. But for Davis, humanity's potential to explore the vastness of space at warp speed is not science fiction.
Davis' latest study, "Faster-Than-Light Space Warps, Status and Next Steps" won the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics' (AIAA) 2013 Best Paper Award for Nuclear and Future Flight Propulsion.
TechNewsDaily recently caught up with Davis to discuss their new paper, which appeared in the March/April volume of the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society and will form the basis of their upcoming address at Icarus Interstellar's 2013 Starship Congress in August. [Super-Fast Space Travel Propulsion Ideas (Images)]
"The proof of principle for FTL space warp propulsion was published decades ago," said Davis, referring to a 1994 paper by physicist Miguel Alcubierre. "All conventional advanced propulsion physics technologies are limited to speeds below the speed of light … Using an FTL space warp will drastically reduce the time and distances of interstellar flight."
Warp speed: a primer
Before delving into Davis' study, here's a quick review of faster-than-light space travel:
According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, an object with mass cannot go as fast or faster than the speed of light. However, some scientists believe that a loophole in this theory will someday allow humans to travel light-years in a matter of days.
In current FTL theories, it's not the ship that's moving — space itself moves. It's established that space is flexible; in fact, space has been steadily expanding since the Big Bang.
By distorting the space around the ship instead of accelerating the ship itself, these theoretical warp drives would never break Einstein's special relativity rules. The ship itself is never going faster than light with respect to the space immediately around it.
Davis's paper examines the two principle theories for how to achieve faster-than-light travel: warp drives and wormholes.
The difference between the two is the way in which space is manipulated. With a warp drive, space in front of the vessel is contracted while space behind it is expanded, creating a sort of wave that brings the vessel to its destination.
With a wormhole, the ship (or perhaps an exterior mechanism) would create a tunnel through spacetime, with a targeted entrance and exit. The ship would enter the wormhole at sublight speeds and reappear in a different location many light-years away.
In their paper, Davis describes a wormhole entrance as "a sphere that contained the mirror image of a whole other universe or remote region within our universe, incredibly shrunken and distorted."
Sci-fi fans, for warp drives, think "Star Trek" and "Futurama." For wormholes, think "Stargate."
[See also: Warp Drive and Transporters: How 'Star Trek' Technology Works (infographic)]
Mirror, mirror on the hull
The next question is: how to create these spacetime distortions that will allow vessels to travel faster than light? It's believed — and certain preliminary experiments seem to confirm — that producing targeted amounts of what's called "negative energy" would achieve the desired effect.
Negative energy has been produced in a lab via what's called the Casimir effect. This phenomenon revolves around the idea that vacuum, contrary to its portrayal in classical physics, isn't empty. According to quantum theory, vacuum is full of electromagnetic fluctuations. Distorting these fluctuations can create negative energy.
According to Davis, one of the most promising methods for creating negative energy is called the Ford-Svaiter mirror. This is a theoretical device that would focus all the quantum vacuum fluctuations onto the mirror's focal line.
"When those fluctuations are confined there, they have a negative energy," said Davis. "You could have types of negative energy that could make a wormhole that you could put a person through and, if you make a bigger mirror, put a starship through. The [mirror] is scalable … that's the beauty of it."
Davis described a theoretical configuration of Ford-Svaiter mirrors that could enable FTL spaceflight: "For a traversable wormhole, it'll have to be separate Ford-Svaiter mirrors [arranged] in an array to create the wormhole and then a ship with mirrors attached to it to extend the wormhole to the destination star."
Melbourne Archbishop Denis Hart has said he'll risk going to jail rather than report what's said to them in the sacrament of confession, even if what's confessed relates to child sexual abuse.
Their latest comments, made on ABC radio, were responding to a recommendation from the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse to make reporting child sexual abuse allegations mandatory in institutions including when an allegation is made in religious confession. Failure to report would be a criminal offence.
Melbourne archbishop says he'd rather go to jail than report child abuse heard in confession Read more
The recommendation is one of a suite of proposed reforms to improve transparency and reporting of sexual abuse and improve the law's effectiveness to apprehend sexual abusers and protect children.
Archbishop Hart wouldn't report something said in confession by a child who's been abused or by an abuser. Non-Catholics don't understand confession, they said. Confession is sacrosanct, above the law, which is what makes it different from other forms of telling. It's communication with God of a higher order.
Like many Catholics, I spent my childhood in fortnightly confession and frankly I don't understand confession either. I recall the queasy light and the slightly creepy whispering of the priest in that little tardis of shame that sat on one side of the church. I got the same penance every fortnight by making up the same sins. I'd say I lied, I stole, because I couldn't think of any actual sins. My penance was always a couple of Hail Marys.
The seal of confession, its secrecy, was important, we were told in religion class at school. A priest was hanged for a murder they didn't commit because they wouldn't reveal the murderer's true identity, which he'd learned through confession. That's how tight the seal was. It amazed us.
When I was 16, I went to confession for real. I'd been sexually abused by a Catholic high school teacher and their husband. I went to see a priest on the suggestion of one of my abusers, because I was so upset.
I fell pregnant to my teacher's husband, but a faceless public servant helped save my life | Mary-Rose MacColl Read more
The priest I saw gave me absolution which didn't make me any less upset. I can't remember what the penance was. They didn't do anything about what I told them as far as I know. I guess they maintained the seal of confession, the higher order communication with God in Archbishop Hart's terms. I wish they had done something, reported what I'd told them to my school, parents or the police, because I'd have been far less harmed. What happened to me after that time has had lifelong consequences. I was a child who had a child. The priest let me down badly.
I don't think we can afford to let Archbishop Hart and their colleagues make judgements about what is and isn't reported when it comes to sexual abuse of children. In my lifetime, hundreds of their priests and brothers harmed children terribly. People in senior roles who knew covered up these crimes. Whatever is done in relation to reporting needs to be simple and clear and externally driven.
Confession is as vulnerable to corruption as any other human activity. In Ryan White's excellent Netflix documentary series, The Keepers, it was the sacrament of confession that enabled paedophile priests to target the most vulnerable children by using the sins they confessed.
The Catholic church is not above the law. It's not above anything. It's down here on Earth with the rest of us and ought to be more concerned about protecting children than protecting its practices.

A one-time Toronto Maple Leafs player who lied about photos of their genitals being posted on the Internet has won a court judgment against a Toronto entrepreneur who cancelled the player's $200,000 endorsement contract, citing a morals clause that allegedly kicked in when the photos surfaced.
Frank D'Angelo, the founder of D'Angelo Brands and Steelback Brewery, has been ordered to pay former NHL player Mike Zigomanis $162,500, plus interest, according to a judgment released Monday by Ontario Superior Court Judge David Stinson.
Zigomanis, who last played professional hockey in 2013-14 with the Rochester Americans, successfully argued that they had been wrongfully terminated from a contract with D'Angelo's Cheetah Power Surge energy drink brand. Stinson wrote that the morals clause was not retroactive, and that Zigomanis had shared the photos with their then-girlfriend before signing the endorsement deal.
Lawyers for D'Angelo and Zigomanis did not reply to emails seeking comment.
During the 2010-11 season, Zigomanis played eight games with the Maple Leafs before being demoted to the Marlies. In May 2011, they met D'Angelo after appearing on the entrepreneur's TV show and agreed to appear in a TV commercial promoting Cheetah.
Under terms of their contract, Zigomanis agreed that they would participate in one production session and two personal appearances each year. They also agreed to sign 50 autographs to be used for D'Angelo's promotion or for charity.
Zigomanis was to be paid $50,000 per year, paid quarterly. After two years, they had the option to extend their endorsement contract two additional years.
The contract included a termination clause that allowed D'Angelo to cancel it if the Zigomanis committed, “any act which shocks, insults, or offends the community, or which has the effect of ridiculing public morals and decency.”
In December 2011, that morals clause took on added importance.
Zigomanis became ensnared in a controversy after The Toronto Star reported photos of their genitals had allegedly been posted on a U.S.-based website where jilted lovers post nude, often lewd, pictures of their exes.
Zigomanis denied they were pictured in those photos.
“Sadly this is one of the few downfalls of being a pro athlete,” former Marlies coach Dallas Eakins wrote on Twitter at the time. “False statements, pictures are common. Attempted identify thefts are picking up.”
"Ziggy assures us that the clothed photos are of him, and were purloined off their Facebook account," former Leafs general manager Brian Burke told The Toronto Sun. "He also assures us that the nude photos are not of him. They have retained a lawyer to help them put an end to this."
According to Stinson's judgment released Monday, Zigomanis has admitted lying about those photos. At trial, they testified that they took the photos of themselves and sent them to their then-girlfriend in late 2010, well before the date they signed their agreement with D'Angelo.
At some point, an unknown individual posted those photos on the Internet. Zigomanis learned that they were publicly available in November 2011 when a teammate told him. They hired a lawyer, but failed to have the photos removed from the Internet.
“Mr. Zigomanis was asked by their coach on the Marlies hockey team whether the photographs were of him,” Stinson wrote in their judgment. “He falsely responded they were not. They claim they made that statement on the advice of their lawyer. The false denial was repeated by various representatives of the Marlies' and Leafs' organization in response to media inquiries.”
It's unclear whether Zigomanis retained the same lawyer for their wrongful dismissal suit against D'Angelo as they did when they sought counsel as the scandal surfaced.
D'Angelo terminated Zigomanis's contract on March 12, 2012, citing the morals clause.
Stinson wrote that since Zigomanis's photos were posted without their knowledge or consent, the Internet posting was not an act committed by them and the clause was not triggered. Moreover, the judge wrote that sending a private photo to another consenting adult was unlikely to shock or offend the community.
“Many people choose to privately exchange intimate information and photographs in this fashion,” Stinson wrote. “Private letters, poems, sketches, photographs and the like, containing intimate information, have been exchanged between individuals for centuries, in the expectation that they would remain private between sender and recipient,” Stinson wrote.
Stinson also noted that the morals clause in Zigomanis's contract did not include any provisions for events that took place before the contract was signed.
D'Angelo, Stinson wrote, “could have inserted a clause concerning [Zigomanis's] past and future personal conduct. The morals clause is not stated to be retrospective. In the absence of any such provision and in light of the entire agreement clause, I am not prepared to interpret the clause to give it retrospective effect.”
If they had extended their two-year contract by an additional two years, Zigomanis would have earned $200,000. Since D'Angelo had only paid them $37,500 before terminating the contract, Stinson ordered them to pay Zigomanis $162,500.
Here's an interesting speculation; reader comments welcome. What if the Democratic party comes to realize that Hillary Clinton is an albatross? Polls indicate that Bernie Sanders would do better against Donald Trump. If they are not the nominee, a few of their supporters will switch to Trump or Clinton, but many of them will stay home. Clinton, SLL recently argued, is a perfect set up for Trump's unpredictability and personal attacks. They lack natural political skills and is vulnerable on both issues and scandals.  They are establishment and an ardent foreign interventionist. Trump made mince meat of a slew of establishment, ardent foreign interventionist Republicans. He's narrowing the gap with them in national polls, and has caught up with them in key states Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Florida.
The email scandal hangs over Clinton's head. The FBI has interviewed their close associates and will probably interview them Bryan Pagliano, who designed their private email server, has received immunity from prosecution in return for their testimony. The cynical assumption, and still the betting favorite, is an FBI recommendation to seek an indictment against Clinton will be quashed by President Obama's Justice Department. Even that outcome cannot be regarded as favorable for Clinton. Many will conclude that it's the establishment taking care of its own, a key issue propelling both Trump's and Sanders' campaigns. There is also the strong possibility that someone in the FBI leaks damaging material that was the basis of the rejected recommendation, compounding the damage to Clinton.
For argument's sake, assume Obama and the Democrat's movers and shakers conclude that Hillary is a liability. Say they let the primaries play out and Clinton has a majority of delegates and committed superdelegates. However, suppose a subtle message goes out to the FBI: the administration will follow whatever the FBI recommends and would not be overly upset if that was indictment. Were it to happen, Clinton would presumably have to abandon them candidacy.
Does that clear the way for Bernie Sanders? Not if the movers and shakers have their way.  They are about as popular with them as Donald Trump is with their party's establishment. Joseph Biden made a couple of interesting comments recently. They said they thought they would have been the best presidential candidate had they chosen to run, and they also said they and Elizabeth Warren discussed them as their running mate. Trial balloons? What if Clinton, upon announcing their withdrawal, released their delegates to vote for Joseph Biden and Elizabeth Warren, who had agreed, for the good of the party and the nation, to accept a last-minute draft?
The key is Obama. For them this would be the best possible outcome. Their vice president is far more likely to preserve their tattered legacy than Clinton, who would want to carve out their own historical niche. Biden is not a polarizing figure, like Clinton, and does not have their scandalous baggage. Their long string of goofy statements will be ignored by the press, as they always do for Democrats.  They are a centrist Democrat and would champion mainstream Democratic policies. Having Warren on the ticket as their vice president would keep the gender-based vote on board. It would make them the automatic favorite for the Democratic nomination in 2020 (when Biden will be seventy-eight years old) or 2024. She's very liberal and has been a strident critic of Wall Street and the banks, which will help with disgruntled Sanders supporters.
It might make the Democratic convention messier, it might take more than one ballot, and there would be those disgruntled Sanders supporters, but a Biden-Warren ticket stands a better chance against Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton. Sanders supporters would have three months to get over it. They are more ideologically aligned with the Democrats than the Republicans. Not to say that Biden and Warren aren't establishment tools, but they haven't been as blatant about it as Clinton, making them more palatable to the Sanders crowd.
Biden and Warren are much less vulnerable to Trump's attacks than Clinton. Biden has been the vice president for eight years and was a senator for thirty-six, with stints as chairperson of the Foreign Relations and Judiciary Committees. On paper he's qualified. They have a genial personality and is a known, safe, quantity. Warren has made a name for themselves and attracts substantial support from the party's far left wing. Biden and Warren give the Democrats a much better chance of winning the election—with a coat tail effect for Democratic Congressional candidates—than Clinton. Were this scenario to play out, the election would have to be rated a toss-up and not, as SLL said in the recent article, “Trump's to lose.”
There is one final consideration. Obama loathes the Clintons and the feeling is mutual. If Clinton is indicted, they will showcase the indictment as proof that their Justice Department does not politicize investigations. Hillary will be in a heap of expensive, lengthy, and risky legal trouble. Wouldn't Obama relish the prospect of the Clintons groveling for a prospective pardon like Gerald Ford granted Richard Nixon? They would extract from Hillary a promise to release their delegates (and campaign contributors) to the Biden-Warren ticket and from both of them a promise to give it their heartfelt support. Assuming Obama held up their end of the bargain (not a safe assumption), they would issue the pardon after the election to minimize the political fallout. Democrats would be happy to put the matter behind them. Only Republicans would complain and for Obama, that's the cherry on the sundae.
Something to think about.

The controversial beer bike beloved by stag weekend tourists in Amsterdam has been given a reprieve by a court in the Dutch capital.
The council had planned to ban the vehicle from city centre streets by January 1, but the court said officials need to provide better support for their arguments. In addition, officials must also come up with a more careful assessment of the likely impact of a ban on the companies which offer beer bike tours, the court said.
By banning the bikes from the entire city centre, companies would have been unable to move the vehicles from their lock-ups to places where there is no ban, the court said. This would make it impossible to operate.
The ban was taken to court by the beer bike companies who said it would have a serious effect on their livelihoods. Council officials say the bikes are major nuisance in traffic, particularly on narrow city centre streets.
MOUNTAIN IRON, Minn.-A stately jack pine growing in a yard in Mountain Iron's shrinking Parkville neighborhood was proclaimed the state champion of its species-the the largest on record living in Minnesota-and then promptly cut down two days later.
The jack pine was surveyed by a state Department of Natural Resources forester on March 31 and confirmed to be the biggest live jack pine in the state.
It apparently was also the largest living jack pine in the U.S., according to records kept by the American Forests Big Tree Program.
"The state was looking for the largest jack pine because the previous one died, which was also a national champion,'' said Jennifer Teegarden, forest outreach specialist for the DNR and coordinator of the state's Big Tree Program. "I was able to declare the jack pine in Mountain Iron as the state champion."
But the new champion never made it into the record books. Just two days after being confirmed, the Mountain Iron pine was felled as part of a future mine expansion.
"Now we need a new champion. I didn't even get a chance to update the website,'' they said. "Being a state Big Tree doesn't protect the tree from being cut down."
The Mountain Iron jack pine measured 87 inches in circumference at 4 ½ feet above ground. It was 57 feet tall with a crown spread of 32 feet. That's smaller than the previous state record, which totaled 189 points but which died of natural causes over the winter in Lake Bronson State Park.
But the Mountain Iron tree was larger than any other living jackpine in the national registry. The current national champ totals 136 points.
"That tree was big when I was little. It's got to be pretty old, but I'm not sure how old,'' said Dale Irish, 60, whose family lived for three generations at the home where the tree was cut. "We used to swing from the big branches."
Teegarden said they were unaware the tree was about to be cut down when Irish told them about it on March 24. They asked a state forester to measure the tree before April 1, when the property was being transferred from Irish to U.S. Steel Corp. The company is buying up properties on the north side of the Parkville neighborhood to make way for an expansion of the open-pit taconite iron mine at its massive Minntac operation.
Iron Rangers are used to moving for new mining-it's been happening for more than a century. U.S. Steel is expanding the mine by 483 acres to gain access to more taconite iron ore and extend the life of the facility through 2031. The plan would result in about a 5 percent increase in the size of the mine pits on adjacent land leased by the company.
The mine expansion was approved in September by state and federal regulators.

Iraqi security forces have retaken a former government compound in Ramadi where the Islamic State had been fighting to maintain control of the city. File photo by Frontpage/Shutterstock
BAGHDAD, Dec. 27 (UPI) -- Iraqi security forces have taken control of a former government compound in Ramadi the Islamic State used as a headquarters.
"The government compound is under our full control," Col. Mohammed Ibrahim, spokesperson for Iraq's Joint Operations Command, told CNN. "This does not mean we have entered the compound. It means it is fully surrounded and fully under our control."
Ibrahim said although there may be pockets of resistance, most Islamic State fighters fled or were killed in ongoing airstrikes and ground combat, BBC News reported. The Iraqi government is planning to hold a flag-raising ceremony at the recaptured government compound on Monday, anticipating taking full control of Ramadi soon.
There has been no official death toll estimate released on the fight for Ramadi, but reports indicate about 400 Islamic State militants were in the city at one point.
RELATED 116 homes lost in Victoria bushfire
Iraqi troops in recent weeks have been working to recapture Ramadi since IS forces seized the city in May. Security forces earlier this month captured areas of northern and western Ramadi, including the al-Aramil and al-Tameen districts, as well as the Palestine Bridge and Anbar Operations Center.
The Iraqi government and its allies in the U.S. coalition and Iran-trained Hashid Shaabi are fighting continued offensives to regain territories lost to IS forces that spilled over from Syria last year, particularly in the Anbar, Saladin and Nineveh provinces.
Iraqi forces have throughout the year conducted two phases of an offensive in the Saladin province, capturing the provincial capital, Tikrit, in April, and the city of Baiji and its surrounding areas in recent months.
RELATED Syrian foreign minister says government ready for peace talks
The most significant IS-held city in Iraq is Mosul, capital of the Nineveh province, where Iraqi Peshmerga forces have played a prominent role on the ground against IS militants. The Peshmerga, supported by coalition airstrikes, captured the city of Sinjar last month, cutting off a major road linking Mosul to IS territories in Syria.

South Korea and the U.S. will formally discuss deploying a missile-defense system known as THAAD, after North Korea claimed to have launched a satellite into space.
A joint statement by both militaries said the talks will "explore the feasibility of THAAD deploying to and operating on the Korean Peninsula at the earliest possible date."
According to the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD) has a truck-mounted launcher that can fire interceptors that destroy ballistic missiles "inside or outside the atmosphere."
"It has been decided to formally start talks on the possibility of deploying the THAAD system to South Korea as part of steps to bolster the missile defense of the Korea-U.S. alliance," said Yoo Jeh-Seung, Seoul's deputy defense minister for policy.
"The Korea-U.S. alliance had no choice but to take such a defense action because North Korea staged a strategic provocation and is refusing to have a genuine dialogue on denuclearization," Yoo said in a joint briefing with Lieutenant General Thomas Vandal, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army based in South Korea.
But the system is unpopular outside Seoul. Three years ago, when South Korea discussed purchasing the U.S.-developed system, China objected, citing a risk to its security.
Beijing once again objected Sunday, with a foreign ministry spokesperson saying the country is "deeply concerned" over the announced negotiations. Hua Chunying said the missile defense system will escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the region.
China is North Korea's primary trading partner.
Sea urchins, dormice and figs: Romans' rich diet revealed after archaeologists sift through tons of 2,000-year-old excrement
British team get their hands dirty excavating ancient sewer system
It may not sound the most glamorous job in the world but a team of British archaeologists say they are thrilled to be sifting through tons of 2,000 year old ancient Roman poo.
The nine tons of historical excrement is among waste that has been found in the sewer system of the town of Herculaneum, which was buried by an eruption from nearby Mt Vesuvius near Naples in AD79.
Specialists involved in the Herculaneum Conservation Project excavating the ancient drains of the city have uncovered the largest deposit of organic material ever found in the Roman world.
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your poo: The British team sifts through piles of the ancient excrement
Tons of excrement has been sifted through by the historians as they search out clues about the diet and health of the ancient Romans that lived in the city before suffering their horrific fate.
The research has revealed a wealth of information about the types of food eaten by ordinary, lower-class, Romans, showing they feasted on sea urchins and dormice as well as fish, figs, olives and eggs.
Herculaneum and the perhaps better known nearby town of Pompeii have provided a fascinating insight in to life 2,000 years ago and amongst past other finds are dozens of perfectly preserved skeletons.
In all 774 sacks of human waste - enough to fill a lorry - have been excavated from the drains but so far only ten per cent has been sifted and there are more than 7,000kg left to go through.
Project director professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill said: 'Sifting through tons of poo may not be everyone's idea of enjoyment but to us its fascinating and we have discovered so much.
'It is the largest and fullest collection of ancient Roman waste ever excavated and it is actually very interesting to look at. In the past archaeologists would throw it away because they didn't have the technology that we have today.

Bounty: The 2000-year-old sewer has so far yielded 774 sacks of human waste and and there are another eight tons left
'In essence It's passed through a series of sieves each one getting smaller and smaller and then the finest particles left are examined through a microscope.
'At first we find bones and then after that we get down to pips, seeds and at the last level there are bacteria but I hasten to add it's not dangerous as it is composted.'

Professor Wallace-Hadrill added: 'We can find out such a lot about what Romans ate by sifting through the poo and in essence it is the classic Mediterranean Diet, plenty of fish and fruit.
'We have a good idea of what the rich ate but we have a lesser idea of what the poor ordinary Roman ate and this study will hopefully tell us that and for example what spices they used. '

Project manager Jane Thompson said: 'Studying this waste and linking it to the inhabitants or workers in the buildings above is allowing us to learn more about their lives, the types of food people ate and the work they did.'
They added: 'We have only scratched the surface and have hundreds of bags left to go through and are offering people the chance to come and help us sieve through the poo and help us in the project.'
