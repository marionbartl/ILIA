A large number of jobs have been created for African countries through China-Africa cooperation, which has promoted local economic growth, helped the maintenance of political and social stability in related countries, and reduced the emergence of refugees and immigrants and their disorderly flow.
Planning is only a small part of the work, and what counts more is its implementation. Since the holding of FOCAC Johannesburg Summit in December, 2015, China and Ethiopia have been working to match up their development strategies to implement the ten cooperation plans proposed by President Xi Jinping for China-China cooperation, which will help Ethiopia onto China's train of development, and the fast train of economic globalization.

Donald Trump and Kellyanne Conway at a dinner on Jan. 19 in Washington, DC. Evan Vucci / AP ID: 10532991
The internet was abuzz Tuesday with a rumor that Donald Trump had unfollowed his controversial senior advisor Kellyanne Conway on Twitter.
The only problem is, Trump has never followed Kellyanne Conway on Twitter — until late Tuesday.
Throughout much of the election season, Trump famously only followed around 41 Twitter accounts. The accounts were well documented, with multiple news outlets listing and profiling the people Trump followed.
The number of people Trump followed did occasionally fluctuate. In October of 2015, he was reportedly following 44 accounts. And in January, Trump briefly made headlines for following, then quickly unfollowing, the account @EmergencyKittens — which true to its name posts pictures cats.
But at no point throughout the election did anyone document Trump following Conway. The fact that Trump didn't follow Conway was noted by at least one Twitter user back in November.
I was trying to figure out who Trump unfollowed to get from 41 to 40 and in the process discovered he doesn't follow Kellyanne Conway. — PJ Vogt (@PJVogt) ID: 10532938
No one has been able to show evidence — screen shots, news stories, etc. — that the official @realdonaldtrump and @POTUS accounts had followed then unfollowed Conway.
Nevertheless, numerous people — including many with verified accounts — tweeted Tuesday that Trump had unfollowed Conway. Many of those tweets racked up hundreds or thousands of retweets.
So @realDonaldTrump, @POTUS and @WhiteHouse have all unfollowed @KellyannePolls. — Brian Scully (@brianscully) ID: 10532927
Donald Trump just unfollowed Kellyanne Conway on Twitter, which is the 2017 version of removing her from his Top 8 on Myspace. Uh oh 💔 — RickyFTW (@rickyftw) ID: 10532931
Coincidentally or not, the rumor that Trump unfollowed Conway took off the same day she found herself in hot water after her account thanked and retweeted a white nationalist. Conway claimed she didn't know who was responsible for the retweet, and then deleted it.
In the end, though, the rumors seem to have had an effect. As Twitter buzzed Tuesday with misinformation, Trump and the official @POTUS account actually followed Conway and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.

A Findlay city school official says the district needs to be more aggressive in attracting students to the school system. The Courier reports board President Shane Pochard said Findlay needs to be, “more aggressive as a district as far as how we go after kids, either to keep them or to go get them. And I'm going to use the R-word: We need to recruit.”
Findlay lost a net amount of around 180 students to open enrollment this school year. That also means the district lost state aid for around 180 students.
Pochard said there is no reason for a child to leave the district. He said Findlay excels in fine arts, athletic facilities, and academic offerings.

“Everybody must know that this government is not a people's government,” she said. “It came by force and if they see people doing things in peace, they are not happy.”
“He called me and I obliged. He was telling me what happened was wrong, he was misinformed,” said Mujuru in an interview with the Voice of America (VOA).
According to the report, Mujuru said she felt vindicated after her “constant denials of plotting to overthrow Mugabe, were ignored by the then president and his wife, Grace, who initiated the calls for her ouster”.
“You know for a start, I told him (Mugabe) that they were not … it wasn't me…Its people who are after Mugabe who you know are doing all these things. And it has, I've, I've been vindicated by what I said to him,” Mujuru said, according to the VOA report.
Then President and VP ... Mugabe and Mujuru
“I forgave him a long time ago, including the, the wife.”
“They (Mugabe, his wife Grace) were tricked, and mind you the same people who are now in control are the very same people who went and tricked Mugabe,” said Mujuru, in apparent reference president Emmerson Mnangagwa.
“So, they knew what they wanted to do – they wanted me out of the way first, so that they will be able to get to Mugabe easily,” she said.
According to the VOA, Mujuru said “she was happy to find Mugabe in good spirits”.
“He was very happy, I think he's resting, he's doing fine. I was very happy to see him in that mood,” she said.
Mujuru said she didn't think her former boss was still under house arrest.
“No, not house arrest as such,” she said. “Of course, being a former president he should have people who guard him such as soldiers, they could be soldiers and policemen all included, because that is how he used to move, even when he was still head of state.”
“Now that he is in this predicament, aaah, we were actually laughing, you know, I just said to him, ah, you know what, when you are in this situation people desert (you), and he said yes, even relatives have deserted.”
According to the VOA, Mujuru blames the new government for the Thursday attack which resulted in her and several of her members, seeking treatment at local hospitals adding that she was “not sure who attacked her or with what, but that the attackers included soldiers”.
“Everybody must know that this government is not a people's government,” she said. “It came by force and if they see people doing things in peace, they are not happy.”
COMMENT - I believe Joice Mujuru's account. I think it is highly telling that all of a sudden the British government doesn't talk abut Gukurahandi anymore, or that certain Ministers are making anti-landreform noises. This is an attack on the people of Zimbabwe by neoliberalism taking over both parties, like they do everywhere else (US, UK, etc.). This is anti-democratic and cheating. This is a hostile act. This is spiking the process to cheat the electorate out of their policies and candidates. This also shows the benefits of having 2 vice presidents.IN what some say could explain the Thursday attack on Joice Mujuru, it has emerged that the former Vice President recently reconnected with ousted former president Robert Mugabe.Sources told New Zimbabwe that Mujuru reconnected with Mugabe on Tuesday adding that there were prospects that she could come together with fired Zanu PF members to form an alliance ahead of the 2018 elections.According to the National People's Party leader, she was “called” byas

WASHINGTON -- On January 20, hours after her father took the oath of office, Ivanka Trump took in a private moment with her family in the White House residence for the first time. The inauguration this year fell on a Friday, and before making an exception to go out that night to celebrate, the Jewish first daughter and her husband, Jared Kushner, were intent to mark the Sabbath.
They did so in the Lincoln Bedroom, lighting Shabbat candles in Donald Trump's latest home– and in doing so marked the first time this religious act was performed on White House grounds. It was a clarifying personal moment for Ivanka, in which she realized the significance of her role ahead as a public figure and, months later, as a formal adviser to the president of the United States.
from sharing some of her Jewish traditions publicly
At the heart of America's sensational political drama, of shifting power dynamics in the Middle East, of battles over refugee resettlement and debate over moral leadership in a nation divided on race, these two figures hold positions of extraordinary power and influence– an unfireable pair of advisers entrusted by the president more than any other.They are not natural public servants. Neither Ivanka nor Jared sought roles in government, and as a couple, they constantly evaluate whether to stick around Washington by the president's side. But so long as they remain, they will continue to advise Trump on every policy issue of consequence to this administration, both foreign and domestic.For Ivanka, that means offering her father radically honest advice– the sort of counsel he is unlikely to receive from outside hires who fear his infamous wrath. She is vocal on a range of issues, aggravating several senior White House aides. But those who disagree with her tend not to last long in Trump's administration. Her portfolio squarely focuses on workforce development, specifically on reducing the skills gap, empowering women and combating human trafficking.Jared, meanwhile, leads the administration's effort to restart negotiations toward a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians– a tall order, made taller perhaps by his strategy of orchestrating a broader regional peace between the Jewish state and the Arab world. All the while he is tasked with tackling criminal justice reform and an expanding national opioid crisis, running the administration's new Office of American Innovation, and advising the president on the daily political crises that pass before his desk.Both native New Yorkers, their move to Washington was a difficult one. But the couple retained many of their personal family traditions. Those moments they wind down in their Kalorama home, with their three kids in pajamas, have become their respite– and for the devout couple, Judaism is often the force in their lives providing these moments of quiet removal from the city's constant chaos.As a rule, the immediate tribe has Shabbat dinner together every Friday. Jared and Ivanka log off for the night wherever they may be– in New York, at the family home in New Jersey or in Washington.While observing the High Holy Days this year, they plan to share some of their religious life with the country, understanding that some Jewish traditions remain unfamiliar to many. But Ivanka has struggled with the extent to which she should open up about her personal Jewish experience, and it has proven a balancing act for her. She seldom discusses details of her decision to convert upon marriage in 2009 on the belief it was a sacred, deeply personal choice.Nevertheless, she has not shied awayby posting of holiday preparations on social media and of her visits to Jewish sites in Israel and Europe. One of the most meaningful moments of her father's presidency thus far was her visit to the Western Wall in May– a trip that was orchestrated by her husband.After touring the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin last spring, she spoke on record of politics, telling one journalist that accepting refugees into the US should be "part of the equation" in her father's quest to end a global humanitarian crisis emanating from Syria. She continues to privately express her views on refugee policy, although it is not a formal part of her portfolio.But perhaps most important to the American Jewish community has been their response to a rising tide of antisemitism nationwide, measured both in rhetoric and in deed, and so often tied to the political rise of her father.In their first six months as presidential advisers, Ivanka and Jared led a resistance within the West Wing against figures aligned with this movement– those they considered too far right of the American political consensus. They won that battle, pushing out two of their most controversial opponents, Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka of Breitbart News.Their suspicions of these figures were only reaffirmed in their minds by the epithets thrown against them: New Yorkers, secret Democrats, liberal elites and globalists, all tropes long associated with antisemitic slander. Their power comes in part from their familial ties, but their success against alt-Right nationalist figures in the White House also demonstrates a political adeptness learned rather quickly on the job, for outsiders new to the bloodsport of politics.Ivanka was the first White House figure to publicly and specifically condemn the hate groups behind a white power rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last month, which turned violent, and which quickly became a seminal moment in her father's presidency when he seemed to equate the marching neo-Nazis with the groups in their crosshairs."There should be no place in society for racism, white supremacy and neo-Nazis," Ivanka wrote at the time on Twitter.Jared has been less visible and vocal, offering precious few public appearances and interviews. But he too was reportedly displeased by Trump's response to Charlottesville, and with Trump's continued association with groups defined by racist causes.No matter the crisis that surrounds this president, Ivanka and Jared have made a choice to express their indignation and disapproval quietly, ensuring they maintain Trump's trust whilst pushing him toward their preferred path of moderation. It is Jared's tactic, as well, in the Middle East peace process, as he works to build trust amongst the parties and with Israeli and Palestinian leadership himself."Anyone that knows the president understands that he takes great pride in having a Jewish daughter and Jewish grandchildren," Jared said at the start of a conference call last week with Jewish leaders marking the High Holy Days. "His love and respect for the Jewish people extends way beyond his family, and into the heart of Jewish American communities.""Under the President's leadership," he continued, "America's relationship with the State of Israel has never been stronger. And our country's commitment to Israel's security has never been greater."

— Following the Wednesday morning shooting at a park in Alexandria, Va., many are left questioning how quickly political passion can turn violent.
Psychotherapist Ronda Bean, who is not connected with the case, said attackers do not simply snap and go on shooting rampages. Instead, she says, it happens slowly over time, leaving a trail of clues.
“There were lots of red flags and lots of warning signs,” she said. “He clearly was explosive and angry in his Facebook posts.”
The alleged gunman in Alexandria, 66-year-old James Hodgkinson, often posted online about his political anger. He was reportedly a member of a Facebook group called “Terminate the Republican Party.”
“His comments have an element to them that are kind of over the line, but again, that in and of itself, by itself, doesn't indicate anything,” Bean said.
But, Bean said the comments paint a different picture when added to his run-ins with the law and reports of past aggression with neighbors.
“You start to tease out, is there the indication that this person wishes to harm,” she said.
In 2015, the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security published a study on homegrown extremism. A key finding was that law enforcement said anti-government violent extremists are the greatest threat of political violence.
“There are lots of pieces, but nobody is communicating,” Bean said.
Bean said that most people don't want to involve themselves in another person's business. In the end, they must go with their gut feeling about behavior that might be potentially dangerous.
“You have to use your own judgment about what is appropriate intervention and what is appropriate to do,” she said.
Law enforcement officers always urge people to speak up if they see something suspicious.

The 51-year-old actor, who is one of the highest-paid actors in Bollywood, said he is the same lower middle class boy, who still believes he got more than what he desired.
"(Money) never did and it never will. I am well to do and God has been kind to me in every aspect of my life - professionally, economically and financially and more than that emotionally I have never ever done anything for the love of money.
"I say this from the point of view of a lower middle class boy, who has had much more than he had imagined or dreamt of in the wildest of dreams. People may think I am an entrepreneur, but I have never done anything for the liking or love of money. I do things because I love doing them," Shah Rukh told reporters here at the launch press conference of his upcoming show "TEDTalks India - Nayi Soch".
The actor said youngsters today must understand that money is the least important thing that should drive them towards their goals.
"I would say this to every youngster that if you desire to do something one of the things that we surely follow is money but (I think) it is the least important gaps that we try to fill in when we try to do something as work, job or love and hobby."
Shah Rukh said he is excited about the upcoming inspirational talk show and hopes people will connect with it as much as he does.
"I did TED Talks is perhaps the closest things to my heart I am not saying this because Uday Shankar and Gaurav are friends or Chris as they are good to me I say it genuinely. I hope people also love it as much as I do. It is important for me that this gets loved by everyone," he said. With Pti inputs.

MIAMI (CBSMiami) – The blockbuster trade that sends reigning National League MVP Giancarlo Stanton to the New York Yankees is now official.
The Miami Marlins shipped Stanton and his massive contract to the Bronx Bombers in exchange for infielder Starlin Castro and a pair of minor leaguers; RHP Jorge Guzman and infielder Jose Devers.
The deal was locked in on Monday as Stanton officially waived his no-trade clause.
Stanton has 10 years and $295 million remaining on his contract, the majority of which will be paid by the Yankees should the slugger remain with the team through the team of the deal.
Additionally, the Marlins will send New York $30 million if Stanton decides not to opt-out of his contract following the 2020 season.
Stanton, 28, led the majors last season with 59 home runs and 132 RBIs.
He was an All-Star last year, as was Castro for the Yankees.
The Marlins are expected to trade Castro sometime this offseason as the team is looking to bring its payroll down to around $90 million.
Castro hit .300 with 16 home runs and 63 RBIs last season.
Guzman was 5-3 with a 2.30 ERA in Class A Staten Island last year while Devers hit a combined .245 in the Dominican Summer League and rookie Gulf Coast League, adding one home run, 16 RBIs and 16 stolen bases.
The Yankees are expected to introduce Stanton during a press conference Monday afternoon.
The National Basketball Association's Development League (D-League) will be known as the G-League for the 2017-2018 season because it is being sponsored by the sports drink company Gatorade.
Founded in 2001 as a league to develop NBA talent, the D-League will have 25 teams in the 2017-2018 season: 40% of current NBA players have spent time in the D-League.
The Gatorade Sports Science Institute (GSSI) intends to work with players in the league on player nutrition and training, according to a statement released on Feb. 14 by the NBA Development League.
“As one of the most iconic brands in the world and a founding partner of the NBA Development League, Gatorade PEP, +0.38% is an ideal fit for this first-of-its-kind partnership,” said Mark Tatum, NBA deputy commissioner and chief operating officer.
The G-League's logo will include Gatorade's logo:

Not only is the D-League — er, G-League — cashing in from sponsors, but even NBA teams will be featuring advertisers' logos in a new place next season: team jerseys. For the first time next season, NBA jerseys will have advertisements on them from such brands as GE and Blue Diamond almonds.

Namibia Says Revised Mining Act to Be Finalized by Year-End
Namibia will finalize revisions to its mining act by the end of the year, Mines Minister Tom Alweendo told a conference Tuesday in the capital, Windhoek.
The revisions under consideration include policies on environmental and social responsibility and ensuring the “legislation is sufficiently attractive to inspire new investment,” Alweendo said.
The country's mining sector is currently governed mainly by the Minerals (Prospecting and Mining) Act of 1992, which is under review, and the Diamond Act of 1999.
Earlier this month President Hage Geingob scrapped a clause that proposed all businesses be at least a quarter owned by “racially disadvantaged people.”
MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — Newly-released video captures the harrowing attempted kidnapping of a Twin Cities woman in a small Washington County town last April.
Michael Harker was on parole from Idaho for felony strangulation last April when a surveillance video caught him circling the streets of Willernie.
A woman is seen smoking a cigarette outside a Domino's Pizza. The van stops and parks across the street. Harker then walks up to the woman, grabs her and forces her across the street towards his van.
“I heard screaming and I thought it was kids playing,” said neighbor Cindy Vadnais.
She then drove a half block to investigate.
“She ran out in front of my car screaming, ‘He's trying to get me into the van! He is trying to kidnap me!'” Vadnais said.
The video shows Vadnais's dark truck trying to block the white van's escape.
“I just thought, ‘That son of a gun, I'm not going to let him go,'” Vadnais said. “But he had enough room to escape. I could not believe it.”
As Harker drove off, the victim and Vadnais were able to get two key bits of information. The victim got a partial license plate — but Vadnais got something more important.
“I got his last name off of his sign on his van,” she said.
Vadnais followed the van for a few blocks, but returned to help the victim.
“She was just hysterical,” Vadnais said.
Harker was arrested two days later. Vadnais and the victim have since become friends.
“It still really haunts her,” Vadnais said.
She insists she did nothing special.
“I didn't even have time to be scared … I was madder,” Vadnais said. “No, I'm not a hero. Anyone would do the same thing. I would do it again.”
Harker pleaded guilty to the attempted kidnapping, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) — The Minnesota Vikings haven't had a player with 1,000 yards receiving since Brett Favre's sensational season in 2009.
Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielen are on track this year to give them two.
A deep track.
Making difficult catches in tight sideline coverage or breaking open underneath the secondary, Diggs and Thielen have emerged as one of the NFL's best wide receiver tandems. Diggs leads the league with 391 yards and Thielen is third with 358 yards, sandwiching Pittsburgh's three-time All-Pro Antonio Brown .
“If both of those guys are singled there's a good chance I'm probably going to throw it their way,” quarterback Sam Bradford said, “just because I do feel very confident they're going to go out and get it.”
The Vikings have completed nine passes of 30-plus yards in four games, a pace that would double last season's total of 18. They had 53 successful throws that covered at least 20 yards last year, and they're already at 21 through the first quarter of the 2017 schedule.
With an offensive line contributing vastly improved pass protection and a productive running game forcing defenses to honor play-action fakes, the Vikings have so far displayed a dynamic, creative, versatile attack under offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur in his first full season at the play-calling helm.
“When we have an opportunity, we've got to make the most of them,” Thielen said. “Because we don't know when we're going to have those shots and when they're going to come up.”
Bradford, who has missed the last three games because of a left knee injury, set the NFL record for completion percentage last year out of necessity behind a struggling offensive line. The running attack was nonexistent, too. Going deep was hardly possible, even if Diggs and Thielen had the ability to turn such play calls into momentum-changing completions.
Related: Bradford Back At Practice, But Status For Bears Game Unclear
“Pat's just drawing it up, what he sees and what he likes. He's letting Adam do some great things. Adam's got some great hands. He runs some great routes,” Diggs said. “So I just feel like it happened organically.”
Don't get too comfortable, Cris Carter and Randy Moss. Diggs and Thielen have begun to push their way toward the top of some of the lists of the franchise's all-time leaders.
Sidney Rice was the last 1,000-yard receiver in purple, in 2009. Before that, Moss in 2003 completed a streak of 11 straight seasons with at least one. Seven of those featured two: Carter and Jake Reed each year from 1994-97, and Carter and Moss from 1998-2000.
The primary difference with Diggs and Thielen — both a bit undersized by NFL standards — is that they had to work harder to reach this status. Diggs was a fifth-round draft pick out of Maryland in 2015 and a healthy scratch the first three games of his career. Thielen famously signed out of an undrafted tryout camp in 2013, spent a season on the practice squad and another couple of years primarily on special teams until his breakout in 2016.
But they're both exceptional route runners, with an ability to line up inside or outside and make a shallow cross or a deep post work whenever the situation calls for it. With Brown as an example, the league has seen more and more versatile wide receivers who can confuse and confound defenses by moving all over the formation rather than being limited to either the outside or the slot.
“When a quarterback is in trouble, they'll come down with the ball,” said wide receiver Michael Floyd, who's coming off a four-game suspension and set to join the Vikings as another dangerous down-field option when they play at Chicago on Monday. “That's expected in our room.”
Diggs broke out ahead of Thielen, but he said he's looked up to his teammate as an example of precise route-runner. Shurmur likened Thielen to an outfielder in baseball for his ability to judge the ball and adjust to it in flight for a catch even if he hasn't separated himself from the defender. Both Diggs and Thielen have a keen sense for how to bend a route away from a cornerback to make an interception impossible and a difficult reception look routine. Diggs in particular has a reputation among the Vikings defense for being relentlessly competitive.
“He won't ever stop. He catches a ball in practice, he'll run all the way to the end zone,” cornerback Xavier Rhodes said.
The key for the Vikings will now be to keep up this deep passing game with the loss of running back Dalvin Cook, whose early success was setting up those play-action fakes.
“But also, it's part of what they do now,” Detroit coach Jim Caldwell said last week, before his team beat the Vikings 14-7. “Before they had been getting the ball out fairly quickly, intermediate passes and those kinds of things, and occasionally down the field. Well now they're attacking down the field with that real strong running game, so that's what's made the difference. Those guys are running really good routes, catching the ball well.”

On Being A Mother
The actress told the daily, "So you see, the day is fully packed. And mine is a 27-hour long day. My kids are very noisy, making me run around the house [all the time] and not letting me work. But, I've never known patience the way I have it today. I'm surprised and amazed. We've become kids with our kids."
Kashmira Loves Baby Talking
"We (actor Krushna Abhishek and she) used to find other parents irritating when they would do the baby talk or show their baby's pictures to everyone around them all the time. I'm one of those irritating parents now."
She Balances Work & Motherhood
"In fact, if anything, I want to work harder because I want my kids to know that their mum is a director, a fighter, a survivor! They should know that I have made a name in this industry with no backing. I want them to be proud of me and everything that I've done, so I am striving each day to do good roles and make better films."
Breaking The Stereotype
"Everywhere in TV and films, actors who become mothers, are treated differently. Suddenly, people will be like, ‘Oh, she's a mom, so she can't play a sex symbol role."
Kashmira Is Proud Of These Actresses
"But I feel that actors like Kareena Kapoor Khan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have changed this notion. [The late] Sridevi changed it years ago. So, I think slowly, the women of this industry are changing the norms and I'm proud to be one of them."
Parody/spoof movies are not seen quite often in South Indian cinema as it would offend either the celebrities or fans of star actors. While most of the makers do not wish to take the risky gamble, one movie emerged successful by breaking all the myths associated with the parody movies. Tamizh Padam, a 2010 blockbuster, made way for new style of movie making in Tamil, as the movie mocked at almost all stars of K-town but in an artistic manner.
Tamizh Padam won over the audience and critics and the same was later remade in Telugu as Sudigaadu. Fans of Kollywood were excited over the weekend as the sequel to one of the most entertaining movies of Tamil cinema was launched. Actor Sidharth too was proactive in the process of launching the movie and there were quite a few tweet exchanges between the producer and the actor.
The information poster of the movie was released in social media which made the fans and celebrities' jaw drop and speak about the same for the next couple of days. The poster carried out the release date of the movie in theatres as 25th May 2018 and also the release date of the movie in Tamil Rockers website as 26th May 2018. This was indeed surprising as piracy is generally seen as a threat by the industry. It now seems that piracy has grown its roots and seems to be unavoidable.
The first look poster of Tamizh Padam 2.0 was also released over the weekend where the leading star of the movie, Agila Ulaga Superstar Mirchi Shiva, will be seen in white 'veshti' and shirt meditating on the ground. This is a clear imitation of a popular Tamil Nadu politician and the first look poster just went viral within few seconds. This shows that the movie will have political inclinations and sequences mocking the recent political developments in the state.
Rumours are ripe that the combo of Vikram Vedha, Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi would be reprising the same roles in Tamizh Padam 2.0 but as cameos.
The movie features Mirchi Shiva and Ishwarya Menon in the lead roles while the same is directed by CS Amudan. The project will be bankrolled by Sashikanth Shivaji, who is also the producer of Tamizh Padam.

SANTA CLARA
The whole sweep of the afternoon at Levi's Stadium felt like the final day of school, except that nobody seemed to know for sure if either their principal or their favorite teacher was coming back in the fall.
Also, there was a blown 11-point lead by the 49ers. Plus a tight end who broke his leg in warmups. Plus a bizarre pregame radio interview where 49ers general manager Trent Baalke heartily endorsed his own firing. Plus a 25-23 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Plus a postgame news conference where head coach Chip Kelly said he didn't know anything about his own widely reported firing because owner Jed York had not yet met with him or mentioned anything about it during a Saturday night phone conversation between the two men.
But what was the tone of that conversation, a reporter wondered?
“It was monotone,” Kelly answered. “Is there any other kind of tone?”
Well, yes. There is a judgmental and critical tone, which apparently was the tone of the conversation between York and Kelly an hour or so later when York did tell Kelly he was, in fact, out of a job.
And there is an exasperated tone, which is the tone that followers of the 49ers have heard buzzing around in their heads since, oh, mid-September.
And now? Well, now the entire organization is being tossed into the NFL void for days or weeks, with no designated supreme football leader to supervise scouting or the college draft–and after Kelly's dismissal, must compete for the best replacement candidates with the five other teams who have head coaching vacancies.
Meanwhile, starting quarterback Colin Kaepernick is in semi-limbo and not sure if he wants to return. The other 49ers players await their fourth head coach in four seasons. And fans remain angry enough to have paid for yet another airplane banner that was towed above Levi's Stadium on Sunday, a banner that still harped on York for his outplacement of Jim Harbaugh back in 2014.
Happy New Year, everybody!
“I have informed Trent and Chip of my decision to pursue new leadership for our football team,” York said in a media release issued roughly two hours following Sunday's game.
York then explained: “The performance of this team has not lived up to my expectations or those of our fans, and that is truly disappointing. We all expected to see this team progress and develop as the season went on, but unfortunately that did not happen. That is why now is the time to find a new direction for this team.”
York promised to outline that new direction at a 10 a.m. news conference Monday. He might begin by directionally apologizing for the continued mess that he created over the past two seasons by directionally failing–twice–to replace Harbaugh with a coach who could win and directionally supporting a Baalke-led system that led to a misaligned roster and no consistent draft success.
A year ago, after firing Jim Tomsula as Harbaugh's first replacement, York did in fact say he was sorry and was contrite about making that mistake. But then came the hiring of Kelly, who had been a winner elsewhere but with the 49ers produced a frustrating team that consistently blew first half leads–10 times, to be exact–and finished with a 2-14 record. Some believed that Kelly was hindered by the roster Baalke provided him as well as season-ending injuries to key players and freaky stuff such as the busted leg suffered by backup tight end Je'Ron Hamm during pregame drills Sunday.
There might be a grain of truth to all that. But would it have been so difficult for Kelly to just maintain five of those 10 first half leads and wind up with a 7-9 record?
Kelly answered that question himself in his postgame remarks, saying: “It's a bottom line business. We probably didn't win enough games.”
Baalke, a few hours earlier, had told radio station KNBR in his paid pregame appearance that he understood why he had been terminated and even termed it “was the right thing do do.” He endorsed an entire organizational reboot, saying he was “a big fan” of that philosophy because “sometimes, you need to reset the culture.” Baalke also called the 49ers “a class organization” for the way they dumped him.
Translation: Baalke must have received a very healthy severance and contract settlement. Kelly is also owed more than $10 million on his deal and the 49ers still are paying Tomsula. So you can't accuse the Yorks of being afraid to eat up their large Levi's profits in pursuit of better things.
On the other hand, it is unclear what quarterback Colin Kaepernick might do next. He concluded his own tumultuous season with a decent-but-not-spectacular performance (17 completions in 22 attempts for 215 yards and one touchdown, but five sacks). Kaepernick, who gained as much attention for his national anthem protest of Kaeper-kneeling, has a contract that allows him to opt out for the 2017 season and become a free agent. He would not commit to any decision Sunday but said he had “a great appreciation” for the 49ers organization and York.
“A lot of things to think about moving forward,” Kaepernick said. “We'll see where this goes.”
We all know here it should go. York needs to appoint the best football mind possible to the GM position, someone who can be a good roster architect rather than just a guy with a stopwatch, which is what Baalke often appeared to be. He did identify some good talent over his 11 years with the franchise. But he also missed more frequently in recent drafts and did not construct a team with depth or parts that meshed well. The new general manager must then also find a head coach who fits the architecture. Finally, the new GM must communicate with the team's fans and customers in a way that produces optimism rather than the dour near-silence favored by Baalke.
Sunday was a weird and awkward day, one that ended with players leaving the building uncertain of their head coach's status and wondering what sort of tone would greet them the next time they showed up at work. The suggestion here: Any tone except the rotten music we heard and witnessed this season.

A labor standards office in Tokyo, Japan, released details this week about what led to the death of a 31-year-old reporter, revealing that the woman died from overwork.
Miwa Sado, who worked for public broadcasting company NHK, logged 159 hours of overtime and had only taken off two days in the month prior to her death from heart failure in July 2013. Labor inspectors determined that Sado's death was caused by karoshi, a Japanese term that means ‘death from overwork.'

Though the local labor standards office concluded in its case in May 2014, the details were not made public until Wednesday, Japan Times reported.
Sado reported on the Tokyo Metropolitan Government for NHK, and, between June and July of 2013, she covered the Assembly and House of Councilors election, the Times reported. She died on July 24, three days after the Upper House election. Sado had been with the broadcasting company since 2005.

In a statement, NHK executives revealed they kept track of her working hours through personal statements and time cards but acknowledged there were areas requiring improvement.
Masahiko Yamauchi, senior official at NHK's news department, said the incident was not a personal matter but a “problem for our organization as a whole, including the labor system and how elections are covered.”

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration has sought to make improvements to working conditions in the country following the suicide of a new employee at advertising giant Dentsu Inc. in 2015, which some believe was due to excessive working hours.
Yamauchi said NHK waited four years to share the details of Sado's death due to her family's wishes. Her family said, in a written statement, they wanted to ensure such an incident never happens again.
“Even today, four years after, we cannot accept our daughter's death as a reality,” Sado's parents said in a comment released by NHK. “We hope that the sorrow of the bereaved family will never be wasted.”

Mothers with depression who receive therapy pass the benefits of treatment to their children in a number of ways, say researchers.
One mother involved in the study, Laianna Baker, says that she could barely make it out of bed some mornings. Feeling lonely and depressed, she found it hard to perform everyday tasks, including taking care of her newborn.
“How do I start my day? Nobody was there for me. Lots of unresolved issues,” Baker remembers.
But it wasn't just the 21-year-old who was suffering. “When I'm sad, not in my element, he feels it,” says the mother of Corey, now 18 months. “He's more agitated, he keeps falling down to the ground, he whines and cries more.”
Shortly after her son's birth, Baker started therapy at the Mt. Hope Family Center in Rochester, New York. She's been receiving interpersonal psychotherapy there, learning how to cope, and to look for something that will lift her up.
“When I feel low I play with my kid, watch movies—just do things that clear the stress that I have off my mind,” Baker says. Sometimes, she wrestles with Corey on the ground. He loves it. She feels better.
Scientific research backs her up.
Toddler attachment
The study in Development and Psychopathology concludes that mothers who receive interpersonal psychotherapy after showing signs of major depression fare significantly better than the control group, which received just community referrals.
“It's a cascading effect for the family.”
The mothers weren't the only ones to benefit—their children did, too. The moms become better at parenting—and their children improved across a host of important developmental measures.
Lessening the mothers' depression, researchers discovered, meant improved attachment security for their toddlers. Overall, the researchers found that post-treatment the moms in the study became better at reading and understanding their toddler's temperament, essentially making them better parents, while the toddlers became less fussy and angry, making them easier to parent.
“It's a cascading effect for the family,” says lead researcher Elizabeth Handley, research associate and assistant professor at the Mt. Hope Family Center.
Interpersonal psychotherapy is a time-limited therapy that focuses on resolving interpersonal issues and the symptomatic recovery of the patient. The therapy is highly structured and lasts just 12 to 16 weeks.
Using a randomized controlled trial of 125 mothers, each paired with her own child, the study looked at reduced maternal depression after psychotherapy and its effect on the children. Study subjects were low-income moms with an average age of 25. The children's mean age was 13 months at the start of the study. More than half of the mothers, 54.4 percent, were African American.
The current research builds on a 2013 University of Rochester study of moms representing similar demographics, which concluded that screening for depression and providing short-term, relationship-focused therapy can relieve their depression, even in the face of poverty and personal histories of abuse or violence.
Why treatment pays off
According to Handley, part of the improvement is a result of shifting the mother's vantage point. Moms who view their kids as difficult tend to engage in harsher forms of parenting, she says, which down the road can lead to more problematic behavior in the children.
“If you can change the moms' lens in the way that they see their children, then you can set the kids off on a more positive trajectory,” says Handley. “Rose-colored lenses are preferable to gray ones, because a positive perception of their children is actually predictive of better outcomes later in life.”
Prior research shows that children of depressed mothers are at greater risk for a variety of developmental problems, and establishing a secure attachment relationship with a parent is a critical developmental milestone during the early years of life.
“An insecure attachment relationship is associated with a whole host of negative outcomes,” Handley says. One of the most critical aspects of development within a child's first year, a healthy attachment makes it possible for children to cope with stressful situations.
“They know mom as a secure base from where to explore the world. Without that secure attachment toddlers are more likely to be aggressive, to have conduct problems, and a whole array of negative mental health outcomes.”
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a significant health concern in the US, with 13 to 16 percent of the general populace experiencing an episode during their lifetime. Generally, women are more likely to suffer from depression, with the highest rates occurring among women of childbearing age and during the child-raising years. For economically-disadvantaged mothers the likelihood of depression jumps to one in four moms.
Feeling better, parenting better
Besides finding a way to head off likely problems for the children in later life, there is also a personal component, says Handley, herself a mother of two daughters, ages one and five.
“Seeing the depression alleviated and seeing moms be more sensitive with their children, more responsive, less impatient and harsh—and seeing the kids respond more positively to their moms, well, that's the warm and fuzzy of it.”
To Baker, it means an achievement that she's clearly proud of: “Good mother, good person. It's good Laianna all over again.”
“I take care of my child, I now have a better job, an apartment, a car,” she says. “I take care of my responsibilities. He changed me.”
Wiping away tears, Baker adds quietly, “I don't think I was raised right. But I want to do right with him.”

'There Is A Sense Of Blessing'
Q. How does it feel after your film ‘Padmaavat' has become a success?
A. It is very different this time because I've had film releases before. I've had successful performances and successful films, performances that people have appreciated but somehow this time, it's a completely different energy that I am feeling. Of course, people are appreciating the film and the performance and all of that but there is a sense of blessing; a very spiritual experience that I feel this time.
'A Lot Of Characters That You Play Impact Your Life In A Powerful Way'
Q. How easy or difficult was it for you to leave behind a character like Padmavati which has taken such a lot from you personally and start afresh with a new character when you move on to your next?
A. It's easy because I have to do it. But at the same time, it is hard because and especially, characters like these which are so powerful and a performance which has literally come from my gut and I had said this six months ago when I was promoting the film that they don't leave... if you ask me to do a scene from ‘Piku' today or if you ask me to play Veronica again, I think it would very easily come back to me. I don't think it would take me very long to get into that space again because a lot of these characters that you play impact your life in such a powerful way that they actually just don't ever leave and this one is most definitely.
'Padmavati Was A Warrior In A Completely Different Way'
Q. You are a very opinionated person. We have seen you speak about issues that are close to your heart from time to time. But while playing Padmavati, there were certain things that are even now being talked about like how she had sought approval of her husband to commit the final act of ‘Jauhar'. So at that point in time, did your sensibility conflict with that of Padmavati or were you so much in character that you went with the flow?
A. As an actor, you find meaning in what you do and for me, there is a reference for this character. Now whether it is true or untrue, historic or not historic, that's a separate conversation but the fact that it is based on a poem and one could sort of envisage what she would be like, you also have to look at these situations in context to when these situations happened. That was the 12th or 13th century, Today would I take permission? No. Would I take permission to go out with my girlfriends? Most definitely not. (laughs)
But in the film, in that particular scene, in that given situation and most importantly in that particular moment, it feels like the right thing. Because it's beyond the words that are being said. It's almost poetic in a sense. If you look at ‘Jauhar' in another way, for me it is her uniting with her husband who sacrificed his life and died trying to save and protect the honour of their clan.
Now if I step away from it and look at just the act itself, it doesn't make any sense to any of us. But if I put myself back into when I was shooting the film or as the character, it feels like the absolutely right thing to do because for her it was war in a very different way. She was a warrior in a completely different way. She's not a warrior who went to the battle field and killed people in that sense or with a sword in her hand but she won a different kind of battle. In her mind, she still defeated Khilji because he went after that one thing and he still didn't get that one thing. It was her choice.
So yes, this sort of conversations, agreements, disagreements, views are very valid. I may agree with some while I may disagree with some. But it is important to view a film for the time that it was set in and view it in totality.
Q. You said that success is different for you so do you want to celebrate it in a different way or celebrate it usually like you do with the other films you've been part of?
A. I think that will come to me organically whether it should be different or not different. I've never been one to plan these things too much and I didn't plan for the feeling of this film to be different. It just happened when people saw the film and I think the same will happen when we are ready to celebrate. I think It will happen in the way it should.
'Javed Saab Told Me That He Believes That Padmaavat Is My 'Mother India' '
Q. What was the best compliment that you have received for your performance in the film ‘Padmaavat'?
A. I think it's the same one that I've been saying. The first screening that we had was for Shabana ji and Javed sahab. Sanjay sir and I were waiting outside the screening room. After they finished watching the film, they came out and Javed sahab just looked me in the eye and said - "When I think of Madhubala ji or Nargis Dutt ji, I think of at least one iconic film that they've done in their entire careers. I think of ‘Mughal-e-Azam', ‘Mother India'" and he said that he believes that ‘Padmaavat' is my ‘Mother India'.
Q. Currently you are the undisputed queen of Bollywood with seven 100 crore films. After the era of Madhuri and Sridevi, we have finally seen the next female superstar. Any reason as to why has it taken so long? Was there a lack of female oriented scripts or is it like things just have to come together?
A. Because there is a time and place for everything.
'I Hope Padmaavat Will Open Doors For Such Big Budget Films To Be Made With Female Protagonists'
Q. How does it feel to be the actress who has not only bridged but overtaken the pay gap that has existed between male and female superstars?
A. The pay is one thing. The understanding is that I had been paid a lot more than some of my male colleagues but I have never viewed it as wanting to be paid more than someone else. I think that has just been a by-product of wanting to get paid what I think I deserve to be paid. Based on my awareness of films and budgets, it's a lot of factors that come into your success, films and track record. There are a lot of things that come into play when these things are being discussed.
So I think in wanting to fight for what I thought was right for myself, I think this is sort of a by-product of that. But what I see as an even bigger achievement is the budget that was approved for this film. ‘Padmaavat' being the most expensive Indian film ever with a female protagonist is what I view as an achievement, not for myself only but for the fact that I think this will now open doors for many more of this kind of films with this kind of budgets, not to say that, in the last couple of years, there have been quite a few films on female protagonists but not of this scale.
To be able to match the scale and the budget of some of my senior male colleagues, I view that as an achievement and I am hoping that this will now open doors for many more of such big budget films to be made.
'I Have Worked Very Hard To Get To Where I Am & To Achieve Whatever Little I Have Achieved'
Q. Do you think that ‘Padmaavat' is the best film in your career?
A. I hope not because if this is the best then what's next. Not to say that I am not enjoying the phase that I'm in and not only am I grateful for everything that is coming my way but I've also worked very hard to get to where I am and to achieve whatever little I have achieved. But at the same time ,if you say that this is the best phase then I don't know what next so I hope there's a lot more in store is for me just in terms of what I'm able to do as an actor and also as a human being.
'I Was Never Afraid'
Q. How scary were the times when the death threats were made and did it make you angry?
A. I wouldn't say angry. I think I was disappointed because I feel like maybe it didn't go down in the way that it should have. I was disappointed for various reasons which now is not the right time to speak about that but never once was I afraid.
'I Respect The Fact That Swara Bhaskar Has An Opinion & I Am Nobody To Question The Fact That She Has An Opinion'
Q. Have you read Swara Bhaskar's open letter and how did you take it from your perspective of feminism? What was your reaction to it? What are you on those lines?
A. I haven't read the letter but I am aware of some of the comments that she has made based on my interaction with all of you and I think that whether I agree or disagree is irrelevant but I respect the fact that she has an opinion and I am nobody to question the fact that she has an opinion.
Whether I agree or disagree, I think it goes without saying that it's important to view films in the context of the film itself. It's important to view the film in the era that it was made. If you watched ‘Troy' or ‘300' or any of those films, I highly doubt that you would pick out one scene out of context and question that so it's very important to view it in totality and in the period that the film is being true to.
On a lighter note, she was probably out buying popcorn and maybe just missed the disclaimer.
'I Was Willing To Put Padmaavat On Hold To Fight A Much Larger Cause'
Q. With the film being based on Rani Padmavati, you have been driving this film on your own. So was there also a huge sense of responsibility all the way while shooting the film and with all the protests that were going on, were you also feeling the heat?
A. When I was shooting for the film, there were only two of the incidents which happened. I had told Sanjay sir at that point itself and considering what we just discussed about the fact that this in a way is a turning point in my career in terms of the budget, scale and now the success of the film, I was even then willing to put this on hold to fight a much larger cause and I said to him back then that something didn't feel right.
It's not that people haven't had issues with earlier films. Shabana ji's films have had issues in the past. But this to me right from the beginning just felt very different. It's not the usual disappointment or protest or anger that people have felt before with certain films. This just felt different right from the beginning. But I think everyone didn't probably view it in the way that I did.
So, I guess everything that happened later which is in the last two or three months, let me just say, that I wasn't surprised in the way that it all unfolded.
'There's Nothing To Fear When You Know You Have Done Something Right'
Q. After all of this, have you come out to be as a stronger person?
A. I honestly don't know any other way of being. I will be the first person to apologize if I've done something wrong. As a child and even today, I have never had any issues with acknowledging my weaknesses, with saying sorry if I know I've done something wrong or with just being vulnerable or accepting if you've made a mistake sometimes. But when you know you've done something right, there is nothing to fear.
'I & Ranveer Never Try To Overshadow & Outdo Each Other While Performing In A Film'
Q. You and Ranveer have worked on three films together. All three of them have done really well at the box office. Recently, Ranveer had a chat session with fans on Twitter. When he was asked whether you both would be seen together on a next project to which he replied that you're the best co-star to work with. What are your views?
A. I have to agree. I think somewhere our idea of good actors and a good co-star is the same. In this film we don't have even one scene together but when we have worked together earlier in the past, for both of us, it's very important for the other person to be very honest and true to that moment.
I think he's had a couple of experiences earlier where maybe he has worked with people who are not as giving and he's an intelligent person so he sees that. So, somewhere the fact that we both completely trust each other when we are performing, no one is trying to overshadow or outdo the other and we're only trying to better each other's performance, and he is a very special talent.
'I Can't Make A Sweeping Statement Saying, 'Those Are Not The Kind Of Films I Would Do' '
Q. Now that you have reached this stage of your career where you are the face of a film playing the lead, where you don't only bring much to the table as the actor but even more, would you be open to doing a masala multi-starrer film where the hero is the lead like a ‘Housefull'. So, would you be open going ahead or have you left that behind?
A. I wouldn't generalize it and say that I think, a lot of the kind of films that I have been a part of earlier have all contributed to something that I have learnt along the way. I might feel differently today about certain films, not about the decision at that point but like you said, moving forward, I don't know. I don't think I can make a sweeping statement saying ‘Those are not the kind of films I would do'. Because in all honesty people viewed ‘Chennai Express' also as one of those masala films not realizing that it was a really solidly driven film. I think it really boils down to what state of mind I'm in.
A lot of it is your state of mind at that point and something that I want to do today, I may not want to do tomorrow and vice versa. So, it depends on my state of mind at that point. The kind of energy I'm feeling and what do I have to put into a film and if I can make a character special. Maybe I can be a part of one of those ensemble films and make the character really special so it really depends. I have never been the one to just say no to something without knowing what the film is. I will always make an informed decision. The only film I'm doing right now is ‘Sapna Didi' as per the title in the book which will go on floors by early March.
Make informed decisions.

Roy Moore and other Republican Party “superstars” continue to display racism and ineptitude, but their extremely loyal base doesn't seem to care.
In the latest incident, the Alabama Senate-candidate, plagued by a reputation of alleged sexual misconduct with teenagers, openly declared at a campaign event that the last time America was great was during slavery.
Yeah, he said that.

The comments came during in article that ran in September in the Los Angeles Times, but went viral yesterday after Eric Columbus, a former member of the Obama administration, tweeted about it on Thursday.
Can't make this up — Roy Moore said in September that the last time America was great was when we had slavery. (h/t @reckonalabama)https://t.co/NMF4BCQ6ZS pic.twitter.com/XbpPtdifuS — Eric Columbus (@EricColumbus) December 7, 2017
When asked a question by one of the only Black folks in attendance at the Florence, Alabama event, he said:
“I think it was great at the time when families were united—even though we had slavery—they cared for one another. … Our families were strong, our country had a direction.”
Horrifying.
It's no secret that many (if not all) people assume that when Trump and his cronies say “Make America Great Again,” that this is part of what they mean. Now, thanks to Moore, it's been made plain.
Moore is also accused of sexually assaulting teen girls, which led to him losing his job in his 30s, but doesn't seem to have any affect on his popularity for one of the highest offices in the state of Alabama. Recent polls have him just 4 points behind Doug Jones, his Democratic opponent in the state. The election is Dec. 12.

A California man is on the lam after he broke through the steel ceiling bars in an Indonesian jail on Monday — the second time foreign inmates escaped from the overcrowded prison this year, authorities said.
Cristian Beasley, 31, a suspect in narcotics-related crimes who had not yet been sentenced, bolted from the Kerobokan prison — about six miles from the main tourist beaches of Kuta, a village in Bali — at 4:10 a.m., Bandung police chief Yudith Satria Hananta said.
“It is thought that the prisoner escaped … by cutting through the steel bars above the ceiling,” he said in a statement.
Authorities believe Beasley used a rope to descend a wall, then managed to get over a perimeter wall in an area being refurbished.
He did not mention how Beasley managed to evade detection, but noted that police questioned witnesses and guards, and continue hunting for the escapee, Hananta said.
Paul Anthony Hoffman, 57, another American, also tried to escape Monday morning but was captured.
In June, an Australian, a Bulgarian, an Indian and a Malaysian escaped by tunneling about 13 yards under the prison's walls. Both the Indian and the Bulgarian were caught — but Shaun Edward Davidson, of Australia, and Tee Kok King, of Malaysia, remain at large.
On Davidson's apparent Facebook page, he shared a link to a group entitled, “Fans of Shaun Rageone Davidson – Australian Escapee.”
“From what we know of Mr Davidson he's not only a wanted international fugitive but hes got the looks of a model and the humor of a comedian this cunning lad is not only smart but he seems like the whole package,” the page description said.
The Kerobokan prison has housed various foreign drug convicts, including Australian Schappelle Corby, who served 12 1/2 years for marijuana smuggling.
The country has executed several foreign drug convicts in recent years.
Kerobokan held 1,378 inmates — more than four times its capacity of 323 as of June, according to government data.

No country had lost more penalty shootouts at a World Cup, but even though history was against them England's inexperienced team held its nerve to see off Colombia in a tense finale and progressed to the quarterfinals.
England were within minutes of reaching the last eight in normal time thanks to a Harry Kane penalty until it conceded an injury-time goal — Yerry Mina powered in a header in the 93rd minute — which allowed the South Americans to live on to extra-time and, ultimately, penalties.
A miss from Mateus Uribe and a one-handed Jordan Pickford save from Carlos Bacca in the shootout proved to be Colombia's downfall and ensured England, having failed on three previous occasions, won a penalty shootout at a World Cup for the first time in its history.

Practice makes perfect
Previously England had lost six of its seven penalty shootouts at major tournaments, the only win coming against Spain in the European Championships in 1996.
But coach Gareth Southgate — a man who famously missed from the spot in the Euro 1996 semifinal against Germany — had made sure his players took spot-kicks in training and, on this occasion at least, practice made perfect.
“We talked long and hard about owning the process,” Southgate told ITV when asked about the squad's approach to penalty shootouts.
“Great credit to all the staff and our players who have taken everything on board.
“We looked at individual technique, looked at how we needed to be as a team, and the goalkeeper has been important in that.”
It was left to Eric Dier to convert the winning spot-kick and send fans into fever pitch, changing hope to expectation with Sweden the next opponent on July 7.

Is football ‘coming home?'
Little was expected of this young England team when it left for Russia. There were others with more experience, better teams packed with superstars and pedigree.
But with this being the World Cup which has had little respect for reputation, sending Spain, Germany, Argentina and Portugal tumbling, English hopes have increased with every heavyweight exit.

Social media had been awash, perhaps initially with tongue firmly in cheek, with England fans claiming football was “coming home,” the chorus of the country's favorite football song “Three Lions,” written when England hosted the European Championships in 1996 and reached the semifinals.
The English are now the only previous winners in their half of the draw and though they have some way to go before replicating the feats of 1966, the only time the country has won football's biggest prize, even the gloomiest of fan will now perhaps be captivated.
Sweden — eight places below the English in FIFA's world rankings — will be a dangerous opponent, but it is a tie England will be expected to successfully negotiate.
The tenacious Swedes — who reached their first World Cup quarterfinal in 24 years thanks to a 1-0 win over Switzerland — will not be obliging opponents.
Sweden, after all, topped a group which featured Germany and, though it is a team without superstars, its unity and discipline has already seen off South Korea, Mexico and the Swiss.
Southgate himself tempered expectations.
“This is special but I want us to go on now,” the Englishman added on ITV.
“Sweden, it's another team we have a poor record against. We've underestimated them for years. They're brilliant at what they do. It's going to be a real tough test.”

From injury-time heartbreak to penalty joy for England
England controlled the beat of a high-tempo opening, pressing with urgency and keeping the opposition largely in its own half.
Without the injured James Rodriquez, captain Radamel Falcao was an isolated figure in Colombia's attack and, starved of possession and opportunity, the former Manchester United and Chelsea striker posed little threat.
But for all its dominance in the middle of the park there were few chances for England in the first half, the best falling to Kane in the 15th minute from a Kieran Trippier cross. But, from an acute angle, the striker headed over the crossbar.
The major talking point of the half came off the ball just before the break when replays showed Wilmar Barrios pushing his head first against Jordan Henderson's chest and then his chin.
The England midfielder, who was the only English player to miss a penalty in the shootout, fell to the ground, but the offense was deemed worthy of a yellow card only.
With comfortable victories over the lower-ranked Tunisia and Panama in the group stages, followed by defeat to an understrength Belgium after having already qualified, this was supposed to be the biggest test of the tournament for England but, in truth, for the majority of the match Colombia only tested the English temperament.
Within minutes after the break, the Colombians were punished for their ill-discipline — the referee caught Carlos Sanchez rugby tackling Kane to the ground at a corner and had no hesitation in awarding the spot-kick.
Some Colombians argued with the referee while others scuffed the penalty spot with their studs, but it made little difference to Kane who calmly scored his sixth goal of this tournament, putting him in prime position for the Golden Boot award.
As Colombia searched for an equalizer, England threatened on the counter-attack, though Colombia did have an opportunity in the 80th minute.
Kyle Walker lost the ball in Colombia's half, the South Americans rapidly attacked but Juan Cuadrado shot into the stands when he should have at least tested Pickford.

Pickford, going into this match questions over whether he was worthy of a starting spot, produced a sensational save to deny Uribe from distance in injury time but, deep in injury time, the England goalkeeper could do little to prevent the equalizer.
From a corner, Mina headed beyond the diving Pickford and Trippier, who was standing on the line, to set up a grandstand finish.
In the first-half of injury time England faced wave after wave of yellow-shirted attacks — Falaco and Mina tested with headers — but England held firm and regained its composure in the final 15 minutes before the match concluded with a dramatic climax.
Daniel Brito batted .370 (17-46) with a double, three home runs, eight RBIs, four walks, three stolen bases and 1.018 OPS. He hit safely in his first seven games of the season (five of which were multi-hit efforts) and batted .412 (14-34) against right-handed pitching.

A gunman stormed a house party and killed 11 people, including his former wife and 8-year-old son, before shooting himself in the head during a New Year's party in the southeastern Brazilian city of Campinas late on Saturday.
Police in the state of São Paulo said the shooter, identified as 46-year-old Sidnei Ramis de Araújo, is believed to have been angry over a split with his wife, Isamara Filier, 41, and their son João Victor.
Three other people remain hospitalized, police said, while four people survived the attack unharmed, including one party attendee who managed to flee to a bathroom and phone the police when the shooting began.
Survivors, according to a police spokesman, said that just before midnight, the shooter jumped over a fence surrounding the house, burst through a door and began firing even as he berated Filier for taking their son.
Araújo possibly sought to take advantage of the commotion of New Year's Eve to disguise the shooting, police said.
One neighbour told local television that he and his family heard shots, but had thought they might be fireworks until one of the wounded ran to their property, bleeding and pleading for help.
Despite high rates of crime and violence in Brazil, including significant problems with assaults against women, the attack alarmed Latin America's biggest country on a holiday associated with family gatherings.
Gun deaths are common in heists, holdups and in confrontations among police, drug gangs and other criminals in Brazil, but targeted mass shootings are rare.
Police said Araújo, reported by local media to be a laboratory technician, used a 9 mm pistol and carried two additional clips, extra ammunition, a knife and unspecified but unused explosives.
Investigators are analyzing the explosives in addition to a cell phone and audio recorder found in a car he parked outside the home to determine whether Araújo left any sort of message about his attack.
Police said they did not yet know if Araújo had a history of violence, or whether he had been known to physically harm or threaten his former wife before the attack.
Campinas, an industrial and university city of over 1 million residents, is located about 100 kilometres northwest of the city of São Paulo, Brazil's biggest metropolis.

The bright lights and marquees of the Las Vegas Strip are seen in this undated areal image. (File/FOX5)
the LVCVA is expecting more than 320,000 visitors in the valley this three-day weekend. (FOX5)
There are dozens of events going on across the valley this Memorial Day Weekend.
“There's a little something for everyone this weekend,” LVCVA chief communications officer Jacqueline Peterson said.
That's why the LVCVA is expecting more than 320,000 visitors in the valley this three-day weekend. They're expected to spend more than $244 million on their trips.
There are a lot of artists and comedians coming to town, including Pink. Her concert is at T-Mobile just a couple of days ahead of the Stanley Cup Final.
The Las Vegas 51s are playing a few games. And the Aces have their first home game. The main event for many will be Game 1 between the Golden Knights and the Capitals.
“I'm going to head down and watch on the screen outside the arena then I will be at Game 2,” one valley man said.
Some Las Vegas locals said they are ready to brave the traffic and the crowds to cheer on the Knights.
“It's worth the wait,” he said. “It's not like you're waiting in gridlock in LA traffic. You're going to watch the Stanley Cup Final, which 10 years ago in Las Vegas would've been unheard of.”
Meanwhile others are opting out and choosing to watch the game somewhere else.
“We're going to be watching the game from somewhere with a big TV. I hear Vegas has a lot of big TVs!” one visitor said.
Those who aren't among the lucky few to snag a ticket online, there are lots of bars and restaurants holding watch parties.
“We're going to do great giveaways, signed memorabilia, signed pucks,” Born and Raised bar owner Scottie Godino said.
At Born and Raised, they make the atmosphere just as exciting as Toshiba Plaza.
“Our fans come here to experience that together,” Godino said. “It's lively, it's energetic!”
Many Golden Knights fans were excited to spend their Memorial Day Weekend, honoring a different kind of hero.
“A lot of us will have Monday off not just to honor our veterans, but to prepare for the Stanley Cup Final,” Robinson said.
“This is our first Stanley Cup,” Godino said. “We don't know anything about this kind of territory. We're just going with the flow, doing the best we can to create memorable experiences during this time of history.”
On Monday, Henderson Pavilion will host a large watch party. The D usually does, but will not on Monday because of music festival Punk Rock Bowling.
The festival is celebrating 20 years in Las Vegas.
Other events downtown include Downtown Rocks a free summer concert series.
At McCarran International Airport, tourists shared their plans for the weekend.
"We're celebrating my good friend's 55th birthday," Michelle Mason from Seattle said. "It rains most of the time (in Seattle) so we're here to have some fun!"
She said she's also cheering for the Golden Knights. "Gotta put some bets down for sure on that!" she said.
"Tomorrow we've got a drag queen brunch at Senor Frogs, so we're excited about that," Kory Kalahar from Washington said. "I've got three kids and we thought let's start a tradition and take everybody to Vegas on their 21st birthday." "Las Vegas is special for us because my wife and I got engaged here so that's kind of the reason we wanted to come back."
"I am here celebrating my wedding anniversary and the 13th anniversary of my husband and I's first date," Jodi Kruse of Washington said. "We're gonna hit Hoover Dam, we're gonna hit Caesars Palace, we're gonna hit the outlet malls, we're gonna hit Steinmart."
Chris Chiofaro from Boston said he was looking to save his money. "I'm looking forward to Tiesto tomorrow morning and I'm looking forward to all the tables that I'm going to mooch off of the entire weekend because I'm not spending a ... cent!"

AWKA- THE recent verbal war between the camps of Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State and his Anambra State counterpart, Chief Willie Obiano, may ultimately form the basis for a united South East Governors' Forum, going by the latest development.
Media aides of both governors went out, all guns blazing recently, apparently to showcase their ability to defend their bosses well, by writing unprintable things. Surprisingly, both governors were not in the country at the time the media were awash with the attacks from both sides. While Okorocha was in South Africa, Obi was enjoying his vacation in the United States of America, USA, and it was after the dust settled that people realized that the two governors did not sanction the writings in the first place.
Newly elected president of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the apex Igbo socio cultural organization, Chief Nnia Nwodo, has taken it upon himself to resolve the matter as he realized that the altercation between the two governors was a merely distracting the Igbo nation from what is important.
Principled disagreement
Nwodo said: “What happened between Okorocha and Obiano is just storm in a tea cup and it has been accentuated by media aides in the way they addressed it. They had a principled disagreement about a representation of which number of governors was crossing from one political party to the other. One made an assertion and the other made a denial.
“The rebuttals were taken over by their press aides and put in such unpalatable light that it embarrassed their superiors. When it happened, I called Governor Okorocha, but he was in South Africa. He was not even in Nigeria at the time the rebuttals were issued instantaneously and replied and claimed not to have seen the rebuttals before their publication.
“Governor Obiano, on the other hand, was totally embarrassed. He said to me, this is not my language. I could not have gone this far. I was prepared to discipline my staff until they presented a defence of the Imo governor's writing, but they did not bother to contact me before writing those things.
“They felt they were doing me a favour. He said, how could I discuss my colleague in that manner? Two wrongs don't make a right. So, in the circumstance, he made a phone call to Okorocha and they both discussed and put it behind them. And they have both respected my plea for an injunction that this matter should not go ahead and that has happened. We are planning to have a meeting of all the South East governors soonest where we will meet and discuss the basis of how we will move forward.”
Also worried by the development, the Association of South East Town Unions, ASETU, frowned at the way the camps of the two governors handled the matter. Describing the conflict as diversionary, the union regretted that instead of working for the development of their areas, the two governors engaged in the politics of vilification, thereby diverting the attention of the people from the economic recession that had brought a lot of hardship to Nigerians.
The national chairman of ASETU, Chief Emeka Diwe said: “It is unfortunate that the two governors chose to throw caution to the wind by casting aspersions at each other, thus bringing Ndigbo to ridicule. As a grassroots organization in Igbo land, we are worried that our governors chose to descend so low. We are the highest risk bearers. If there is good governance, we should be the greatest beneficiaries and if it is bad governance, we become the most affected.
“We are, therefore, concerned because it is the grass that suffers when two elephants fight. We are not taking sides, but only looking at the facts to be able to conduct our independent investigations.
Assessing their performances
At the appropriate time, we will make known our findings on the matter. It is interesting that people are already assessing their performances in their respective states. We view this as a good development that will raise the bar of governance in Igbo land.”
Diwe observed that the exchange between Okorocha and Obiano had exposed the lack of cohesion and cooperation among South East governors, which he described as unhealthy for the zone.
He said further: “Now, we are forced to ask, does the South East Governors' Forum still exist? Who is the chairman? Is there any form of cohesion or cooperation among the South East Governors? This is where our governors are not getting it right. Instead of our governors cooperating to make life more meaningful for their people, they are quarreling over who will defect to this or that party.
“Why can't they learn from their counterparts in the North and South West zones who, aside party affiliations, have always met to discuss issues of common interest to their blocs? We talk of Igbo presidency, is this how we are going to rule Nigeria?”
Also, the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) told the two governors not to further wash their dirty clothes in public, advising both leaders and other governors of the South East zone to emulate the simplicity and humility of the former Governor Peter Obi of Anambra State, who led the South East governors for years without rancour.

Intel said it has made progress in fighting against the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities through software patches and an upcoming generation of microprocessors with newly designed hardware.
In a public blog post shared on Thursday, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich [pictured above] outlined a two-pronged plan to mitigate future damage by the two vulnerabilities, which were made public in January, rattling the cybersecurity community. In addition to software patches distributed to all Intel products launched in the past five years, Intel's next-generation Xeon processors, code-named Cascade Lake, will have hardware redesigns to prevent both vulnerabilities.
Meltdown and Spectre were discovered last year by researchers led by Google Project Zero. The vulnerabilities can allow hackers to steal sensitive personal data stored in the computer's memory via apps running in the computer, such as password managers, browsers and emails.
Meltdown steals data by bypassing the hardware barrier between running applications and the computer's memory; Spectre tricks applications into handing over secret information from the computer's memory. Due to the flaws dating back to the 1990s and in nearly all Intel chips, nearly all computers, laptops, mobile phones and cloud servers in the world were vulnerable to these bugs.
Intel has been working to protect computers from these two vulnerabilities in the past three months by issuing software patches. Krzanich said Intel has released updates for 100 percent of Intel products launched in the past five years that require protection against Meltdown's side-channel hacking method.
The software updates do have limits, as they will prevent against one of two variants in which Spectre can be used by hackers to collect data from the computer's memory.
"With these updates now available, I encourage everyone to make sure they are always keeping their systems up-to-date," said Krzanich. "It's one of the easiest ways to stay protected."
Intel's new microprocessors will prevent the other variant of Spectre and the one existing Meltdown variant. Cascade Lake microprocessors have additional layers of "partitioning" in the processor so the memory is harder to exploit. The microprocessors are expected to launch in the second half of 2018.
"Think of this partitioning as additional 'protective walls' between applications and user privilege levels to create an obstacle for bad actors," said Krzanich.
After facing a major public relations crisis following the public revelation of Meltdown and Spectre, which included a Congressional inquiry and more than 30 class-action lawsuits, Intel has been doubling down on preventing similar situations in the future. A week after the vulnerabilities were revealed, Krzanich issued the "Security First Pledge" that Intel will shore up its defenses against them.
In February, Intel opened a bug bounty program to find similar vulnerabilities to Spectre. It will last until the end of this year and pay up to $250,000.
"Our work is not done," said Krzanich in the blog post. "This is not a singular event; it is a long-term commitment. One that we take very seriously. Customer-first urgency, transparent and timely communications, and ongoing security assurance. This is our pledge and it's what you can count on from me, and from all of Intel."

Sevilla will play host to Manchester United in the first leg on 21st February before then travelling to England for the return on 13th March.
And Sarabia revealed that Sevilla were only desperate to avoid being paired with Manchester City and PSG, contenders to win the Champions League .
"It is going to be a very competitive match", the midfielder told his club's official media channel.
"We know that Mourinho prepares for the knockout rounds very well, but we have options and we will try to put everything on the table to be able to get through this tie.
"The only ones we did not want in that aspect were City and PSG, two rivals tipped for the title."

Bitcoin's Crazy Ride: Soaring, Falling and Investor Frenzy
The price of bitcoin swung wildly Thursday, rising to more than $19,000 only to fall sharply within minutes, as the frenzy surrounding the virtual currency escalated just days before it starts trading on a major U.S. exchange.
The frenzy even has parts of Wall Street concerned. A group of banks came out and complained that federal regulators approved bitcoin futures, which begin trading on Sunday, too quickly and without properly considering the inherent risks in the virtual currency.
At 1:05 p.m. EST, Bitcoin was valued at $16,825, according to Coinbase, after briefly surging above $19,000 Thursday morning. At the start of the year, one bitcoin was worth less than $1,000. Coinbase, the largest bitcoin exchange, at one point tweeted that record-high traffic had caused interruptions to its service.
The swings in price occurred just as the trading community prepares for bitcoin to start trading on two established U.S. exchanges. Futures for bitcoin will start trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange on Sunday evening and on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange a week later.
The Futures Industry Association, which represents Wall Street's biggest banks and clearing houses, sent a letter to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, saying that as the guarantors of customers trades, they should have been consulted before trading in bitcoin futures was approved. They expressed concern that the extreme volatility tied into bitcoin could leave banks exposed when the futures move too violently.
Bitcoin is the world's most popular virtual currency. Such currencies are not tied to a bank or government and allow users to spend money anonymously. They are basically lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they are traded.
A debate is raging on the merits of such currencies. Some say they serve merely to facilitate money laundering and illicit, anonymous payments. Others say they can be helpful methods of payment, such as in crisis situations where national currencies have collapsed.
Miners of bitcoins and other virtual currencies help keep the systems honest by having their computers keep a global running tally of transactions. That prevents cheaters from spending the same digital coin twice.
Online security is a vital concern for such dealings.
In Japan, following the failure of a bitcoin exchange called Mt. Gox, new laws were enacted to regulate bitcoin and other virtual currencies. Mt. Gox shut down in February 2014, saying it lost about 850,000 bitcoins, possibly to hackers.

You can tell that this has been a strange season – when some teams are close to being out of the playoff race – and it's only the first week of October.
With the new point system in place this year, and an early projection of what teams are looking good for a playoff spot, there are others who are not so fortunate. Those are the football players who have to work extra for college exposure.
One of the biggest questions that is asked in recruiting – by parents and athletes – has to do with playing for a program that is not in the playoffs and not in the spotlight. This is not new, and to tell you the truth, there is never any guarantee.
Those who have been around recruiting for any length of time will tell you that if you can play, they will find you. There are too many events to take part in that provide exposure, so with that in mind, the only thing that will get you noticed is to perform, and so far, we have had plenty of athletes step up their game.
As we head toward another weekend of action, there will be plenty of prospect who are jumping On The Radar. Today, we have six more for you from Miami-Dade and Broward Counties.
Check these quality football players out:
2018 – Sherron Chester, DE/DT, 6-1, 233, Miami Carol City. Here is one of those quality football players who was not hyped or talked a lot about before the season began, but as this year continues to unfold, this is certainly a prospect that many are watching on a team that has worked extremely hard to defend its 6A state title. He is a versatile line prospect.
TAPE: https://www.hudl.com/profile/6339403/sherron-chester
2019 – Devon Corker, LB/FS, 5-11, 185, Fort Lauderdale Dillard. One of the very gifted underclass prospect in Broward County who has looked good in the spring and summer, and as this crazy season moves along, the coaches have been pleased with his progress as a hard hitting safety, who does play like a linebacker. This is certainly a college prospect who just needs to get his reps and learn more about the game.
TAPE: http://www.hudl.com/profile/9405558/devon-corker
2018 – Marquis Edwards, DB, 6-0, 180, SW Ranches Archbishop McCarthy. Yet another impressive football player who we got out last year, and have followed his progress in the spring and summer. This is someone who has worked very hard in the offseason. He got bigger and stronger and much wiser as a football player. Is having a solid start to the season – with his best football still ahead.
TAPE: https://www.hudl.com/profile/6164219/marquis-edwards
2018 – Jonathan Lorza, DE/OG, 6-3, 280, Homestead Somerset Academy. Sometimes change is good. Here is a talented football player we have watched the past two seasons, and as he made his move down south this season, there were, and still are, a lot of expectations out of this gifted football talent. He learns things fast, and his coaches are excited about his future at the next level. Solid line prospect.
TAPE: https://www.hudl.com/profile/4489712/jonathan-lorza
2018 – Nick Louis, DB, 6-2, 175, North Miami. One of the under-the-radar football players in South Florida this season, here is a gifted talent who runs well, has very good size and plays with a passion for the game. Is the kind of athlete who will give college coaches several options. He is fluid enough to play the corner position – while also being able to be that physical, rangy safety who makes plays. Has a chance the rest of the season to lineup against some quality opponents.
TAPE: https://www.hudl.com/profile/7825926/nick-louis
2018 – Daryl Powell, WR, 6-4, 190, Pompano Beach Blanche Ely. The beat goes on with so much talent in South Florida that seniors like this aren't being noticed by colleges until late in the recruiting game. This is indeed a big time talent who has everything you are looking for in the position – and he continues to get better and better all the time. Good coaching has also helped to elevate his status.

Sierra Leone Telegraph: 14 August 2017
The Sierra Leone Telegraph has launched an Emergency Appeal to raise at least £50,000 to help victims of the flooding disaster which happened today 14th August 2017 in Freetown, through the Just Giving Crowd Funding Website. Please follow this link to make a donation:
https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/FreetownFloodDisasterEmergencyAppeal
About the Freetown Flood Disaster Emergency Appeal:
We are raising £50,000 to help victims of the massive flooding in Freetown, Sierra Leone which has taken the lives of hundreds of people, with thousands homeless.
Heavy rains in the West African city of Freetown in Sierra Leone, have caused major landslides in various parts of the city. Over 350 unidentified remains have been taken to the Connaught Hospital mortuary. Over 100 of the more than 350 dead are children.
Over 1,000 homes have been covered in deep mud with people stranded inside. Emergency services are trying hard to rescue people trapped in their homes, but with great difficulty.
Fifteen years ago, saw the end of a deadly ten year rebel war, which left over 100,000 dead and thousands of people homeless – living in shanty huts.
Then came the deadly Ebola virus in 2014, which took the lives of over 4,000 people. Sierra Leone is one of the poorest nations in the world, with most people earning less than 60 British Pence a day. More than 40% of newly born children will not live to see their fifth birthday; and over 30% of pregnant women die during or after child birth.
And now heavy rains have taken its toll on a nation that is almost collapsing under the weight of poverty.
The landslides which took place last night and this morning – 14th August 2017, have left thousands of people homeless, with hundreds dead. Food, clean drinking water, and clothing are now needed to help those that have lost everything. This is why I am asking for your kind donation to help those people.
Please give generously to help the Freetown Flood Victims:

iStock/Thinkstock(NEW YORK) — Jenny Cavnar has had a long-running career in Major League Baseball, but she slid into a historic new role in the broadcast booth Monday night, becoming the first woman since 1996 to call the televised play-by-play for a major league team.
Cavnar called the Colorado Rockies and San Diego Padres matchup in Denver alongside analyst Jeff Huson and former Rockies outfielder-turned analyst Ryan Spilborghs. It was a fitting assignment for Cavnar, who previously reported for the Padres before joining the Rockies as a pre- and post-game host in 2012.
With more than a decade of baseball reporting in various capacities under her belt, Cavnar called her first televised homerun Monday night when Rockies' third baseman Nolan Arenado stepped up to the plate.
“That ball is shot into left field, fire up the fountains she's gone,” Cavnar announced, describing the two-run shot in the bottom of the first inning. Her run call coincided with the eruption of the classic Coors Field fountains whenever the home team hits a home run.
Cavnar joins a shortlist of women who have called America's pastime.
Mary Shane was the first female in a booth, doing radio for the Chicago White Sox in 1976 before moving on to television; and Suzyn Waldman was the first woman to do baseball game commentary, for a few New York Mets games on radio in June 1993, according to ESPN. Waldman called her first TV broadcast in July 1995 for a New York Yankees versus Texas Rangers game on ABC's “Baseball Night in America” and her first play-by-play in 1996.
Other notable women who have spent time in the booth include Gayle Gardner, who replaced Charlie Jones on the Rockies TV broadcast for the Aug. 3, 1993 Rockies and Cincinnati Reds game. Pam Boucher announced 36 games on Yankees TV, WPIX in 1977.
Cavnar, a Colorado native, previously made history in 2015 as the first female analyst for a series of National League games in the radio booth.
She felt the love with messages of support from around the league and other women in the industry, including ESPN “Sunday Night Baseball” analyst Jessica Mendoza.
Although the Rockies fell to the Padres 13-5, the night will go down as a win for Cavnar.

As the World Cup advances to the quarter-finals, the tournament has already brought us unforgettable moments. From Cristiano Ronaldo's impressive penalty against Spain to Germany's elimination in the group stages, this World Cup has reminded everyone why the world championship is unlike anything else.
Here Euronews revisits ten reasons that make the World Cup so great.
1. World Cup brings people together
Like these Bolshoi ballerinas huddled together watching the Russia-Spain penalty shootout from an iPhone screen in full costume.
The dancer who posted the video, Bruna Gaglianone Cantanhede, said the penalty shootout took place during the Bolshoi's production of Raymonda, so the dancers were only able to catch a glimpse of the action before going on-stage.
2. Players from opposite teams consoling each other after matches
Competition at the World Cup can be so stressful that some players lose it after the games. Luckily, the World Cup is also about being a good sport — and some players have proven this by taking the time to console players from opposite teams after a loss.
After a heart-wrenching match, Belgium's Romelu Lukaku consoled Japan's Shinji Kagawa over their elimination.

Even coaches from the opposite team are seen consoling players from the rival team after a tough game.
After England's win over Colombia, the Red Lions' head coach Gareth Southgate joined Colombia's head coach Jose Pekerman in consoling Mateus Uribe.
REUTERS
But players are not the only ones consoling each other after a match. Off the pitch, fans from opposite teams also comfort each other.
A crowd of Colombians did exactly that after seeing a devastated young Polish fan cry when his team lost to the South American country.
3. Players thanking their fans for their support
It is always endearing seeing players thanking their fans for their support after a tough match. Japan's team showed how strong the player-fan union can be when they gave an ovation to their supporters at the stadium after their unforgettable match against Belgium.
REUTERS
Japan's dignified response to their loss to Belgium stole hearts across the world.
4. Players sharing a moment of reflection despite their differences
Players sometimes share more than a love for football. Some of them are sometimes caught sharing a moment of reflection or prayer before or after a game.
After battling for a place in the Round of 16, Panama's Fidel Escobar was joined by Belgium's Romelu Lukaku in a moment of reflection after the game.
REUTERS
5. Coming together to celebrate a victory despite different nationalities
Nothing says World Cup more than different nationalities celebrating a victory together.
Mexican fans celebrated South Korea's win against Germany as it saved Mexico from elimination despite their loss to Sweden that same day.
Videos of Mexicans raising Koreans into the air circulated on social media that day.
Journalist James Wagner filmed the Korean consul being carried by Mexican fans outside the South Korea embassy in Mexico.
6. Making exceptions so everyone can watch the game
The World Cup may have brought a huge win to Iranian women who were allowed to watch the game alongside men in a stadium — for the first time since 1980. The official Twitter account of the Iranian team tweeted a picture of the mixed gender crowd cheering them on from back home.
7. Unexpected friendships
The World Cup may be a football tournament but one of the best things about it are the unexpected friendships that flourish from it.
Fans from different nationalities have been caught on camera trading jerseys, embracing each other after a game and even singing together.
French comedian John Sulo bonded with Japanese fans over the theme tune to anime classic One Piece after the Senegal-Japan game on June 24.
8. Remembering loved ones with a passion for the beautiful game
Each World Cup brings new memories but it also brings back old ones.
People coming together to cheer for their countries in 2018 reminded one Scottish woman how much her late husband loved the football championship.
Helen Bunker shared a photo on Twitter of her husband at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Rio de Janiero, Brazil. “4 yrs ago my husband was dying of cancer so he flew to the World Cup in Brazil,” she tweeted. Bunker points out the joy that can be seen on her husband's face in the photo. “Just look at the smile on his face, the joy & happiness & excitement. I love the World Cup,” she tweeted.
9. People helping disabled fans enjoy the game
A disability can impair some from watching the game. But as communities come together to watch the match, help is offered to those who may need it.
In Brazil, an interpreter helped deaf-blind football fans follow the country's matches thanks to a miniature pitch to act out the game.
10. Making dreams come true
The World Cup can also make dreams come true in the most unlikely ways.
Thanks to a picture gone viral, a Brazilian boy from a favela will be able to meet his hero Philippe Coutinho at the end of the championship.
The boy who was pictured with a home-made jersey with Coutinho's name and number 11, caught the player's attention who reached out to him and sent him an official football jersey among other things.
Motorcyclist, pedal cyclist killed as…Two Fort Wellington cops involved in separate fatal accidents
A 29-year-old father of three and a pedal cyclist were killed following separate accidents Saturday and yesterday involving vehicles being driven by police ranks stationed at Fort Wellington, Berbice.
Gavin Crandon of New Amsterdam, Berbice, perished shortly after 01:30 hrs yesterday, when the motorcycle he was riding slammed into a policeman's car at Main Road, New Amsterdam. Hubert Williamson, 15, of New Amsterdam , who was a pillion rider, was also injured and has been admitted to the hospital
A police release indicated that the victims were travelling at a fast rate when the accident occurred.
“The bike was coming at a fast rate with the rider and a passenger and a car was turning through Lad Lane, New Amsterdam when the bike slammed into the car. The rider pelted fifteen feet away and the passenger on the bike pitched further away,” an eyewitness said.
Both Crandon and Williamson were reportedly not wearing helmets.
Information gathered by this publication states that approximately 01:30 hours, Sunday morning, motor car PSS 1890 was proceeding in the eastern direction and had stopped to make a turn when motorcycle CJ 735, heading in the opposite direction at a fast rate, slammed into the car.
Crandon and Williamson were flung several feet away from the point of impact. They were subsequently rushed to the New Amsterdam Public Hospital where Crandon succumbed about an hour later.
Williamson was later transferred to the Georgetown Public Hospital.
Meanwhile an off-duty police constable is under close arrest following a fatal accident which occurred about 18:50 hours on Saturday on the Rosignol Public Road, West Coast Berbice that resulted in the death of a pedal cyclist.
Dead is Daymon Barran, a minibus driver of Lot 103 William Street, Rosignol Village, West Coast Berbice.
Kaieteur News understands that a police constable from the Fort Wellington Police Station was proceeding south along the eastern carriageway in motor car PWW 5999 allegedly at a fast rate and crashed into the rear of the cycle.
A senior police source disclosed that the rank told investigators that he swerved from an approaching minibus and struck the pedal cyclist.
As a result of the impact, the cyclist identified as Daymon Barran, 43, fell onto the roadway.
He was picked up in an unconscious state and rushed to the New Amsterdam Public Hospital by the same constable, and transferred to the Georgetown Public Hospital Corporation. He succumbed about 06:45 hours yesterday.
The policeman who was driving his personal vehicle was tested but found no alcohol in his breath.
The body is presently at the GPHC Mortuary awaiting a post-mortem.

EDMOND, Okla. - A veterinarian in Oklahoma has quite a tale to tell after removing 21 pacifiers from a dog's stomach.
The veterinarian at Gentle Care Animal Hospital said he had to share the story because "this was the most fascinating and exciting surgery I have ever done..."
A local couple recently had a baby and were wondering what was happening to all of their child's pacifiers.
One day, the child's grandmother saw the dog, Dovey, jump up on the counter and take off with one.
The couple told the veterinarian that Dovey had slowed down her eating and had been vomiting a little phlegm for a few days, but other than that, they said the dog seemed fine and that they hadn't noticed any other changes.
When Dovey vomited up a pacifier one day, the couple decided it was time to take the dog in for an x-ray, according to the hospital's Facebook post.
Judging from the x-ray, the local veterinarian believed there were between 7 to 9 pacifiers in the dog's stomach.
However, during surgery, the veterinarian found 21 pacifiers in the dog's stomach!
Fortunately, Dovey is doing great and gets to go home today, the veterinarian told KFOR.
"Dog's will eat anything, anytime and at any age so always be watching!!!" the veterinarian posted to Facebook.

Message: * A friend wanted you to see this item from WRAL.com: http://wr.al/18pPc
— A group of protesters in Durham toppled a Confederate monument Monday evening.
The statue is called the Confederate Soldiers Monument and was dedicated in 1924.
The protest began at about 6 p.m. near the old courthouse and a portion of East Main Street was closed as a result.
Several men used a ladder to reach the top of statue, which had been sprayed with cooking spray by authorities to make it more difficult to climb, and it was pulled down with a rope.
Protesters began kicking the statue and chanting after it fell. They then began marching to the police department, blocking a number of downtown streets in the process.
The protest dispersed just before 8 p.m.
The protest was held in response to a white nationalist rally that turned violent Saturday in Charlottesville, Va., killing three and injuring dozens.

Victoria's Cool Films series returns
By David Nilsen
Victoria Theatre's Cool Film Series will kick off on Friday, July 6, with a showing of the 1950 George Cukor film “Adam's Rib,” starring the classic comedic team of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn as married lawyers who must face off in court. The film is the beginning of an exciting season for the annual movie series. Mechele Pritchard, director of contracts and licensing at Victoria Theatre and the woman who organizes the Cool Film Series, believes it will be one of the most entertaining line-ups in years.
The movies in the Cool Films Series are screened in the gorgeously restored main theater at the Victoria, and are projected on a full-size movie theater screen, most of them from original celluloid film prints.
“We are a 35mm projection house,” explains Pritchard. “We run reel-to-reel when we can. It's getting harder and harder to find 35mm prints though because of the degradation of the celluloid over the years, so sometimes we have to use discs. However, only four will be projected from DVD or Blu-ray this year.”
Pritchard works for months behind the scenes to track down rare prints of these films. “The trick is matching up the film with the distributor. Every few years the distributors sell their prints, so it's like playing hide and seek.”
In addition to classic era films like “Adam's Rib,” this season will feature a number of modern-era classics like “The Princess Bride” (July 13-15) and “Die Hard” (August 10-12).
“We try to do a mix of old and new classics,” explains Pritchard.
The series will feature a disaster movie marathon in August, with “The Poseidon Adventure” (August 17), “The Towering Inferno” (August 18), and “Earthquake” (August 19). When asked about the choice of these campy but highly entertaining blockbusters from the 1970s, Pritchard's answer is simple: “I wanted it! I said, ‘I'd really love to do a disaster weekend,' and everyone said, ‘Okay!'”
The series will also include a Christmas in July marathon the final weekend of July, with a showing of “National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation” on July 27, “Elf” on July 28, and “Miracle on 34th Street” on July 29. The marathon will coincide with Victoria Theatre's Merry Makeover campaign, a fundraising effort to restore the display cases for the Christmas elves from the former Rike's Department Store. For decades the elves graced the store's holiday window displays in downtown Dayton, and are now a part of the Schuster Center's Wintergarden.
The 10:30 p.m. showings of cult classics “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” (July 14) and “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” (August 11) renew the program's Late Night at the Vic tradition of screening quirky, off-the-beaten-path classics for an audience of nocturnal film lovers.
Despite being better known today for its stage performances, Victoria Theatre has a long history as a movie house. Built in 1865 as Turner Opera House, the theater first screened a moving picture in the early 1900s—a fight featuring legendary boxer Bob Fitzsimmons. The theater continued to show films regularly throughout the classic era of cinema.
“We were a Warner Brothers house in the 1940s and 1950s,” explains Pritchard. “Then we were a Disney house for a while.”
1977 saw the rebirth of movie screenings at the Vic with that year's Summer Film Fair. Hot Times Cool Films kicked off in 1981 as the precursor to the modern Cool Films Series. The renovation of the theater between 1988 and 1990 restored the venue to its former splendor. Watching a film in the theater now is like being transported back in time to the glory days of grand movie palaces.
When asked which film she's most excited about from this summer's schedule, Pritchard hems and haws like any true movie fan before settling on the 1963 romantic comedy “Irma la Douce,” showing the weekend of July 20-22. The Billy Wilder-directed classic stars Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine and tells the story of an accidentally disgraced cop (Lemmon) who finds himself falling in love with a prostitute (MacLaine).
Pritchard begins the process of selecting films for the series in February by making a master list of both older and more modern classics. She takes this list to a programming committee, who add their own suggestions. The group also takes into account audience suggestions from surveys filled out at movie screenings the previous year. After the list is assembled, the group whittles it down to an eclectic final mix they hope will appeal to a wide audience. This year's schedule includes comedy, action, drama, musicals, and family films.
Victoria Theatre's Cool Films Series is an opportunity to revisit cinema classics on the big screen in a beautiful historic setting. Through the generous donation of the program's sponsors, free soda pop and popcorn are available to be enjoyed in the lobby before each screening.

The law bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, and is likely to very quickly be challenged in court.
Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant signed the most restrictive abortion ban in the US on Monday, drawing outrage and promises of lawsuits from abortion rights advocacy groups. The bill, called “The Gestational Age Act,” bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, just before the end of the second trimester. The law contains exceptions to the ban in cases of fetal abnormalities and medical emergencies, including a threat to the woman's life or serious risk of physical impairment, but not in cases of rape or incest. When the bill was up for a vote, Bryant tweeted his support, saying, “As I have repeatedly said, I want Mississippi to be the safest place in America for an unborn child.”
As I have repeatedly said, I want Mississippi to be the safest place in America for an unborn child. House Bill 1510 will help us achieve that goal. https://t.co/ffqRfhwx51
Before this bill, Mississippi already had a ban on abortion after 20 weeks, which 16 other states do as well. While other states have passed even more restrictive bans through their legislatures — like Ohio, which passed a six-week ban on abortion in 2016 — none have successfully become law. "We are protecting more women, we are protecting more children," Mississippi House Judiciary Committee Chair Andy Gipson told CBS News. "By 15 weeks, you have a child in the womb who has a heartbeat, who for all practical purposes has taken on the form of a person." Organizations like the Center for Reproductive Rights and the American Civil Liberties Union were quick to make clear they planned to challenge the law in court. There it could be blocked temporarily as the groups and the state litigate its constitutionality. “It will end up at the center of a legal battle, wasting tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars in legal fees,” the ACLU of Mississippi said in a statement Wednesday, after the bill passed the state Senate and was sent back to the House. “Mississippi can't afford to use your precious dollars in that way.” Senior vice president of the Center for Reproductive Rights Lourdes Rivera called the bill “dangerous and unconstitutional” and said that her organization “is prepared to answer any attempt to undermine 40 years of Supreme Court precedent with the full force of the law." For many anti–abortion rights advocates and lawmakers, the hope in passing a bill that they know will be challenged in court is that it will eventually make its way to the Supreme Court, where it may have a chance of chipping away at nationwide abortion laws.
The “Gestational Age Act” is unusual not only in that it bans abortion so early in pregnancy, but also in the reasoning for that time period. Laws imposing 20-week bans usually reference the disputed idea that a fetus can start to feel pain after 20 weeks of gestation. But Mississippi's new bill is less specific: It cites moral opposition to the method of abortion frequently used in the second trimester of pregnancy (dilation and evacuation), and claims that abortions after 15 weeks have a greater chance of causing harm to the pregnant woman. “[The] legislature finds that the intentional commitment of [dilation and evacuation abortions] for nontherapeutic or elective reasons is a barbaric practice, dangerous for the maternal patient, and demeaning to the medical profession,” the bill reads. According to a report from the Centers for Disease Control released in November, only about 8% of the abortions performed after 14 weeks between 2005 and 2014 occurred after 14 weeks. A 2009 Columbia University study of abortion procedures used by National Abortion Federation members found that the rate of medical complication for an abortion increases 38% for each additional week of gestation beyond 8 weeks. Mississippi has long had some of the most strict abortion laws in the country. The state has a “trigger law,” which would immediately make abortion entirely illegal in the state should Roe v. Wade (the constitutional decision that made abortion legal in the US) be overturned. The state also requires women seeking abortions to undergo an ultrasound and wait 24 hours between that and having the procedure. Jackson Women's Health Organization is the only abortion clinic left in the state. Even before this ban was in place, the clinic didn't provide abortions after 16 weeks of pregnancy, making the passage of this law largely symbolic.

The seniors collecting diplomas at one of two commencement ceremonies scheduled at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Saturday are in a slightly better position than last year's graduates. The National Association of Colleges and Employment (NACE) is expecting that employers will be hiring four percent more graduates in 2018. In a recent survey done by NACE, college seniors were asked to determine which aspects of a job they find most important. The top five responses included:
Opportunity to develop job-specific skills (84%)
Opportunity to develop applied skills (82%)
Job security (82%)
Friendly co-workers (81%)
Good benefits package (74%)
More than 3,000 students ranging in age from 16 to 72 years will graduate from UNLV at a ceremony at the Thomas & Mack Center. The graduation comes at a time when Las Vegas is adding business sectors outside of gaming and tourism to build inroads and create jobs. In a comprehensive report done in November by the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance (LVGEA), the organization listed the top-ranked, high-demand jobs that have strong growth over the next decade or two. The medical and technology fields were significantly highlighted in the report, but jobs spanned a variety of sectors to include this partial list:
Financial Managers
Pharmacists
Cost Estimators
Software Developers
Registered Nurses
Computer Programmers
Landscapers/Groundskeepers

Boko Haram: 11 Million “Out Of School” Children In Northeast Nigeria – UN
The UN Special Envoy for Global Education, Mr Gordon Brown, has said that there are about 11 million out-of-school children in northeast Nigeria due to the destructive activities of the Boko Haram terrorists.
Brown, a former British Prime Minister, made this known while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in New York, USA.
He said that his commission was already intervening in the situation.
The UN envoy, who chairs the Commission on Financing Education Opportunity, explained that the commission was giving more funds to help the Nigerian education system move forward.
According to him, the commission and Acting President Yemi Osinbajo are already discussing ways to secure global funds to address the education challenges confronting the northeast.
“We think there are probably around 11 million children that are not in school. We know that the Boko Haram attacks remained a huge problem and the terrain too. “These have prevented girls, particularly, from going to school and we know that there have been many abductions. “And they are still tragically many of the girls that were kidnapped from Chibok that have not returned,” Brown said.
The former British premier, however, said his commission wanted every child to be safe at school, adding there is a new proposal to attract resources to fund the project.
The UN education, who announced a envoy lauded the 30 million dollars Nigeria's Safe Schools Initiative launched in April 2014, describing it as a novel idea.
“We want every girl to be safe and particularly girls but also boys and girls to be safe when they go to school. “The Safe Schools Initiative is designed to help fortify the schools and also help the telecommunications between the schools and prevent the attacks. “This is so people can get advanced warnings and to give people the security that there might be some better protection in case there was an attack. “So the Safe School Initiative has been something that other countries adopted since Nigeria led the way. “The Safe Schools Initiative is being implemented in different parts of the world but obviously we need more resources into the Nigerian system and that's what this new proposal is about.”

CALGARY, Alberta (AP) — An airline pilot is facing charges in Canada after police say he was found by his co-pilot passed out in the cockpit of a Boeing 737 before it was set to take off.
Calgary police say the gate crew as well as crew members on the aircraft indicated that Miroslav Gronych was behaving strangely ahead of his scheduled flight Saturday. Sgt. Paul Stacey says the co-pilot later found the 37-year-old captain “slumped over in the seat” of the airliner.
The pilot was escorted from the plane and charged with having a blood-alcohol level above .08 and controlling an aircraft while impaired. Police allege Gronych had three times the legal amount of alcohol in his system.
Sunwing Airlines calls it “a very unfortunate matter.”
The Mexico-bound plane later took off with another pilot.

Sophie Brussaux and Drake dated for an unknown amount of time in 2017. The two were spotted at a restaurant in Amsterdam together, and a couple of months later, Brussaux announced that she was pregnant.
Before giving birth, Brussaux claimed that Drake was the father of her child and she even hired an attorney to protect the baby's rights. Drake denied the claims, but vowed to do right by the child, if it was indeed his kid.
Drake has never admitted to fathering the child, but rapper Pusha-T just released a diss track in which he calls out Drake and says that Drake is indeed the father of “Sophie's” son, “Adonis.”
Neither Brussaux nor Drake have responded to Pusha-T's claims.
Here's what you need to know:
1. Pusha-T Rapped About Drake & Brussaux in ‘The Story of Adidon'
Pusha-T released a new song called “The Story of Adidon.” The track calls out Drake and basically outs him as the father of Brussaux's 7-month-old son, whom Pusha-T says is named Adonis.
Fans have watched this Drake/Pusha-T feud play out by way of diss tracks. For example, Drake made mention of Pusha-T's engagement to Virginia Williams in his track, “Duppy Freestyle.” And Pusha-T rapped about Drake's family on Jay-Z's “The Story of OJ.”
The release of “The Story of Adidon,” seems to have upped the ante. On the track, Pusha-T raps about Drake, making mention of “Sophie” and her son, “Adonis.” In case his intentions weren't clear, he also shared a photo of Drake wearing blackface on his Instagram page. The photo has since been removed by Instagram.
You can read the lyrics from “The Story of Adidon” below.
Sophie knows better, ask your baby mother
Cleaned her up for IG, but the stench is on her
A baby's involved, it's deeper than rap
We're talkin' character, let me keep with the facts
You are hiding a child, let that boy come home
Deadbeat mothaf**** playin' border patrol, ooh
Adonis is your son
And he deserves more than an Adidas press run, that's real
Love that baby, respect that girl
Forget she's a porn star, let her be your world.
2. Brussaux's Son Has the Same Birthday as Drake & Rumors That Drake Was the Father Resurfaced Earlier This Year
Call it a coincidence, but Brussaux's son has the same birthday as Drake — October 24. Drake was not present when Brussaux gave birth to her son. According to Vulture, she welcomed the baby in her home country of France. Drake was in Los Angeles, celebrating his 31st birthday, at the time. He was photographed at popular Los Angeles restaurant, Catch.
Over the past few months, Brussaux has only posted one picture of her newborn son on her Instagram account, according to Vulture. Other outlets claim that she posted a few pictures of her baby boy and that Drake actually followed her on Instagram afterwards.
“[The rapper] followed Sophie Brussaux on Instagram after [she] posted photos of her and young son flying on a private plane,” BET reported back in January.
3. She Hired a Lawyer After She Got Pregnant
A post shared by rosee divine (@frenchrosebud2) on Apr 10, 2015 at 8:24am PDT
Brussaux was quick to protect her unborn child, likely fearing that Drake would deny paternity and not take care of the child that Brussaux claimed was his.
At the time, Brussaux claimed to have text messages from Drake in which he allegedly encouraged her to get an abortion. You can read the alleged texts below.
Drake: “I want you to have an abortion.”
Brussaux: “I can't kill my baby simply to indulge you sorry.”
Drake: “Indulge me? F*** you.”
Brussaux: “What?”
Drake: “You do know what you're doing you think you're going to get money.”
A rep for Drake responded to Brussaux's claims, according to TMZ.
“This woman has a very questionable background. She has admitted to having multiple relationships. We understand she may have problems getting into the United States. She's one of many women claiming he got them pregnant. If it is in fact Drake's child, which he does not believe, he would do the right thing by the child,” the rep said.
4. There Have Been Rumors That Brussaux & Drake Are Working Things Out, But He's Been Linked to Several Other Women This Year
Brussaux is a former porn star who lives in France. She has been raising her son in her home country and it's unknown if Drake has ever met the child. Although Drake has not confronted the baby rumors publicly, various outlets have reported that he's trying to work things out with Brussaux.
For the past few months, there has been some chatter that Drake reconnected with Brussaux and that the two had been working on their relationship in an effort to raise their son together.
“Several online blogs also published photos of Drake and Sophie together fueling speculation that they'd reconciled and that Drake was the father of her young son, Adonis,” BET reported.
Drake has been romantically linked to a few women in 2018, but has yet to make anything official. He has been spotted with Instagram model Malaika Terry, dancer Reka Nagy-Miticzky, television personality Lateysha Grace, and singer/songwriter Raye.
5. Several People Have Been Posting Comments on Drake's Instagram Page
A post shared by rosee divine (@frenchrosebud2) on Sep 12, 2015 at 2:43am PDT
Drake has been silent on social media for a couple of days now, but Instagram users have been sure to voice their opinions about the situation.
“Drake … what kind of father are you?” wrote one user.
“I just found out this dude slept with a porn star and was called a dead beat dad…damn,” added a second.
“Pusha ain't win, Drake ain't respond yet. Drake won round 1 with duppy now it's his turn to respond for round 2,” wrote a third, suggesting that the Drake/Pusha-T diss track feud isn't over.
Neither Drake nor Brussaux have responded to any of the rumors.

MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) – Minnesotans are proud of the Bold North, and they're also proud of their favorite pizza spots – whether it's Red Savoy's ‘Sota-style or Punch's Neapolitan.
But how do Twin Cities pizza shops compare to those on the East Coast?
Providing some context – as well as cause for Midwestern indignation – is Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, who does by-the-slice pizza reviews, among other sports blogger things.
While in town for the Super Bowl, Portnoy – aka Davey Pageviews – tried several Minnesota spots as requested of his audience. All places were critiqued on their cheese slice and off Portnoy's first bite.
Here's how they fared:
Black Sheep Coal Fired Pizza (Score: 8.3)
—-
Portnoy actually critiqued Black Sheep's pizza over the summer, while in town for a Kyle Rudolph charity event. It earned a respectable score of 8.3, with its “cheese drippin' like a glacier.” No other Minnesota slice earned a higher score. Portnoy really like Black Sheep.
Pizza Lucé (Score: 5:3)
—-
The beloved late-night pizza spot – known for crazy toppings – didn't do much at all for Portnoy.
“People said Pizza Lucé is good pizza, shame on them,” Portnoy said. “This pizza is like a 5.3. This isn't good pizza.”
Cossetta (Score: 6.8)
—-
The St. Paul Italian staple fared better than Lucé, but that bite from Black Sheep still looms large.
“It's a Minnesota mush, bobsled slice,” Portnoy said. “Very cheesy…but Black Sheep puts the beat-down on this.”
Young Joni (Score: 7.6)
—-
Don't let that “official” score fool you. Portnoy admits that his first bite – the bite of judgement – was taken while the slice from the hip, Northeast Minneapolis pizza joint was still a bit too hot. He suggests, toward the end of his review that his real score for Young Joni was approaching the Black Sheep benchmark.
Football Pizza (Score: 6.8)
—-
For the renamed Crescent Moon Bakery, the response was lukewarm. While Portnoy said the football-shaped pizza was good, it didn't stop him from smearing it all over his shirt as some sort of joke.
“Football Pizza, it's actually not a bad description for it,” Portnoy said. “It's just basic pizza.”

Editor's Note: Throughout the year, the Coast Guard sends its men and women out to assist mariners in hazardous situations. Some of that assistance comes by air.
BOURNE, Mass. — Freezing rain? Teeth-chattering temperatures? Limited visibility? Coast Guard aircrews are still ready to fly.
At Air Station Cape Cod, aviation maintenance and electronic technicians work around the clock to ensure the MH-60 Jayhawk helicopters are ready to launch. But there is one thing the maintenance crews and pilots cannot control — winter weather.
“The weather here is worse than the two tours I did in Alaska, icy and bitter cold,” said P.O. 2nd Class Andrew “Sully” Sullivan, an aviation electronic technician who transferred to Cape Cod from Sitka, Alaska.
“Icy weather conditions are considered 14 to 35 degrees Fahrenheit or below with visible moisture in the air,” said Lt. Tyler Dewechter, a Jayhawk helicopter pilot at Air Station Cape Cod.
When the forecast calls for visible moisture, the risk of flying gets more challenging for the pilots and crew. Visible moisture can limit the pilots' ability to fly as high as required in order to use the aircraft's instruments.
According to Dewechter, the difficulty with flying around Cape Cod is that these conditions often occur at all altitudes. The air base is landlocked and none of the runways extend into a body of water where there would be fewer obstacles in the flight path.
“To safely fly, we need to have a 300- to 400-foot ceiling and at least a one mile visibility,” Dewechter said.
According to Lt. Ben Wolhaupter, another Jayhawk pilot, a flight ceiling is when the sky is covered by at least 80 percent cloud coverage and is measured by the height of the layer of clouds above the ground.
“For example, if one looks outside on a foggy day, the ground to the line of fog is called the ceiling,” Wolhaupter said.
According to Dewechter, Cape Cod's cold weather often requires precise visual navigation under very low ceilings and low visibility to safely navigate from the airfield to the scene of a search and rescue case.
Depending on the weather, pilots can either rise above the moisture in the air or fly under it thanks to joint policies and procedures or the Coast Guard and the Federal Aviation Administration in order to fly during search and rescue cases in severe weather that would ground commercial aircraft.
The Jayhawk is also the only search and rescue helicopter in the Coast Guard's fleet from Maine to northern New Jersey able to deal with the icy weather because it is equipped with both engine anti-ice and blade deicing systems.
Both anti-ice systems are spread out on the outside of the helicopter and around parts of the rotor blades, windshield and engines.
Sullivan said the anti-ice detector for the engines is mounted on the starboard engine and provides information to the anti-icing system. The blade deicing system is in the rotor head and tail rotor and it activates only if enough ice has accumulated.
“Ice buildup adds extra weight and changes the aerodynamics of the helicopter,” said P.O. 3rd Class Jeremy Reed, another aviation electronics technologist at the air base.
Reed said wires run along the rotor blades and an electronic pulse is sent out when there is ice buildup, melting it and keeping the blades in working order. When the system is activated, the pulse hits two blades at a time to not upset the helicopter's weight.
“If all four blades are done at the same time, it could knock the helicopter out of the sky,” Sullivan said.
A Jayhawk helicopter crew generally includes two pilots, a flight mechanic and an aviation survival technician. The flight mechanic is qualified on all the components of the helicopter necessary to keep it flying.
During a normal flight, the side door remains closed, but during a rescue operation it is open so the flight mechanic can operate the hoist. In order to keep warm and battle the winds of the rotor blades, the flight mechanic wears multiple layers of clothing.
“We know we are going to be cold and wet,” said Reed. “Between the rotor blades pushing heavy winds down on us to the sea spray being kicked up because of the winds from the blades, it is inevitable.”
Flight mechanics may wear up to three layers under their aircrew dry coverall. This suit has rubber neck and wrist seals to keep the aviator warm and the water out. It doesn't replace having the helicopter's heater running though.
“We are willing to sweat to make sure our aircrew stays warm,” Dewechter said.
The pilots do not have to worry about the cold weather coming in from the open door during operations; they are protected in the cockpit. However, in addition to flying in the frigid conditions, pilots have to make sure there is enough fuel to return home when the anti-ice system or heat is flowing through the aircraft.
“Under standard flying conditions the heat and anti-ice system cannot run at the same time,” Dewechter said.
The pilots and crew must consider weight and fuel consumption. The weight of individuals in the helicopter consumes a set number of fuel gallons. Running the heaters for the crew and survivors consumes additional fuel as well.
According to Dewechter, difficult decisions must be made to balance the need for the anti-ice system and the additional fuel burn of the auxiliary power unit on the helicopter to warm survivors pulled from the water.
But that's not the only challenge where fuel is concerned.
“When icing conditions are present certain locations are no longer available for landing and close attention must be paid to fuel management and weather conditions in order to make sure we can land safely following a rescue,” Dewechter said.
When an aircrew is returning from an off-shore search and rescue case and freezing rain is pounding down on the helicopter, the crew knows the anti-icing systems will keep the ice to a minimum for a safe return home. Coast Guard aircrews are trained and know what to do and how to perform their missions in the ever changing and always challenging New England weather.
RIYADH: The Ministry of Labor and Social Development yesterday revealed that 1,392 domestic workers left the female workers' shelter (guest house) and departed to their home countries during the Hijri month of Shawal. Meanwhile, preparations are underway to repatriate all other domestic workers after completion of their formal procedures.
The female workers' shelter receives runaway domestic workers and offers them care until their cases with their employers are resolved and their repatriation arranged.
The ministry said that it is keen to provide these workers with full protection and help them obtain their full rights before sending them to their home countries.
Ministry spokesman Khalid Aba Al-Kheil said that the regulations for domestic workers stipulate that in case of any disputes, one party should launch an official complaint against the other with a domestic labor arbitration committee.
In another development, the ministry has launched an electronic performance system for its employees to improve their capabilities and develop their performance.
The ministry said failure to use the system may have undesirable consequences for the employee, such as exclusion of the employee from promotions records.

In the foothills of the Aspromonte mountains in southern Italy, the silence of a once-dying village is broken by the laughter of a small group of refugees.
Tiny Sant'Alessio has been welcoming families and vulnerable migrants here for three years in a project which not only provides humanitarian assistance but brings with it invaluable economic and social benefits.
The post Video: Nigerian refugees, others bring dying Italy village back to life appeared first on Vanguard News.
A street camera recorded an airplane destined for the North Las Vegas Airport crashing and bursting into flames on a golf course, killing all six people on board.
A street camera recorded an airplane destined for the North Las Vegas Airport crashing and bursting into flames on a golf course, killing all six people on board.
In the the video released by Scottsdale Police, the plane entered the top right corner of the frame, moved to the upper left corner of the frame, then dove to the ground, creating a bright flash, then a large rising ball of fire.
Scottsdale Airport cameras had also captured the moments before the Piper PA-24-260 crashed.
The National Transportation Safety Board released an aviation accident preliminary report last week, detailing the April 9 crash in Arizona. That surveillance video showed the occupants, three women and three men, boarding the six-seat plane Monday night at 8:28, the report said.
The Scottsdale Police Department identified the victims as Helena Lagos, 22; Iris Carolina Rodriguez Garcia, 23; Mariah Sunshine Coogan, 23; Anand Kamlesh Patel, 28; Erik Valente, 32; and James Louis Pedroza, 28.
Lagos, Valente and Pedroza were residents of Las Vegas, authorities confirmed.

According to the report, two of the women boarded the aircraft first and sat in the two rear seats and were followed by the third woman and a man who sat in the middle seats. The student pilot occupied the front left seat and the airline transport pilot sat in the front right seat.
The report did not specify who was flying the plane at the time of the crash.
Surveillance video from the west side of the runway showed the plane departing from runway 03. In the video, it appeared that the airplane's wings were rocking during and shortly after rotation, the report said.
An additional traffic camera located at the end of the departure runway captured the plane executing a left turn. The report said as the plane's turn progressed, the aircraft began to descend and its wings became nearly vertical.
The cameras lost sight of the plane, but captured a fireball on video seconds later when the aircraft impacted the ground at the TPC Scottsdale Champions Golf Course, which is located about one-fourth of a mile north of the end of the departure runway, the report said.
Investigators said the main cabin of the aircraft was mostly consumed by fire, the inboard section of the right wing became separated, most of the left wing was separated and the majority of the plane was crushed.
The wreckage of the aircraft was moved to a secure facility for further examination. A full detailed investigative report of the crash can take up to 18 months to complete.

Let's go back in time for a minute. It's June the 24th, 2016, the day after the Brexit referendum. To most pundits' surprise, the UK has narrowly voted to leave the EU. But something strange is happening.
The economy isn't falling off a cliff, as some had predicted. There's no imminent, self-inflicted recession. And the Treasury's prediction that 800,000 jobs are about to disappear - its worst-case scenario - also appears overcooked.
So what's actually happened to the economy since the vote? And what impact will Brexit really have?
No. True, the pound dropped 10% immediately after the result. There's been little recovery against the euro. But the pound has climbed back up to the $1.35 mark.
Inflation has risen. So things like bread and chocolate are more expensive for you and me. And the economy is about 1.9% smaller than pro-Brexit economists expected it to be at this point. That's a £38bn annual loss.
What about the future?
On March 29th, 2019, the day Britain officially leaves the EU, not much will change. The transition deal means the UK will probably stay in the single market and customs union until December the 31st, 2020.
Businesses can rest easy, for now, knowing that goods, capital, people, and services will continue to flow freely. What's less certain is what sort of customs arrangement the UK and EU will agree on and what trade deals the UK can strike when it's free to set its own tariffs on goods.
Ah, yes, those top secret documents, the ones that show the government's own analysis of how Brexit will affect the economy. So what do they tell us?
For a start, they say that almost every sector of the economy in every UK region will be worse off under all likely Brexit scenarios. Depending on how hard the Brexit is, the losses are expected to be large, 2% of national income or £40bn a year if Britain stays a member of the single market and adopts Norway's relationship with the EU, 5% of national income if Britain just has a free trade deal with the EU, or 8% of national income if there's a very hard Brexit and Britain trades with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules.
In each case, the government expects tax revenues will be hit, even though less money will be transferred to Brussels. The net losses are expected to be between £20bn and £80bn a year.
Both the Bank of England and the Office for Budget Responsibility now think the UK economy won't grow faster than about 1.5% a year. But, of course, all of this economic modelling depends on a lot on things we don't know.
Will manufacturers be able to import parts from across the EU without big delays at borders? Can companies hire the EU workers they need? Will there be new regulatory barriers erected?
Companies are reluctant to invest heavily in the UK until there's clarity over the outcome of the Brexit talks. Britain's long-term economic relationship with the EU should become clearer in the autumn.
Oh, and one more thing. The EU withdrawal bill still has to make its way through Parliament and clear a lot of hurdles before anything is set in stone.
MATHEWS COUNTY, Va. (WAVY) — A 1-year-old boy died at the hospital on Thursday after authorities say he was left alone in a bathtub in Mathews County.
At 12:20 p.m. on Thursday afternoon, a 911 call went to Gloucester County authorities. According to court paperwork, an unresponsive one year old had been scalded in the bathtub at a home on John Clayton Memorial Highway, and when the mother returned the child's head was reportedly face down in the water.
The child was taken to Riverside Walter Reed Hospital, and died shortly after arriving.
On Friday, WISH-TV's sister station WAVY visited the mobile home, where the mother lived with two children.
“I wish people would leave me alone. I wish people were considerate and not in my face right now. I left him for five minutes,” the child's mother said. “You know what, get out of my face.”
She has not been charged.
Mathews County Social Services has been contacted and are working to investigate the case, alongside the Sheriff's Office.
The Office of Richmond's Chief Medical Examiner will be performing an autopsy.
“She left a child in the bathtub in scaling hot water; I can't imagine; it is hard to fathom that,” said neighbor Patricia Griffin.
The memo is a critique of the FBI's application for surveillance amidst the Russia Probe.
House Republicans and their allies have long argued that the House memo released Friday would demonstrate that the Trump-Russia investigation had its roots in an FBI fraud.
But the Republican memo doesn't support that theory, even if everything alleged in it is true, according to analysis by NBC News. (And Democrats, the FBI and the Justice Department insist that much in the memo is deeply misleading.)
Before the memo was released, House Republicans said it would show that the entire investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller was based on an improper act: a reliance by the FBI on a tainted dossier, funded by Democrats and written by a former British intelligence operative.
Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton, a right-wing activist cited on Twitter Friday by President Donald Trump, has called the Mueller investigation the “fruit of the poison tree” that “needs to be shut down.” The poisonous tree legal metaphor means, essentially, that if the government obtains evidence from illegal acts, it can't use that evidence to prosecute somebody.
Trump Says He's Declassified GOP Memo on Russia Probe
President Donald Trump announces he's declassified a memo on the Russia election meddling probe over the objections of the FBI, saying that it is “a disgrace what's happening in our country” and that “a lot of people should be ashamed of themselves.” (Published Friday, Feb. 2, 2018)
But now that the memo is out, such arguments have been called deeply into question.

The same approach could work for GAC or another Chinese carmaker with deep enough pockets, suggested Joe Phillippi, head of AutoTrends Consulting. “We could see a mad scramble among the top three of four players in China to tie up with an American partner and FCA is the one most open.”
Marchionne has been openly looking for another partner and has approached a variety of potential Western allies, notably including General Motors, which turned him down flat. While Marchionne has most often suggested his goal is an alliance, he has not ruled out the sale of his company and, during a recent conference call with industry analysts acknowledged he would even consider selling off specific FCA brands.
What's for Sale?
The primary focus likely would be on the company's two crown jewels, Jeep and Ram. Light truck sales are booming worldwide and, in the U.S. now account for almost two-thirds of the new vehicle market. Jeep sales have slid slightly this year, but only because of production issues related to a planned expansion of the brand. An all-new version of its iconic Wrangler model, for example, will soon start rolling off a completely refurbished plant in Toledo, Ohio. An assortment of new models, including a Jeep pickup and the reborn Wagoneer flagship model are in the pipeline, as well.

Is FCA About to Sell Off Jeep and Ram?
“The timing couldn't be better for a sale,” said analyst Sullivan. “While every other automaker is struggling with declining sales and bloated inventories of passenger cars, that's not something that FCA has to deal with since they have a much less car-centric line-up.”
The question is what would be left if either Jeep or Ram — or both — were sold off. The two remaining U.S. brands, Chrysler and Dodge, have seen their product line-ups largely scaled back over the last several years, reflecting the rapid decline in sedan and coupe sales. The Fiat brand continues to struggle, especially in the U.S. And the planned, $6 billion revival of the Italian Alfa Romeo brand is still in the early stages.
For his part, Marchionne has said he also sees great potential for Alfa and the even more upscale Maserati brand in China.
Chinese Ownership After a Billion-Dollar Bailout?
How a Chinese acquisition of FCA would play out is far from certain, especially in today's political climate. There could be strong opposition to the sale of a company saved only with the help of U.S. taxpayers — though FCA ultimately paid back the U.S. Treasury, unlike rival General Motors.

China, on the whole, is facing the threat of trade sanctions by the Trump administration because of a lopsided trade balance. In March, National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro declared “unacceptable” China's policy on imports of foreign-made autos. The country has a 25 percent tariff on American-made vehicles. It also requires foreign companies such as FCA, Ford, and General Motors to enter an alliance with local Chinese companies if they want to produce vehicles in that country.
China hasn't been the only target. In January, the new president warned Toyota it could face a “big border tax” if it didn't shift more production to the U.S.
During his presidential campaign, Trump also repeatedly went after Ford for planning to shift small car production from an American plant to Mexico. Curiously, he was essentially silent when Ford more recently said it would, instead, build its compact Ford Focus in China.
“The Ford decision shows how flexible multinational companies are in terms of geography,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross responded to that announcement.
Nonetheless, with the president now putting Chinese trade back in the spotlight, anything that might boost the trade imbalance — and high-dollar cars could do that quickly — might trigger a sharp rebuke. But by acquiring FCA and retaining — and perhaps even expanding — its U.S. production base, some observers believe a Chinese automaker could enter the market without stirring up trade frictions.

ALBANY, N.Y. — The Latest on the latest Siena College poll showing Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo has big leads over potential Republican challengers and former “Sex and the City” story Cynthia Nixon, who announced Monday she'll challenge Cuomo in the Democratic primary (all times local):
2:40 p.m.
A poll released a few hours before Cynthia Nixon announced she'll challenge New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for the Democratic nomination shows the incumbent has a big lead over the former “Sex and the City” star.
Nixon made her announcement Monday afternoon, about eight hours after a new Siena College poll showed the two-time incumbent governor was favoured by 66 per cent of registered Democrats, while 19 per centfavoured the 51-year-old actor.
The poll also showed Cuomo leading two potential Republican challengers — Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro and state Sen. John DeFrancisco — by wide margins.
The poll of 772 registered voters was conducted March 11-16. The margin of error is plus-minus 4.0 percentage points.

The latest Siena College poll shows Gov. Andrew Cuomo holding big leads over two potential Republican challengers as the Democrat seeks a third term in office.
The poll released Monday found that registered voters in New York state prefer Cuomo over Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro by 57 per cent to 29 per cent. They also favour Cuomo over state Sen. John DeFrancisco, of Syracuse, 57 per cent to 28 per cent.
Democrats overwhelmingly favour Cuomo over a potential primary challenger, actress Cynthia Nixon, by 66 per cent to 19 per cent. There have been reports Nixon, best known for her work on HBO's “Sex and the City,” is considering challenging Cuomo in the September primary.

FREMONT — A low-speed non-injury collision between a driver and a cyclist last week led at least three of the injured rider's companions to punch the driver in his face and an unknown number to vandalize his 1969 Chevy Camaro, police said Monday.
At 8:48 p.m. Friday, the Camaro was traveling at 10 miles per hour when it struck a cyclist, who was taking part in a large group ride, at Farwell and Eggers drives, police said.
Although the cyclist was not hurt, members of the cycling group responded aggressively and the driver headed several blocks west to the campus of Mattos Elementary School, 37944 Farwell Drive.
Dispatchers took a call from the driver's wife, who told them about 200 people were confronting her husband. A different caller nearby let dispatchers listen in on the resulting confrontation, with the driver yelling “get off my car.”
Officers responded with lights and sirens, arriving to find most of the group gone, and found that three different cyclists had struck the driver, a 73-year-old man, and vandalized his car.
Police said a Fremont police sergeant spoke with group organizers, who said members had taken BART from around the Bay Area to participate.
Friday's ride by the East Bay Bike Party, a longtime monthly mobile gathering of Bay Area cyclists, was a “sensation lights” themed gathering. Riders of various skill levels had planned to meet at Fremont BART station at 7:45 p.m. before an 8 p.m. start time along a 15-mile route ending at the Warm Springs/South Fremont BART station.

As an airshow pilot, I often get asked, “How do you deal with flying a low-level airshow when you're having a bad day?” It's a good question and one that I've struggled with myself. Like fighter pilots, airshow pilots have unique challenges and distractions to deal with. Airshow pilots live their life in the public flying aerial displays during all of life's events—relationship break ups, death of a family member and even death of friends at the same airshow. I have learned that continuing to perform and stay focused during life's challenges requires being able to set those things aside at least temporarily and focus only on the mission I am required to do. After I started flying, and especially flying competitively, I found that I could train staying focused and block out distractions—and with practice, I learned to “compartmentalize.”
We'd all love to wake up every single morning, yawn and stretch and jump out of bed feeling our best. That's not going to happen. No matter how well we eat, sleep and keep excesses in check, let's face it, some days are better than others. Life gets in the way and things that are often out of our control—a midnight phone call with bad news, an argument, dealing with relationship or job issues—all tend to throw us off balance. Yet we still need to rise and greet the day, showing our best side to the world without burdening everyone else with our personal roller coaster of emotions. The show must go on.
One of the reasons I enjoy aviation so much is that I get to rise above the mundane. To be a safe pilot, we have to put aside life's complications even before starting the engine. But when faced with adversity and life's challenges, how do we perform at our highest level? Whether a professional pilot or a weekend flier, we need to set those things aside, compartmentalize them, when stepping into the cockpit, keeping distractions to a minimum.
It's impossible to achieve peak performance without sublimating certain areas of our life for periods of time. When we have to focus on one activity without distraction, compartmentalization is the key. There are various definitions, but basically compartmentalizing is being able to separate parts of your life into isolated compartments. A pilot can't afford too much distraction while performing functions critical to safe flying, so the ability to block out distractions is extremely important. Understanding airplane systems and practicing procedures contribute to the safe operation of an airplane, but staying focused without distraction can be key to performing them. You must be able to fly the airplane when the tower is squawking, you're in the pattern, your passengers are asking questions, and something falls off the panel into your lap.
The military has long used and studied the concept of compartmentalization in the cockpit, and the technique has long been used by fighter pilots and athletes who have a “mission” that requires complete focus for a specific period of time. In “The Lifestyle Keys to Flight Deck Performance of the Naval Aviator—Another Window” author Frank E. Dully Jr. writes that “IT WOULD APPEAR to this flight surgeon that cockpit information systems and other forms of aircraft performance measurements are designed for use primarily by an uncluttered mind, capable of assimilation and interpretation with uncommon accuracy, in order to make the judgments and take the appropriate actions that will sustain safe flight.”
But ignoring distraction and staying focused is not always easy. For example, you have prepared for a cross-country flight and have filed an Instrument flight plan because of bad weather along your route, but you and your partner have had a fight, and you can't get it out of your mind even though you know you must focus your full attention on your flight. We know it will be critical to focus on the flight without distraction, but sometimes it's just really hard.
Here are a few things that have helped me learn to use compartmentalization when dealing with adversity and extreme challenges in my flying career:
Use Rituals.
Checklists, procedures, a practice, flight and sleep apps are all helpful. Falling asleep can be a challenge for most of us at times, and I have used sleep rituals as a way to get better at compartmentalizing. When I was competing, I “flew” my aerobatic routines every night in my head to help me sleep, visualizing each maneuver. Every night I “flew” the routine with a different wind component, and after a short time I would fall asleep halfway through the routine. Now I have a sleep app that I've used for several years, and I'm so conditioned to it that when I start it at night, I immediately become more restful listening to the sounds of soft breaking waves. It's a form of conditioning that brings me into a mind-set conducive to falling asleep, and a way to compartmentalize the thoughts racing around my head.
Prepare for Fewer Distractions. Plan Ahead.
Since I have a hard time eliminating distractions and it's easy for my mind to go off on a tangent, I have to practice focusing on eliminating distractions before I begin something—whether a flight, writing an article or working on a project. If you're easily distracted, focus is something you can set yourself up to achieve. For e.g., If you're planning a flight, clean up the cockpit beforehand; don't leave things like papers or charts on the glare shield that can fall on your lap; tell your passengers beforehand that you need a sterile—e., quiet—cockpit during take-off and landing. I always plug my cell phone into a charger before I take off, so if it falls off the seat I can easily reach it. If I'm writing an article, I set aside a specific time to do it, then clean off my desk and turn off my phone.
Identify the issues You're Dealing with Ahead of Time.
Decide you will set them aside to deal with them at a later, more meaningful time.
Get Away from it All.
If you're at home, set aside a specific place for certain activities. If you're in a busy environment with a lot going on, isolate yourself for a period of time. If you are at an FBO, go to the flight planning room or another quiet area if you need to clear your head and get away. Airshow pilots mean chill in their cars with the AC on before flying, getting away from people and other distractions. I purposely don't even read anything heavy and just look at fashion magazines or listen to music, nothing that clutters my mind. I don't believe in superstitions around airplanes, but we all have our rituals. Use them to your advantage.
Your ability to compartmentalize, prioritize and focus enough time on each area in order to make incremental progress toward a conclusion may be your most important skill. We actually have more experience with it than we realize, and the skill is rather innate. As kids we are trained to compartmentalize. For most kids the day is divided into play time, school time, homework time, TV time, reading and bed time. In a sense, we are trained to compartmentalize our entire life to get through trauma and adversity—we have to go to school, we have to show up for work, we have to keep our emotions in check at the hardest times. But learning to compartmentalize doesn't happen overnight. To learn to block out distraction and learn to focus in order to perform takes practice and intent. Move forward in incremental steps, and you will see the progress.
Once you start to compartmentalize your life and your flying, you will notice growth in all areas of your life. After I visualized my aerobatic routine while trying to go to sleep, night after night, I found that when I entered the box at a competition, I had already “flown” the routine, and that is when I started to win. I had learned to block out distractions and control my nervousness by focusing on only one thing. To be your most productive self, it is key. When you master compartmentalization, it will change your life.

Sunday Holiday, the family entertainer which was released on 13th July 2017 has already earned the superhit status in Kerala. The movie, which features Asif Ali and Aparna Balamurali in the lead roles, is directed by Jis Joy.
When it completed the first 30 days at the Kerala box office, Sunday Holiday has successfully entered the 14-Crore club. The Asif Ali movie has made a total gross collection of 14.27 Crores from the Kerala releasing centres.
It is a highly impressive collection for a film, which was made with a medium budget and released without much huge pre-release hype. The word of mouth publicity has immensely helped Sunday Holiday, in reaching the audiences.
Sunday Holiday had made a strictly average opening at the Kerala box office, by collecting Rs. 1.27 Crores within the first two days. The movie had crossed the 7-Crore mark within the first 10 days, and 13-Crore mark, within the first 25 days.
Alencier Ley Lopez and Sruthi Ramachandran has essayed the other pivotal roles in Sunday Holiday, which is produced by Maqtro Productions. The outside Indian box office collection report of the Asif Ali movie is expected to be revealed soon.
By Christie Melhorn, October 6, 2017 —
When I took up West African dance in high school, I was met with a lot of intrigue, confusion and ignorance. Friends, family and even strangers would ask, “What is that?”, “Why would you want to do that?” and the very misinformed “But you're white?”. My socioethnic status and experience level has never excluded me from Calgary's dance and athletic community. In contrast, the community's desire to enrich others through different cultural traditions and training styles has been welcoming.
On Sept. 29, UNDRCARD Boxing Studio proved to share this initiative with its pilot run of “Bruk Out Boxing” — a boxing class fused with reggae and dancehall. The class was designed and led by studio co-founder Joanna ‘Magik' Majcherkiewicz and Decidedly Jazz Danceworks and Pulse Studios instructor Sabrina Naz.
Majcherkiewicz's extensive athletic background includes professional snowboarding and downhill mountain biking. She even DJs, making her no stranger to how music can profoundly affect mood and movement. She says Bruk Out Boxing was inspired by the rhythmicality of reggae and dancehall — music genres originating from Jamaica characterized by a thick, indulgent bass and smooth tempos serrated by offbeats.
“Boxing has a lot of rhythm — flow and timing are all important,” she said. “If you're tense all the time, you don't fight as well and waste energy. Dancehall and reggae are very complementary to boxing. I wanted to incorporate the music here but also include the moves.”
As an experienced afro-caribbean dance teacher, choreographer and performer, Naz was Majcherkiewicz's first pick to collaborate with.
“We have structured UNDRCARD to break down the barriers to boxing,” Majcherkiewicz said. “We want to make it really unintimidating and culturally inspiring — not just inspiring through what instructors say and how you feel after a great workout but also through art and visuals. Sabrina is an amazing dancer who gets UNDRCARD's vibe.”
Majcherkiewicz's value of quality sensory engagement is evident in UNDRCARD's bright and open layout. The studio's white and black walls are energized by pops of yellow and light hardwood furnishing. Natural light generously filters in from sprawling windows at the front, illuminating the in-studio cafe, Yo Adrian, which is open to the public.
Bruk Out Boxing took place in the group class studio — a dark spacious room fitted with 34 punching bags. Naz and Majcherkiewicz designed the class to provide a dynamic, intense workout and introduce new types of movement to attendees.
“The goal was to provide a place where people could enjoy their workout but also have that party-fun element — to let the words fun and work amalgamate,” Naz said. “This kind of event opens [boxing] up to a totally different demographic. Dancing takes a lot of mental and physical strength and vulnerability. There is strength in art and in sports — both of those together is really beautiful.”
“Boxing is a full body workout — cardio and strength. It works every muscle and your coordination. It also takes discipline not to gas out easy,” Majcherkiewicz added. “My goal is to make it unintimidating, fun and for people to want to make [being physically active] a lifestyle.”
Enjoyment resonated in the studio before the sold-out session even started. Yo Adrian was bustling and anticipation electrified the air. The staff remained kind and efficient despite the busyness. Since it was only my third time boxing, Majcherkiewicz ensured an UNDRCARD member helped me with tying my hand wraps, making me feel welcome and supported.
The studio's energy only amplified as class began. Our cardio warm-up was followed by a rotation of boxing combos, freestyle hits, dancehall choreography and isolated exercises, such as planks. Cued by song changes, Majcherkiewicz and Naz traded off instructing but remained engaged throughout the session, running and jumping through the room and shouting words of encouragement — which I appreciated since my arms felt like they were going to fall off.
The dim room was illuminated by flashes of different colourful lights that synced nicely with the mood and pace of specific songs and types of activity. As dancehall music and dance emerged out of Jamaican club environments, the nightclub-inspired setting and opportunity to freestyle echoed the genre's improvisational nature.
At one point, Majcherkiewicz flicked the lights to a golden yellow and warm red to mimic a sunset. Coupled with the room's humidity, the atmosphere felt reminiscent of clubs I visited in Trinidad and Tobago while on a dance and culture study with the University of Calgary. Fond memories rose to the surface, further rooting me in the moment.
But the most memorable part of the class occurred after it ended. A dance party emerged between a few of us who lingered in the room, including Naz and Majcherkiewicz. Maneuvering around the bags, we freestyled and dutty wined — a traditional afro-caribbean step that involves circulating the hips. People came sprinting back from the locker room to join in. The sense of community and elation was incredible and carried over into the rest of my evening.
As someone with experience in afro-caribbean dance, my positive experience in Bruk Out Boxing may be biased. But UNDRCARD's uplifting vibe transformed my vulnerability as a novice boxer into motivation and enjoyment. I not only had a killer workout but bonded with a room of people who, with the exception of Naz, I had never met before.
Bruk Out Boxing elegantly merged different cultural traditions and forms of exercise to nurture the mind, body and spirit. My only criticism of the night was that the class didn't feel long enough! However, the class's success will surely inspire more sessions. In the meantime, you can learn more about UNDRCARD Boxing Studio by clicking here or by visiting their Instagram account.

President Trump's Department of Justice gave its expert witness a second chance on Tuesday to make a convincing case against AT&T's proposed $85 billion buyout of CNN-owner Time Warner.
Earlier in the trial, Carl Shapiro was embarrassed by Judge Richard Leon, who referred to his testimony on modeling cable price increases as a “Rube Goldberg” contraption.
Meaning it was unbelievably, excessively complicated.
The return of Shapiro — a University of California Berkeley professor — included plenty of theatrics, and what at least some AT&T supporters see as another embarrassing gaffe.
The government asked Shapiro to rebut AT&T's expert witness.
The bespectacled academic started out well in replying — saying Time Warner cherry-picked the worst numbers to make it look as though prices would not rise by much.
But it went south from there, according to reports.
AT&T lawyer Dan Petrocelli got Shapiro to admit that the economist didn't know that poll results cited during the trial were changed to show AT&T's potential blackout power was greater than it actually is.
The poll showed 10 percent of DirecTV subscribers thinking of switching to Charter Communications would stick with DirecTV should AT&T black out Turner content from Charter.
The poll result was changed from 6 percent just before Charter agreed to testify at the trial, Petrocelli said, to make the effect of a potential blackout more potent.
Shapiro has testified to the 10 percent — and said he didn't know the earlier result was 6 percent.
At one point, Shapiro said Petrocelli, who often kept his suit jacket buttoned during the trial, had good flair, but that he stood by his numbers, according to Bloomberg.
On Thursday, both the Justice Department and AT&T lawyers will reconvene — and Shapiro may or may not be called to further testify. Closing arguments are slated for next week.
Drivers on Interstate 55 into and out of Chicago may knock as much as 15 minutes off their trip in each direction if toll lanes are added to the highway, according to state officials.
The Illinois Department of Transportation is evaluating the possibility of adding toll lanes along I-55 between Interstate 355 and Interstate 90/94. IDOT's plan calls for two express toll lanes in each direction between Interstate 294 and I-90/94, and one toll lane in each direction between I-355 and I-294.
As the project is in its preliminary stages and no funding has been identified, all things are on the table, including possible private ownership of the toll lanes in a public-private partnership, according to Steve Schilke, major projects unit head for IDOT District 1.
“We are looking at toll lanes along with this being a general expressway,” Schilke said. “Nothing is ruled out right now. Those toll lanes might be through a private entity.”
Schilke noted that the Chicago Skyway has been privatized and the lanes are no different than other toll highways in the state.
He said that the Stevenson Expressway's inner median would be reduced in both directions to avoid taking land for the highway improvements. Pavement markings, not barriers, would separate the free lanes from the toll lanes, Schilke said.
Schilke said it was determined that sectioning off the toll lanes with physical barriers would increase the likelihood of accidents.
“We did look at physical barriers of some type when we started looking at the improvements,” Schilke said.
Poster boards, a video and IDOT staff laid out the proposed I-55 improvements during a public open house last week in the Stadium Club at Toyota Park in Bridgeview.
Jim Zilinsky of Crest Hill saw and heard the information, but said he feared that people looking to avoid paying a toll and heading into the free lanes would create more accidents on the highway.
“How is IDOT going to keep accidents from happening, by telling people they have to follow the stripes?” asked Zilinsky.
Schilke admitted that is a concern of IDOT officials at this time.
A frequent user of I-55 until going into “semi-retirement” recently, Zilinsky said that cameras may have to be used to keep people from veering over into the free lanes when it comes time to pay the toll.
He said the highway department's track record on projects does not give him confidence that the Stevenson Expressway improvements will come out as well as everyone hopes. He said IDOT continues to put traffic lights at the end of exit ramps which does nothing but increase the number of accidents as people try to beat the lights.
Zilinsky said merge lanes, such as are provided at I-55 exits on Route 83 and Lemont Road, are much safer alternatives.
“I've never gone by and seen an accident on Route 83 or Lemont Road,” the Crest Hill resident said.
The state has already received federal approval to build one managed lane in each direction of I-55 between I-355 near Bolingbrook and I-90/94 in Chicago. IDOT's revised project proposes to add a second managed lane in each direction from the Tri-State Tollway east.
Improvements would be made in existing IDOT right of way. Trucks would not be allowed in the toll lanes. Public buses would be able to use the toll lanes free of charge.
Overhead toll collection via transponder would take place just like is done on Illinois Tollway roads.
IDOT officials say the additional capacity will make it easier to maintain consistent, reliable speeds and travel times for all I-55 users.
People wanting more information about the project or looking to provide their comments can do so at www.i55managedlaneproject.org.
Schilke said with funding for their work still undetermined, no timeline is yet in place for the I-55 project. The next major step in the project would be a public hearing on the project, likely sometime in the spring.
Steve Bahnsen does not even have an I-PASS as he is a very infrequent tollway user, but still felt it was important to attend last week's open house to see what is planned for the roadway.
“It looks like a solid plan they have here,” the resident of Chicago's South Loop said. “They need to enhance I-55. They need to get people into the city.”

Until fairly recently, a meeting was thought to be successful if it met its financial and learner outcome goals. And while those are still important, a recent white paper posits that it's time to stop focusing solely on the outcomes data and shift to making meetings more human-centric experiences. In the white paper, Maritz Global Events President David Peckinpaugh says, “In fact, while good meetings have well thought out logistical execution, great meetings enrich the hearts and minds of our guests.”
Janet Sperstad, CMP, program director with Madison College, outlined the white paper's five key elements for designing a more purposeful meeting at a keynote at this year's IMEX America show in Las Vegas. As Sperstad said, “It's about providing a rich experience that supports people performing their best.”
1. Behavioral science—how people act and interact and think when in a social setting. “Where we once were fascinated by cyberspace, the new frontier is now inner space,” Sperstad said, adding that it's just as important to understand how people think as it is to understand what they think. That's because what we experience actually changes the physical tissues of our brains. Our brains are our bodies' social organs, she said, and we like to exercise them at events through conversation—“70 percent of conversation is social. We even dream socially. We evolved as humans together in a pack.” This makes events powerful forums of influence.
“Ninety-three percent of communication is nonverbal,” she said. “We have to exchange that energy, to see what you're not saying as well as what you are saying. If you want information, go to the Internet. If you want wisdom, go to meetings.”
Planners can make their meetings more purposeful by nurturing the social connection and sense of belonging that are such strong influencers on behavior and decision-making, she said.
Tips:
• Use storytelling to make your messages your meaningful, using data to back up the facts illustrated through the story.
• Use an “audio-scape” to synchronize the brainwaves of participants as they walk into the event space.
2. Health and well-being—how to nourish the mind through taking better care of the body through food, sleep, exercise, and mindfulness. “The brain is like a glass of water—it can only hold so much. If you keep pouring more information in, it will just spill over. Planners can help the brain digest.”
Tips:
• Along with reminding attendees to download the app and make their hotel reservation, also remind them to sleep a full eight hours and get some exercise before they head to the meeting so they're better prepared physically for the event. When they're on site, ensure that guest rooms have blackout curtains and otherwise are conducive to sleep. You can even provide pictures of your participants' loved ones in their room to ease the stress of being separated—and get it sponsored.
• Build in some mindfulness elements that help participants manage their stress levels and feel more energized. One quick-and-easy idea she shared was to put a note on the mirrors in the restrooms reminding people to take three deep breaths while they're washing their hands. Also consider asking speakers to give participants a 120-second “palette cleanser” to take three deep breaths.
• Think about when you want participants to expand their attention to take in the whole space, and when you want them to narrow their focus. “We can leverage sound and light to create bigness and energy in the room,” Sperstad said. “Other times we need to bring the focus down.”
• Give more thought to your breaks. For the comfort breaks, can you provide some natural light, the sound of trickling water, and the smell of a freshly peeled orange to provide stimulation for participants' senses? Connecting with natural elements helps people think more clearly, Sperstad said; research has shown that groups that look at meadows and gardens outperformed groups that looked at a cityscape. “Any time you can pick a room with a view, do it. Daydreaming is where ideas come from.”
• Provide nooks and crannies where people can hang out and regroup before running off to the next session.
3. Event design—building new experiences that will maximize performance. Sperstad said, “It's time we stop being the architects of exhausted people” by offering the same old “imbalanced agenda” that has people running from morning coffee and muffin to general session to breakouts to lunch to more breakouts to receptions. Instead, event strategists should build agendas that balance active participation with downtime, learning with laughter, and content with connection, she said.
Tips:
• Think about building your agendas around how participants' energy naturally ebbs and flows over the course of the day. For example, slot in lots of interaction and problem-solving first thing in the morning when participants' brains are fresh. Follow that with cognitive and comfort breaks, and don't ask people to multitask over lunch. Let them eat without having to listen to a speaker, she suggested. “Don't drain the brain's battery.” And that post-lunch dead zone? “It's actually a beautiful time for reflection, peer-to-peer sharing, and case studies,” she said. Later in the afternoon is a good time for thinking and collaborating in those nooks and corners you're providing. Top it off with a rousing closing session full of light and sound to activate their emotions.
• Declutter with right-sized sessions. Don't stress out your attendees by asking them to sit still for an hour or longer and absorb information. Break down the information into smaller, well-defined chunks that can fit into 45-minute breakouts.
• Think about how you can limit the size of the audience to help participants make those vital connections. Sperstad talked about the Dunbar number, defined by researcher Robin Dunbar as the maximum number of people anyone can maintain a solid relationship with. That golden number, she said, is 150. Do meetings larger than that really help people learn and connect most effectively? While the white paper doesn't answer that question, it's one that the industry should look into in more depth, said Sperstad.
• “Layer how you want people to feel over the logistics,” said Tahira Endean, event producer, BC Innovation Council, in a followup session. Think about just one thing you want participants to feel when they leave your event, then think about what you could add or change to make that happen.
4. Positive Impact—including activities that can drive new levels of meaning and connectivity. Community engagement programs also can help provide a richer, more purposeful experience, she said.
Tips:
• Start by asking the local community what it needs, how you can involve local individuals and organizations in your project, and what you can do to leave a lasting legacy. “It has to be real and authentic,” she said.
• Put effort into minimizing any negative impact your event could have on local resources, from increased traffic to producing trash and food waste.
5. Technology—using tech to enhance ideas, connections, and creativity. Social media, video streaming, gamification, virtual reality, artificial reality, apps…the list of tech available to enhance events keeps growing. The challenge is how to use it in a human-centric way to reduce anxiety, create a conducive mood, or bring people's brains more in sync. “We need to create a new currency of magical moments in our world,” Sperstad said, mentioning an IBM Watson-driven LED “cognitive dress” created for the 2016 MET Gala. The lights on the gown changed colors in real time based on the moods being expressed on Twitter.
Tips:
• It's not about the platform or the data per se, but rather about how they can best be used to enhance the participant experience.
• The Starbucks app lets patrons order and pay for their coffee before they go pick it up. Would it be possible to do something similar for dinearounds to avoid that awkward moment when the time comes to split the check? “Technology needs to help us make real-time changes,” she said. “We are the architects of time and space.”
The white paper, called “Purposeful Meetings: How to plan with deeper meaning, innovation, and insight in mind” (free registration required for downloading the PDF), was authored by Sperstad and Amanda Cecil, PhD, CMP, associate professor, Indiana University, and sponsored by IMEX Group and PSAV.

Three women who have publicly accused President Donald Trump of sexual misconduct will sit down Monday with NBC's Megyn Kelly to address their claims.
In an exclusive interview on "Megyn Kelly Today," Jessica Leeds, Samantha Holvey and Rachel Cooks will share their stories, which range from groping to making lewd propositions.
Trump has repeatedly denied the allegations, which date back three decades, and has publicly accused the women of lying. According to The New York Times, Trump has also recently denied to some political allies that it was him in a 2005 "Access Hollywood" tape where he was recorded bragging about crude and degrading behavior toward women, even though he directly confirmed the remarks and apologized for them a month before the presidential election last year. More than a dozen women stepped forward during the 2016 elections to allege sexual misconduct by Trump.
Responding to NBC News, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: "The president addressed these accusations directly during the campaign and we have no changes."
Trump Endorses Roy Moore in Campaign-Style Rally

"Megyn Kelly Today" will air at 9 a.m. ET.
Later Monday morning, a group of women who have also publicly accused Trump of sexual harassment and assault will hold a press conference in New York City to call for accountability and a congressional investigation of sexual misconduct by the president.
"The women will share their firsthand accounts of President Trump groping, fondling, forcibly kissing, humiliating and harassing women. They are among the at least sixteen women who have come forward to accuse the president of sexual misconduct. Their disturbing allegations came to light before the post-Weinstein era of accountability for sexual misconduct and the rise of the #MeToo movement," wrote Brave New Films, which has produced a documentary featuring the womens' stories. The event will be live-streamed.
The women's press conference comes amid a torrent of sexual misconduct allegations that have toppled high-profile men in news, politics and entertainment, among them, Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, Louis C.K., Russell Simmons and Kevin Spacey.
This past week alone three U.S. politicians announced their resignations over allegations of misconduct.
Democratic Rep. John Conyers, of Michigan, a civil rights hero who'd been the House's longest-serving current member, resigned after facing sexual harassment allegations.
Trump Comments on Franken Allegations, But Not Moore
President Trump criticized Democratic Sen. Al Franken after a sexual harassment allegation against him, but Trump remained silent on Alabama Republican Roy Moore's alleged misdeeds with teen girls. NBC's Blayne Alexander reports. (Published Saturday, Nov. 18, 2017)
Republican Rep. Trent Franks, of Arizona, resigned as well, effective Jan. 3, after admitting he had asked two female staff aides about becoming a surrogate mother.
Senator Al Franken, a rising political star only weeks ago, reluctantly announced he's resigning from Congress, succumbing to a torrent of sexual harassment allegations and evaporating support from fellow Democrats. But he fired a defiant parting shot at Trump and other Republicans he said have survived much worse accusations.
Last week, Time Magazine named the people who spoke up about sexual misconduct as its Person of the Year for 2017.
On Tuesday, Alabama residents will vote in a U.S. Senate election in which the Republican candidate, Roy Moore, has been accused of sexual misconduct with teenagers decades ago when he was a county prosecutor. Moore has denied the allegations, and he has found support from President Trump in recent days.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Sunday broke the Trump administration line when she said 16 women who have accused Trump of sexual impropriety have the right to be heard.
"I know that he was elected," Haley said on CBS' "Face the Nation." "But, you know, women should always feel comfortable coming forward. And we should all be willing to listen to them.”

Mark Williams's Godly detective is set to solve even more cases in the Cotswolds
Our prayers have been answered: crime-solving cleric Father Brown will be back for a seventh series.

Harry Potter's Mark Williams, who plays the titular crime-fighting priest, will once again don the white collar for the Daytime BBC1 drama, based on the stories by GK Chesterton.
Mrs McCarthy (Sorcha Cusack), Inspector Mallory (Jack Deam) and Bunty Windermere (Emer Kenny) will also all be back to assist Father Brown in solving a new set of mysteries, while Nancy Carroll is slated once again to play Lady Felicia, who will return to Kembleford from Northern Rhodesia in need of help. And Brown's nemesis Hercule Flambeau (John Light) may be the only one who can provide it…
The BBC also say another “familiar face” will show up in the Cotswolds when a killer is spotted in the area, circumstances which will put Sergeant Goodfellow (John Burton) “in grave danger”.
“In this series we see anarchists, ramblers and Morris Dancers all throwing up new adventures for Father Brown but as ever, he's more concerned with saving souls that in just bringing the guilty to justice,” said Will Trotter, Head of Daytime Drama, BBC Studios.
Since it first aired in 2013, Father Brown has become BBC's most popular daytime drama, averaging over 2.3 million viewers. The show has also been seen in 150 countries and is the most popular BBC programme in both Norway and Sweden.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Saturday claimed complete vindication from a congressional memo that alleges the FBI abused its surveillance powers during the investigation into his campaign's possible Russia ties. But the memo also includes revelations that might complicate efforts by Trump and his allies to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry.
The four-page document released Friday contends that the FBI, when it applied for a surveillance warrant on a onetime Trump campaign associate, relied excessively on an ex-British spy whose opposition research was funded by Democrats. At the same time, the memo confirms that the investigation into potential Trump links to Russia actually began several months earlier, and was “triggered” by information involving a different campaign aide.
Christopher Steele, the former spy who compiled the allegations, acknowledged having strong anti-Trump sentiments. But he also was a “longtime FBI source” with a credible track record, according to the memo from the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and his staff.
The warrant authorizing the FBI to monitor the communications of former campaign adviser Carter Page was not a one-time request, but was approved by a judge on four occasions, the memo says, and even signed off on by the second-ranking official at the Justice Department, Rod Rosenstein, whom Trump appointed as deputy attorney general.
Trump, however, tweeted from Florida, where he was spending the weekend, that the memo puts him in the clear.
This memo totally vindicates “Trump” in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2018
“This memo totally vindicates ‘Trump' in probe,” he said. “But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their (sic) was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!”
The underlying materials that served as the basis for the warrant application were not made public in the memo. As a result, the document only further intensified a partisan battle over how to interpret the actions of the FBI and Justice Department during the early stages of the counterintelligence investigation that Mueller later inherited.
Some Republicans are citing the memo, released over the objections of the FBI and Justice Department, in their arguments that the Mueller investigation is politically tainted.
A closer read presents a far more nuanced picture.
“Having decided to cherry-pick, the Nunes team picked a bunch of the wrong cherries for its own narrative,” Matthew Waxman, a Columbia University professor and former Bush administration official, wrote in an email.
The memo's central allegation is that agents and prosecutors, in applying in October 2016 to monitor Page's communications, failed to tell a judge that the opposition research that provided grounds for the FBI's suspicion had been partially funded by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee.
Page had stopped advising the campaign sometime around the end of that summer.
Republicans say a judge should have known that “political actors” were involved in allegations that led the Justice Department to believe Page might be an agent of a foreign power — an accusation he has consistently and strenuously denied.
Steele's research, according to the memo, “formed an essential part” of the warrant application. But it's unclear how much or what information Steele collected made it into the application, or how much has been corroborated. Steele was working for Fusion GPS, a firm initially hired by the conservative Washington Free Beacon to do opposition research on Trump. Steele didn't begin work on the project until after Democratic groups took over the funding.
The FBI this week expressed “grave concerns” about the memo and called it inaccurate and incomplete. Democrats said it was a set of cherry-picked claims aimed at smearing law enforcement and that releasing the memo would damage law enforcement and intelligence work.
For one, Democrats said Friday that it was misleading and incorrect to say a judge was not told of the potential political motivations of the people paying for Steele's research.
Beyond that, though, the memo confirms the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign began in July 2016, months before the surveillance warrant was sought, and was “triggered” by information concerning campaign aide George Papadopoulos. He pleaded guilty last year to lying to the FBI and is cooperating with Mueller's investigation.
The timing makes clear that other Trump associates beyond Page, who was part of the election effort for only a short period and was not in Trump's inner circle, had generated law enforcement scrutiny. The memo also omits that Page had been on the FBI's radar a few years earlier than part of a separate counterintelligence investigation into Russian influence.
The memo focuses on Page, but Democrats on the House committee said “this ignores the inconvenient fact that the investigation did not begin with, or arise from Christopher Steele or the dossier, and that the investigation would persist on the basis of wholly independent evidence had Christopher Steele never entered the picture.”
Other details in the memo could also challenge Republican claims of bias. The warrant requested was renewed on three additional occasions, meaning that judges approved it four times. One of the Justice Department officials who signed off on it was Rosenstein, a Trump appointee.
Trump, who lambasted the FBI and Justice Department on Twitter, was asked if he was more likely to fire Rosenstein and if he still had confidence in the official. The president simply said, “You figure that one out.”
The memo had been classified because it deals with warrants obtained from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The White House declassified it Friday and sent it to Nunes for immediate release.
That disclosure is extraordinary because it involves details about surveillance of Americans, national security information the government regards as among its most highly classified. The release is likely to further escalate the conflict between the White House and Trump's law enforcement leaders.
Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray had personally lobbied against the memo's disclosure, arguing it could set a dangerous precedent.
The memo's release also comes amid an effort by Trump and congressional Republicans to discredit Mueller's investigation. His probe focuses not only on whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia but also on whether the president sought to obstruct justice.

Production of a Brooklyn pilsner called Biëryoncé halted production after Beyoncé, the beer's namesake and label inspiration, ordered the creators to cease and desist. The beer brand was launched this fall and Beyonce's legal team took action as soon as they found out about it. Now, members of the Beyhive can seek out cans as limited edition collectibles.

Lineup Brewing owner Katarina Martinez insists that both the name and the Bey typography-inspired label were intended as a compliment.
“As a Hispanic, female-run business, I am very inspired by her so I thought I'd pay homage,” Martinez told Pitchfork. “We're disappointed she didn't take it as a compliment, but oh well. It was fun while it lasted!”
Bey and her representatives have not commented.
The Biëryoncé brew earned attention from industry bibles, including Bon Appétit magazine, which wrote that it's “perfect for those chilly-but-sunny Sundays when every song that plays from your phone is your favorite song.”
We'd suggest pouring one out in memory of Biëryoncé, but it'd be a shame to waste it.

When producing clubs with the Ben Hogan name, one of the challenges is staying true to what aficionados remember about the brand while bringing the club design into today's modern game. The company has attempted to do just that with the release of its Equalizer wedges, the first new club product from the company in nearly two years.
It starts with the Equalizer name, which is what Hogan's competitors referred to his pitching wedge back during the Hawk's heyday because he was so efficient with the club. Next is the forged head, made from 1025 carbon steel. Those familiar with the Hogan brand are familiar with the soft feel of the company's forgings over the years. The company also stayed true to Hogan's V-Sole, although it has been updated with more bounce and a softer leading edge to accommodate a wider array of attack angles and turf conditions.
That's not to say the new line of gap, sand and lob wedges are stuck in the past. The new wedges boast a progressive center of gravity design where more mass is moved higher in the lower lofts in an effort to bring ball flight down and produce a more penetrating trajectory, before slightly lowering it in the sand and lob wedges—clubs where more height is desirable. The milled faces also feature milled faces where the new groove design is machined into the face.
The clubs are available in lofts ranging from 48 to 62 degrees in two-degree increments. Custom options include lengths, lie angle, shafts and grips. Cost per wedge is $100 in either steel or graphite. Ben Hogan only offers direct to consumer sales via its website at benhogangolf.com . The company also provides no interest financing as well as its Trade Up program where golfers can trade in their old equipment to offset the cost of the purchase.
North American markets took a bit of a beating today as the technology sector fell.
On Bay Street higher gold prices weren't enough to keep lower oil prices from dragging things down. There were early gains in industrials with CN Railway getting a boost in share prices on the back of a first quarter profit, but those gains evaporated as the day went on. The TSX closed down 75 points to 15,477.
On Wall Street big sell-offs in the technology sector and higher interest rates weighed the markets down. The FAANG stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google-parent Alphabet, were the hardest hit. Investors were looking at reports of higher costs, instead of profits. The Dow Jones closed at 24,024, losing 424 points.
Tim Hortons sales were down 0.3 per cent in the first quarter.

NEW YORK (CBSMiami) – A four-year-old girl from central New Jersey is the latest child confirmed to have died from the flu virus.
Health officials say she did not get a flu shot and died in December.
To combat this year's active flu season beyond advising people to get their flu shots, the largest healthcare provider in New York state is taking a new approach.
It's all hands on deck at the emergency operations unit at Northwell Health on Long Island. With a cutting-edge biosurveillance system, they can take information from all their hospitals in almost real time, bypassing the typical one to two-week time lag on information from state and federal health officials.
Vice president of emergency management Mary Mahoney said the system is a game changer. If they see a spike, they are ready to act and send resources if needed.
“So things like do we have enough masks to protect our patients and our families and our staff,” said Mahoney. “If a large number of this population is pediatric population, do we have the appropriate doses of Tamiflu if we're going to be treating them with Tamiflu.”
This season at least 39 children have died from flu-related complications in at least 25 states and that number is expected to rise.
“Kids are vulnerable because of their immune system. They're young, they haven't been exposed to this before, so their body attacks them full on,” said Dr. Eric Gottesman, Director of the Intensive Care Unit at North Shore University Hospital.
When asked at what point should a person go to the hospital if they think they have the flu, Gottesman said,”you're having problems breathing, becoming lethargic, and coughing up yellow, green — a lot of yellow-green sputum– then it's time to get to the emergency room.”
Northwell's biosurveillance unit could become a model for other hospital systems. It could help health officials hone in zip codes and more specific locations for targeted outreach. It could also be used to track and respond to other infectious disease outbreaks in the future.

A body has been recovered during a search for a Canadian diver who went missing off Malin Head in the Republic of Ireland on Saturday.
The body was found at a World War Two shipwreck off the County Donegal coast, according to Irish broadcaster, RTÉ.

Its spokesperson said the man got into difficulty 16 miles north of Malin Head.
TORONTO — Two Ontario cabinet ministers announced Friday they won't seek re-election next year, adding to a growing tally of prominent Liberals bowing out at a time when the party struggles in the polls.
Both Deputy Premier Deb Matthews and Treasury Board President Liz Sandals, however, insist that is not the reason for their upcoming departures.
Matthews will remain as the Liberals' campaign co-chair through the election, saying she has enormous respect for Premier Kathleen Wynne.
"I am confident that, on June 7, 2018, the people of Ontario will give her and her team the mandate to continue to serve," Matthews wrote in a statement Friday.
Various polls would suggest a different outcome, however, with most putting the Liberals behind the Progressive Conservatives, and one survey even putting the Liberals in third, behind the NDP.
Sandals, 70, stressed that her 30 years of service and her age were behind her decision to retire.
"This was a challenging decision to make because while I'm ready to be a full-time grandmother, I've never had more faith in Premier Kathleen Wynne and the Ontario Liberal Party," she wrote in a statement.
"Over the last several months, I've spent time knocking on doors across Guelph and I know that our policies are resonating with my constituents."
Matthews, who was elected in 2003, will stay as the representative for London North Centre and as advanced education minister until the election. Sandals, who first got into politics through her local school board and was elected to the legislature in 2003, will stay as the representative for Guelph, Ont., and in cabinet until the election, too.
Economic Development Minister Brad Duguid announced last month that he would not run in next year's provincial election.
Former environment minister Glen Murray recently left government for the private sector, and Speaker Dave Levac, the Liberal representative for Brant, and Monte Kwinter, Ontario's oldest MPP, have also announced they won't seek re-election.

EUGENE, Ore. — Two Oregon pot shops say they're getting harassed for having a similar name to another marijuana business owned by a white nationalist.
The Register-Guard reports that Oregon Growers Analytical, known as OG Analytical, is a state-accredited marijuana testing lab, whose owner has been linked to white pride events and neo-Nazi groups.
Now, two other pot businesses, Eugene OG in Eugene and OG Collective in Salem, say they've gotten harassed by phone for the name mix-up.
Those businesses say they have nothing to do with OG Analytical.
Days earlier, OG Analytical's Bethany Sherman issued a statement saying she's not a neo-Nazi but that she was proud to be white.
Sherman also said she would resign and sell the company she founded, which verifies pot potency and pesticide contamination.

If you want a job that rides the wave of the future, get hired by a firm that combats cyber-threats.
Criminal and malicious hackers are endlessly inventive and every day despatch novel viruses and other digital threats into cyber-space to wreak havoc.
Getting paid to tackle This is about as cutting edge as you can get.
One emerging discipline in this field of cyber-incident response tackles the most skilled and serious of these hackers - those who work for nation-states.
The UK's GCHQ now estimates that 34 separate nations have serious, well-funded cyber-espionage teams targeting friends and foes alike.
The threat from these state-sponsored digital spies has been deemed so serious that the intelligence agency has designated five firms victims can all on if they are caught out by these attackers.
"We get called when people have a big fire and we come along with our hoses and try to put it out," says James Allman-Talbot, head of incident response in the cyber-security division of BAE Systems.
Image copyright BAE Image caption "We're like the fire service," says BAE's James Allman-Talbot
That captures the fact that, more often than not, the fire brigade arrive to find a building still in flames. When it comes to cyber-fires, that means the hackers are still embedded in a victim's network and are still trying to steal data or burrow more deeply.
Unlike the fire service, the BAE team do not arrive in a blaze of lights and sirens. They have to be more stealthy.
"If the attackers have access to the victim's email servers the last thing you want to do is discuss it on there," says Robin Oldham, head of the cyber-security consulting practice at BAE, who is also part of the incident response team.
Tipping off the bad guys could prompt them to delete evidence or, if they have more malicious motives, shut down key systems and destroy data, he says.
Instead, responders first gather evidence to see how bad the incident is and how far the hackers have penetrated a network.
It's at this point that the team use the skills picked up during earlier careers. All of the team have solid technical computer skills to which they have added particular specialities.

Prior to working at BAE, Mr Allman-Talbot did digital forensics for the Metropolitan Police and Mr Oldham has significant experience running large complex networks.
The good news about most organisations is that they typically gather lots of information about their network and often it is anomalies in the logs that expose suspicious activity.
But that extensive logging has a downside, says Mr Oldham.
"It can mean we have a large amount of data to work with and analyse. In some cases that means a few hundred million lines of log files."
Once incident response teams get their hands on data from a victim they start analysing it to see what has happened.
It's at this point that the allied discipline of threat intelligence comes into play. This involves knowing the typical attack tools and techniques of different hacking groups.

Good threat intelligence can mean responders hit the ground running, says Jason Hill, a researcher at security firm CyberInt.
"If you understand how they operate and deploy these tools and use them to attack the infrastructure you know what to look and how to spot the tell-tale signs."
In the past, nation state hackers have tried to bury themselves in a target network and siphon off data slowly.
"Criminal hackers have a more smash and grab mentality. They do it once and do it big," he says.
More recently, he adds, it has got harder to separate the spies from the cyber-thieves.
One example was the attack on Bangladesh's central bank - widely believed to have been carried out by North Korea. It netted the rogue state about £58m ($81m).
Russian groups also span both sides of the divide. Some criminal groups have been seen working for the state and often they use the tools gained in spying for other jobs.

"The motivations of the groups have really become blurry of late," says Mr Hill.
Attribution - working out which group was behind a breach - can be difficult, says Mr Allman-Talbot, but spotting that one attack shares characteristics with several others can guide the investigators.
One widespread attack, dubbed Cloud Hopper, sought to compromise companies selling web-based services to large businesses. Getting access to a service provider could mean that the attackers then got at all its customers.
Thoroughly investigated by BAE and others, Cloud Hopper has been blamed on one of China's state-backed hacking groups known as APT10 and Stone Panda. Knowing how they got at a victim can help free the hackers' hold on a network and reveal all the places that need cleaning up.
Even with up-to-date intelligence on attack groups and their chosen methods, there will still be unanswered questions thrown up by an investigation, says Mr Allman-Talbot.
The joy of the job comes from during investigations as the team figures out how the bad guys got in, what they did and what data they got away with, he adds.
Future of Work
BBC News is looking at how technology is changing the way we work, and how it is creating new job opportunities.
He likens it to solving complex puzzles and problems using experience, good hunches, deep analysis and coding skills. It's a challenging profession that regularly bestows solid intellectual rewards.
"There are lots of eureka moments," he says.
The deep knowledge built up by the responders as they investigate and clean up a breach can also help others that might not even know they have been penetrated, says Mr Oldham.
"There are people that see the smoke alarm go off and pick up the phone and tell us that something is wrong. There are others that we go to and tell them that their house is on fire," he adds.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There's little doubt that the cyber-responder's job is going to get more important in future
Mr Allman-Talbot says some of the satisfaction with the job comes from helping people and making life online safer.
"Just as with criminal cases, there's a real sense of doing good. We are investigating incidents that have badly affected these organisations."
There's little doubt that the job is only going to more important as time goes on. The cyber-spies will not stop and are only going to get better at what they do.
"It's just going to get more and more complex," says Mr Allman-Talbot. "It's the next form of warfare."

Limericks by Bob Aldrich Raider football is rolling the dice.
Moving to a gambler's paradise.
Now can Roger Goodell
Break the Las Vegas spell
And keep NFL teams free of vice?
Say goodbye to the bleak winter gloom,
When the dogwood and daffodils bloom.
As the spring flowers sprout
Each azalea breaks out,
In its rich brightly colored costume
A good landscaper's job is quite hard.
Cutting shrubs by the foot leaves them scarred.
They trim grass by the inch
But good looks aren't a cinch
Because impressions are made by the yard.
Editor's note: This is an updated version of a story first published July 4, 2015.
At the 2018 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, held every Fourth of July on Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, Joey Chestnut claimed his 11th victory by devouring a world record 74 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes, topping the record he set last year. In the women's competition, returning champ Miki Sudo downed 37 for her fifth consecutive win.

The thought of it is enough to make any normal eater queasy. So how do these competitive eaters manage such extreme gorging?
There is not a lot of research on competitive eating and this sport continues to baffle scientists and doctors. However, small studies from gastroenterologists have provided some information.
According to an article in Gastroenterology and Endoscopy News, "After being swallowed (competitors have dozens of swallowing techniques, such as "chipmunking," in which they puff their cheeks out as they stuff their mouths full of food or gulp big bites followed by sips of water), the food mass moves through the esophagus, a portion of the route that takes about 10 seconds to traverse for the first mouthfuls and longer for every swallow afterward as the esophageal pipeline fills up."
Competitive eaters have to learn how to relax their esophagus so that it expands, allowing more food to go down. From there, the hot dog travels to the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), an involuntary bundle of muscles at the low end of the esophagus that prevents acid from getting into the stomach. Competitive eaters have developed various techniques for relaxing these muscles.

In the 2006 book on competitive eating called "Eat This Book," author Adam Nehr writes that competitive eating champion Don Lerman learned to overcome nausea when food hits his LES and relax the sphincter by downing a gallon of water every morning.
Then, once the food passes the LES, it enters the stomach.
A normal eater has a stomach that feels full after consuming about a liter or a liter and a half's worth of food. Competitive eaters learn to stretch and relax their stomachs to fit in more food by eating large amounts of low-calories foods and liquids including water, diet soda, watermelon and cabbage. The stretching does not go on indefinitely, however. As with any competition there will be losers and all competitive eaters will stop when they've reached their limit.
And they might not feel too good afterwards.
The side effects of such binges vary based on the competitor and the food being eaten. Gastroenterology and Endoscopy News states that hot dogs cause the most painful cramps. Other side effects of competitive eating include nausea, painful gas, vomiting, heartburn and diarrhea. More serious side effects could include choking, esophageal inflammation and stomach rupture.
There are always emergency medical technicians on hand during eating competitions in case there is a problem. "Safety is a huge consideration for us," George Shea, emcee of Nathan's Hot Dog eating contest told CBS News before the 2015 competition. Organizers of the competition go over the risks and issues with eaters prior to the competition and all contestants have been professionally trained.
"It's the most intense contest of the year," Shea said. "Generally, after an event eaters are emotionally and physically wiped out and want to take a nap."
But amazingly, the intensity of the competition doesn't stop everyone from continuing to eat. "Sometimes they'll go and have an ice cream after," Shea said.

MIAMI (CBSMiami) – March is colon cancer screening awareness month, aimed at getting people 50 and older to get themselves checked out.
Nobody enjoys getting a colonoscopy, but getting one could save your life.
Just ask Jeff Pine.
Jeff was 54 when he got his first colonoscopy, and the results were not good.
He had colon cancer. Stage 3.
“I got woken up right after the procedure and the doctor say ‘Hey, you've gotta come in my office as soon as they release you here,'” Jeff remembers. “We need to talk.”
He underwent surgery and 6 months of chemotherapy. Thankfully, he is now cancer free.
But as a survivor, he now has an elevated risk of getting it again, so he's been getting screened once a year.
He now understands the importance.
“It's not that big a deal in the scheme of things,” he says. “It's your life. It's worth doing the screening.”
Jeff's doctor is Gary Luckman, of West Broward Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine in Plantation.
Dr. Luckman sees Jeff before the procedure takes place.
“The good news is you did great,” Dr, Luckman says, referring to Jeff's prior treatment. “We're going to make sure you continue to do great.”
Luckman says more people die from colon cancer each year than either breast or prostate cancer.
And, he says, colon cancer is also the most preventable – IF patients start getting screened at age 50.
“If you wait to have symptoms, then your chance of a full cure is much lower than if we find it in a routine screening,” Luckman says.
Colonoscopies allow doctors to find and remove polyps that could, if left alone, one day turn into cancer.
Luckman says for most patients, having a colonoscopy once every ten years is enough.
For Jeff, and others with elevated risk – either because of past disease or a family history – more frequent screenings are needed.
African Americans have an earlier onset of colon cancer risk, so screenings should start at age 45.
Patients who are obese, who smoke, or who have inflammatory bowel disease are also at elevated risk.
Jeff is brought into the procedure room.
“Here comes your cocktail,” says the anesthesiologist as she administers the drug, Propofol, which will put Jeff to sleep.
Dr. Luckman jokes, “We call this milk of amnesia.” Jeff laughs.
He won't remember any part of the procedure itself.
The least pleasant part, as anyone who's had a colonoscopy will tell you, is the prep.
In the hours before the procedure, the patient has to take laxatives to clean the colon.
If the colon is not sufficiently clean, the doctor cannot get a good enough view and the patient will have to go home and come back another day.
A long flexible tube called an endoscope allows the doctor to see the colon. There is a camera and light at the end.
Dr. Luckman is happy with what he sees. “Everything looks nice and clean,” he says. No polyps.
“He was 54 when the cancer was diagnosed,” Luckman says. “If he had come in at 50, I can guarantee you it would have (just) been a polyp. I would have seen it. I would have taken it out.” The polyp would not have had the chance to develop into cancer. “He's lucky. It could have taken his life. Luckily, it didn't.”
A half hour after the procedure, Jeff was awake and happy to hear the results.
Now instead of once a year, Dr. Luckman says he only needs to be screened once every three years.
That's fine with Jeff.
Colonoscopies, he says, are “very easy. There's no big deal to it. It's not a big deal considering the alternative – which is death and cancer. This is well worth it.”

The Serby 2.0 Mock Draft is being held hostage by Kirk Cousins — he likely will land with the Broncos, Jets, Cardinals or Browns. For this mock — 1 through 15 — we'll give him to John Elway, who is desperate for a Win Now quarterback.
In Mock 3.0, we'll marry him to the Jets.
The Raiders and 49ers will have their draft positions decided with a coin flip.
1. Browns
RB Saquon Barkley, Penn State
Hue Jackson plucks this generational running back before the next franchise quarterback. The great Jim Brown applauds the pick.
2. Giants
QB Sam Darnold, USC
The high-character Quarterback of the Future for Pat Shurmur to learn under Eli Manning (and Davis Webb). “Dahnold and Bahkley were at the top of our draft bahd,” general manager Dave Gettleman says.
3. Jets (from Colts)
QB Josh Rosen, UCLA
Woody Johnson risks his U.K. ambassador gig because his new franchise quarterback once wore an anti-Trump cap. Indeed, the president tweets: “Jittery Josh is a Jet. Sad!” He fires Johnson and replaces him with Christian Hackenberg.
4. Browns
QB Josh Allen, Wyoming
Unlike Johnny Manziel, here is a franchise quarterback with prototypical size who is the answer to Cleveland's prayers. Unless they're wrong again.
5. Broncos
FS-CB Minkah Fitzpatrick, Alabama
Aqib Talib is on his way out, so here's a versatile thoroughbred for the No Fly Zone.
6. Colts (from Jets)
DE Bradley Chubb, N.C. State
New head coach Josh McDaniels gets the draft's best pass rusher.
7. Buccaneers
CB Denzel Ward, Ohio State
Brent Grimes is a free agent and will be 35 in training camp. A pass rusher is also a consideration.
8. Bears
LB Tremaine Edmunds, Virginia Tech
A 6-foot-5, 250-pounder who can help Leonard Floyd rush the passer and has drawn comparisons to Brian Urlacher.
9. Raiders
DT Vita Vea, Washington
Jon Gruden will need another wide receiver, but this would be a much-needed 340-pound monster in the middle of his defense.
10. 49ers
G Quenton Nelson, Notre Dame
A nasty, 330-pound bookend for 2016 No. 1 draft pick Joshua Barnett and new bodyguard for Jimmy Garoppolo.
11. Dolphins
QB Baker Mayfield, Oklahoma
If GM Mike Tannenbaum liked Mark Sanchez in 2009, he will love this firebrand to replace Jay Cutler … and maybe Ryan Tannehill as well.
12. Bengals
Tackle Connor Williams, Texas
Andy Dalton has taken a beating the past two seasons because Cedric Ogbuehi and Jake Fisher have not lived up to the hype.
13. Redskins
WR Calvin Ridley, Alabama
Terrelle Pryor was a bust with Washington, and Alex Smith needs another outside threat to go with Josh Doctson.
14. Packers
DE Marcus Davenport, Texas-San Antonio
A 6-5, 259-pounder who might remind new GM Brian Gutekunst and new defensive coordinator Mike Pettine of a young Julius Peppers. Clay Matthews turns 32 in May. Aaron Rodgers is upset once again that he was not consulted on this. Danica Patrick clearly needs to cheer the poor guy up.
15. Cardinals
QB Lamar Jackson, Louisville
Rookie coach Steve Wilks needs his own franchise quarterback since Carson Palmer's retirement. No more talk about switching the kid to wide receiver, please.

BEIRUT — Smoothly and confidently, Syrian President Bashar Assad merged into traffic at a large roundabout in Damascus before driving himself to the suburbs where his forces are battling rebels.
The traffic around him and pedestrians making their way across the busy Umayyad Square gave no indication of knowing who was behind the wheel of the Honda sedan.
His low-profile trip was captured in videos filmed inside the car and released by his office late Sunday and early Monday. They show the president calm and assured as his forces appear close to clinch one of their most significant victories in the civil war.
Syrian troops are on the verge of retaking eastern Ghouta, the last major rebel bastion on the outskirts of the capital, where residents took to the streets against the Assad family's decades-long rule in the early days of the 2011 uprising.
As he drove, Assad, wearing sunglasses, narrated his route to the camera and gave his thoughts on the battle he was going to visit. He said the images of civilians streaming out of eastern Ghouta through a corridor manned by Syrian authorities showed that his government was still popular.
A white pickup seen in several of the videos appeared to be his only escort.
Before the war, Assad was known for driving in Damascus and Aleppo, Syria's largest city, and dining out with his wife. He has maintained a steady, sophisticated propaganda machine on social media throughout the war.
Half of Aleppo now lies in ruins after his forces, with unsparing support from Russia and Iran, destroyed the eastern part of the city to drive out rebels in 2016. Thousands of civilians fled with them and have not been able to return.
The scenario is repeating itself in eastern Ghouta, where government forces are waging a fierce air and ground campaign against a collection of suburbs that have resisted returning to government rule through seven years of war.
Close to 1,500 civilians have been killed in a month of heavy shelling and airstrikes. The government now controls 80 percent of the area held by the opposition in February.
Tens of thousands of civilians have crossed over to government-held areas as the army has advanced in recent days. It is unclear where the government will house them. The fate of thousands of men wanted for military conscription and held on suspicion of desertion or fighting for the enemy remains unknown.
“The painful thing, despite the pride and happiness of this visit, is to see people who have been forced out of their homes and to live rough, because of the war and the terrorists,” said Assad as he entered eastern Ghouta. Outside the window, the landscape turned steadily to wreckage and ruin.

‘Bless You': Last Words Said to Man Killed by Tree Branch
A family is grieving after a man was hit by a tree branch that blew down during strong winds through San Diego County.
Frank Vawter, 74, was getting out of his car at Holiday Park in Carlsbad Thursday when it happened.
"[Frank] sneezed and a very kind gentleman said 'God bless you,' and a tree branch fell and hit him on the head," said Sally Vawter, Frank's wife.
City officials said Frank was struck by a branch that was eight inches in diameter. Firefighters arrived and attempted life saving measures, but he was pronounced dead.
Sally said she is now trying to find the gentleman because he helped her husband as first responders came to the scene.
Sally said Frank was a veteran: a Corporal in the U.S. Marine Corps and father of five children.
"Frank was the best person I've ever met in my life," said Vawter. "He was a good man, very kind-hearted. He loved his children and was a great father."
She added Frank was honored as the citizen of the year for acts of bravery in Mesa, Arizona.
Just two weeks before his death, Sally said Frank had helped the family cut down a problematic tree in the backyard.
"He had never cut a tree in his life before and two weeks later he was killed by a tree, so it seems quite ironic," said Sally.
Sally added the family will always consider Frank to be their hero. They plan to hold a celebration of life ceremony for him.
"We want to celebrate the good times," said Sally. "Not the terrible tragedy that's happened."
Quicken Loans Inc. was sued by real-estate data analytics startup HouseCanary Inc., which accused the mortgage-lending firm of trying to steal its data and technology through a sham licensing agreement so it could develop competing appraisal software.
The lawsuit was filed days after San Francisco-based HouseCanary won a jury trial against the affiliate, Amrock Inc., which calls itself the biggest independent title-insurance and valuation firm in the U.S. Jurors in Texas last week said Amrock stole HouseCanary's trade secrets "with malice" and awarded the startup $706 million in damages.
In its March 16 complaint, HouseCanary claims Quicken officials directed Amrock to secure the licensing agreement in 2015 under false pretenses. Once Quicken and Amrock had what they wanted, Amrock backed out of the deal, refused to pay a $5 million fee and falsely accused HouseCanary of providing useless software that never worked properly, according to the complaint.
Amrock's data science team, which worked closely with HouseCanary, went to work for Detroit-based Quicken in 2016, according to the lawsuit. The next year, Quicken allegedly launched its own automated-valuation tool.
HouseCanary is trying to extract cash from Quicken by using bogus litigation, Quicken Loans Chief Executive Officer Jay Farner said Monday in an emailed statement.
"We will be driven by one thing and one thing only: Defending against the assault on our reputation by unscrupulous actors who exploit the time and cost of litigation and the fear of perceived bad publicity to pressure their targets to write large multimillion-dollar checks for them to go away," Farner said.
Seth Lubove, an outside spokesman for HouseCanary, declined to comment on Farner's claim.

— Raleigh-Durham International Airport officials on Friday displayed mock explosive devices and answered questions about TSA safety procedures and protocols, part of the federal agency's effort to heighten awareness about what the agency does to keep airline passengers safe.
RDU officials said that no incident at the airport prompted the demonstration. The TSAa simply likes to explain why certain security procedures, like taking off shoes, removing laptops and taking out liquids, are essential for safety.
As an explosives expert said at the demonstration, the security steps work.
TSA explosives specialist Tony Aguilera showed off a table of innocuous items that could be vessels for disaster. He pointed out that someone can fit an explosive in the sole of a shoe or even in a flip flop.
When screeners look at shoes in the X-rays, they're trained to look for certain abnormalities. The same goes for computers—they can be rigged up as bombs—and baby bottles, which can contain explosive liquids.
"Before 911, we didnt' have any of this. It was rolled the dice," Aguiler said. "Today, folks are going to be hard-pressed to get explosives through the checkpoint."
Aguiler says agents regularly run through bomb simulators in shoes and other items to see if screeners catch them. The tests are a way the TSA tries to ensure screeners don't get complacent.
The testing is ongoing at airports across the country.
As a society, we promise that education is the key to a better life. But fulfilling that promise requires that institutions of higher education are held accountable, and that there are protections in place to guarantee that education doesn't lead to a lifetime of indebtedness.
Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-Va., the chair of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, introduced a bill last week that fails on all counts, and instead sells out students to corporate interests ready to get rich off taxpayer-backed education dollars. A bill reauthorizing the Higher Education Act should be a real opportunity to help students; this one just makes their lives worse by raising repayment costs for struggling borrowers, letting institutions that scam students off the hook, and narrowing relief for defrauded students.
Foxx's legislation, which pares the six available student loan programs to three (undergraduate, graduate and parental), completely eliminates subsidized loans for undergraduates, which means that students will pay more for their education over time. Currently, students with enough federally-determined financial need can qualify for subsidized Stafford or Perkins loans, in which the federal government pays the interest charged by service providers while the students are in school, which prevents students who qualify from facing more debt after graduation than they borrowed while attending classes.
The forgiveness Rep. Virginia Foxx denies to borrowers in her higher education bill is in abundant supply for proprietary, for-profit colleges.
The bill also fails to increase the maximum Pell Grant award for low-income students, and changes how they are paid out to students who receive them. And, at a time when the student parent population is growing and the cost of childcare continues to be out of reach for many working families and student parents, Foxx's bill does nothing to increase investments to provide on-campus childcare.
Currently, outstanding student debt has reached $1.4 trillion and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has found that there are over 8 million borrowers in default on their student loans. But Foxx's bill eliminates the $0 per month payment for which the lowest income borrowers qualify in certain income-driven repayment plans This change alone would push even more borrowers into default.
It's not the only change that will hurt vulnerable borrowers. According to the National Consumer Law Center, the other changes the bill makes to income-based repayment plans mean that it could take a low-income borrower with just $30,000 in student loan debt an incredible 138 years to repay their student loans.
And beyond those issues, the bill also takes direct aim at those who've committed their careers to public service, by eliminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives federal loans after 10 years for those who pursue work in emergency services, public education, social work, or other public sector jobs.
But the forgiveness Foxx denies to borrowers is in abundant supply for proprietary, for-profit colleges. The Obama-era “gainful employment” rule denies federal financial aid dollars to schools that consistently leave students worse off. Rep. Foxx's bill eliminates the rule, letting schools continue to use taxpayer dollars no matter how bad the outcomes for their students are.
For-profit colleges leave far too many students worse off than when they started taking out loans and reporting to class.
The bill also rolls back a measure meant to ensure that for-profit schools are worth the tuition they charge. The 90-10 rule requires that for-profit colleges receive at least 10 percent of their revenue from a source other than federal student loans. Instead of making the rule stronger (as student and consumer advocates have been asking for years), Foxx's bill eviscerates this simple protection altogether, paving the way to hand over even more taxpayer money to for-profit institutions with no questions asked.
But perhaps the most insulting part of this terrible legislation is the way it treats students who were defrauded by predatory schools. Two giant for-profit colleges, Corinthian and ITT, have collapsed in the last few years, and both schools faced numerous lawsuits and investigations for misrepresentation of job placement rates and other abuses. A decades-old rule known as borrower defense to repayment dictates that, if your school breaks certain laws, you're entitled to a cancellation of your federal student loans.
Nearly 100,000 former students of Corinthian, ITT and other institutions have pursued this right to cancellation, but the Department of Education continues to sit on their applications. In the meantime, their lives remain on hold, with ruined credit and no job prospects, because employers see Corinthian and ITT as a stain, not a boon, on a resume.
Against this backdrop, Congress should be working to expedite relief; instead, Foxx wants to narrow these former students' options even further. Her bill puts new and senseless limits on this relief by denying any help to scammed students who did not individually apply for a discharge within three years of when the misconduct by the school occurred — not when it's uncovered. Many students don't know until long after graduation (often following a slew of rejections by employers) that their education was worthless, let alone that the schools had even committed misconduct or that they're eligible for loan cancellation. Foxx's legislation makes no allowances for these victims, even as it rolls out the red carpet for the types of schools that commit the sorts of abuses that would make students eligible for relief.
For-profit colleges leave far too many students worse off than when they started taking out loans and reporting to class. Foxx had the power to change that with this bill. Instead she turned her back on students to favor the corporate interests who abuse the federal financial aid system in which taxpayers invest in and on which millions of students rely.
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — The Ohio man accused of killing a woman when he allegedly rammed his car into a group protesting against white nationalists rallying in Virginia went before a judge Monday for the first time since the chaos in Charlottesville.
Dressed in a black and white prison jumpsuit, James Alex Fields Jr. appeared in a Charlottesville courtroom via video conference from the local jail and did not enter a plea in connection with the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer at a "Unite The Right" march Saturday.

"No sir," Fields answered when Chief Judge Robert H. Downer Jr. asked him if he could afford a lawyer.
The 20-year-old was assigned court-appointed attorney Charles Webber and given a August 25 return court date.
Fields told the court he earns $600 a week working for a private security company in Maumee, Ohio. During the 10-minute appearance, he mostly kept his head down and avoided looking directly into the camera.
"Yes sir," Fields answered when Downer asked him if he understood everything that was said during the proceeding.
Then Fields was marched back to his cell at the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail.
Fields was arrested shortly after he allegedly plowed his Dodge Challenger through a group of demonstrators, barreling through them like bowling pins. Heyer was killed and 19 other protesters were injured.
It was a deadly coda to day of anger and rage on the normally genteel streets of the southern city that pitted hundreds of white supremacists, Ku Klux Klansmen and neo-Nazis versus an army of anti-racism protesters.
Fields was held on suspicion of second-degree murder, malicious wounding and failure to stop in an accident that resulted in death.
Outside the courthouse, white nationalist Matthew Heimbach barged in on a gathering of reporters and accused them of being "liars" and insisted Fields was "scared for his life" and tried to portray him and the other white supremacists as the victims.

"The nationalist community defended ourselves against thugs," Heimbach insisted. "These radical leftists...they are the one who came to kill us."
Heimbach was soon drowned out by chants of "Nazis go home" and "murderer" and police officers quickly surrounded him for his own protection and escorted him away from the court complex.
Earlier, Fields' mother Samantha Bloom told NBC News and other outlets that she learned of the deadly havoc from reporters who showed up at her home in a Toledo suburb and said she was under the impression that her son was merely attending a political rally — not a nationalist march.
"I didn't know it was white supremacists. I thought it had something to do with Trump," she said. "Trump's not a supremacist."
President Donald Trump has been hit with bipartisan criticism for failing to explicitly condemn the white nationalists for the violence and suggesting the counter-protesters bore some of the blame.

Agnyaathavaasi
Trivikram Srinivas and Pawan Kalyan's Agnyaathavaasi hit the screens during Sankranthi and opened to a good response at the box office despite receiving unflattering reviews from all corners. The negative WOM soon caught up with the film and it ultimately proved to be a disappointment for all concerned. Agnyaathavaasi also had Keerthy Suresh and Aadhi in the lead.
Touch Chesi Chudu
The year started on a bad note for Ravi Teja when his Touch Chesi Chudu opened to a poor response at the box office and failed to impress the critics. Shot against a budget of Rs 30 Crore, it ended with a final distributor's share of Rs 9 Crore and proved to be a disaster. Touch Chesi Chudu also featured Raashi Khanna and Seerat Kapoor in the lead.
Naa Peru Surya
Featuring Tollywood's 'Stylish Star' Allu Arjun in the lead, Naa Peru Surya was one of the biggest releases of the year and hit the screens on May 4, 2018. Unfortunately, it underperformed at the box office and its distributors suffered losses.
Nela Ticket
The second Ravi Teja starrer to feature on the list, Nela Ticket hit the theatres on May 25, 2018 and proved to be a box office dud. It ended with a distributor's share of around Rs 9.5 Crore and received negative reviews.
Officer
Officer marked Nagarjuna's first film with Ram Gopal Varma in over two decades and hit the screens on June 1, 2018. Featuring the veteran actor in the role of a cop, it sank without a trace and failed to impress the movie buffs.
Acting Solwezi District Commissioner Christopher Nyungila has confirmed the development to ZANIS in Solwezi today.
Mr Nyungila said the hammer mills have been strategically located in areas with high maize productivity and population.
He named the areas to benefit from the solar powered hammer mills as Kakombe, Kyafukuma, Mbonge, Sandang'ombe, St Francis and Zangamenu.
Mr Nyungila said the hammer mills will not only create employment for the local people but will also provide a readily market for farmers to sale their maize and also lower the cost of mealie meal.
Meanwhile, Mr Nyungila says government has topped up e-voucher cards for 3,550 farmers out of the 3,934 who have deposited their K400 contribution for the 2017/2018 farming season.
He said 4,380 farmers have been authorized to deposit the K400 contribution out of the targeted number of 5,780 farmers in the district.
Mr Nyungila said the redeeming of inputs has been relatively slow because most farmers are giving incorrect national registration card numbers and passwords thereby being rejected by the system.
He has since appealed to farmers to ensure they submit correct details to agro dealers and redeem their inputs.

MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) – A former city worker in the west metro is charged with soliciting nearly $60,000 in bribes and kickbacks in exchange for city projects.
Ronnie Taggart, the former facilities supervisor for the city of Plymouth, is charged with one count of wire fraud, according to U.S. Attorney's Office.
The 50-year-old allegedly devised a scheme in which he would defraud the city by soliciting bribes and kickbacks in exchange for city contracts.
From 2012 to 2016, Taggart received $58,532 in bribes and kickbacks, authorities say. Often, the bribes would be in the form of home upgrades, such as landscaping work, kitchen appliances and electrical work.
To conceal the fraud, Taggart instructed contractors to submit fake quotations and inflate their bids to cover the cost of the kickbacks and bribes.

You don't want to learn new tricks, you just want to publish your ebook
If you are ready to publish and don't want to take the traditional publishing route, then the quickest and easiest way is to use Kindle publishing.
Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) offers the fastest publishing process for an ebook.
It only takes a few minutes set up your account and start uploading your Kindle ebook.
When you finish publishing your book, it will be available in Kindle stores worldwide in around 24 hours.
Kindle ebooks are by far the most popular ebook format with ebook readers, and Amazon is the biggest seller of ebooks in the world.
If you are new to self-publishing and do not want to go through a long learning curve to publish a paperback then it is an ideal way to become a published author.
Here is a step-by-step guide for Kindle publishing to help you on your way
1. Set up your KDP account
Go to https://kdp.amazon.com/ to begin setting up your new KDP account.
On the welcome page, you will find a short video that explains the basics of KDP and Amazon Kindle.
On the right of the page, sign in using your existing Amazon account.
If you do not have an Amazon account, you will be prompted to open a new account.
Once you are signed in, complete your details in the following form.
When you have completed all your personal details, you will be prompted to enter your payment and tax information.
It is very important to complete all the required information to ensure that you will get paid for sales of your ebooks.
Now you are ready to start publishing.
2. Getting your manuscript and ebook cover ready for publishing.
If you have everything ready, then you can move on to the next step, but you should read on as a quick check.
1. Make sure you save your Word file in .docx file format. This is better suited to ebook publishing and will give you fewer problems with formatting.
2. Use Word headings for your title and chapter headings. The best is to use Heading 1 for your book title on the title page and Heading 2 for all your chapter titles.
3. Run a grammar and spell check. You can use the tools in Word, but a much better way to check your manuscript for errors, typos and mistakes is to use a premium online checker or writing assistant.
I would recommend either Grammarly online grammar checker or ProWritingAid writing assistant.
They are both excellent programs, which I use myself, and are perfectly suited to finding and suggesting corrections in a long text such as a book.
4. Do you have a book cover? If so, you are good to go. But if not, you will need an ebook cover.
If you were publishing a print book you would need a high-resolution custom cover. Very often, an ebook cover is created from this. However, hi-res covers are expensive.
A less expensive way is to buy pre-made ebook covers for between $30.00 to $50.00.
Another ebook cover alternative is free. Go to Canva.com and you can create a cover from hundreds of templates. All you need to do is change the text to your author name and title.
Here is an example of a Canva book cover. It is not too bad at all.
3. Publishing your ebook
Go to your KDP dashboard and select + Kindle ebook.
You will then start completing your new book's details. It is very straightforward, but you should take care when selecting your 7 keywords and 2 categories.
If you would like more details about these two areas you can read this article on how to select the best keywords for your book.
Once complete, click save and continue.
On the next page, your Kindle Ebook Content, you will need to upload your manuscript and your book cover. There is the option to see a preview of your Kindle book.
Make sure you use the online previewer to check that everything is perfect.
Once you are happy, save and continue again, and you will be at the pricing page.
Be careful here! Amazon will prompt you to enrol in KDP Select.
There are some things to consider before enrolling.
Your new book will be included in Kindle Unlimited, and you will receive 70% royalty on all Kindle store sales. However, you will need to grant exclusivity of your ebook to Amazon.
You can read more about the Pros and Cons of KDP Select before you make your decision.
Now you can set your selling price. Always set your royalty option to 70%.
Selling your book at a very high price will obviously reduce your potential sales. But setting it too low can make it look too cheap. The sweet spot is usually between $2.99 to $4.99.
There is the option to vary your price in different markets, but there is rarely a need to change these settings.
The last thing you need to do is hit publish. You're done.
Even though Amazon says up to 72 hours, new kindle ebooks in English are usually published and available for sale within 24 hours.
4. Promoting your book
The most common ways to promote your new Kindle ebook are by using social media or your blog or website to help readers find your book.
There are hundreds of book promotion ideas, and you can read about these in some of our articles.

For new self-publishers, ebook publishing is now the most popular way to find readers. Publishing on Amazon is quick, efficient and your books will be available for sale almost immediately to a worldwide market.
At first glance, the Naba Kusta ashram is beautiful. Standing on a freshly swept patch of dirt, its pink and yellow walls decorated with painted flowers, the little colony in the city of Purulia, West Bengal, looks peaceful. But life has been far from serene for its 34 inhabitants. They have leprosy, a disease that is curable but for its two worst symptoms — poverty and exile.
The patients come from all over India and have received treatment at a local hospital run by the Leprosy Mission. In theory, leprosy is easy to treat, requiring a course of drugs lasting between six months and two years. But many at the government-run ashram, like 64-year-old Rustom Singh Mundu, who has lived there for five months, will not be able to return home even once they have been cured. “My family kicked me out. They said, ‘You'll make everyone ill.' I'm never going to go back home,” he says. Late diagnosis has left Mundu severely disabled — he cannot walk and relies on food donated to the ashram by local landowners. But there is hardly enough to eat, he says.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared leprosy officially eliminated as a public health problem in India in 2005, but the disease is still widespread in regions where, doctors say, poverty and stigma have kept patients hidden and untreated. The problem is, in part, one of definitions: a disease is classed as “eliminated” if fewer than one in 10,000 people contract it in a given year. In India, elimination was achieved on a national level, even as some areas continue to have high prevalence of the bacteria. “There's no scientific basis for why this term is used, but it was a catchy terminology that boosted [aid] efforts across the world,” says a senior public health official who declined to be named. “Unfortunately, what wasn't very clearly communicated to political leaders is what this milestone means.”
Anil Kumar, who leads India's National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP), says the 2005 declaration halted progress, allowing the disease to spread again. Funding and resources fell, he says, and health workers stopped making door-to-door visits to identify hidden cases. Instead, a “passive detection” phase began that relied on people coming forward of their own accord to report the disease.

The result was that the number of patients arriving at hospitals with severe disabilities from leprosy nearly doubled in the following decade, according to government data. During a two-week detection campaign organised by the NLEP at the end of 2016, more than 1,000 cases were discovered in nine states. The government reversed its “elimination” status for the states of Chandigarh and Orissa as well as the so-called union territories of Delhi and Lakshadweep, a tropical archipelago off the south coast.
In Purulia, leprosy bacteria have been found by scientists in the soil and water, through which Joydeepa Darlong, a doctor at the Leprosy Mission hospital, says it infects children who run barefoot over the dirt.
Gaju, a 50-year-old patient at the hospital, watches unflinchingly as Darlong pulls maggots out of his foot. Like many leprosy patients, Gaju, who goes by one name, has lost the feeling in parts of his body. The numbness is such that, long after his muscles had wasted away, he continued his job running errands at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. After a course of medication in Delhi failed to work, he says his leg deteriorated and doctors recommended that he travel to Purulia where the Leprosy Mission is known for handling complicated cases.
“He has to elevate his leg, which he wasn't doing, and he got ulcers because of the stasis,” says Darlong. “When [patients] stand for a long time their veins get blocked.”

Leprosy has afflicted more than 15m people worldwide over the past two decades, according to the WHO, with India accounting for more than half of cases discovered in 2015. The disease, which often affects those with weak immune systems who live in close contact with untreated patients, initially causes irritable spots before the bacteria begin to attack nerves, causing muscle paralysis and lasting disabilities. These long-term effects can be avoided if the disease is diagnosed and treated quickly, but stigma and a widespread, though false, perception that it is highly contagious often lead patients to hide their symptoms until they become extremely serious. In the Leprosy Mission hospital in Purulia, an entire workshop is dedicated to sculpting limbs for patients that have lost their legs in this way.
Despite these challenges, Kumar's goal is a drastic reduction over the next two years in the number of cases of long-term disability, which, he says, reflect a failure of the system. With support from prime minister Narendra Modi and the central government, which this year doubled the programme's funding from Rs460m to Rs1bn ($15m), Kumar hopes the disease can be banished for good.

Last September and October, Kumar's national leprosy case detection campaign was carried out, using an army of health workers to oversee two-person volunteer teams. Each pair of volunteers (a man and a woman) was assigned 1,000 people and paid Rs50 (about $0.75) a day to check 16 or 17 households a day over the course of two weeks, for the patches of irritable skin that are early symptoms of the disease. In all, about 360m people were covered, says Kumar.
In Vadodara district, in Modi's home state of Gujarat, Minakshi Patel, a doctor at a village health centre, says the campaign, which cost the government Rs500m, has been successful. “It was very good,” she says. “Before, there were hidden cases. Now, we have found them.” She says there were monthly meetings to raise awareness and two full days of training.
Other health workers disagree. According to one monitoring progress on the ground for the government, the thoroughness of the detection campaign varied dramatically by region, as did the reliability and quality of the volunteers. Darlong is also critical of the campaign. She says her hospital was forced to turn away people who showed no sign of the disease after volunteers gave them a positive diagnosis in an effort to prove they were being diligent in their job. “Until last year everyone was like, ‘We've got rid of leprosy.'” she says. “Now everyone says, ‘We have found it.'” The stigmatisation of leprosy patients, she says, is very much alive despite “eyewash” from politicians, who claim the situation is improving.
In Gujarat, the issue has become political for some after the prime minister called on the country in January to “eliminate the social stigma attached with this disease”. JP Gupta, the state's health commissioner, says more money is always welcome. “I wouldn't say that stigma has been totally eliminated,” he says. “[Fighting leprosy] is manpower-intensive work; it requires human resources.”
Indian districts reporting more than 1,000 leprosy cases
Kumar believes a lot more progress is possible. He wants to see leprosy colonies closed down and patients reintegrated into their communities; the development of a vaccine that is to be trialled in Gujarat this year; and early detection across the country so that disabilities are reduced to less than one in a million by 2019.
Some of these goals are controversial. The vaccine trial has prompted scepticism among doctors and government health officers, in part because studies have shown that the vaccine, mycobacterium indicus pranii, is only 28 per cent effective, based on studying the population again after nine years. “We don't want to do it. There is no vaccine that has been developed that is effective,” says the senior health official in Gujarat.
Doctors and WHO officials say existing treatments should be prioritised over a possible vaccine because they are known to work, and treated patients are not infectious. “It's a disease of the poor and decentralised,” says one public health official on condition of anonymity. “You need a pro-poor approach — this is the missing element in the WHO headquarters plan and the country plan.”

After the disease was declared eliminated in 2005, funding for the WHO's global leprosy programme fell. It now receives about $2.5m a year from the Nippon Foundation, a Japanese grantmaker and its only major donor, compared with between $7m and $8m before 2005, in addition to free medicine from Novartis, the pharmaceuticals group. Famkima Darlong, Joydeepa's husband, who is superintendent of the Leprosy Mission in Purulia, says that funding cuts have left the hospital with half the money it had before the country was declared leprosy-free. Aside from stopping the door-to-door vetting of villagers in the region, it has closed a school it used to run for children with leprosy.
Darlong says the hospital is also taking on more and more non-leprosy patients for small fees, so that leprosy treatment can remain free. With only four doctors on staff and more than 250 people now moving through the outpatient clinic each day, carrying on can seem daunting. “Doctors don't want to work in a place like this,” he says.
But while India's battle against leprosy hangs in the balance, some patients say that they are optimistic about the future. “I'll go back when I'm better,” says Gaju, who says he has been given medical leave by the university. “People are much more understanding now, no one told me to go. I think it will be OK.”
The criminally-underrated Carly Rae Jepsen
By Carlos Bilan, Staff Writer
You should know who the British Columbia-born Carly Rae Jepsen is by now, and if you don't, then perhaps the lyrics: “Hey I just met you and this is crazy / But here's my number so call me maybe” might ring a bell.
Interesting fact about the song: It was actually a sleeper hit as it was released in 2011, yet only gained massive popularity the following year. When Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber, and other celebrities made a parody of it, thousands of people followed suit and the whole world was dancing silly while lip-synching to the teen bop.
It was a remarkable feat that had unfortunate drawbacks, as “Call Me Maybe” became both a blessing and a curse for Jepsen. A blessing because the extremely catchy hit eventually became the best-selling digital single of 2012, accumulating 12.5 million units in worldwide sales—according to IFPI—while staying at the summit of many charts for several weeks. The curse was that, due to its massive success, the song became overplayed to the point that people got annoyed, and after the album Kiss was released—which had a lukewarm reception—her follow-up singles didn't live up to the worldwide smash hit, so she was dismissed by the general public as a one-hit wonder.
Fast forward to 2015, when Jepsen released “I Really Like You,” which was intended to emulate the success of “Call Me Maybe.” Unfortunately, the song ended up not being as successful as hoped. This also lead to her follow-up album, E•MO•TION, flopping commercially. However, Jepsen's E•MO•TION received acclaim from music critics and was placed on numerous 2015 year-end lists.
It was a big surprise to many, because how could Jepsen be getting such critical acclaim, especially from elitist indie critics like Pitchfork and Stereogum? The truth is in the album; from late 2015 to this very day, many have been claiming E•MO•TION is the best pop album of the decade, to which I agree. Jepsen has continued to gain a big cult following by winning the hearts of those who dismissed her and those who do not generally listen to pop music.
A meme surfaced late 2015 that revolved around videos sampling “Run Away With Me,” the glorious opening track of E•MO•TION. There are numerous variations of the song, but the most popular one depicts a seal playing a saxophone along to the intro of “Run Away With Me.” Many were hoping that the meme's viral status would make the best pop song of 2015 a sleeper hit, but unfortunately, the song didn't achieve the mainstream success it deserved.
In a perfect world, Jepsen's E•MO•TION would have been as commercially successful as Taylor Swift's 1989. In fact, some critics thought that E•MO•TION is the album 1989 tried to be, since E•MO•TION is considered the superior love-letter to '80s synth-pop and has been commended for its cohesiveness. Even the follow-up E•MO•TION Side B was praised by critics and considered a strong work, despite the album consisting of tracks that didn't make the final cut of E•MO•TION. In fact, Jepsen said to Radio.com that she wrote 250 songs for this album. The fact that the album has undergone a meticulous process demonstrates Jepsen's attention to detail and her excellent craftsmanship.
Jepsen has recently released “Cut to the Feeling,” a song originally intended for E•MO•TION. Jepsen felt the song was “too theatrical,” to include in the album. Thankfully, Jepsen found the perfect home for the track as it is now in the original movie soundtrack of the upcoming animated film, Leap, coming to theatres this August. The euphoric track has been universally praised and many are calling it a potential summer anthem.
Perhaps we will see Jepsen turn the tide of mainstream pop this year. I believe that if her label plays their marketing cards right, Jepsen will finally receive the overdue recognition she deserves. I swear that, after listening to E•MO•TION, I have developed a strong love for Jepsen; I just want the best for her in life and I'm sure that most who have listened to her recent works feel the same.
The coach of the San Antonio Spurs thinks the U.S. is “an embarrassment to the world.”
Gregg Popovich, NBA head coach of the San Antonio Spurs, reportedly made the comment during the team's media day on Monday in regards to the recent battle between professional sports teams and President Trump, the San Antonio Express-News reported.
After being asked about his thoughts on President Trump's tweet on Saturday, in which the president rescinded an invitation for the Golden State Warriors to visit the White House, Popovich reportedly laughed saying, “I thought it was comical that it was rescinded because they weren't going to go anyway.”
“It's like a sixth grader is going to have a party in his backyard and he finds out somebody might not come, so he disinvites them,” Popovich said. “Although it's disgusting, it's also comical.”
After winning the NBA championship last season, the Golden State Warriors were reportedly meeting on Saturday morning to decide whether or not they would accept an invitation to visit the White House in February, according to ESPN. But before they could meet, President Trump tweeted, officially rescinding the invitation.
Popovich also commented on the situation in the NFL, in regards to players protesting during the national anthem. He reportedly said that he would never tell his players what to do in that situation.
“Each one of them has the right and the ability to say what they would like to say, and act the way they would like to act,” Popovich said. “They have our full support. No matter what they might want to do or not do. It is important to them to be respected by us, and there is no recrimination no matter what might take place unless it's ridiculously egregious.”
In regards to the conversation of racism, Popovich reportedly referred to race as the “elephant in the room,” saying even if it's an uncomfortable conversation, race needs to be talked about, Bleacher Report said.
“Obviously, race is the elephant in the room, and we all understand that. Unless it's talked about constantly, it's not going to get better,” Popovich said. “There has to be an uncomfortable element in the discourse for anything to change, whether it's the LGBT community or women's suffrage, race, it doesn't matter.”
“People have to be made to feel uncomfortable, and especially white people, because we're comfortable. We still have no clue of what being born white means,” Popovich said.
Popovich's comments come after President Trump criticized NFL players for protesting during the National Anthem, “Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say ‘get that son of a b—- off the field right now – he's fired,” Trump said at an Alabama rally on Friday.

Metra hikes to electric bikes: 2017's transportation forecast
hello
If electric bikes -- yes, bicycles with little motors -- become more popular, the safety of bicycling will become an increasing concern. AP Photo/The State Journal-Register, Rich Saal, 2014
Experts share consensus that Metra is likely to raise fares again in 2017. Daily Herald File Photo
In a world of uncertainty, you can count on one thing: our annual transportation predictions for the new year by a panel of experts on planes, trains, automobiles and politics.
Let's start with one close to home. Despite momentum at the Illinois tollway to spend up to $50 million to study extending Route 53 north, our prognosticators are dubious about the project's fate in 2017.
"The opponents of Route 53 expansion will gain the upper hand as decision-makers grow more weary of all the contentious debate. The problem of rising congestion will not be enough to break the stalemate on Route 53," DePaul University transportation professor Joseph Schwieterman said.
Former state senator and former tollway director Bill Morris of Grayslake anticipates the demise of the Route 53 extension, which lost the support of Republican Lake County Board Chairman Aaron Lawlor in May in the face of a $2 billion funding gap. Morris said that if Gov. Bruce Rauner wants to be re-elected he "can ill-afford to risk losing Lake County."
But state Rep. David Harris of Arlington Heights, a member of the Tollway Oversight Committee, thinks "the tollway will keep it alive as long as it can" -- regardless of questions about how to pay for it.
Will Metra want more?
One thing that seems sure in 2017 is a Metra fare increase coming Feb. 1. Asked if the agency will raise prices again this year, the consensus was "yes."
"Metra will move ahead with another increase, taking advantage of the strengthening economy and worsening congestion to help it modernize," Schwieterman said. Rising traffic congestion will offset many of the negatives of a rate hike, he said.
Former Regional Transportation Authority chief Steve Schlickman agreed, adding if the state budget stalemate continues, lawmakers won't pass a capital plan and "Metra may have no choice but to go to the fare increase well again" to address the state-of-good-repair backlog.
Asked if state capital funding will dry up, Republican Harris answered, "I am going to answer this 'yes,' and it pains me to do so."
Northbrook Democrat and Illinois House Assistant Majority Leader Elaine Nekritz also expects little movement "on a significant capital program unless and until the bigger budget impasse can be resolved or at least progress made."
Next move on noise
Switching to O'Hare International Airport, the city of Chicago ended a popular overnight weekly runway rotation test Dec. 25.
The city and Federal Aviation Administration need to assess the data and there's no guarantee when another rotation, intended to evenly distribute jet noise around the region, will begin.
That's a tough break for residents who say the trial gave them much-needed shut-eye, although folks in communities that got an unexpected din welcome the reprieve.
Chicago's "mayor will likely stay the course and keep the rotations only temporarily, much to the chagrin of several suburban communities," Schwieterman said.
But U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley, a Chicago Democrat who represents suburbs around the airport, thinks the city will and should continue the rotation and "they should expand it to more hours in the day."
Back to earmarks?
There's buzz in Washington that Congress will resurrect earmarks, Quigley hinted.
congressional directives that funds be spent on specific projects were banned in 2011 with the aim of eliminating "pork" projects.
"Some say it's a bad idea; others think it's a way to have members target funds where they're needed," Quigley said.
He predicted there's a strong possibility House Speaker Paul Ryan will allow a vote on the issue.
That will help Illinois if earmarks are revived, added Quigley, who is on the House Committee on Appropriations and the transportation subcommittee.
Meanwhile, despite uncertainty on how President-elect Donald Trump will treat blue states such as Illinois, Schlickman doesn't think local projects, including O'Hare modernization, will suffer.
Uber, Airbnb rules?
Schwieterman added two insights for 2017.
"Travelers may see growing pushback by suburban governments against services like Airbnb and Uber," he predicted.
"These services are growing so fast that there is a serious risk of 'overregulation.'"
And, electronically powered bikes "will become much more prevalent, pushing the debate over bicycle safety in an unexpected new direction," he said.

After a day of teasing in true Bethesda fashion, a teaser trailer has officially been released revealing a game that is known as Fallout 76.
Since it was a teaser trailer we don't have a ton of information to go on but we do have some clues. Based on the snippet of information we get from the trailer, it looks like there is going to be some sort of celebration at Vault 76.
Vault 76 has a decent amount of lore behind it based on mentions in Fallout 3, it's Mothership Zeta DLC and in Fallout 4. With that many mentions, it's clear there is some sort of importance with this vault. It is even further confirmed since a whole game is being made focusing on Vault 76.
Here's the description given from the Vault 76 page from Fallout Wiki:
The Vault-Tec terminal in the Citadel lists Vault 76 as a “control” vault, with 500 occupants. The vault was designed to open 20 years after a nuclear war, and was among the seventeen known control vaults, meaning that it was used as a baseline to compare to experimental vaults. It is also mentioned in one of the alien captive recorded logs (no.13) recorded by Giles Wolstencroft, a Vault-Tec official who was abducted while inspecting the vault's construction site. In Fallout 4, the newsreader in the prologue mentions Vault 76 debuting in 2076 in honor of America's tercentenary when discussing Vault-Tec's plans to expand.
Vault 76 is located in Virginia meaning we'll be in a new location for this game, provided the entirety of the game isn't spent in a vault. A poster can be seen in the teaser trailer indicating the party is for “Reclamation Day” and the dates 1776-2076 are shown, also indicating this game doesn't take place too far into the future.
The vault is known as a control vault and was designed to be automatically opened after 20 years to compare the results with the other vaults in the area.
Possibly coincidentally, 1776 was also the year the United States officially became its own nation so it could be inferred that 2076 is when the new United States would rise again. In terms of lore, this is the earliest players will have stepped foot into the wasteland so it doesn't sound like there will be many, if any at all, established settlements.
An astute comment by Allen pointed out the date on the computer read 21 (27?) Oct 2102 which seems like the game doesn't actually take place in 2076.
The line “When the fighting has stopped, and the fallout has settled…” can be heard in the trailer which makes it sound like humanity is ready to make the steps to go out into the world and take it back.
Weird things have happened with this vault, including an alien abduction, so it's possible Bethesda has some surprises up its sleeve with this game. If it does end up taking place in the vault itself, there will likely still be a number of twists to keep the game interesting for everyone.
"When the fighting has stopped, and the fallout has settled…" “#Fallout76 – the newest game from Bethesda Game Studios. See more at the #BE3 Showcase – June 10th @ 6:30pm PT pic.twitter.com/wKeIq66tzR — Fallout (@Fallout) May 30, 2018
For those of you who haven't seen the trailer yet, you can watch it above.
Since this was a teaser trailer, we don't have a ton of information to go from but all we can do is analyze the trailer. More information will be available at Bethesda's E3 2018 conference. You can read out mega-post about what to expect right here.
A new Fallout title probably wasn't on a lot of minds so that's why it comes as an even bigger surprise. Fallout 4 released in late 2015 so it seems like this title came out a little sooner than expected, especially when you consider the last main Elder Scrolls title came out in 2011.
In what would be a first for the series, Kotaku has mentioned they are hearing from sources this title will have some sort of online element. Whether that is just simple co-op or something else entirely remains to be seen.
Although no platforms were announced, we can presume an Xbox One, PS4 and PC version of this game will be on the way. Bethesda has been supporting the Nintendo Switch a lot as of late but we can't confirm anything about a Switch version right now.

Sometime ago, it was reported that Aamir Khan has come onboard to play the role of Indian astronaut Rakesh Sharma in his biopic.
However, here's some news that might be shattering for all his fans. The grapevine is abuzz with rumors that the superstar has walked out of the film due to creative differences. Scroll down to read details...
The Film Was Supposed To Go On Floors After 'Thugs Of Hindostan A Deccan Chronicle report quoted an insider as saying, When Siddharth Roy Kapur launched his own production house, one project that he had announced, was based on the life of astronaut Rakesh Sharma and the shooting was to go on the floors only after 'Thugs Of Hindostan' was complete." Aamir Khan's Exit "It was a 2018 release. Aamir was approached to play Rakesh Sharma, in a conversation started with Siddharth way back in 2016, but the star is not doing the film anymore." He Wasn't Convinced With The Script "They were developing the script but Aamir did not like the way it finally shaped up. Everybody knows that his script sense is brilliant so in that form, so if he does not like a script there has to be something wrong with it. And while he's very fond of Siddharth, Aamir is not someone who will do a film if he's not 100 percent convinced of it." Better Safe Than Sorry "He discussed this with the creative team and conveyed his decision to them. Siddharth understood Aamir's reasons as he knows that's how the Aamir works." Shahrukh Khan To Step Into Aamir's Shoes? Although names like Ranveer Singh and Ranbir Kapoor are doing the rounds, we hear that Shahrukh Khan is a leading contender for this role. SRK To Reunite With PeeCee Meanwhile, rumours are strong that Priyanka Chopra has been roped in to play the role of Rakesh Sharma's wife.
Will we get to see Shahrukh Khan and Priyanka Chopra reuniting on screen after a long time? Let's wait and watch.
INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — A 19-year-old was taken to the hospital in critical condition after he was shot Friday night at an east side apartment complex, police said.
The teen, who was not immediately identified by police, was taken to Sidney & Lois Eskenazi Hospital.
Police said the shooting happened in the Cheswick Village Apartments complex located southeast of East 30th Street and North Post Road. However, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department units and an ambulance were dispatched about 7:10 p.m. to the 9200 block of East 30th Street, just outside the apartment complex, which is where the shooting victim was found.
Police said they did not know if the teen is a resident of Cheswick Village.
IMPD had no information on suspects in the shooting, and said they do not believe people in the area should be alarmed, but cautioned them to remain vigilant.
STOCKHOLM — An American scientist who shared this year's Nobel Prize for medicine bluntly criticized political developments at home in his address at the awards' gala banquet, saying that U.S. scientists are facing funding cutbacks that will hurt research.
Michael Rosbash, who was honoured for his work on circadian rhythms — commonly called the body clock — expressed concern that U.S. government funding such as that received by him and Nobel colleagues Jeffrey Hall and Michael Young is endangered.
“We benefited from an enlightened period in the postwar United States. Our National Institutes of Health have enthusiastically and generously supported basic research … (but) the current climate in the U.S. is a warning that continued support cannot be taken for granted,” Rosbash said in a short speech Sunday night at Stockholm's ornate city hall.
The 2018 federal budget proposed by President Donald Trump calls for cutting science funding by billions of dollars.
“Also in danger is the pluralistic America into which all three of us of born were born and raised after World War II,” Rosbash said. “Immigrants and foreigners have always been an indispensable part of our country, including its great record in scientific research.”
Literature laureate Kazuo Ishiguro of Britain expressed concern about increasing tensions between social factions.
“We live today in a time of growing tribal enmities of communities fracturing into bitterly opposed groups,” said Ishiguro, who was born in Japan.
He said Nobel prizes can counterbalance such animosity.
“The pride we feel when someone from our nation wins a Nobel prize is different from the one we feel witnessing one of our athletes winning an Olympic medal. We don't feel the pride of our tribe demonstrating superiority over other tribes. Rather it's the pride that from knowing that one of us has made a significant contribution to our common human endeavour,” he said.
In the Norwegian capital of Oslo, a survivor of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima compared her struggle to survive in 1945 to the objectives of the group awarded this year's Nobel's Peace Prize.
Setsuko Thurlow, who was 13 when the U.S. bomb devastated her Japanese city during the final weeks of World War II, spoke as a leading activist with the Nobel-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.
Thurlow said the Hiroshima blast left her buried under the rubble, but she was able to see light and crawl to safety. In the same way, the campaign to which she belongs is a driving force behind an international treaty to ban nuclear weapons, she said after ICAN received the Nobel prize it won in October.
“Our light now is the ban treaty,” Thurlow said. “I repeat those words that I heard called to me in the ruins of Hiroshima: ‘Don't give up. Keep pushing. See the light? Crawl toward it.”‘
The treaty has been signed by 56 countries — none of them nuclear powers — and ratified by only three. To become binding it requires ratification by 50 countries.
ICAN Executive Director Beatrice Fihn, who accepted the prize along with Thurlow, said that while the treaty is far from ratification “now, at long last, we have an unequivocal norm against nuclear weapons.”
“This is the way forward. There is only one way to prevent the use of nuclear weapons — prohibit and eliminate them,” Fihn said.
The prize winners were announced in October. All except the peace prize were awarded in Sweden on Sunday.
The other laureates were American Richard Thaler for his work in behavioural economics; American physicists Kip Thorne, Rainer Weiss and Barry Barish for confirming the existence of gravity waves; and Jacques Dubochet of Switzerland, American Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson of the United Kingdom for advances in electron microscopy.

Heintz reported from Moscow.
MONTRÉAL, QUÉBEC--(Marketwired - Oct. 6, 2017) - (TSX:BBD.A)(TSX:BBD.B)(OTCQX:BDRBF) - "We strongly disagree with the Commerce Department's preliminary decision. It represents an egregious overreach and misapplication of the U.S. trade laws in an apparent attempt to block the C Series aircraft from entering the U.S. market, irrespective of the negative impacts to the U.S. aerospace industry, U.S. jobs, U.S. airlines, and the U.S. flying public.
The Commerce Department's approach throughout this investigation has completely ignored aerospace industry realities. Boeing's own program cost accounting practices - selling aircraft below production costs for years after launching a program - would fail under Commerce's approach. This hypocrisy is appalling, and it should be deeply troubling to any importer of large, complex, and highly engineered products.
Commercial aircraft programs require billions in initial investment and years to provide a return on that investment. By limiting its antidumping investigation to a short 12-month period at the very beginning of the C Series program, Commerce has taken a path that inevitably would result in a deeply distorted finding.
We remain confident that, at the end of the processes, the U.S. International Trade Commission will reach the right conclusion, which is that the C Series benefits the U.S. aerospace industry and Boeing suffered no injury. There is wide consensus within the industry on this matter, and a growing chorus of voices, including airlines, consumer groups, trade experts, and many others that have come forward to express grave concerns with Boeing's attempt to force U.S. airlines to buy less efficient planes with configurations they do not want and economics that do not deliver value.
The U.S. government should reject Boeing's attempt to tilt the playing field unfairly in its favor and to impose an indirect tax on the flying public through unjustified import tariffs.
Commerce's statement that Bombardier is not cooperating with the investigation is a disingenuous attempt to distract from the agency's misguided focus on hypothetical production costs and sales prices for aircraft that will be imported into the United States far in the future.
As we have explained repeatedly to the Department, Bombardier cannot provide the production costs for the Delta aircraft for a very simple reason; they have not yet been produced. Commerce's attempt to create future costs and sales prices by looking at aircraft not imported into the United States is inappropriate and inconsistent with the agency's past practices. This departure from past precedent and disregard of well-known industry practices is an apparent attempt to deprive U.S. airlines from enjoying the benefits of the C Series, even though Boeing abandoned the segment of the market served by the C Series more than a decade ago.
This action also puts thousands of high-technology U.S. jobs at risk given the C Series' significant U.S. content. More than half of each aircraft's content, including its engines and major systems, is sourced from U.S. suppliers. Going forward, the C Series program will generate more than $30 billion in business for U.S. suppliers and support more than 22,700 jobs in the United States."

At a rally in Nashville, Donald Trump brought up JAY-Z while criticizing Hillary Clinton's campaign:
“His language [at 2016 Clinton rally] was so filthy, that it made me like the most clean-cut human being on earth.”
Trump added: “And by the way, without any musical instruments, I had much bigger crowds than he was drawing.”

Though Gore Verbinski has made a name for himself with big studio pictures like “Pirates of the Caribbean” and “The Lone Ranger,” he's always had a weird streak — a “one for them, one for me” mentality. So his credits include surprises like “The weatherman” and “Rango.”
“A Cure for Wellness” — a horror film set at a spa in the Swiss Alps — is definitely one for him. Here, “wellness” could easily be euphemism for “wealth.”
A powerful Wall Street banker named Pembroke (Harry Groener) runs off to a Swiss spa and writes back to his colleagues about truths that he can't “unsee,” telling them he will not be returning to New York.
So the firm sends an upstart young banker named Lockhart (Dane DeHaan) to bring him back and stave off a business emergency. Lockhart's superiors press him into action with threats of blackmail.
The young man swaggers into the spa like he owns the place but finds it's not easy to get his boss — or himself — out of it and on the next flight to New York. Soo,n Lockhart is suffering from the kind of maladies for which everyone here is seeking a cure, and the staff keeps pushing him to drink the spa's special water.
Ultimately, Lockhart gets drawn into a morbid tale about the spa's history, involving a mad baron, a baroness, his sister and the villagers who burned the place to the ground.
Written by Verbinski and Justin Haythe, the film was inspired by Thomas Mann's 1924 book “The Magic Mountain,” and yet the concerns feel very 21st-century. The film deftly depicts a desire to retreat from the pressures and ruthlessness of contemporary living, perhaps akin to the attempts by many to achieve clarity and soulfulness through yoga, diets and mindfulness apps. It also depicts how that desire can be exploited.
A theme running through “A Cure for Wellness” is the danger and inherent evil in striving for a pure bloodline. It turns out the baron was so obsessed with that goal, he resorted to incest, and was driven to madness.
Stylistically, “A Cure for Wellness” is an odd film — exceedingly well-crafted and given the kind of attention to detail, design, composition and camera movement that has been abandoned in most recent horror films, which strive instead for a jarring sense of realism.
The production design of blues, greens and yellows complements DeHaan's ice-blue eyes and pale features. Yet the filmmakers still deliver splashes of the gruesome violence demanded by the genre.
Through its two-and-a-half-hours, “A Cure for Wellness” ratchets up the dread. But in the final act, it fumbles — to become a sort of 1930s Universal-style psychosexual monster flick.
Even so, Verbinski's new one is likely to inspire a cultish fascination.

British voters headed to the polls last week to elect a new parliament and by extension the leader who will negotiate the Brexit deal. Which leader did supporters of a soft Brexit choose?
A tactical vote against a hard Brexit - The Irish Times, Ireland
British Europhiles should vote for the centre-left candidate with the best prospects in their constituency, The Irish Times urges:
“The next general election had not been due until 2020, a year after the UK's scheduled departure from the EU, but voters now have the chance to slam on the brakes. It's true Labour has committed to following through with Brexit, but they are open to a 'softer' version. Were they to end up in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, they would almost certainly hold a second referendum on the final deal. That is why everyone against a hard Brexit should vote tactically for the candidate who is best-placed to beat the Tory in their constituency.” (07/06/2017)
Pro-Europeans need strong Tories - Gazeta Wyborcza, Poland
Gazeta Wyborcza, by contrast, advises the pro-European camp to vote for the Tories:
“The issue now is whether they will gain an absolute majority - which is very likely - and how big that majority will be. Paradoxically a sweeping Tory victory would be better for the pro-European camp than a narrow victory - because such a victory would make May independent of the Eurosceptic hardliners in her party and give her more leeway in the negotiations with the EU. If May wins by a narrow margin the country will face laborious coalition negotiations and political chaos. Unless the Labour Party wins a sensational victory.” (08/06/17)
May needs a good slap in the face - Il Sole 24 Ore, Italy
Failure at the polls might bring Theresa May to her senses on the Brexit, Il Sole 24 Ore writes hopefully:
“In the meantime Trump's silence in Brussels on Article 5 of the Nato Treaty not only throws into doubt Atlantic solidarity in the case of an attack on a Nato member, but has also besmirched the traditionally privileged British-American ties. And that's not all. Not only is the Brexit no longer greeted with enthusiasm in Washington, there is also no longer any talk of bilateral free trade agreements. ... While Merkel's Germany is calling on Europe to take its fate into its own hands, May's Britain is discovering that isolation wouldn't be all that wonderful. Will this be enough to bring about a change of heart? That would be the logical move. Only Brexit was never a well-considered, rational step, making it hard to turn back. But doubts are being voiced, and a resounding slap in the face for May could do more to make them heard.” (08/06/2017)
Don't forget globalisation's losers - Berlingske, Denmark
Europe's politicians must shape globalisation in a way that is beneficial to all, Berlingske urges on the morning of the British vote:
“If the right political conditions for historic growth are created, one can be sure that everyone - the economy, the people and the welfare state - will benefit from the blessings of globalisation. The anti-globalist stance that has influenced a string of elections in the West is not constructive. But those running for office would do well to recognise that globalism has also created losers, even if society as a whole has benefited. ... It's important that everyone, and not just Chinese workers and London bankers, should benefit. Otherwise the people - as the Brexit referendum showed - will vote with their thumbs down.” (08/06/17)
Prime minister on the defensive - Deutschlandfunk, Germany
Theresa May will now be wondering whether the snap election really was a good idea, Deutschlandfunk suspects:
“Because the Brexit is not the most contentious topic in the parliamentary elections. There are three powerful issues that will influence the way people vote: Brexit, social policy and now also terrorism. … Clearly she was so fixated on the idea of being elected as a shining beacon capable of managing Brexit, the project of the century, that she has now ended up on the defensive on what, as former home secretary, is her very own domain. Prime Minister Theresa May got off to a good start and carefully steered British politics through the first storms after the referendum. But now that the country is experiencing one of its worst crises she unfortunately hasn't been able to maintain her poised stance.” (06/06/17)
May has lost her room for manoeuvre - Kaleva, Finland
Just like Cameron before the Brexit referendum May miscalculated her chances in the election, writes Kaleva:
“Once again a British prime minister has severely misjudged the situation with the decision to call the population to the polls. Like her predecessor David Cameron, who, confident of a victory, decided to hold the referendum on continued EU membership, May has seen her popularity wane in the same fateful way. … In the spring it looked like May would score a landslide victory. She had a lead of over 20 percentage points against her opponents. But then the Conservatives' lead began to shrink and the Labour Party started catching up. A narrow victory against Labour would be a major defeat for May. It would result in the two parties having almost equal power in domestic and foreign policy and dominate the Brexit negotiations.” (07/06/17)

NFL, NFLPA looking into Savage's return despite concussion
hello
Houston Texans quarterback Tom Savage (3) leaves the game to get checked out during the first half of an NFL football game against the San Francisco 49ers, Sunday, Dec. 10, 2017, in Houston. Associated Press
Referee John Hussey checks on Houston Texans quarterback Tom Savage following a hard hit during the second quarter of an NFL football game against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, Dec. 10, 2017 at NRG Stadium in Houston. The 49ers defeated the Texans 26-16. Associated Press
NEW YORK -- The NFL is checking whether concussion protocol was properly followed Sunday when Houston Texans quarterback Tom Savage was allowed to briefly return to action after a disturbing hit in the end zone that left him with his hands quivering.
League spokesman Joe Lockhart said the NFL and the players' association "together will conduct a thorough review of the incident focused on whether the protocol was properly followed, but we're also continuing looking at the protocol to look for ways to improve and strengthen it."
Lockhart said the discovery during this investigation of any possible improvements to the concussion protocol will be quickly implemented.
The NFL's concussion protocol came under heavy criticism after it failed Savage on Sunday in Houston's 26-16 loss to the 49ers. Only after Savage briefly returned to the game did the medical crew determine the quarterback did, indeed, have a concussion and remove him from the game.

Sushant Singh Rajput is definitely controversy's favourite child. He is often in the headlines owing to his arrogant behaviour with the media. Not just that, his rumoured affairs with co-actors have also earned him the tag of a 'player'.
In his latest interview with Mumbai Mirror, when Sushant was asked to comment why he is often tagged as an arrogant actor, here's what the actor said:
Not My Problem: SSR Commenting on his rude behaviour, he said, "People are constantly finding ways to explain how I've continued to survive in the industry. That's their problem, not mine." I Have No Plans Of Living A Rat Life "I'm not trying to prove a point, I'm not in the race to be No. 1 because I have no plans of living a rat's life. I'm not obsessed with the future and at the same time I'm neither hiding something nor trying to earn a particular reputation," said Sushant. Sushant On His Affair With Kriti "Sometimes, there is a series of stories about me which are untrue and I feel misunderstood. That's not a great feeling." The Stories Do Affect Me: SSR "As an actor I can condition myself to ignore the rumours, but I hold on to the vulnerability and the emotions these rumours evoke because it makes me a better actor. The stories often affect me but they never change my friendship with any co-star," said Sushant. Sushant On Raabta Debacle "We view life as a cause-and-effect-theory. If a film doesn't work we try to find reasons and add to our disillusionment. I've read every book on what's necessary to write a great script and make a hit film." SSR Is Indeed A Positive Thinker "They clearly haven't helped. So now, I've conditioned myself in a way that no matter what happens on Friday, I'll be okay on Monday. I can't screw up six months of work on my next by thinking of my last film," said the Kai Po Che actor. SSR On His First GF "My first girlfriend dumped me because I was too boring. I've tried to be more interesting ever since," said Sushant. SSR On Working With Sara On the work front, Sushant will be next seen in Kedarnath, opposite Amrita Singh's daughter, Sara Ali Khan. In the same interview, when SSR was asked if Amrita is interfering too much with her daughter's Bollywood debut, Sushant said, "Untrue, the script hasn't changed a bit from the one I was given and said ‘yes' to the first time."
He further added, "I'm honest and 100 per cent professional. So, there's absolutely no interference from any parent or friend. Everyone involved is trying to do their best."
The Daily Stormer, a Neo-Nazi website that promoted the "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Va., will no longer be hosted by Go Daddy, after the service received calls to ban the site over its hate-filled stories.
The Daily Stormer is now seen as trying to spin the threat of being taken down, with the site posting a story that claims to be written by hackers affiliated with the activist group Anonymous. That story includes a threat to delete the site within 24 hours. But a main source of news about Anonymous says the group doesn't seem to be involved.
The dispute over the website comes after a violent weekend in Charlottesville culminated in the killing of Heather Heyer, 32, an anti-white nationalist protester. Police say James Alex Fields Jr., 20, killed Heyer when he drove his car into a crowd of people.
The Daily Stormer then published a story mocking Heyer and making light of the events in Virginia, prompting calls for Go Daddy, which hosts the site, to be taken down.
Posting a link to the offending story, women's rights advocate Amy Siskind‏ wrote via Twitter, "@GoDaddy you host The Daily Stormer - they posted this on their site. Please retweet if you think this hate should be taken down & banned."
More than 6,500 people retweeted that message, and the web service replied late Sunday night, "We informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider, as they have violated our terms of service."
In the story on the Daily Stormer, the purported hackers say they'll delete the site by the same deadline set by Go Daddy. But in a break with notable hacking takeovers, the story doesn't appear as a message plastered on the front of the site; instead, it's published alongside other pieces, including the one about Heyer.
The Daily Stormer is published by Andrew Anglin, who also writes much of its most high-profile content; the site is supported by reader donations rather than by advertising.
The alleged hackers' message included the hashtag #TANGODOWN — a term that was quickly used by opponents of the site's views to celebrate its seeming demise. News organizations around the world ran stories about the apparent takeover, which had included the explanation, "this evil cannot be allowed to stand."
But a Twitter account that often relays news about Anonymous states, "We have no confirmation that 'Anonymous' is involved yet. Looks more like a DS stunt. Wonder if they are having issues finding a new host."
Referring to the all-caps message posted on the site — about an elite team targeting Anglin and his site — the account states, "We find claim that it took a 'UNITED FORCE OF ELITE HACKERS' to hack a CMS run by amateurs incredibly amusing."

Online Shopping for the Holidays? Beware Hacks, Scams and ID Theft
It may be the "most wonderful time of the year," with special offers and sales galore, but it's also the most likely time to have your identity stolen, cyber experts warn.
Hackers and online fraudsters are impersonating brand-name retailers and scaring consumers with fake emails, purchases and links in an effort to hook unsuspecting shoppers with phishing scams.
"They know we're frazzled, they know we're easily distracted and they know -- and hope -- that we're going to click on one of those links, which will end up having malware downloaded on our computer," said Ryan Gerding, a spokesman for the anti-spyware and malware firm Enigma Software.
The National Retail Foundation estimated that about 78 million people were expected to shop online for holiday discounts on Cyber Monday, with one-day profits expected to total $6.6 billion.
Mr. Gerding said the chances of getting a computer infection increase with the uptick in web traffic. As online shopping grows year to year, more Americans are at risk of being hacked.
"Last year during the holiday shopping season, which we counted as Black Friday through Christmas, infections on our customers computers jumped 99.23 percent and that was a bigger spike than in 2015 and in 2014," Mr. Gerding said.
Cybersecurity firm Carbon Black reported that phishing attacks -- emails, messages or pop-ups with corrupted links -- rose last year by 20.5 percent during November and December, and are expected to increase even more this holiday season.
RiskIQ, another cybersecurity intelligence firm, warned consumers of an increased risk of mobile infections during this time -- their most recent analysis identified at least one in 25 smartphones apps referencing "Black Friday" as unsafe and malicious.
Without naming retailers, RiskIQ said they identified and blacklisted 32,000 apps and 1,451 URLs that impersonate the top five most popular e-commerce sites.
"The findings confirmed that threat actors are using these well-known brands specifically to exploit the popularity of Black Friday shopping in both web and mobile," RiskIQ wrote in its report.
Mr. Gerding said one of the more sophisticated tactics hackers use is to send an email disguised as from a leading online retailer -- like Amazon or PayPal -- and asking users to dispute a suspicious purchase by clicking on a link.
"Instead of canceling the transaction it'll take you to a site that either will download malware or to a site that looks like an actual PayPal site and says enter your password information here, and then they've stolen it and your account has been hacked," he said.
There are a number of ways people can protect against such viruses. One is to be vigilant about suspicious links.
"Think about that link. Anytime you get an email, or anytime you get a message via social media where there is a link inside of it and it's something you weren't expecting, stop and think a minute before you click on it," Mr. Gerding said.
Other advice includes having an anti-spyware or -malware program that deletes infections as soon as they attack computers. Keeping computer and mobile phone operating systems up to date also help protect against hackers. Make sure passwords are secure and updated regularly.
RiskIQ recommends to always look for the "S" in "HTTPS" or a lock symbol in the web browser when visiting shopping sites. These ensure security and encryption of personal data.
Also, never provide credit card information unless it's a secure shopping portal, RiskIQ advises, and that sites that ask for this information in return for coupons or to win free merchandise are scams.

Anne Hathaway and husband buy Connecticut home The couple is spending Thanksgiving weekend on the East Coast shore.
Anne Hathaway gives birth to a baby boy The “Les Misérables” actress and her husband of four years, Adam Shulman, welcomed a son, Jonathan Rosebanks Shulman, on March 24.
Anne Hathaway flaunts baby bump in bikini The actress also shamed the paparazzi in the revealing Instagram shot.
Two people, including a 2-year-old boy, were killed and a pregnant woman was wounded in a shooting captured on Facebook Live as they drove in Chicago, where the latest spate of gun violence “must be a turning point” for the city, according to the mayor.
“I got a bullet in my stomach … they shot him, oh my God,” the pregnant woman screams after running from the car to a home in the 2300 block of South Kenneth Avenue in the city's Lawndale section, according to the Chicago Tribune. “I can't go to the hospital … this bullet in my stomach.”
Footage of the shooting goes dark after the woman gets inside the home, where she pleads with her mother for help but tells her she cannot go to the hospital because she might be taken to jail.
Just minutes earlier, the woman, who is reportedly four months pregnant, was seen chewing gum, smiling and singing into her cellphone as she sat in the passenger seat of a car driven by her 26-year-old boyfriend and with a 2-year-old boy, Levontay White Jr., in the back seat. The couple sing along to music and playfully posture for the camera until roughly a dozen shots ring out.
Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said paramedics were able to revive the boy at the scene, but he later died at Stroger Hospital, along with the 26-year-old man, who detectives believe was the intended target.
The woman, 20, and her baby were both listed in fair condition. Relatives told the newspaper she was about four months pregnant and is expected to survive.
“We have very promising leads, we have video,” Johnson told reporters Tuesday. “There's no doubt in my mind that we'll find him.”
Levontay was the second child to die on Tuesday from gun violence in Chicago. Takiya Holmes, 11, passed away from wounds she suffered when a stray bullet struck her in the head as she rode in her family's minivan. She died “in her mother's arms,” Fox59.com reports, and was one of two girls struck by stray bullets in the city over the weekend. Murder charges were filed early Wednesday against a 19-year-old man in Takiya's death, but how detectives tied suspect Antwan C. Jones to the shooting was not immediately available, the Tribune reports.
A second girl, Kanari Gentry Bowers, 12, remains in critical condition and on life support after being shot just 30 minutes before Takiya in separate incidents about four miles apart on Saturday, according to the Tribune.
Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the shootings “must be a turning point” for Chicago, which had 4,000 shooting victims and 762 homicides in 2016, a two-decade high, according to police statistics cited by the Washington Post.
“One victim of one shooting is one too many, but when innocent children are caught in the crossfire of gun violence and young people have their childhood stolen by stray bullets, our consciences are shaken and our hearts are broken,” Emanuel said in a statement. “Every parent, regardless of where they live, should be able to take their child for a walk to the park or a ride in the car. These are normal rites of passage of childhood.”
Emanuel called for “meaningful gun control” and tougher legislation to keep repeat violent offenders off the streets.
“Anyone with information about these crimes owes it to the families of these children to come forward,” Emanuel said.

Singer Fergie has stripped down on social media to promote her new album Double Dutchess.
The Black Eyed Peas star is currently working on her second solo album project and in a couple of postings on Instagram the singer poses nude in black and white photos with separate captions reading “tick” and “tock”.
tick A post shared by Fergie (@fergie) on Aug 12, 2017 at 6:45pm PDT
tock A post shared by Fergie (@fergie) on Aug 12, 2017 at 6:47pm PDT
Fergie has also shared other provocative shots, in which she is wearing a corset and underwear, and videos that resemble promos for cult U.S. TV series American Horror Story.
The 42-year-old has released four songs, L.A. Love (La La), Hungry, M.I.L.F. $, and Life Goes On from the project, which is her first solo record since 2006's The Dutchess. Last month, the long-awaited record, which has been in the works since 2013, leaked online.
And last year, the singer revealed what fans can expect from the music.
“It's all over the map because if it wasn't, that wouldn't be true to who I am: That's my musical taste,” she told People magazine in December. “For subject matter, I just don't have one thing to say. I've had plenty of life experiences since my last album... I've had a lot of things to say, and I write in my journals. I'm old-school.”

Atlanta's mayoral election has attracted a crowd of candidates this year, and creeping up in the polls is City Councilmember Keisha Lance Bottoms.
Lance Bottoms is a two-term member of the Atlanta City Council representing District 11, the city's southwestern-most region. She has made headlines during her tenure for her role in overseeing the $30 million sale of Turner Field, home of the Atlanta Braves, and for her close relationship with incumbent Mayor Kasim Reed.
In order for a candidate to win outright in Atlanta's nonpartisan mayoral race, they must get more than half of the vote during the election in November. If no candidate wins outright, a runoff election between the top-two vote-getters takes place the following month.
Here's what you need to know about Keisha Lance Bottoms:
1. A Democrat, Lance Bottoms Has Been Gaining Ground in Recent Polls
Lance Bottoms is listed as a Democrat by Politifact Georgia, and has aired television ads styling herself as “the Democrat for mayor” in 2017's crowded race.
The city councilwoman's TV spot describes the various menial jobs she held as she “worked her way through college and law school,” as well as her success in re-opening recreational centers across the city.
Lance Bottoms also picked up an endorsement from the Georgia Stonewall Democrats during her 2013 campaign for re-election to City Council. “Councilwoman Lance-Bottoms has received our endorsement in past election cycles and has not disappointed in her fervent support for equality and fairness,” the endorsement read.
Most of Lance Bottoms' rivals are also self-declared Democrats, apart from fellow City Councilmember Mary Norwood, who calls herself an independent and currently enjoys a strong bipartisan lead in the recent polls.
But Lance Bottoms has also been gaining ground with Democratic voters. Her campaign released a statement in early September after a WSB TV poll showed her just edging out Norwood in popularity among Democrats.
2. Lance Bottoms & Incumbent Mayor Kasim Reed Are Childhood Friends, & Some Have Questioned the Role He Has Played in Her Success
Lance Bottoms is well known around Atlanta as a close ally of incumbent Mayor Kasim Reed. The two have a long history that dates back to when they were teenagers and has plagued the city councilwoman in the form of allegations of cronyism and special treatment.
In April 2015, Lance Bottoms was hired as the executive director of the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority, which is responsible for managing Turner Field, the home stadium of the Atlanta Braves; the Atlanta Hawks' Philips Arena, and the city zoo.
Of the nine board members, Mayor Reed appoints six; the remaining three are appointed by the Fulton County Commission. The commission's chair, John Eaves, issued a statement of protest shortly after it was announced that Lance Bottoms' would replace then-Executive Director Violet Ricks.
“The hiring of a sitting City Council Member hired as a full time employee, as I understand it, in Ms. Ricks place was not done as part of a transparent open process. There was no interview by the Authority nor was the position advertised,” Eaves said in the statement.
He added: “Paying a political figure to oversee the board smacks of cronyism and is extraordinarily questionable. Neither I, nor our County Attorney, was consulted in advance and have not received any form of communication from AFCRA.”
The job carries with it a $135,000 annual salary, which is in addition to the $60,300 annual salary she receives for her position on the City Council.
Lance Bottoms defended her appointment, pointing out that the met with city ethics officer Nina Hickson to discuss potential conflicts of interest prior to accepting the job. Hickson released an official opinion on April 3, 2015, in which she concluded that “there is no per se conflict of interest under the City's Ethics Code that would prohibit this appointment.”
Hickson did add, however, that Lance Bottoms is obligated to disclose any conflict of interest that may arise during City Council decisions, and in those cases must recuse herself from discussion and voting. She also warned that holding dual roles might create an “appearance of impropriety” that would “[cause] a reasonable taxpayer to question whether the interest of a Council Member serving in this position impairs that person's ability to act in the best interest of the City,” but noted that the city's Ethics Code does not regulate such instances.
“Council seats have historically been seen as a part-time position, so it's not unusual for council members to have outside employment,” Lance Bottoms said in response to the criticism, adding that she would, indeed, recuse herself should a conflict of interest arise. “I serve at the pleasure of the board. … It's not a political appointment. It's not an appointment from the mayor. It's not an appointment from the county commission chair.”
Reed has not officially endorsed Lance Bottoms in 2017's mayoral race—Reed is term-limited—but he has taken a few jabs at one of her top rivals, City Council President Caesar Mitchell.
Last month, an ethics complaint was anonymously filed against Reed over large placards the mayor placed outside of his office criticizing Mitchell for having “has paid the second-highest ethics fines of any sitting elected official in Atlanta municipal government.” The complaint alleged that the placard was “political and related to campaign issues, not city business.”
City Attorney Jeremy Berry called the complaint “completely without merit,” adding: “I have seen many things during an election season, but never before have I witnessed someone filing an ethics complaint against two city employees who were lawfully performing their City duties.”
Around the same time the ethics complaint was filed, a flier was making its way around the city attributing Lance Bottoms' success to her relationship with Reed. The flier featured a picture of the two captioned, “Kasim is more than just a friend … I wanted to run for City Council. He made it happen. I wanted to be on the Fulton County Board. He made it happen.” The group behind the flier remained anonymous.
“It is unfortunately common when a woman runs for office for her success to be credited to a man,” Lance Bottoms said in response to the flier. “I'm proud the polls show me as the No. 1 choice of Democrats and African-Americans. Unfortunately, that means other campaigns are going to try and tear me down.”
3. On City Council, She Has Chaired Multiple Committees and Launched an Economic Development Initiative for Underserved Neighborhoods
First elected to the City Council in 2009, Lance Bottoms has served as vice-chair of the Public Safety Committee, chair of the Zoning Committee and vice-chair of the Transportation Committee.
During her tenure on the latter, the Atlanta Airport, one of the busiest in the country, opened the Maynard H. Jackson International Terminal, which CNN called “a billion-dollar solution to the much-griped-about entry procedure for Atlanta-bound passengers.”
Lance Bottoms also spearheaded Invest in Southwest, which she calls a “360-degree urban planning initiative with the goal of expanding economic development within underserved communities.” The legislation created a task force that focused on creating economic growth in the areas of Greenbriar, Camp Creek Marketplace, Campbellton Road and Cascade Road.
Additionally, she secured a $100,000 grant from the Atlanta Regional Commission to update the Greenbriar Towncenter Livable Communities Initiative, a program that conducted a livability study back in 2001 on how to reduce urban sprawl and air pollution. The city councilwoman also donated $25,000 of her own money to the initiative.
But some have criticized the official for using her Invest in Southwest initiative to campaign on city time. Back in 2015, Lance Bottoms sent out about 19,000 mailers to the tune of $21,000 enumerating the successes of the program; a picture of the city councilwoman appeared on 23 of the 30 pages.
At the time, Lance Bottoms was merely rumored to have her eye on the 2017 mayoral race and had not confirmed whether or not she would run. Nonetheless, critics questioned why the report had been sent out across the city instead of just to residents of the district in question.
Executive Director of Better Georgia, a liberal advocacy group, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the ubiquitous appearance of Bottoms' face on the report gave “at least an appearance that she's using her office to advance her profile in advance of a city-wide election, at a minimum.”
But Bottoms retorted that the success of the initiative depended on the involvement of multiple communities, not just those in the Southwest. “I obviously can't just get people to invest in Southwest who live in Southwest; I need a cross-section of people,” she stated at the time. “To the extent you can humanize the messaging is important,” she said of the many photos.
City ethics officer Nina Hickson told the Journal-Constitution that she had not received any complaints regarding the mailer.
4. She Is the Daughter of R&B Legend Major Lance
Lance Bottoms is one of nine children born to soul music legend Major Lance, whose fame peaked in the 1960s—at least in the U.S. In 1972, he moved to England, where obscure American soul music had become trendy at dance clubs.
His most famous single, “Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um,” peaked at #5 on Billboard's chart; 12 other songs he co-wrote made it into the music giant's Hot 100 chart during the 1960s.
Lance stayed in England for two years before returning to the U.S. and settling in Atlanta in 1974. In 1978, after several years of trying unsuccessfully to break back into the music business, he was convicted of selling cocaine and spent four years in prison.
After he died in 1994, The Chicago Sun-Times opined that his 1963 single “The Monkey Time” had “signaled the birth of the Chicago Sound,” referring to a musical tradition of jazz and blues with a heavy folk influence.
Lance Bottoms, now 47 years old, would have been about eight years old when her father went to prison, and just 24 when he died.
Dad's 78th bday 4/4. Just 2, so amazing I remember this. Believe @eltonofficial in this band. Miss him #MajorLance pic.twitter.com/bKirh6gDji — Keisha Lance Bottoms (@KeishaBottoms) April 4, 2017
Lance Bottoms told CBS46 in Atlanta that people used to recognize her father in the street, and at the time she didn't believe him when he told her of his former stardom.
“My dad used to always tell me he opened for the Beatles when they came to the US, but I didn't believe him. I thought he was exaggerating,” she said, adding: “I'd say ‘Daddy, so and so said that they knew you' and he was like, ‘Yeah, I know you don't believe me, but I was a very popular man.”
She also told the local CBS affiliate that her perseverance came from her father, but she did not inherit his musical aptitude. “I'm a genetic freak of nature. I have no rhythm; I can't sing; I can't dance,” she laughed.
5. She Is Married to Derek W. Bottoms, With Whom She Has Four Children
Lance Bottom is married to Derek W. Bottoms, a vice president of employment practices and associate relations at The Home Depot, according to his Linkedin profile.
Prior to becoming a vice president, he had worked as a senior counsel for the mega-corporation for 11 years; before that, he was an associate at the law firm of Powell Goldstein, specializing in employment law.
Both Bottoms and Lance Bottoms received juris doctor degrees from Georgia State University's School of Law. It is unclear where the two met; however, Bottoms graduated in 1994, while Lance Bottoms started her education the same year.
According to City-Data.com, the pair own a house in Southwest Atlanta near the Cascade Road corridor that is valued at $326,000. Additionally, the couple purchased a home in June 2016 on the elite island of Martha's Vineyard just off the coast of Cape Cod.
The house, which is located in the Oak Bluffs neighborhood, was purchased for $1,010,000.
Bottoms and Lance Bottoms have four adopted children: Lance, Langston, Lincoln and Lennox. In 2014, Lance Bottoms spoke to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution about her experience with adoption during November's Adoption Awareness Month:
We were dealing with unsuccessfully trying to conceive, and fertility treatments, and all the emotion that goes with that. For me the biggest hurdle was the first step, just seeking information. It sounds really silly, but when you're dealing with fertility and when you're a woman of faith, (I worried) does this mean I'm giving up because I'm looking at adoption? Even though adoption was something I always wanted to do, I thought it would be in addition to biological children. Once I worked through the unreasonableness of that thought process, it really worked out.
The councilwoman told prospective adoptive parents “to be patient,” adding that being open to adopting a biracial child could speed up the process.
Earlier that year, she participated in a brief interview with Atlanta Parent about daily life in her family, saying that they “are a pretty busy family so just being able to spend a day at home with nothing scheduled for anyone is a real treat. … It sounds simple but it's these kinds of moments that allow us to really bond as a family.”
The original charge of felony first-degree burglary was reduced in a plea agreement.
According to court records, on Dec. 19, 2015, tribal law enforcement officers were called to a residence on County Road 34. They were told Keezer was kicking at the door and had entered the residence, then left on foot when confronted by residents. But he had come back and was again kicking the door trying to get inside. The occupants, who had been awakened by Keezer's kicking in the first place, were fearful of being robbed.
He appeared Feb. 6 before District Judge Gretchen Thilmony, who sentenced him to 15 months in prison, stayed five years. He was ordered to serve 79 days in jail, with credit for 79 days served.
He was fined $900 plus $1,050 in court fees and $2,609 in restitution. He was ordered to get a chemical dependency evaluation and follow the recommendations, and was placed on supervised probation for five years.

Pratyusha Suicide Case
It has to be recalled that Rahul was in relationship with Pratyusha, who shocked the nation by committing suicide on April 1, 2016. Rahul was accused of abetting the suicide of the actress, but he was soon out on an anticipatory bail.
Saloni Sharma Was Questioned
Saloni Sharma was also questioned by the police, as it was said that she was the reason for creating a rift between Pratyusha and Rahul. Pratyusha's parents and her friends are still waiting for justice. It was even said that Rahul had cheated many girls.
Saloni & Rahul
Saloni had revealed that when she and Rahul had opened an event management company, they fell in love. They were in relationship for three years, but she broke up with him as Rahul started seeing Pratyusha behind her back.
Recently (March 2018), both of them got back together, to stage Holi Colour Blast Season 9.
Best Fish Sandwiches In MinnesotaA breaded, deep fried rectangular patty made from white meat fish such as cod or pollock, the fish sandwich, or fishwich, came into its own as a burger when introduced at McDonald's in 1962. Since then, the fish sandwich has become a lunch and dinner favorite. If you favor the local catch, try a walleye fish sandwich.
Can Hack But Not Shoot? FBI May Ease Entry for Cyber Agents
Aspiring federal agents who can hack a computer with ease but can't shoot their way out of a paper bag could soon find the FBI to be more welcoming.
In a series of recent speeches, FBI Director James Comey has hinted the bureau may adjust its hiring requirements to attract top-notch cyber recruits, the better to compete with private sector companies who can lure the sharpest technical minds with huge salary offers.
He's floated the idea of scrapping a requirement that agents who leave the FBI but want to return after two years must re-enroll in the bureau's storied but arduous Quantico, Virginia, training academy. He's also lamented, half-jokingly, that otherwise qualified applicants may be discouraged from applying because of a fondness for marijuana.
And he's suggested the FBI may need to build its own university to groom cyber talent and questioned whether every member of a cyber squad actually needs to be a gun-carrying agent.
"Our minds are open to all of these things because we are seeking a talent -- talent in a pool that is increasingly small. So, you're going to see us experiment with a number of different approaches to this," Comey said last week at a gathering of the Intelligence National Security Alliance.
The rethinking on recruitment comes as the FBI confronts increasingly complex cyber challenges, including crippling state-sponsored attacks, and as it's racing to develop more sophisticated techniques for combating internet-based threats.
The FBI, for instance, has struggled in recent years to break into encrypted cellphones of criminal suspects and sued Apple last year after agents could not access a locked iPhone used by a mass shooter in a San Bernardino, California.
Though an unidentified third-party vendor ultimately came forward with a tool to open the phone, law enforcement officials remain concerned about electronic terrorism recruitment that occurs through encrypted channels and out of sight of investigators.
Even crimes that investigators have tackled for decades, like child pornography, have grown more complicated as suspects trade images through secret internet networks that shield their locations and identities. The Justice Department has been developing ways through bulk hacking to uncover the users' locations, though defendants have repeatedly -- and with some success -- challenged the use of that tactic.
"The world's not coming back. The old school stuff that I did 20, 30 years ago in the State Police and the FBI, all those crimes nowadays have a major cyber component to it," said Robert Anderson, a retired FBI executive assistant director who oversaw cyber investigations.
Given the increasing emphasis on computer crime, the bureau has struggled to find prospective cyber agents who check all the conventional boxes for successful agents, Comey says.
"We will find people of integrity who are really smart, who know cyber -- and can't do a pushup. Or we'll find people, maybe they can do a pushup, they're smart and they can do cyber -- but they want to smoke weed on the way to the interview," the FBI director has said.
Comey's floated different possible solutions, but he's returned several times to the idea of waiving the requirement that people who want to return to the FBI after two years outside the bureau re-enroll in Quantico.
"Our people leave, go to the private sector, discover it's a soulless, empty way to live -- and then they realize, 'My life is empty, I need moral content in my work,'" Comey said, light-heartedly and to laughter, in a recent speech at the University of Texas at Austin.
He added: "I gave the creds for the second time to a 42-year-old cyber agent, and I said, 'So, how was Quantico?' He said, 'It was a nightmare, it was a nightmare.' And so we're trying to figure out, are there ways we should approach this differently to recognize the challenge we have in attracting talent."
Comey made headlines on the topic in 2014 when, in response to a question, he said that a prospective candidate who had previously smoked marijuana should go ahead and apply anyway. FBI rules disqualify applicants who have smoked marijuana within the last three years, and there's been no sign that that will change.
He was chastised days later at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing by then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, now the United States attorney general and Comey's boss, about whether he understood that those comments could "be interpreted as one more example of leadership in America dismissing the seriousness of marijuana use."
Comey replied that he had tried to be "both serious and funny" and was merely remarking on the FBI's challenges in developing a cyber workforce at a time when "more and more" young people were trying marijuana. He pronounced himself "absolutely dead-set against using marijuana" and noted that he had not said that he would change the FBI's policy.
Anderson said, "Anything new in the government is like getting your wisdom teeth pulled out. Anything new takes a while for the culture of the FBI to adjust to it."
He added, "If the strategic vision is to create a mecca for cyber, we're going to have to change."

In oil mystery, traders resort to ‘buy the builds' mantra
From bottles and wadded up napkins to food scraps — the U.S. Bank Stadium will be the site of more than 40 tons of waste by the time Americans know whether the Philadelphia Eagles or the New England Patriots triumphed in Super Bowl LII.
This year, the NFL, PepsiCo, Aramark and the U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis are teaming up to sustainably and responsibly dispose of 90 percent of the stadium's trash with the new initiative, Rush2Recycle.
The project aspires to place new standards for sustainability on events that attract large crowds. The U.S. Bank Stadium alone seats 66,200 people.

The new zero-waste initiative will help fans dispose of their waste properly within the stadium and learn tips and resources for recycling at home. The waste will be hand sorted to compost organic material, while non-compostable, non-recyclable waste will be incinerated to heat local homes and businesses with the recovered energy.
Even the “in-service stadium ware” will become compostable material, the Rush2Recycle site states.
In a video on the site, spokesman Hines Ward, former wide receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers, encourages attendees to "get in the game" by sorting their french fries in to compost bins and bottles into recycling bins, for instance.

"The Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority is proud of the hard work and dedication put forth by all stadium partners to build a sustainable, zero-waste program for U.S. Bank Stadium," Michael Vekich, chair of the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority, owner of U.S. Bank Stadium said in a statement by PepsiCo.
"This dedication echoes the State of Minnesota's commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and building an operation that is friendly to our environment."

The initiative will rely on stadium employees, maintenance workers, fans and new tri-bin waste disposal units to make it a success.
Eight million tons of improperly disposed plastic ends up in a landfill or polluting American waterways. This project, like those through the NFL Environmental Program, are part of the effort in reducing numbers of waste, particularly in sporting events.

Kandy Millspaugh and her husband Rick only see problems when they look at their newly installed shutters.
“They have a lot of marks, nicks, paint splatter and those scratches on the side,” Kandy said.
The couple said they ordered the shutters from Danmer Shutters but each time they arrived, the shutters were damaged. After the third time, they said they wanted a refund and turned to NBC 7 Responds for help.
“They were dented; the front of the louvers, almost every last one of them had a dent in it,” Rick said.
He said they ordered shutters from Danmer Shutters three years ago and they were awesome. So, when the couple needed new shutters this time, they decided to go with the company again but Rick said things didn't go smoothly this time around.
“About ten weeks after we first signed the contract, they scheduled to install the shutters,” Rick said.
According to Rick, that was a month after the promised deadline and after he and his wife rejected the first set of shutters, due to damage. When the second set of shutters arrived, the couple said they rejected them again for scratches and dents requiring them to order one more set.
Due to the difficulties and damaged product, Rick said he wanted his $500 deposit back.
“Somebody from the office called and said the owner of the company decided he was not going to give us a refund,” Rick said.
NBC 7 Responds reached out to Danmer Shutters and the next day, Jim Tortorelli, the President and CEO of Danmer Shutters, told us he personally called Rick and would issue him a full cash refund.
In an email, Tortorelli sent a statement that said, "We tried several times to fix the problems, however, if it is not acceptable to the homeowner, then we understand and will take responsibility for it. We have been in business for 40 years, and at the end of the day, we always act in the best interest of the customer."

NEW YORK (CBSMiami) – Every year millions of people fall victim to internet scams.
One that's been around for years rips people off and they often don't even know it.
In March Sherry Thomas was shopping on her brand-new laptop when it locked up and she got a pop up saying her computer had a virus and she needed to call tech support.
She dialed the number and the person on the other end said she could fix the problem but needed remote access to the computer.
“So I gave her access to my computer, she got in there and started doing a whole bunch of stuff, she started doing a lot of things,” Thomas said.
The person on the phone claimed to fix the problem and charged $179 to Thomas' debit card but the whole thing was a scam.
Steve Baker is an international investigations specialist with the Better Business Bureau and authored a new report showing how con-artists are raking in millions.
“Lots and lots of people have been ripped off by these tech support frauds and they don't even know they've been ripped off because they think they really did have a problem with their computer and really there's nothing wrong with the computer,” Baker explained.
A survey found that two out of every three people have been exposed to one of these scams and experts say when a con-artist takes control of a computer they can also install spyware.
“In fact, in a lot of cases they are getting people's online banking credentials and then logging into people's bank accounts later,” Baker added.
Thomas soon realized she had been scammed and had her laptop cleaned by a computer expert.
“I felt violated, I felt dumb,” she said. “I never knew they could come through your computer like that.”
A month later she got another call from the con artists, who tried to rip her off again. This time she hung up.
Authorities say if you get a pop up like this and your computer locks up, don't call the number.
Experts say turning the computer off and back on is usually enough to fix the problem.
CORSIER SUR VEVEY: Six hundred and sixty-two people on Sunday set a world record for the biggest gathering of Charlie Chaplins, each donning the black jacket, shoes, bowler hat, toothbrush moustache and cane of the comic's signature creation, the Little Tramp.
The unusual rally, drawing Chaplin fans of all ages from all over Europe, took place at a museum dedicated to the artist at his former home in Corsier-sur-Vevey, western Switzerland.
“There have been big Charlie Chaplin gatherings in the past, but this is the first to be certified by an officer of the law,” Annick Barbezat-Perrin, a spokesman for the museum, told AFP.
Chaplin was born in London 128 years ago on Sunday. He died on Christmas Day, 1977, aged 88, after spending the last decades of his life in Switzerland.
The Chaplin's World museum, which opened a year ago on Sunday, also said that it had had around 300,000 visitors in its first 12 months of operation, far outstripping estimates of 220,000.
The fight took place last month in Washington, DC. Video showed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan standing by watching the violence.
Two people have been arrested in connection with a massive brawl that left a dozen people, including a police officer, injured last month outside the Turkish embassy in Washington, DC. The two men arrested were identified as Sinan Narin and Eyup Yildirim. Both were charged with felony and misdemeanor assault. DC Metropolitan Police spokesperson Rachel Reid told BuzzFeed News that both men are US citizens. Yildirim is from New Jersey, where he is currently awaiting extradition, and Narin is from Virginia. Police did not say where the men were arrested or how police zeroed in on them in the weeks following the fight.
#Erdoğan'ın korumaları kavgaya karıştı https://t.co/gsi1iQ68Ye #amerikaninsesi
The brawl erupted on May 16 during a protest outside the embassy shortly after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan met with President Trump at the White House. Video footage showed armed men in uniforms and suits assailing demonstrators as a handful of police scrambled to subdue the crowd. Video footage also showed Erdoğan standing nearby watching the violence from behind a wall of security guards.
In the aftermath, the State Department confirmed that Turkish security personnel were involved in the altercation. Four days after the incident, Turkey's official news agency, Andalou Agency, provided a version of the events where it reported the president's security detail and Turkish police were involved in the attack. A woman also told BuzzFeed News that one of Erdoğan's body guards held her neck and threaten to kill her during the clash.
PLEASE JOIN ME by asking 4 justice for those of us who were attacked yesterday by Erdoğan's bodyguards.… https://t.co/uIpaC4To22
At least 12 people, including one police officer, were ultimately injured in the brawl. Two people were arrested at the scene.
Police did not say Wednesday what role Yildirim and Narin played in the fight or what connection, if any, they had to Erdoğan and the embassy. However, the New York Times previously identified both men in video footage of the fight. Narin can be seen wearing a suit and kicking a woman on the ground. He later told the Times he was defending himself. The video also shows Yildirim kicking a woman on the ground. According to the Times, he manages companies in New Jersey, while Narin owns property in Virginia. The fight drew widespread condemnation in the US. DC Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement that the fight stands "in contrast to the First Amendment rights and principles we work tirelessly to protect each and every day." And the State Department said that "violence is never an appropriate response to free speech."

The first major snowstorm of the season is hitting Ottawa today.
Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement for Ottawa and eastern Ontario.
An Alberta Clipper moving across the region is expected to bring 15 to 20 cm of snow by tonight. The snow will slowly taper off to flurries tonight. Environment Canada says the Belleville-Napanee will receive 15 cm of snow by this afternoon.
As the snow started to fall Monday night, road conditions quickly deteriorated. The City of Ottawa has deployed its fleet of snowplows and sanders to clear the roads for the commute.
Central area roads manager Bryden Denyes says the city will “be out maintaining winter cycling networks and sidewalks. But, we can't be everywhere at once.”
The city says snow removal is based on a roar-priority system, with high-use roads and emergency and transit routes cleared first. Major roads, arterials and major collector roads will be cleared first. Residential roads and lanes will be cleared within 16 hours of the snow ending.
Sidewalks in Ottawa's downtown core will be cleared within six hours of the snow ending, while bus stops will be cleared within 24 hours after clean-up.
More information on the City of Ottawa's snow clearing plans are listed on the city's website.
Air Canada and WestJet are advising travellers to check their flight status before heading to the Ottawa Airport today. Flight information is listed on the airport's website.

For The Essex Reporter
The Essex Jct. home of the man believed to be the oldest living World War II veteran in Vermont is expected to get a facelift this weekend from members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 6689.
The local VFW Post on Pearl Street plans to paint and fix the Maple St. home of 103-year-old Harold Bergeron, according to club member Everett Burns.
Club members plan to make the repairs and add the fresh coat of paint at no cost to Bergeron, Burns explained.
“We are providing all the labor for the project and food for volunteers. Materials have been graciously donated by another organization,” he said.
Burns said non-Post members are welcome to join in. The primary painting day is planned for Saturday, and the hope is for good weather, he said. Some members may do some scraping and preparation work on Friday.
Saturday would have marked the 105th birthday for Bergeron's wife, who died last year. They were married for more than 70 years.
The painting job comes on the heels of Post 6689 and its work with the Essex Memorial Day Weekend festivities, which includes one of the largest parades in Vermont and a large chicken barbecue at the VFW. Thousands line the 1.5-mile parade route along village streets to watch marching bands, the military, floats and other units. The parade comes out the backside of the Champlain Valley Fairgrounds, along both Vermont 2A and Vermont 15 ending at the main entrance to the fairgrounds.
“The list of services and benefits provided by our Post is enormous given the numbers and the age of our members,” Burns said in an email. He said a majority of the members are middle-aged to seniors.
The Essex Post is always seeking new members, Burns said. VFW members must be honorably discharged from the U.S. armed forces and have served in a foreign land. Auxiliary members can include spouses, children and grandchildren, Buns said.
He said the VFW's primary purpose is to assist veterans and their families during difficult times. It covers hospital visits, rides to appointments and access to medical equipment, including wheelchairs and adaptive equipment to help veterans be safe in their homes after an injury or sickness.
During the Christmas season, the Post donated a significant number of toys for children of veterans through the Vermont National Guard. The Post provides meals for other special holidays, such as an Irish dinner on St. Patrick's Day and bi-weekly dinners during the winter months to allow veterans to eat out at a reasonable price.
All events are supported by member volunteers prep, cook, serve and clean up. Meal events are open to the general public.
What To Expect from Microsoft's Surface Pro with LTE
The first of Microsoft's "always-connected" PCs with LTE connectivity is now available for pre-ordering, and early reviews are enthusiastic. Featuring a 7th-generation Intel Core processor and SIM/eSIM support, the Microsoft Surface Pro with an option for advanced LTE connectivity is available for ordering today in the U.S., and is set to start shipping May 1. The LTE option enables wireless, on-the-go networking without the need to connect via WiFi or mobile hotspot.
The Surface Pro with LTE launches ahead of the arrival of other new Windows 10 devices powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon ARM processors instead of x86-based chips from Intel and other companies. The new "always-connected" PCs are designed for lower-cost and more secure mobile working, according to Microsoft.
Built-In Cellular 'So Convenient'
According to today's review in The Verge, the Surface Pro's LTE connectivity makes it the first "true mobile computer." PCMag, meanwhile, called it "a top choice for those who want a sleek, travel-friendly 2-in-1 hybrid tablet, but need absolute connectivity."
"Using a computer with a built-in cellular connection is so convenient that now I want every computer to have it," senior editor Dan Seifert wrote in The Verge. "It foreshadows a time when we won't have to worry about whether or not the coffee shop we want to work from has Wi-Fi or if we'll be able to take care of those emails while traveling."
Adding the option of cellular connectivity to a PC comes with a price, though. While CNET described the new Surface Pro as a "best-in-class" device, it noted the LTE option is an "expensive alternative to tethering from a smartphone." ZDNet's review expressed similar concerns, asking whether LTE connectivity was worth the extra $150 added to the price of the standard Surface Pro.
ZDNet's conclusion? "For someone whose work depends on fast, reliable access to mobile networks without the hassle of hotspots, it's worth considering," ZDNet said.
The Surface Pro's eSIM service will be able to provide LTE connectivity via France's Transatel, with pay-as-you-go prices ranging from $4.99 for one-day, 200 MB access to $29.99 for 30 days and 3 GB, according to PCMag.
'Always-Connected' PCs Arrive in Spring
Beyond the support for LTE, the new Surface Pro is "almost indistinguishable" from the standard Surface Pro released by Microsoft last year, ZDNet said. The LTE version has been available to enterprise customers since late last year.
With a starting cost of $1,449, the LTE version of the Surface Pro features a 12.3-inch PixelSense touchscreen, Windows 10 Pro, dual microphones, stereo speakers, and front- and rear-facing cameras with support for Windows Hello face-based authentication. Depending on the Intel processor inside, the device weighs a little more or less than 1.7 pounds and provides enough battery life -- according to Microsoft -- for up to 13.5 hours of video playback.
Sometime later this spring, the Surface Pro with LTE will be joined by other new Windows 10 devices with ARM chips for cellular connectivity. Among the Microsoft hardware partners planning to come out with such "always-connected" PCs are Asus, HP, and Lenovo.

Four Silicon Valley Execs Charged in Trade Secrets Theft
Four Silicon Valley executives have been charged in an alleged conspiracy to steal trade secrets from their employer, an unnamed semiconductor manufacturer.
The men -- Liang Chen of Saratoga, Donald Olgado of Palo Alto, Wei-Yung Hsu of San Jose and Robert Ewald of Aptos -- are accused by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiring to use stolen information in a competing startup based in the U.S. and China.
The technology related to the high-volume manufacturing of semiconductor wafers to be used in lighting and electronic devices.
The company is not named in the indictment but public records show that the men were employed by semiconductor company Applied Materials Inc. of Santa Clara around 2012, the time of the alleged crime.
They allegedly downloaded information about the technology from their employer's confidential internal engineering database, including over 16,000 drawings. They also shared emails describing their plans to use the technology in a new company and tried to recruit investors to fund the company.
Each man has been charged with one count of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets and eleven counts of possessing stolen trade secrets, according to the indictment, announced Wednesday by U.S. Attorney Brian J. Stretch and Federal Bureau of Investigation agent John F. Bennett. The charges were issued in an indictment handed down on Nov. 30, 2017, by a federal grand jury.
If convicted, they face up to 10 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine for each charge.
Chen, 52, was a corporate vice president and general manager of the alternative energy products division; Olgado, 54, was a managing director of engineering within the product business group; Hsu, 57, was a vice president and general manager within the semiconductor LED division; and Ewald, 60, was a director of the energy and environmental systems within the alternative energy products division.

Good news for fans of the image-hosting site Flickr, whose fate was up in the air following Verizon's purchase of parent company Yahoo (see“Verizon to Buy Yahoo for $4.8 Billion,” 25 July 2016). The family-owned photo sharing service SmugMug has purchased Flickr, saying that it will maintain Flickr as an independent service and give it the attention and resources it deserves. No details of the deal have been released, but SmugMug CEO Don MacAskill told USA Today:
Flickr is an amazing community, full of some of the world's most passionate photographers. It's a fantastic product and a beloved brand, supplying tens of billions of photos to hundreds of millions of people around the world. Flickr has survived through thick-and-thin and is core to the entire fabric of the Internet.
In email to Flickr users, SmugMug said that nothing will change immediately regarding Flickr accounts. If you wish to prevent your Flickr data and account from being transferred to SmugMug, you can do so by downloading your images and deleting your account before 25 May 2018. Look for answers to other questions on the Flickr blog.
SmugMug has been around since 2002 and has never taken money from outside investors. That suggests that Flickr is in good hands, and we hope to see it thrive again under the new owners.

— Durham community members who are against the opening of a Publix grocery store, which is expected to open in 2018, gathered Tuesday at a public meeting to discuss their concerns.
Residents protesting the Publix say there just isn't enough room at that intersection to sustain the traffic it will bring.
The land proposed for for re-zoning is at the corner of Guess and Latta Road. The application was submitted by Halvorsen Development corporation for nearly 30 acres of land on that corner.
The report from the city and county said the request is for a mixed use development plan, including residential and commercial space. People planning to show up at the meeting are specifically upset about Publix.
A spokeswoman for Publix says the 45,000 square feet store will hire some 140 employees.
Publix recently opened new locations in Apex, Fayetteville and Wake Forest.

According to recent reports, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Border Patrol agents just apprehended two individuals who were attempting to sneak across the border over the weekend—but they weren't who you might expect.
CBP confirmed to Breitbart Texas that one Iraqi national and one Egyptian national were detained after illegally entering the country through Mexico. Though CBP did not confirm if the two criminals were men, another source implied they were both males.
Border Patrol released a statement confirming agents from Lordsburg Station apprehended the two individuals at 2:15 PM along Arizona State Route 80.
“Record checks and interviews produced no derogatory information and the two individuals were placed into removal proceedings,” the statement said.
The area of the border where the two foreign nationals are believed to have crossed does not have barriers, Breitbart reports. The area south of the border from where the individuals were apprehended is notoriously controlled by criminal groups working for the Sinaloa Federation or cartel. It is highly unlikely the two men from the Middle East were traveling into the United States without the cartel's consent.
At this point, we cannot confirm the intentions of these two individuals, but we do know they were breaking the law by entering the country. Whether they had harmful intent or not, this is just another example of why we need a border wall.
What do you think? Do you support Trump's wall?

Carrying brochures advertising adventure and pamphlets promising world-class experiences, Wake Forest students wandered between displays and representatives that shared information concerning study abroad programs available to undergraduates.
On Tuesday, Sept. 26, the Center for Global Programs and Studies held its fall Study Abroad Fair. Advocates from Wake Forest and affiliate programs shared information and answered questions concerning study abroad programs. While students can conduct research independently, the fair offered more personal advice tailored to each individual students' needs.
“I met with an ambassador and looked online a bit, but I'm trying to figure out what preference is best for me here,” said sophomore Kate Cowie. “My priority is to find classes that fullfil my major requirements, and then I'll decide on the location.”
Sophomores Perry Myers and Abigail Anderson expressed that they were happy Wake Forest has so many options but feel overwhelmed with the number of programs and trying to find the right ones for their schedules.
“Some locations are only compatible with certain majors, and I'm trying to find a study program that really helps me get credit toward my degree,” Myers said.
The fair not only offered informational outlets to answer questions students like Myers had about abroad opportunities, but offered games with prizes available to participating students, including a $2,000 scholarship.
Wake Forest English professor Omaar Hena participated at the fair as a representative for the Worrell House in London during the activities fair. As the resident professor during the fall 2016 semester, Hena explained why abroad programs — particularly Wake-sponsored programs — are valuable to one's undergraduate experience.
“The beauty of the Wake Forest program is that one is immersed and surrounded both with students and the professor in a resident environment such as London,” Hena said. “There's a beautiful interweaving of what's happening in the classroom, and then the day-to-day life of living in London.”
The Worrell House is one of three abroad properties owned by Wake Forest for the benefit of students. The Casa Artom in Venice and Flow House in Vienna also offer opportunities for students and resident professors to live and study together. Still, there are more than 400 compatible study abroad programs in more than 200 cities and 70 different countries for students to take advantage of while earning their degree.
Sophomore Annabel Grunebaum expressed that she narrowed down her study abroad location preference to somewhere in Europe so she can easily travel to many different countries on weekend excursions while still fulfilling academic credit.
“I always knew I wanted to study abroad my junior year, so when applying to colleges, the study abroad opportunities I saw Wake Forest had been definitely a decision-making factor,” Grunebaum said.
Wake Forest's ample amount of study abroad opportunities can attract many prospective students.
A 2016 report published by the Institute of International Education ranked Wake Forest sixth among U.S colleges and universities in the percentage of students studying abroad.
Hena encourages students to study abroad to open their world outside of the “Wake Bubble.” Hena, a Wake Forest alumnus who studied abroad as an undergraduate student abroad in 1996, said that after he studied at the Worrell House, his goal after getting tenure was to return and lead that same trip he experienced as a student.
“There's a time before you go and a time after you go abroad, and after you go, nothing is the same and gain a new perspective of what it means to live in the U.S.,” said Hena.
Students seeking opportunities to study abroad can visit studyabroad.wfu.edu for lists of Wake Forest and affiliate approved programs.
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — A review of the driving records of potential Ohio gubernatorial candidates shows some have better records than others.
The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that it reviewed the driving records of four Republicans and five Democrats considering a run for Ohio governor in 2018.
The newspaper reports Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicle records show the only one with no traffic tickets or crashes was Republican Mike DeWine, Ohio's current attorney general.
The review found that former attorney general Rich Cordray, a Democrat, had the most speeding tickets, with five since 1998. The potential candidate with the most crashes was Senate Democrat Joe Schiavoni, with three since 2007. The review also found he had four speeding tickets.
None of those reviewed had impaired driving charges. All had valid driver's licenses.

LAS VEGAS — When rookie 6-foot-9 combo forward Kevin Knox debuts for the Knicks on Saturday in the Las Vegas Summer League, their lottery pick gets the first chance to dispel his reputation as a low-energy defender who occasionally lacked a revved-up motor while playing one season at Kentucky.
Knox, 18, has taken all the criticisms to heart. He entered the draft process as a project expected to go in the 15-range until a glorious three-on-three workout propelled his stock and convinced Knicks coach David Fizdale he was the one to take over Mikal Bridges and Miles Bridges with the ninth-overall pick.
“I'm ready to come out and show people I'm able to play defense,'' Knox said after their first summer-league practice Tuesday at Thomas & Mack Center. “It's a new season, a new year, so I'm really looking forward to coming out there and be physical on defense, get stops. Like Coach Fiz says: Our offense is going to come from our defense. If we get stops and run in transition, that's kind of how we're going to play.”
Playing at Kentucky is similar to the basketball cauldron found in New York. The Wildcats' rabid fan base got on him plenty, questioning fluctuating effort levels during games. Despite averaging 15.6 points, he shot a modest 44 percent and his player-efficiency ratings were subpar.
see also Breaking down the Knicks' enticing summer league roster Here's a deeper look at the players on the Knicks'...
“Yeah, I heard that all the time,'' Knox said of his motor. “I just kept playing. People are going to talk all the time, criticize you. I listened to my parents, listened to my coaches. They said the same thing. I kind of got better at [it]. I worked on my conditioning a lot this summer as far as getting in extra sprints, so I keep my motor up the whole game. You're going to get tired at some point during the game. It's good we got a lot of guys that if I have to sub myself out so I can be on the court 100 percent playing with full energy.”
So it was a fair criticism?
“Yeah, [there] were games I agree with that,'' Knox said.
Fizdale said he sees nothing but athleticism, potential, a dedicated student and his starting small forward this season. Kentucky's coaches have talked of Knox being either the next Jayson Tatum or the next Kevin Durant. Since the June 21 draft, Knox has worked out daily with Fizdale, along with the other Knicks prospects.
“He's a focused kid,'' Fizdale said. “He listens well. He absorbs information well. He applies it well — which is all the things you want from a young talent. He takes what you tell him and applies it to the game. So far he's shown the ability to absorb information and execute it.”
Knox knows earning the starting slot — even on the young Knicks — is no guarantee.
“I have confidence in myself,'' he said. “I know it's not going to be easy. I'm going to have to work it, compete for that starting spot, compete for that job. I'm willing to come in and work, willing to compete and go at people in practice so I can have that ability to start in the starting lineup. Like Coach Fiz told me, it's not going to be easy. There are a lot of veteran guys on the team that are going to want the same spot. I have to work for it.
Racking up 20 points a game during the summer-league tournament — five games, plus playoffs — is not the goal.
“I just want to win,'' Knox said. “That's all I care about. I want to make it to the championship. That makes everyone on the team look better. I'm not worried about personal stats. It's summer league. I'm just trying to win and get a feel for the game and a feel for my teammates.”

Tropical Storm Nate is expected to become at least a category 1 hurricane by the time it reaches the Gulf Coast, including Mobile, Alabama. Governor Kay Ivey has already issued a statewide State of Emergency to prepare for the storm. The National Hurricane Center also reports that a hurricane warning is already in effect for Alabama's Gulf Coast. Here's the latest forecast for Mobile.
The 1:00 p.m. CDT forecast from the National Hurricane Center has Nate becoming at least a category 1 hurricane by the time it reaches the Louisiana coast. A category 1 hurricane has maximum sustained winds between 74 mph and 95 mph.
As of Friday afternoon, the storm has maximum sustained winds at 50 mph and the storm is about 125 miles east-southeast of Cozumel, Mexico. It is moving very quickly at 21 mph and is forecast to reach the Gulf Coast by late Saturday.
A Hurricane Watch is in effect for “East of the Alabama/Florida border to the Okaloosa/Walton County
Line” and a Hurricane Warning is in effect for “Grand Isle Louisiana to the Alabama/Florida border.”
“A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area,” the NHC notes . “A warning is typically issued 36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion.”
Governor Ivey issued a state of emergency earlier this week as the storm moved through Central America. The state of emergency began at 7:00 a.m. today.
“I have signed the State of Emergency, because it frees up personnel and resources in case there is a need to respond to any storm related activity,” Ivey said in a statement. “State and local leaders are ready to respond if needed, but our people need to stay weather-aware and heed any directions given by local officials.”
AL.com reported on Thursday that the Alabama State Port Authority already stopped accepting loaded barges and told ships to finish unloading and loading by 6 p.m. today. Judith Adams, vice president for marketing for the Port Authority, told AL.com that the issue with Nate isn't that its scale, but its speed. Nate isn't expected to become a major storm like Harvey or Irma, but its speed created “really a compressed timeline” to get prepared.
Here's the full seven-day forecast for Mobile from the National Weather Service:
Friday Afternoon: A 20 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms. Partly sunny, with a high near 86. East wind 10 to 15 mph.
Friday Night: A 30 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms, mainly after 1am. Mostly cloudy, with a low around 76. East wind around 10 mph.
Saturday: Showers and possibly a thunderstorm. High near 84. East wind around 10 mph. Chance of precipitation is 80%. New rainfall amounts between a quarter and half of an inch possible.
Saturday Night: Tropical storm conditions possible. Showers and possibly a thunderstorm. Low around 77. Chance of precipitation is 80%.
Sunday: Tropical storm conditions possible. Showers and possibly a thunderstorm. High near 81. Chance of precipitation is 80%.
Sunday Night: A 40 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms. Cloudy, with a low around 77. Southwest wind 10 to 15 mph, with gusts as high as 20 mph.
Monday: A 40 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 85. South wind 5 to 10 mph.
Monday Night: A 20 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms. Mostly cloudy, with a low around 74. South wind around 5 mph.
Tuesday: A 20 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms. Partly sunny, with a high near 87. Calm wind becoming southwest around 5 mph in the afternoon.
Tuesday Night: A 20 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms. Mostly cloudy, with a low around 71.
Wednesday: A 20 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms. Partly sunny, with a high near 84.
Wednesday Night: Partly cloudy, with a low around 66.
Thursday: Sunny, with a high near 83.

CLEVELAND -- A multistate manhunt for the suspect in a random killing that Cleveland police say he recorded and posted to Facebook is entering its third day.
Authorities say it's now a nationwide search for 37-year-old Steve Stephens, who's wanted on an aggravated murder charge in the shooting death of a 74-year-old retired man in Cleveland on Sunday.

The substation jacket for EnBW's 497MW Hohe See offshore wind farm in the German North Sea has left Smulders' shipyard at Vlissingen in the Netherlands.
The structure is on its way to the construction site some 105km off the German coast and will be installed on Thursday or Friday, Smulders said.
Smulders is fabricating the Hohe See substation together with Cofely Fabricom and CG as part of the FICG consortium.
Smulders is responsible for the design and fabrication of the steel structures for both the topside and foundation, including piles.
Thialf is also expected to install the Hohe See topside in the summer.
Hohe See, which will feature 71 Siemens Gamesa 7.0-154 turbines, is scheduled to be fully commissioned in 2019.
The substation for the 112MW sister project Albatros, a Siemens offshore transformer module manufactured by Heerema, is due to go in next year.
It will be installed by GeoSea's jack-up Innovation on a monopile foundation.

This is what might have happened when Martin Luther met Pope Francis and together they met Money. Almost all of the words of Martin Luther and Pope Francis are quotes from their writings.
Pope : in 1517 the church was not a role model. There was corruption, there was worldliness, there was greed, a lust for power. Martin Luther protested against this. And he was an intelligent man.
Money : with money hat on. We are here to celebrate the power of money to purchase for people access to God
Luther: Oh no we aren't. Takes Money's hat off and places it on the ground. The only thing bringing us to God is the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Money: takes hat back. In that case we are here, today, 2017, to call economists, financiers, technology experts to celebrate this: unlimited growth is here to stay.
Pope : No: there is not an unlimited supply of the worlds goods. The world is being squeezed dry.
Luther: and God writes the gospel not in the bible alone, but also in the trees, and in the flowers, and clouds and stars.
Money: Enough of that, we are here to celebrate me, the god of extreme profits, so that I may gorge myself on the feast of everything that stands in my way.
Pope: Sadly we might agree. Whatever is fragile, like the environment, is defenceless before you, the god of the market. It seems that you are the only rule.
Money: so you admit defeat?
Luther: Defeat? if I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces, I would still plant my apple tree. For every green tree is far more glorious than if it were made of gold and silver. Everything that is done in this world is done by hope.
Money: Hope? Money crushes hope. What are you going to do?
Luther: When cardinal Bogoglio became pope, he took the name of St Francis. But this was not just a name, it was a plan.
Pope : Francis, The man of poverty, the man of peace, the man who loves and protects creation. Francis, the man who changed history. How I would like a church that is poor and is for the poor. What kind of world do we want to leave to those who come after us, to children who are now growing up?
Luther: Parents shouldn't give up choosing what is best for their children, even when they are ungrateful.
Money: And do you, with all your terrible mistakes, think that anyone will listen?
Luther: No great saint lived without errors.
Pope: I also am a sinner but I trust in the infinite mercy and patience of our lord Jesus Christ .And in this day and age, unless Christians are revolutionaries, they are not Christians.
Luther: And though this world with devils filled should threaten to undo us, we will not fear for god has willed His truth to triumph through us.
Pope : We need to strengthen the conviction that we are one single family. The climate is a common good, belonging to all and meant for all. This is one of the greatest challenges of our time: changing to a form of development which seeks to respect creation.
Money: so what do you want?
Pope and Luther. A radical reformation of the economy.
Money: What do you want?
All:. A radical reformation of the economy.
Pope: the time has come to accept decreased growth in some parts of the world, so that other parts may experience healthy growth.
Money: This is just asking for...
Pope and Luther: A radical reformation of the economy
Money: You know you can't have...
All: A radical reformation of the economy.
Pope: I await the surprise of each day.
Luther: God is always a surprise, so you never know where and how you will meet him.
Both: Earth our mother moon our brother, here we stand we can do no other.
Pope: working for a just distribution of the fruits of the earth and human labour is not mere philanthropy, it is a moral obligation. For Christians the responsibility is even greater, it is a commandment.
Both: Earth or mother, moon our brother, here we stand we can do no other.
Luther: If you want to change the world, pray and act. And let us sing as we go; may our struggles and our concern for this planet never take away the joy of our hope.
Money: But money always rules.
Pope: takes hat. No it does not. Men and women will not be sacrificed to the idols of profit and consumption. Money has to serve and not rule.
All: Money has to serve and not rule.
Pope and Luther: what do we want?
All: a radical reformation of the economy
Pope and Luther: What do we want?
All: a radical reformation of the economy!

As the world gears up for “Black Panther,” Brooklyn Academy of Music takes a look at the movie's forebears with “Fight the Power: Black Superheroes on Film.”
“This is a story about what led up to ‘Black Panther,” says Ashley Clark, the BAMcinématek senior programmer who curated the 28-film festival. Though the Disney/Marvel film, out Feb. 16, is “certainly the most high-profile” black superhero movie, many films preceded it, Clark says, especially when you open up the definition of superhero to include “mythical, fantastical black characters from five decades of cinema.”
From George Romero's 1968 zombie classic “Night of the Living Dead” — starring Duane Jones as “the hero of the day,” says Clark, “radical in terms of what it represented in that time to have a black man playing that role” — to the brand-new “Brown Girl Begins,” by director Sharon Lewis, the festival includes a wide array of heroes of color.
“I think the whole world of black sci-fi is very new to the mainstream,” Lewis tells The Post. “That's why we're seeing such an outcry of support for ‘Black Panther.' Which is so unlike the situation I was in 15 years ago, when I first tried to make my movie.” Lewis says she was told point-blank that nobody wanted to see a movie about a young black woman who discovers she has superpowers.
Robert Townsend, who wrote, directed and starred in the 1993 comedy “The Meteor Man,” was a comic-book fan who set out to fill a void: “We had Spider-Man and Superman and Batman and I was a fan of all those,” he says, “but we hadn't seen a lot of people of color as heroes for kids.” Townsend will do a Q&A after the Feb. 11 screening of “The Meteor Man.”
Clark weighed in on some other highlights in the series:
“The Spook Who Sat by the Door” (1973): “It was considered so revolutionary at the time that it was strongly alleged that the FBI suppressed the prints.”
“Blade” (1998) and “Blade II” (2002): “They're Marvel films that are just incredibly underrated. Wesley Snipes has this extraordinary dramatic range. And Guillermo del Toro directed the sequel.”
“Black Dynamite” (2009): “A dead-on spoof of the blaxploitation era, incredibly funny with a big heart.”
And, of course, Clark adds, “we're all very excited about ‘Black Panther,' which we'll be showing starting Feb. 15!”
“Fight the Power” runs through Feb. 18 at BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton St.; BAM.org

Transnational Corporation of Nigeria (Transcorp) was on the list of Africa's top 500 companies recently released by The Africa Report (February 2017 issue), a leading news magazine publication owned by Paris-based media group, Jeune Afrique.
The list is compiled annually with each company listed assessed based on total turnover as well as net profits. Despite the recent economic challenges in the country, Transcorp has continued to focus on improving lives and transforming Nigeria as they join the list of Africa's stellar performers.
According to Transcorp Plc. President/CEO, Emmanuel Nnorom, the recognition is most welcomed and has become proof that it is possible to be financially profitable when you focus on the best interest of the country and the people.
Nnorom also noted that Transcorp has been recognized as one of Africa's top 500 companies despite the fact that its investments are currently situated in Nigeria only.
A handful of notable Nigerian companies also appeared on this year's list of Africa's best including Dangote, and Nigeria Breweries.
Transcorp is a leading diversified conglomerate with focus on acquiring and managing strategic businesses that create long-term shareholder returns and socio-economic impact. Its business interests are in four strategic sectors: Power, Energy, Hospitality and Agriculture.
Incorporated on November 16, 2004 and quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, Transcorp has a shareholder base of about 300,000 investors, the largest of which is Heirs Holdings Limited, a pan-African proprietary investment company.
Transcorp's other notable businesses include the award-winning Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja; Transcorp Hotels, Calabar; Transcorp Power Limited which acquired Ughelli Power Plc, owner of the Ughelli Power Plant and Transcorp Energy Limited, operator of OPL 281.
Theresa May explained her decision to hold a snap election by talking tough on Brexit, saying she would use a fresh mandate to rout those in opposition parties who hoped to frustrate Britain's departure from the EU.
But behind the prime minister's robust rhetoric, some believe, lay a different motive: a pitch for a full five-year term that would allow her to work towards a smoother, more orderly Brexit, as well as help her to manage a politically awkward transitional deal.
Either way, Mrs May's decision is intended to allow her to deliver Brexit on her own terms and in her own time. One diplomat from a leading EU government said: “It makes sense, if she wants a strong hand domestically.”
The prime minister defended her dramatic volte face on Tuesday on the grounds that in recent weeks Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party had indicated they would try to thwart any deal she negotiates with the EU. “Our opponents believe that because the government's majority is so small, our resolve will weaken and that they can force us to change course,” she said on the steps of Downing Street. “They are wrong.”
Yet recent events suggest she was overstating the idea of a parliamentary ambush on Brexit. Last month she crushed opposition to the bill allowing her to trigger the Article 50 exit process; far from being a den of rebellion, parliament has been more often criticised for being supine in the face of a powerful prime minister.
Rather than seeking to strengthen her ability to lead Britain towards a “hard” Brexit, the theory goes that the prime minister in fact wants a mandate to negotiate a softer deal — and a new intake of additional Conservative MPs could insulate her from pressure from the diehard Tory Eurosceptics.
Andrew Duff, a former Lib Dem MEP now at the European Policy Centre think-tank, said the snap election was a calculated risk on the part of the prime minister to win independence from the “far right” of the Conservative party as Brexit talks proceed. “What she wants to do is to screw the extremists, the militants who she is aware are lining up to try to block her from an association agreement with the EU,” he said.
If Mrs May had stuck to her original plan, she would have faced the UK electorate in May 2020. At that point, Britain would probably still be tied to the EU during an “implementation phase” following the point of formal Brexit in March 2019.

This month she acknowledged that such a period might include the continuation of free movement of EU citizens in the UK while a free-trade deal was being negotiated. Some experts have speculated that Britain will also have to adhere to European Court of Justice rulings. Both issues — immigration and sovereignty — were key to the EU referendum and are dear to Brexiters' hearts.
By holding an election in 2017 instead, Mrs May would have until June 2022 to wrap up the trade deal and to reach a final EU settlement before having to go back to the polls.
Dominic Grieve, the pro-Remain former attorney-general, said: “I think one of the reasons she has done this is that the next general election might well have been fought in the middle of a period of continuing uncertainty. This could buy us extra time, on the basis of her hope of securing a working majority.”
Number 10 says the June election is also timed so as to cause minimum disruption to the two-year Brexit process: the campaign will take place while the EU is finalising its own negotiating position after the French president elections.
A spokesperson for Donald Tusk, European Council president, said the election would not alter the schedule of Brexit talks from the perspective of the EU27. “The UK elections do not change our EU27 plans,” said the spokesperson. “We expect to have the Brexit guidelines adopted by the European Council on April 29 and, following that, the Brexit negotiating directives ready on May 22.”
Former fire captain gets 36-year prison term for rape
hello
URBANA, Ill. -- A former central Illinois fire captain has been sentenced to 36 years in prison for drugging and raping a probationary employee during a party at his home last year.
The News-Gazette reports former Savoy fire Capt. David "D.J." Dunn apologized to his victim and the community during his sentencing hearing Tuesday.
Dunn's 22-year-old victim said that after the assault he thought about how satisfying it would have been to kill Dunn, but he decided to be the kind of person who does the right thing.
He told Dunn Tuesday that "If I wasn't your first victim I will be your last."
The 44-year-old was convicted in May of aggravated criminal sexual assault, criminal sexual assault and aggravated criminal sexual abuse.
Judge Tom Difanis called it "a reprehensible and horrible offense."

Microsoft To Delete Software that Bullies Users into Paying for Upgrades
Starting next month, Microsoft will be on the lookout for software that uses alarming or misleading notifications to scare users into paying for added security protection. Microsoft will then delete that software via Windows Defender Antivirus and other Microsoft security programs.
Microsoft has noticed an increase in the number of free cleaner or optimizer programs using coercive language to drive people to pay for "premium" versions of their software, Terry Myerson, executive vice president for the Windows and Devices Group, said in a blog post Tuesday. Under Microsoft's new security criteria, such products will now be classified as malware or unwanted software.
In other news, Microsoft yesterday reported Q2 financial results that showed the company with $28.9 billion in quarterly revenues as of Dec. 31, 2017, a 12-percent increase over the same period in 2016. Income for the quarter took a hit from a one-time, $13.8 billion charge due to the Trump- and GOP-led tax bill approved by Congress in December. However, without that bill, which slashed rates for U.S. firms' overseas cash holdings from 35 percent to 15.5 percent, Microsoft would have had to pay over $28 billion more to repatriate those funds.
Coercive Messages='Unwanted Software'
In unveiling Microsoft's new security criteria for software, Myerson called the use of scary warnings to persuade users to buy software upgrades "problematic." Those new criteria will go into effect March 1.
"In the future, programs that display coercive messaging will be classified as unwanted software, detected, and removed," Myerson said on the Microsoft Secure blog. "This update comes in addition to our other long-standing customer protection requirements designed to keep our customers from being deceived by programs that display misleading, exaggerated, or threatening messages about a system's health."
Two years ago, Microsoft criticized cleaner and optimizer programs for not providing users with more detailed information about the system errors and security problems they claimed to address. At that time, Microsoft updated its security criteria to require providers of such software to improve transparency so users could decide how valid such errors were and how helpful the software might be.
'Increasingly Complex Threat Environment'
Microsoft's latest changes flag software not only for using exaggerated or alarming notifications, but for suggesting to users that there is no other method to correct the reported errors or problems. They also target programs that tell users they must act within a limited period of time if they want problems to be corrected.
Cleaner and optimizer programs have been connected to other security issues as well. In September, for example, Cisco threat intelligence researchers discovered that malware designed to collect information about users' PCs had somehow been inserted into a free optimization tool called CCleaner.
The tool's maker, Piriform, shut down the server receiving users' information and notified customers and law enforcement authorities. The security software company Avast linked the malware, believed to have affected some 2.27 million PCs, to a larger, sophisticated attack on technology and telecommunication companies in the U.S., as well as in Germany, Japan, Taiwan, and the U.K.
During yesterday's earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella described an "increasingly complex threat environment" that includes recently discovered chip-level vulnerabilities, such as Spectre and Meltdown.
"Our investments to make Windows 10 the most secure, always up-to-date operating system enabled us to move quickly to protect customers in the face of these threats," Nadella said.

Huda Beauty Rose Gold Remastered Palette
Huda Beauty Rose Gold Remastered Eyeshadow Palette ($65.00 / £56.00 for 0.59 oz.) is a new, reformulated and remastered version of the previous Huda Beauty Rose Gold Palette (review, swatches).
From all the 18 shades, 5 of them are brand new so I've taken quite an interested in those. Of course I was really curious to see how the reformulated shades perform. I've been playing with this palette for the past week now. Like always there are some things that I like and some things that I don't. I wouldn't say is the perfect palette and I would honestly expect an impeccable formula considering we are talking about a remastered palette here.
I still think that the best strategy would have been the launch a complete new palette, new shades and that Huda will apply in terms of packaging and formula what she learnt from previous mistakes or feedback.
One thing I noticed right from the first time I swatched the eyeshadows was the indendations from my fingertips left in the pan. Now after several uses, because these shades are so creamy, it looks like I've been playing with this palette for months. The formula of these remastered metallic shades has improved indeed comparing to the old one, but not to the point that you can apply all the shades only with your brush. Some of them do work well applied with a dampened brush, while for others you'll still have to use your fingers.
I'll give you more details about each shade performance in my upcoming review. In the meantime you can also check my Instastories to see me wearing a makeup look inspired by this palette.

Prince, also known as “The Purple One” is finally getting his very own Pantone color. Pantone and Prince's Estate announced today (August 14) that the late singer has his own purple hue, “Love Symbol #2,” which is named after the iconic symbol the singer used as an emblem for his name.

“The color purple was synonymous with who Prince was and will always be. This is an incredible way for his legacy to live on forever,” Troy Carter, entertainment adviser to Prince's Estate, said.
“We are honored to have worked on the development of Love Symbol #2, a distinctive new purple shade created in memory of Prince, ‘the purple one,'” added Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute. “A musical icon known for his artistic brilliance, Love Symbol #2 is emblematic of Prince's distinctive style. Long associated with the purple family, Love Symbol #2 enables Prince's unique purple shade to be consistently replicated and maintain the same iconic status as the man himself.”
Las Vegas police said a man died on Sunday after he became trapped under a car in an east valley auto shop.
Officers responded about 4:50 p.m. to 3055 Fremont Street, near Mojave Road, where they said a man was working under a vehicle. The man became trapped under the car and he was pronounced dead.
Metro was on scene but said OSHA would be investigating.
Family members and co-workers identified the man as Ntumba Bukasa, a mechanic who was talking to two people while working underneath the car.
Bukasa's uncle, Kena Bashale, traveled from Idaho to see his nephew's body. He described Bukasa as a good mechanic and an even better father.
"He was good at his job. He got good money," Bashale cried. "I'm going to miss that connection. Ntumba was my favorite person."
Jaffar Abdullah, who owns the auto shop, said he noticed Bukasa was often distracted at work. Bukasa had recently gone through a divorce, and those close to him believe his personal life was negatively impacting his work.
Bukasa had three children in Las Vegas and another daughter who lives on the east coast.
"His children, they are nice children," Abdullah said. "(They are) respectful, respect their dad, and they love him so much. So, so much."
Abdullah said he hasn't been able to eat, drink or sleep since finding out about his employee's death. Still, he said he must work and take care of customers. Many of them arrived to the shop on Monday with no idea of what happened.
"I don't want to come here at all. I don't want to see the shop. I don't want to be around here," Abdullah said. "He's a friend to me. I (met) Ntumba five years ago."

Financial regulators in Europe like banks to be boring. Full of capital and light on leverage, the ideal institutions should be quick to adjust either as required. What if that dull but trustworthy enterprise was a telephone company, though? Orange fits the bill.
The French telecoms group opened a bank in October. The project looks set to confuse shareholders and analysts. Seen from a bull's point of view, the new Orange Bank has its merits. As UBS analysts argued, it has “a strong brand and 28m mobile customers already”. Last week, Orange reiterated its target to acquire 2m customers within 10 years, equivalent to 2.5 per cent of the French savings market.
That would be quite an achievement. Going by what the top six French banks earned last year from retail banking, that much share could generate over €2.4bn in net income. Even half this number sounds like a lot; consensus estimates for 2019 for Orange put It's after tax earnings at just €3bn. While that may sound a nice problem to have, shareholders and analysts may struggle to value a company with legs in two heavily regulated sectors.
Some industries, like carmakers, have long run in-house finance units. Two years ago, Renault launched a savings bank in Britain known as RCI, to help fund its car finance loans. In two years it has attracted about £2.1bn in deposits, equivalent to 0.25 per cent of UK retail deposits and savings. However, such sales financing has long been integral to Renault's profits. More banking income probably would not register with its shareholders.
Orange's strategy might even backfire. The market tends to under-price conglomerates. Telecom analysts know little about banks and may not assess risks properly. If the bank flounders, then shareholders will question why resources were wasted. Regulators might welcome another dull deposit-taking bank. It is less certain that investors will.
Should Orange start a bank? The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Please tell us what you think in the comments section below.

MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — A baby can go through about ten diapers a day. That's more than 3,000 in the first year alone, and a big cost for parents.
Which diaper you choose can dramatically affect the price. So we asked new mom Natalie Nyhus to look at the options and ways to save your family money.
As the saying goes, babies eat, sleep and — well, you know. That means diapering is a big part of taking care of them, but if you really start breaking down the numbers – each diaper adds up to a lot of cents.
There are three disposable choices for diapering: store made brands like Target's Up and Up and Walmart's Parent's Choice, brand names like Huggies and Pampers, and green or organic like the Honest Company and Babyganics.
We broke down the cost per diaper for a size two in a 32 pack and 132 packs, via prices on Diapers.com. Store made brands were about 12 to 13 cents per diaper. Brand name diapers were 27 to 34 cents each. The green and organic brands were 28 to 50 cents per diaper.
Add that up, and diapers are a big cost. Blogger Sarah Carlson says figure on spending $100 per month, but there are ways to save.
“The best way to buy diapers depends on what kind of shopper you are,” she said.
1) Coupons
Coupon clippers will find plenty of options. Carlson says Target is currently giving shoppers a $20 gift card for $125 spent on baby purchases.
“If you have a baby registry they will often give you an extra 15 percent off coupon when you've had your baby,” she said. “That's a way to stock up on diapers and get the lowest price.”
2) Buy in Bulk
Buying a lot of diapers at once can help you save quite a bit.
“Costco, Sam's Club you can get massive amounts of diapers for that set price,” Carlson said.
3) Subscribe
Online retailers like jet.com and Amazon.com offer lower prices for members.
“If you're a Prime member and set up subscribe and save, you get 20 percent off diapers every time,” Carlson said.
4) Don't Size Up
Lastly, don't size up until you absolutely have to.
“In each box, you get more diapers for the lower sizes,” Carlson said. “So the higher you go, the fewer diapers you're getting.”
Carslson says choosing a diaper is a personal preference, but there is always a way to save. And no matter which type you choose, “yhe baby doesn't know the difference.”
Another tip is to incorporate diapers into baby showers. You can also have guests bring diapers of different sizes and brands for the parents-to-be so they can sample a little of everything and save money.
After a successful launch in Tobermory, and now available in the Borders, The Sea Unicorn of Mull is the latest book from Eyemouth's Serafina Press.
By local author Jennifer T. Doherty, and illustrated by Gillian Stewart, (who illustrated The Unicorn of Holy Island), the full-colour picture book follows the story of a sea unicorn who is in search of his heart.
He swims past Oban, and round the island of Mull. However, a little girl keeps throwing stones at him. What can be going on…?
“I realise that our local books have a natural appeal here in the Borders,” says Jennifer Doherty. “But so many people enjoy holidays to Oban and Mull, that I felt that the book can work in different parts of Scotland. And I'm delighted that a title from a small Eyemouth publisher is going to be in the bookshops on the Calmac ferries.”
The Sea Unicorn of Mull is available from The Roadstead Gallery, Eyemouth, and www.amazon.co.uk.
DENVER — Lawyers for pop star Taylor Swift and the Colorado DJ she accuses of groping her were due to deliver closing arguments on Monday before the federal court jury weighing her sexual assault claims against his assertion that he was wrongfully fired.
The trial stemming from Swift's allegations against radio personality David Mueller headed into its final phase after the 27-year-old singer-songwriter won an important ruling on Friday, which dismissed the DJ's accusation that she wrongfully got him to lose his job.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge William Martinez left standing Swift's assault and battery countersuit against Mueller, who insisted during the trial that he was falsely accused.
The judge also left intact a single claim by Mueller accusing Swift's mother and another member of her management circle of interfering with his contract, bringing about his ouster from his $150,000-a-year job at radio station KYGO-FM.
Related: Here's Why Taylor Swift Chose to Sue for $1 in Sex Assault Case
The judge previously tossed out Mueller's defamation-of-character claim against Swift, ruling before the trial that the DJ had waiting too long to file a lawsuit on those grounds.
The weeklong trial stems from allegations by the Grammy-winning artist known for such hits as "Fearless" and "I Knew You Were Trouble," that Mueller clutched her bare buttocks during a pre-concert fan reception while they posed together for pictures.
Mueller, 55, initiated the litigation, suing Swift, her mother and her radio station liaison Frank Bell for his termination.
The elder Swift said she wanted Mueller fired, and Bell reported the allegation to KYGO management, who sacked Mueller two days after the incident.

Swift then countersued, saying in her lawsuit that raising the issue of sexual assault “will serve as an example to other women who may resist publicly reliving similar outrageous and humiliating acts.”
During his trial testimony, Mueller denied having touched Swift inappropriately and said the false allegation cost him his career.
“It's a humiliating experience to be accused of something that despicable,” he said.
When Swift took the stand, she testified that Mueller put his hand under her skirt and “latched onto my bare ass cheek,” causing her to lurch away from him.
A photograph of the incident, shown repeatedly during the trial, depicts Swift flanked by Mueller and his then-girlfriend Shannon Melcher. Mueller's right hand is concealed behind Swift's backside, and she appears to be leaning away.
Melcher testified that she did not see anything untoward during the encounter, but added, “I don't have eyes in the back of my head.”
Swift is asking for a symbolic $1 in damages, but that does not limit what the eight-member jury could award her should she prevail.
“For this reason, any recovery obtained by Ms. Swift will be donated to charitable organizations dedicated to protecting women from similar acts of sexual assault and personal disregard,” the countersuit said.
If Mueller prevails on his claim against Andrea Swift and Bell, any damages would be limited to his two-year contract with the radio station, the judge has ruled.
Vestas are buying energy analytics specialist Utopus Insights in a $100m deal designed to boost the manufacturer's digital capabilities.
The Danish company said the acquisition would help to deliver “faster, smarter and more holistic solutions” as the global shift to renewables continued.
"This transformation means energy systems and power plant owners must improve forecasting accuracy for renewable production, optimise output from each individual generation asset and orchestrate a portfolio of resources across multiple sites and equipment types."
US outfit Utopus has been in business for 15 years and offers “a suite of innovative digital products”, holds more than 30 patents and offers “data expertise in analytics, power engineering, energy software development and meteorology”.
The company reported revenues of below $10m in 2017 and will be integrated into Vestas when the deal closes this quarter, subject to third-pary approvals.
Utopus has its origins in IBM's Smarter Energy Research Institute and boasts "a rich pedigree in data science, software, utility operations, meteorology, and renewable and distributed energy”, said Vestas.
"Vestas's strategic objective is to accelerate the transition towards a fully decarbonised energy sector in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible, both for our customers and for our planet,” Vestas chief executive Anders Runevad.

CAMDEN, Ark. (KARK/NBC News) – A young Arkansas mother's final moments were streamed on Facebook Live as friends watch helplessly from afar.
25-year-old Keiana Herndon went live Wednesday from a friend's home, where she was staying with her young son.
The video starts out with Keiana singing. You see and hear her respond to viewers and even put the spotlight on her son.
A few minutes later, Keiana falls and the phone drops out of her hands.
Her uncle, Jeffrey Herndon, said he could hear his niece struggle to breath and her son scream in the background.
“It was real hard,” he said.
All the while, the number of eyes on her grew.
A friend showed up nearly 30 minutes after Keiana hit the floor.
Keiana's father wishes someone watching would have acted sooner.
“It's amazing for someone to sit there and see somebody or hear them take their last breath and nobody did anything,” said Richard. “So, I want to take my hat off to everybody that actual did something.”
Last week began with analysis of one embarrassing correction by a major news outlet and ended with President Donald Trump on stage in Florida railing about “all the corrections the media has been making.” Trump's verbal assaults on the press are nothing new, but after a three major mistakes in eight days on the Trump-Russia investigation, he had some new ammunition to work with.
First, a brief refresher on what went wrong:
On December 1, ABC News's Brian Ross rushed to air with a bombshell report: Michael Flynn was prepared to testify that he had been instructed by then-candidate Donald Trump to initiate contact with Russian officials. Later that day, Ross corrected his reporting, stating that it was shortly after the election that the directive was issued. He was suspended by ABC for four months and will no longer cover stories involving the president.

He was suspended by ABC for four months and will no longer cover stories involving the president. Last Wednesday, several financial news outlets, including Reuters and Bloomberg, walked back their reports that special counsel Robert Mueller had issued a subpoena for President Trump's personal bank records after The Wall Street Journal reported the subpoenas were for “people or entities affiliated” with the president.
several financial news outlets, including Reuters and Bloomberg, walked back their reports that special counsel Robert Mueller had issued a subpoena for President Trump's personal bank records after The Wall Street Journal reported the subpoenas were for “people or entities affiliated” with the president. On Friday, CNN, CBS, and MSNBC all reported on an email that seemed to prove the Trump campaign had advanced notice about emails hacked by Wikileaks. The story soon fell apart, however, because the email in question was sent 10 days after CNN and others reported, meaning it appeared in Trump's inbox after the Wikileaks information was public.
With a president eager to paint the press as his enemy, and at least part of the nation ready to believe him, the stakes for getting the story right are high. Reporters make mistakes, of course, and when they do, they correct, explain, and move on. Three mistakes that all erred in the same direction—that is, the initial, incorrect reporting was worse for Trump than what actually happened—won't help journalists regain the trust among Trump's supporters, many of whom believe that the media is out to get him.
Any way you look at it, last week was a bad one for “the media” at large. The corrections, reflection, and at times over-the-top hand-wringing are all being adjudicated in the public eye, and it seems more people are paying more attention than ever before. Below, more on the reaction to a rough week for journalists.
Tough criticism: The Intercept's Glenn Greenwald offered a harsh critique of the way the mainstream press has covered the Trump-Russia story.

Throwback rapper dear Joey Bada$$ thinks the genre is currently trashed. In a recent string of tweets, Joey articulated his thoughts on the current climate of hip-hop.
Rap is in a very trash state rn with very few exceptions that don't even get the love and attention that they deserve. — BADMON (@joeyBADASS) January 24, 2018
Music is the most influential force in the world. Pay attention to what's being over saturated. It says something about the generation. Sound is vibration. — BADMON (@joeyBADASS) January 24, 2018
Curmudgeonry is a cyclical vice. It's inherently human to idolize a passing generation and resent the one that supersedes it. A lot of people don't like change, but come on.
Joey, a derivative boom-bap traditionalist, has often been at odds with the uneven landscape of modern trends. His 2012 breakthrough, 1999, borrowed so heavily from tropes of hip-hop's over-fantasized ‘golden age' that it could have been packaged with a pair of JNCO's and a snakeskin Gucci visor. It was a serviceable record of decent MCing and solid beat-making that benefited from a period of peak East Coast revivalism from names like Roc Marciano, Action Bronson and KA.
Joey is a solid rapper — clearly a student of New York icons like Jay-Z, Nas and Cormega. But for all his self-righteous championing of the good ol' days, he has never once pushed the envelope. Since 1999, his releases have struggled to find a foothold in the market, slipping between his affection for a period two decades in the rearview and the exponential change of today's open market. He can claim no right to any original concept. He doesn't take risks, instead treading comfortably in the footsteps of those who took risks before him. He's a student of the game, but no one should consider him a resident hot-taker of the genre that passed him by even before his debut.
To be fair, the mid-'90s were an almost overwhelmingly formative time for rap, filled with unprecedented growth. But that doesn't mean it's free of myopic romanticization. Harmful cons have been written out of a wistful, revisionist history. Apart from charitable radio outlets like New York's Stretch & Bobbito, the only way to break through to an audience larger than your average street corner 20-years ago was to sign a highly coveted record deal. Elitist New York media refused to acknowledge regional rap that wasn't from the five Boroughs and certainly not from a rapper that could literally be killed because of their music and what it stands for.
In 2018, anyone can make a rap record — for better or worse. What we have at our fingertips couldn't have even been fathomed 20 years ago. You can start a label from your mom's basement. Boundary-pushing rap can come from New York or Atlanta, Chicago or Houston, New Orleans, Toronto or the United Kingdom. You probably won't get shot because you prefer 2Pac to Biggie or vice-versa. You can always listen to the finite music made in the ‘90s and no one will blame you for it. But if you think rap is currently trash, you — like Joey — are part of the problem.

PARIS — A French legal official says five people have been released by police without charges after a Tunisian man stabbed two young women to death at the Marseille train station.
The official stressed the “absence of incriminating evidence at this stage.” He spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.
Four men and a woman close to the attacker have been in custody since Tuesday.
French and Tunisian authorities say they have not confirmed any links between the attacker and the Islamic State group or radical Islam. A counterterrorism probe has been opened, but the attacker's motive remains unclear. He was shot dead after the attack on Sunday.
NBC NEWS – Messages, posts and likes, kids have a lot of ways to stay connected.
One of the newest social media apps is called Sarahhah and it targets adults but is gaining popularity with teens.
Made as a way to “get honest feedback from your coworkers and friends”.
The app allows users to send anonymous messages but cyberbullying can occur on any social media site.
Seventy percent of kids ages 12 to 17 say they have seen it happen, according to a study.
Sue Scheff, author of Shame Nation, says bystanders can make a big difference.
Instead of ignoring cyberbullying, major social media sites have options for reporting online abuse and even muting or blocking users.
Some students are even countering with a trend of cyber-encouragement.
Students creating pages to spread positive comments about their peers.
Parents also play a role in monitoring their child's online activity, especially when it comes to apps like Sarahhah.
New York's top cop plans to meet with tenant representatives to discuss a report by a housing watchdog group that claims Jared Kushner's family real-estate firm under-reported the number of rent-regulated units in dozens of buildings to escape extra scrutiny of construction projects.
Kushner Cos. filed more than 80 documents for buildings across New York City stating they had no rent-regulated units when there were actually hundreds, the Associated Press reported on March 18, citing a study by the nonprofit Housing Rights Initiative. The filings from 2013 to 2016 allowed Kushner Cos. to raise rents and push out tenants who would have otherwise been protected if their presence had been documented, the AP said.
“We are very concerned about the allegations raised in the report and will be meeting with tenant representatives in the coming days,” Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, said Monday in a statement.
Schneiderman has frequently expressed concern about New York's tenant laws, arguing for example that the bar for evidence in criminal cases is too high. The attorney general has repeatedly clashed with Kushner's father-in-law, President Donald Trump, in unrelated legal fights. Kushner is now a senior adviser in the White House.
"If mistakes or typographical errors are identified, corrective action is taken immediately with no financial benefit to the company," Christine Taylor, a spokeswoman for Kushner Cos., said in an emailed statement. "Kushner Companies did not intentionally falsify DOB filings in an effort to harass any tenants."

Portugal's online poker players have been given the green light to start sharing liquidity with their counterparts in France and Spain, after the country approved the necessary regulations.
On Thursday, the Serviço Regulação e Inspeção de Jogos do Turismo de Portugal (SRIJ) regulatory body approved regulations governing the technical requirements for Portuguese-licensed online poker sites – i.e. The Stars Group's PokerStars – to share liquidity with sites in the regulated online gambling markets of France and Spain.
The new regulations were published in the official Diàrio de Republica and are set to take effect one day later, meaning PokerStars players in France, Portugal and Spain could all be splashing about in one big happy pool by the weekend, although Stars execs said just last week that a “Q2 launch” was more realistic.
PokerStars launched its French-Spanish pool last month, and players in non-regulated European Union markets and beyond were allowed to join in the fun by registering via Stars' Spanish-licensed site. Reaction to this influx of international players has been mixed, due to an allegedly higher proportion of sharp players making the French-Spanish games tougher to beat.
French operator Winamax has yet to join the cross-border liquidity pool party but the company's LinkedIn and Twitter accounts have been recruiting new employees, with an emphasis on bilingual fluency in French and Spanish, suggesting that a Winamax ‘.fres' pool is only a matter of time.
Italy, the fourth member of the cross-border liquidity pact inked last summer, had been sending signals that it was having second thoughts about honoring its commitments. However, last week saw Undersecretary of the Ministry of Economy and Finance Pier Paolo Baretta insist that “the agreement will be respected,” although he offered no timeline for when Italy might get its liquidity act together.
For the record, Portugal's liquidity-sharing regulations aren't limited to poker, with an eye toward authorizing cross-border pooling of horserace bets and also allowing exchange betting fans in both countries to match wits and wagers, should regulators in these other markets concur.

COMX-T Series enables applications in networking, military, aerospace and IoT
TEMPE, AZ--(Marketwired - Apr 18, 2017) - Artesyn Embedded Technologies today announced a new series of COM Express® embedded computing modules based on NXP QorIQ® T Series processors. The Artesyn COMX-T Series brings four (NXP T1042) or eight virtual core (NXP T2081) Power Architecture™ processors, with a wide range of high speed interfaces, to a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) form factor. This enables cost-effective processor implementations with high processing density, simple technology migration and long lifecycle. Applications include telecom, networking, aerospace, military/defense, and industrial, including Internet of Things (IoT) applications requiring low power consumption and small physical size.
Artesyn's COMX-T2081 and COMX-T1042 modules are designed to operate in harsh environments thanks to a rugged design with extended temperature and vibration. With its AltiVec engine and innovative dual-threaded e6500 core offering a high performance/watt rating, NXP's T2081 processor is primarily intended to succeed the successful QorIQ P-series mid-range series of quad-core devices. T2081 is designed to deliver maximum benefit for mid-range applications as it outperforms the previous generation in core capability, cache size and SerDes bandwidth, within a similar power budget. Pin-compatible with the T2081, the quad-core T1042 offers a cost-effective alternative for applications requiring high performance CPU cores, along with SATA and graphics, in a low power envelope.
Qianqian Shao, product marketing manager for Artesyn Embedded Technologies, said: "These new modules provide system developers with multiple performance levels for a range of applications. We already have successful deployments of our Power Architecture COMs in infrared radar systems, helicopter-based data communications routers and in-flight entertainment servers to name just a few. The small size, ruggedness and high performance makes them ideal for all these applications and more. Importantly, the sought-after longevity of supply of NXP Power Architecture processors enables customers to handle long lifecycle programs and maximize the return on their investment."
Designed for the Basic COM Express size form factor (95 mm × 125 mm) and Type 5/6 pin-outs with NXP extensions/modifications, the newly launched QorIQ T-series based COMX-T2081 and COMX-T1042 modules further enhance Artesyn's Power Architecture COM Express portfolio, and provide customers with technology insertion to either handle a product migration smoothly or take on a green-field project effectively.

With Apple set to unveil the new iPhone later this year, leaked photos have already given the public an idea as to what it might look like. Twitter user, Benjamin Geskin, who's been sharing a stream of leaked photos, posted a model of an iPhone 8 in what appears to be a brand-new shade of copper not available with previous models.
Foxconn's internal name of the new #iPhone8 color is "Blush Gold" (腮红金)
Barcode says "Blush Gold 64GB / 128GB" pic.twitter.com/MZPTfVAr2P — Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) August 12, 2017
It appears the color, a warmer tone to copper, might just be called “Blush Gold.” Geskin says there seems to be only two model capacities of 64GB / 128GB, but this might be the new iPhone that contains an even higher storage capacity of 256GB.
Another leaked photo shows iPhone 8 next to two older iPhone models.
While nothing has been confirmed yet, we probably bet if this is Apple's new iPhone 8 and color, it might be called something super luxurious.

DEAR CAROLYN: I have two children, 1 and 3. My husband and I always talked about having two. I am having a hard time coming to terms with not having more children.
I don't think he would be on board with more — we haven't discussed it — and I wouldn't do anything behind his back. But how do I know if I'm done?
Not Sure
DEAR NOT SURE: This will come out snarky, but its intent is sincere: Please don't consider having any more children until you're able to talk to your husband about things like whether to have more children.
I think I can read your intent between the lines, that you anticipate resistance to the idea so you want to have your argument straight before you bring it up. Understandably so.
But when you include the “behind his back” possibility out of the blue, even to rule it out, you give your whole question an antagonistic slant, you vs. spouse. And that's the exact opposite of the approach I'd suggest in making plans for your family's future.
Just talk to the guy, please. Finding a way to discuss the children you want will also serve the children you have.
DEAR CAROLYN: Several years ago, I was in a long-term relationship that kind of fizzled out.
Before that, both of us had talked about getting married, but it always seemed like real-world circumstances got in the way. One of her parents was sick, and she traveled constantly. The other of her parents meddled in her relationships to the point of causing real trouble. I was drowning in grad school. I realize couples make it work when they want to make it work, but I think both of us got exhausted by the circumstances.
Now, five years later, I'm done with school, my finances are in great shape, and I'm ready to make a commitment to her. But I have no idea where she is, whether she's single or married, or anything. All I have is her old email and phone number.
Is it fair to call and try to rekindle something with someone who may (or may not) be in a relationship now? Should I apologize for my part in this situation, even if I didn't have any bad intentions? How should I approach someone whom I know I adore but whom I haven't spoken with in years?
R.
DEAR R.: Of course it's fair. You call, you ask, you find out.

I strongly recommend, though, that you add a “d” to your careful rationale for getting in touch. You say she's “someone whom I know I adore,” but in fact she's someone you know you adored. Note that final “d.” Because you clearly fell far enough out of adoration to let the relationship go, or because each of you is now five years from who you used to be — take your pick.
Either way, your expectations in making this call can be the difference between congenial and creepy, so hold off until you can override, for real, your impulse to project. When you're ready, tell her she's been on your mind lately — then see where you both want to take it from there.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Parts of Bombardier's C-Series planes are made in Belfast
The US Department of Commerce has again ruled against aerospace firm Bombardier in its dispute with rival Boeing.
A further tariff of 80% has been imposed on the import of Bombardier's C-Series jet to the US for alleged below-cost selling.
This is on top of an earlier tariff of 220% which related to subsidies Bombardier got from Canada and the UK.
There have been warnings that the import tariffs could threaten Bombardier jobs in Belfast.
About 1,000 jobs are linked to the C-Series, the wings of which are made at a purpose-built £520m factory in the city.
The programme is not just important to Bombardier jobs in Belfast, but also to 15 smaller aerospace firms in Northern Ireland - and dozens more across the UK - which make components for the wings.
The US Department of Commerce rulings, which could more than triple the cost of a C-Series aircraft sold into the US, could jeopardise a major order placed last year from US airline Delta.
A final ruling in the case is due until early next year.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The history of Bombardier in Northern Ireland
The Canadian aerospace firm employs more than 4,000 workers across four sites in Northern Ireland.
Components of the C-Series jet are manufactured at a purpose-built factory in east Belfast and many other local firms are involved in the supply chain.
The punitive tax would significantly raise the price of the jet in the US market, and threaten the future of the product.
Boeing took the case after accusing Bombardier of anti-competitive practices.
It claimed its rival was selling the C-Series jets below cost price after taking state subsidies from the Canadian and British governments.
When the preliminary tax ruling was made last week, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur said: "The subsidisation of goods by foreign governments is something that the Trump Administration takes very seriously."
The US trade commission is due to rule on the Department of Commerce's 220% tax proposal next year, but ISME said the EU should not wait for the final decision.
Its chief executive, Neil McDonnell, said the EU "should signal right now that it will unconditionally, unequivocally and aggressively oppose protectionist measures by the US with tariffs of like effect".

A CCSD special education teacher was arrested Wednesday for stealing iPads from school and selling them at nearby pawn shops, police said.
Amanda Mirkovich is a special education teacher at Myrtle Tate Elementary School.
Clark County School District police arrested Mirkovich for burglary, possession of stolen property, grand larceny, and obtaining money under false pretenses.
CCSD police found out what was going on when they ran a routine check of pawn databases in Clark County.
That's when they got a hit on two iPads, missing from Tate Elementary. Police were able to link them to Mirkovich and her friend Robert Oseguera. He pawned one of the stolen iPads for $399, according to police. Oseguera was charged with possession for stolen property.
He originally told police that he didn't know the iPads had been stolen and claimed he bought them on Craigslist, according to the arrest report.
Mirkovich was hired by the school district in 2013, police said.
“It's just not right,” parent Alejandra Fogg said. “There are so many other ways to go about than stealing.”
Parents said they were upset to hear a teacher was accused of stealing from students.
“[She's] not a very liked teacher right now,” Fogg said.
Her friend Robert Oseguera admitted to police he helped her erase the data, so that the pair could sell them to Cash America Super Pawn.
“She's taking away from our kids,” Fogg said. “That's property used to educate our kids.”
Parents said the school sent them an automated message about Mirkovich's arrest.
“I'm shocked,” parent Jeree DeJarnette said. “Now I feel like I want to put my kids in a different zip code.”
They called this unfair and unprofessional.
“That right there - that's spoiling everything,” DeJarnette said. “That's making this whole school look bad.”
“If it's not assault, it's them violating their rights as children,” Fogg said. “Now it's stealing. And it's like no wonder a lot of people want to home school their kids.”
When police interviewed Mirkovich she denied the claims, saying she would never steal from the school.
Parents weren't buying it.
“She is out of line and I hope they do fire her,” DeJarnette said.
Parents said they're turning this into a teaching moment for their kids.
“As a parent, how do I go about explaining this to an eight-year-old, what happened?” Fogg said. “I don't want him to feel like okay, so she steals - is it okay if I steal? Because that's not right.”
Mirkovich is no stranger to Super Pawn. A store employee showed Mirkovich's transactions in 2018.
Along with the iPad, flagged by police, she also sold several watches, a GoPro camera and a wedding ring set. The pawn store employee added they do not know if things are stolen, unless a police report is filed.
CCSD said its iPads are etched with ‘Property of Clark County School District.'
According to the police report, Oseguera sold five more iPads to pawn shops. Police were still investigating if those belong to CCSD.
CCSD police said Mirkovich will be ‘assigned to home' once she is released.

— At the Morehead Planetarium in Chapel Hill, where many people will gather to watch the solar eclipse on Aug. 21, staring at the sun for even a brief moment is not recommended.
"Unless the sun is totally covered by the moon, you will get a retinal burn," said Dr. Don Budenz. "It could mean permanent vision impairment."
Budenz, an ophthalmologist at UNC Hospitals, said special eclipse glasses are one safe way to look at the sun.
The right glasses are recommended by NASA and carry a specific mark on the label.
"We want to be ISO certified," Budenz said. "In very small print, (it will say) 'ISO 12312-2.'"
With eclipse glasses on, the sun is dimmed to look like an orange ball, he said.
"I could literally look at the entire eclipse through these safety glasses without fear of harming my retina," he said.
Special eye protection is just as important in places of partial eclipse, like the Triangle.
"Here in the Triangle area, the sun will be, at its maximum, 93 percent eclipsed," said Amy Sayle, an astronomy educator at Morehead Planetarium.
Amy Sayle says, if you don't have eye protection, try using your hands.
"Make waffle patterns with your fingers. With your back to the sun, look at the image on the pavement. It will look like there are circles with a bite taken out of them," she said.
Only those in the path of the total eclipse will be able to look at it safely without protective eyewear. Even then, Dr. Allen Mask warns, "The moment the sun re-emerges, you can instantly damage your eyes."
"Don't risk it," Mask said. "Use certified eclipse glasses or use a pin-hole system that projects the image of the eclipse on the pavement or a white background."
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) – A suspect who claims to be a Sovereign Hebrew Israelite citizen is charged with biting off the end of a police officer's thumb and injuring another officer's leg.
Alexander Ray Johnson, 29, is currently being held on traffic charges, but charges of aggravated assault and resisting arrest are pending.
The Knoxville Police Department says two officers were conducting traffic enforcement on Woodbine Avenue around 1:15 p.m. Residents had asked for help to slow down cars in their neighborhood. The officers spotted an Acura MDX going 12 miles over the speed limit. The officers stopped the vehicle at the intersection with Milligan Street, but the driver, identified as Johnson, would not comply with the officers.
Police say the car had no legal license plate, only a Sovereign Hebrew Israelite sign. While they tried to arrest the suspect, he began fighting the officers and bit off the end of Officer Trey Lane's thumb. Officer Tim Edwards also suffered a leg injury in the fight.
Johnson was eventually detained and is being held in the Knox County Detention Center. Both officers were taken to the hospital for their injuries. Johnson was not hurt.
A passenger in the vehicle was taken in for questioning but is not expected to be charged.

We can barely cope with how heartbreaking Harry Potter is at points, but whilst the young wizard's life is pretty depressing, Dumbledore's heartbreaking family history actually casts a Crying Curse on my heart.
A quick recap: Dumbledore's sister Ariana was assaulted by three Muggle boys who saw her doing magic. Because of that, Ariana now refuses to use her powers and becomes ‘magically unstable'.
> This Harry Potter Theory About Why There Are So Few Pupils In His Class Is Legit Heartbreaking
And then, years later when her mother Kendra dies in an accidental outburst of magic from Ariana, it left Albus in charge of the family.
However, fans reckon they've got it sussed and have compiled a compelling theory about why “sweet and scared and harmless” Ariana was so dangerous.
The answer?
She was an Obscurial.
Definition: An Obscurus is a young witch or wizard who has had their magic compressed due to psychologically or physical abuse. Basically, they're too afraid to use their powers.
In the movie - Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them - Constance is too afraid to conduct magic so he internalises it instead.
As a result, he develops an Obscurus - a dark force which bursts out of him and proceeds to kill his abusive adopted mother.
If you cast your mind back to the final Harry Potter book, it makes even more sense.
Aberforth explains that her magic “turned inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn't control it” and their mother Kendra was killed because of it.
If you look at the plot of Fantastic Beasts, the theory gains even more traction.
The Dark Wizard, Gellert Grindelwald tries to use Constance as a weapon. He could have potentially got this idea from Ariana Dumbledore during the summer he spent in Godric's Hollow with his pal, Albus.
JK Rowling hasn't (as of yet) responded to the theory.

This deleted scene from Harry Potter is causing quite the stir...
A humanitarian crisis is brewing at the Longmore village where residents have been without electricity and water since the weekend.
Kouga Executive Mayor Elza van Lingen said 80 households were affected by the service interruption, caused by fire damage to electrical infrastructure.
“Longmore is situated in the Kouga region, but Nelson Mandela Bay is the supply authority for electricity. The Metro had hoped to have the power restored by today, but the damage was more extensive than anticipated,” she said.
“The burnt line also supplies electricity to the Loerie Dam and pump stations, hence, the interruption in the water supply.”
She said Kouga Municipality was carting water to the area and that 25 mobile toilets were being delivered to the village today. Generators are being brought in to try and get the pump stations up and running again.
“We are also collecting ready-made meals for the 204 people of the village because it has been difficult for them to make their own food.”
She said the full extent of the fire damage had not yet been determined but that early estimates put it at hundreds of millions of rands.
“Sixty percent of the Longmore Plantation, as well as the saw mill, burnt down. The cost of this damage will be immense.”
Van Lingen said the Department of Social Development was working with local farmers and farming associations to assess the damage to farms in the area.
“We are concerned that hundreds of farmworkers are going to be without work. It could take as long as three years or more for affected farmers to rebuild what they have lost.”
She said Social Development and the Jeffreys Bay Trauma Centre were continuing with counselling support. Eighteen children from the affected areas have already received counselling.
She appealed to non-profit organisations that work with poor communities to contact Sarah Hugo from the National Lottery at 086 006 5383 to see how they can assist those traumatised and affected by the fire.
Ready-made meals can be dropped off at the Thornhill Hotel, the Kouga Municipal offices at 33 Da Gama Road, Jeffreys Bay, or at the Kouga Fire Department on the entry road to Humansdorp from the N2.

The former US deputy national security advisor Ben Rhodes says President Trump had a "deep-seated hostility" towards President Obama that was, in part, due to racism.
Mr Rhodes served as adviser to President Obama from 2009-2017 and was also involved in writing many of President Obama's foreign policy speeches.
President Trump has previously denied claims that he is racist. In January, he told reporters he was "the least racist person", after reportedly using crude language to describe foreign countries in an Oval Office meeting.

INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — One person is dead after a multivehicle crash on the city's northwest side Wednesday night.
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said the accident occurred at the intersection of West 56th Street and Reed Road, which is near Eagle Creek Park.
According to authorities, three vehicles were involved in the crash.
This story will be updated as more information becomes available. 24-Hour News 8 has a crew on the way to the scene.
From living the good life in a northern California apartment, he has moved to an assisted living facility in his hometown of Cloquet, where he's starting to need help eating.
"I can no longer lift my hands up high," Setterquist, 56, said last week in the sitting area of his comfortable, brightly decorated room in the Fond du Lac Assisted Living Building. "Last night, I was unable to use a spoon, so I was kind of sad. It kind of gets to you sometimes."
Setterquist knows he is living in the shadow of a progressive, incurable disease. ALS, which is diagnosed in a little more than 6,000 people in the U.S. annually, attacks the nervous system, weakening muscles. It's famously associated with baseball legend Lou Gehrig. Actor-playwright Sam Shepard recently died of ALS.
But Setterquist — who started out at Nordstrom selling shoes in its Mall of America store and worked his way up to managing hundreds of employees in major cities — doesn't let things get to him much.
No longer able to indulge the artistic hobby he took up in his early 30s while living in New York, Setterquist is learning to grasp and guide the paintbrush with his lips and teeth.
The suggestion came from his sister, Sue Gonzales, who was with Setterquist in February when he was diagnosed at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center.
"I just hated to see him give it up because it makes him feel better, and it's just kind of a way to let his emotions out," Gonzales said in a phone interview from Seattle.
Gonzales, 60, is involved in the arts in Seattle, pre-screening films for the Seattle International Film Festival and belonging to the Seattle Art Museum. She's familiar with the stories of artists who have overcome obstacles to continue their work, she said.
Gonzales has power of attorney for Setterquist and is also his "super-duper supporter," he said. He recalls feeling down when she suggested he paint by mouth, and he initially dismissed the idea. "But then I thought, 'Well why the heck not?' "
Artistic outlet
Taking on a challenge in the face of difficulty is characteristic of their family, Gonzales said. The siblings grew up in a family of seven children whose parents owned and operated the Public Market Grocery Store in Cloquet. Their parents were "mellow, happy people," but it was a large family and there was work to be done.
"There wasn't any tolerance for moping," she said.
With both parents and several siblings still living in Cloquet, it made sense for Setterquist to return home, Gonzales said. In fact, their father, Jerald Setterquist, already had a room at the assisted-living center available because the family has Native American heritage.
"The social worker said the most important thing was for someone in that condition to be in a highly social setting," she said.
It has been a rough stretch for the Setterquist family. Jerald died last month, Bo Setterquist said. Their mother is in hospice care.
But Setterquist has long known that art serves as an outlet for him.
"I just like creating something," he said. "You have this blank canvas and start, and you build and build on it. And then when it's done, I feel really good about it."
Although he took one art class in college — he attended both the University of Wisconsin-Superior and the University of Minnesota Duluth — Setterquist said he didn't really get interested until he was in his early 30s, seeing the artwork in the home of his well-to-do in-laws in New York.
Among their possessions was an original piece by Jean-Michel Basquiat, the late-20th century artist whose works include one that recently sold for $110.5 million.
Setterquist liked Basquiat's style and mimicked it as he's starting painting, leading his father-in-law to start referring to him as "Bosquiat."
'I can do it'
A larger, Cloquet-themed work, painted recently while Setterquist lived in Boston, occupies a prime place on his bedroom wall. Another wall contains a display of the political aspect of Setterquist's life — clippings from a run for mayor of St. Paul in 1993.
On the far side of his bed, an easel displays his work in progress. A face, painted in straight lines, dominates the page. The number "3" — the number of his hockey jersey when he was in school and the soccer jersey number for one of his daughters — occupies the lower right side. After dipping his brush into oil paint with his clenched hands, he transfers the brush to his mouth, remarkably able to carry on a conversation as he applies paint, giving the face on the canvas a reddish flush.
It's his first work in which he has attempted to paint with his mouth, Setterquist said, but he feels it will be a keeper. He plans to give it to one of his daughters, who, like his ex-wife, live in California but already have paid visits to Cloquet.
No one has to tell Setterquist about the disease's debilitating aspects. A vigorous man who once worked on oil rigs in Wyoming and used to play basketball every day, he now gets tired quickly during a short walk. He said he expects to eventually be in a wheelchair.
But Setterquist is focusing on what he can do, not what he has lost. And what he can do still includes painting.
"It's going to take a little bit because it's slower," Setterquist said. "But I know I can do it. And then once I'm done it's going to be even cooler."
Demonstrators raise their fists in protest of President Trump's attempts to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an executive action made by President Obama that protected minors known as Dreamers who entered the country illegally from deportation, outside of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, USA on March 5, 2018.
A third federal judge on Tuesday ruled against the Trump administration's campaign to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for undocumented immigrants, ordering the administration not only to continue processing applications but also to resume accepting new ones.
U.S. District Judge John Bates of the District of Columbia was withering in his 60-page ruling, calling the administration's attempts to end the program, known as DACA, "arbitrary," "capricious," "virtually unexplained" and "unlawful," NBC News reported.
Bates stayed the ruling for 90 days to give the Department of Homeland Security time to come up with better arguments for scrapping the program. If it doesn't, he wrote, he will enter an order reinstating DACA in its entirety.

How an eleventh-hour border shift kept the suburbs in Illinois
hello
Editor's note: Most people know about the Great Chicago Fire and the apocryphal cow blamed for starting it by kicking over a lamp in Mrs. O'Leary's barn in 1871, but there's a lot more to Illinois history than that. Native American settlements thousands of years old, the battle over slavery, the transfer of influence from southern to northern Illinois, wars and riots, the leaders and gangsters and politicians and artists and athletes that shaped our state all will be part of a yearlong series of articles to mark Illinois' bicentennial. The Daily Herald and dozens of publications across the state are joining forces on the series, which will continue until Illinois' 200th birthday on Dec. 3, 2018.
Were it not for the action of an enterprising lawyer 200 years ago, the northern portion of Illinois would have the badger as the state animal and the Green Bay Packers as the home football team.
Indeed, the shrewd move in 1818 by Nathaniel Pope, the Illinois Territory's delegate in Congress, to relocate the original proposed boundary from the southern tip of Lake Michigan is regarded as a decisive event in Illinois history.
The shift meant Chicago, then an unincorporated backwater, became part of the nascent state with a port on the Great Lakes.
How Illinois' northern boundary was designated at 42 degrees, 30 minutes latitude was a tactical maneuver that effectively set Wisconsin statehood back 30 years.
Pope's move provided the groundwork for Chicago to become Illinois' economic juggernaut and literally turned state politics upside-down as the area grew. But it also had the national implication of ensuring Illinois would be a free state at a time of percolating political unrest over slavery.
"This was not a matter of people interested in the Chicago area. It was actually farsighted people who were about to become the leadership in the new state," said John Reda, associate professor of history at Illinois State University.
At the time, construction of the Erie Canal connecting the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes had just begun and Chicago was contemplated as one end of a canal providing a path to the Illinois River and on to the Mississippi.

By placing that terminus in Illinois, the state would be connected to New York and New England via the Great Lakes shipping channels, providing security for the perpetuity of the Union, Pope argued to Congress, and aligning Illinois firmly with the northern states.
Even then, "there was the possibility of a civil war," said Ken Olson, professor emeritus at the University of Illinois, who has written about the Illinois border controversy.
Congress "wanted to have a water route between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River for shipping supplies and soldiers if needed, since the Ohio River route could become contested," said Olson, co-author of a new book "Managing Mississippi and Ohio River Landscapes" that includes a chapter on the northern border.
Along with giving Illinois access to Lake Michigan, Pope's border modification raised the population nearly to the 40,000 required for statehood, Olson said in an article he co-authored for the Journal of Earth Science and Engineering.
- Mick Zawislak | Staff Photographer A historical marker along Route 47 south of Hebron tells how the area ended up in Illinois instead of Wisconsin.
By the time Illinois territory was considering statehood, only the northern border was in question. Kentucky and Indiana already were established and the Mississippi River formed a natural boundary on the west.
How did the situation come to be? The genesis was in the Northwest Ordinance Act of 1787 approved by Congress that set guidelines for vast tracts ceded to the new government after the Revolutionary War.
At first, the original 13 colonies thought they could simply extend their borders to the west, said Gregory M. Gordon, a history professor at the College of Lake County.
"What we call the northern part of Illinois was supposed to go to Connecticut, and the southern part of Illinois was supposed to be part of Virginia," he said.
Instead, the Northwest Ordinance set up the framework allowing three to five areas to apply for statehood on equal footing with other states.
"It was a pretty radical plan," Reda said.

Kaskaskia was the capital of the Illinois territory and home to Nathaniel Pope, a Kentucky native who became the first territorial secretary of Illinois and its delegate in Congress. His petition for statehood, presented to Congress in January 1818, was referred to a committee, with the northern boundary still to be set.
While some communities in the northwest part of the Illinois territory, such as Galena with its lead mining industry, were hopping, the northeast landscape was bleak.
Chicago "was a nothing place," Gordon said. "Southern Illinois was where the action was."
According to an article in the Illinois Periodicals Online project, the 1787 ordinance intended for the northern borders of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois to be aligned, touching the southern tip of Lake Michigan. However, the map used by Congress mistakenly showed the southern shore of Lake Michigan to be about 6 miles north. And when Indiana became a state, its northern boundary was approved about 10 miles north of the originally intended boundary.
- Mick Zawislak | Staff Photographer Welcome to Illinois, but it would have still been Wisconsin if not for some maneuvering 200 years ago to move Illinois' boundary northward.
Those precedents helped Illinois, as did a sense of urgency.
When a slave state entered the union, as Mississippi did in late 1817, there was a push by the North to counter with a free state. Some feared Missouri, a slave territory, would seek statehood and the ensuing national crisis could put Illinois' bid on hold.
Pope took a bold stance. In pushing for a more generous northern boundary, he "got an extra 50 miles," Reda said.
Illinois became the 21st state on Dec. 3, 1818, including an additional 8,500 square miles comprising what now are the 14 counties north of the original boundary line.
- Mick Zawislak | Staff Photographer Wisconsin's border with Illinois is about 50 miles north of where it was envisioned before 1818.
Wisconsin became a territory in 1836 and for several years protested against the northern Illinois boundary, claiming the southern tip of the lake as the true boundary. In 1840, delegates in northern Illinois meeting in Rockford declared the property properly belonged to Wisconsin.
But nothing came of the efforts and the matter ended in 1848, when Wisconsin was admitted as a state with its southern border where it exists today.
When Illinois was admitted, Pope was made U.S. judge of the district, which included the entire state. Pope County on the southern tip of the state is named for him.

CHICAGO — The mayors of Chicago and Washington are making a friendly wager on the outcome of the National League Division Series between the Cubs and the Nationals.
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said Friday that he's wagering beer, sausage and steaks. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser is betting beer and half-smokes.
The losing mayor also will make a donation to hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico.
Bowser says she's looking forward “to enjoying some of Chicago's most delicious treats.” Emanuel says there's no doubt last year's World Series champion Cubs will “take the series.”
The first game of the series is Friday night in Washington.
Social media users are banding together to expose attendees at the Charlottesville white nationalist rally to make sure their employers, friends, and neighbors know their names.
A man identified as Cole White was fired from his job at a Berkeley, California restaurant Top Dog when his participation in the rally was revealed by the Twitter account @YesYoureRacist.
@YesYoureRacist, which has 290,000 users, has been been on a mission to call out racism on the internet since the account was opened in October 2012.
After a car rammed into a crowd of counter-protesters on Saturday afternoon, killing paralegal Heather Heyer and injuring 19 other people, social media users mobilized in full force to begin naming and shaming the attendees, who included people identifying as neo-Nazis, white nationalists and members of the Ku Klux Klan.

"There were hundreds if not thousands of cameras running during the rally at any given moment. I am consistently impressed by amateur detectives who are able to unearth people's names, home addresses, and social media accounts by picking out details from publicly available photos and video," Cole Stryker, author of "Hacking the Future," a book about the history and future of online anonymity, told NBC News.
"Anyone who puts on a bandana or a mask and thinks that will do the trick is fooling themselves, and should be prepared to accept what's coming to them," he said.
Early Sunday morning, @YesYoureRacist and legions of people on Twitter got to work, sharing photos in the hope someone would recognize the people in them.
Before his identity was released, Peter Cvjetanovic, a student at the University of Nevada Reno, was just the young, angry looking white man carrying a Tiki torch through the streets of Charlottesville. The photo, showing hate and furor, went viral.
Now that the world knows his name, a Twitter account purported to belong to Cvjetanovic claims he is, "Changing the world for the better. Here to clear my name. White Nationalist."
“I did not expect the photo to be shared as much as it was. I understand the photo has a very negative connotation. But I hope that the people sharing the photo are willing to listen that I'm not the angry racist they see in that photo," Cvjetanovic told CBS Reno affiliate KTVN.
But he didn't apologize for his beliefs. He told the station that the planned replacement of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee "will be the slow replacement of white heritage within the United States and the people who fought and defended and built their homeland."

On Sunday, Marc A. Johnson, the president of the university, issued a statement saying, "Racism and white supremacist movements have a corrosive effect on our society. These movements do not represent our values as a university."
Other Twitter users also shared photos of people they hoped someone could identify. One photo of a man wearing an 82nd Airborne Division hat while giving the Nazi salute had been retweeted more than 18,000 times as of Monday afternoon.
Would *LOVE* to know the name of Mr. 82nd Airborne Division here rendering Hitler's Nazi salute. The 82nd jumped into Normandy on D-Day. pic.twitter.com/oObJNgXzEI — Brandon Friedman (@BFriedmanDC) August 13, 2017
"These people went with the intention of making a statement and I think they should have expected to be in pictures," Allison Matherly, coordinator of digital engagement at Texas Tech University told NBC News.Naming and shaming is perfectly acceptable on Twitter, as long as it doesn't cross the line into threatening behavior and no private information, such as an address or phone number, is shared.
Accounts such as @YesYoureRacist are also identifying people who attended an event in a public space, which does not violate any of Twitter's policies.
And of course, a picture can speak volumes, but sometimes they don't tell the entire story. YouTube star Joey Salads was initially named on Twitter as being at the event. He discredited by letting his followers know he's on vacation in Jamaica and that the photo used of him wearing a Nazi armband as a "social experiment" at a Trump rally was from a video posted in March.
While White lost his job as a consequence of attending the rally, Stryker said some of the people "will be fine and return to their communities, where racism is celebrated."
But he doesn't think naming and shaming will cause those at the center of it all to change their beliefs.
"We enjoy a powerful catharsis in exposing and punishing people who express objectionable opinions, even people who really do 'deserve' to feel shame, but let's not delude ourselves into thinking we've somehow reduced racism or its power," he said. "We've only pushed it into the dark where it will continue to fester."

Doctors, patients have played roles in creating opioid crisis
hello
At Amita Health, we are acutely aware of the challenge that the opioid crisis presents to heighten awareness of the public and medical professionals, alter attitudes of providers and obtain sustainable results in reversing this tragic phenomenon.
The public is aware that doctors underestimating opioid risks, patients demanding more intervention and drug companies marketing opioid products, have all played critical roles in creating this crisis.
We are committed to reducing exposure of all patients to opioids when possible, minimizing the risks for overdose by prescribing fewer pills to be available for diversion, usually accidentally, and to provide alternative, useful methods for chronic pain management. Long term opioid therapy for nonmalignant pain should never be a desirable outcome as it has not yielded the positive results that doctors and patients expect. However, stopping opioid therapy without a sound plan for the future is not appropriate either. These goals require conversations and planning in our offices and hospitals with mutual understanding.
Denying treatment is not a solution and will only aggravate risks to patients. Innovative care such as PRO-CAMP, an outpatient multidisciplinary pain rehabilitation program, through the Amita Health Neurosciences Institute is one example of collaboration between patients and providers in achieving this vision of reducing the role of drugs in general and opioids specifically in managing chronic pain. The pain management centers at Amita Health Alexian Brothers Medical Center, Amita Health St. Alexius Medical Center and Amita Health Adventist Medical Center Glen Oaks are also valuable resources for patients suffering from chronic pain. Our physicians collaborate with patients and our team of health psychologists and physical therapists to provide evidence-based, comprehensive care to help best manage chronic pain.
Unfortunately, there are many people in the community who have been exposed to long-term opioid therapy and have a difficult time coming off these medications. We now know that opioid medications can make a person's body physically and emotionally dependent and tolerant to their effects; it is these properties that lead to addiction and potentially overdose. Amita Health Alexian Brothers Behavioral Health Hospital connects patients to psychiatric, psychological, and social support services to optimize the ability to wean off of opioid medications resulting in the safe withdrawal of opioids over time.

The Rankin family was driving down I-480 in Omaha, Nebraska, on May 18, when they spotted a cat clinging to the roof of a van driving in the lane next to them. They were able to alert the drivers of the van so they could pull over and rescue the cat.
We live in a society where people are quite judgmental about how a woman dresses or behaves. Sadly, in our country, a smoking and tattooed women are still considered promiscuous.
Kriti Sanon is all set to question this stigma with her role of Bitti in her upcoming film Bareilly Ki Barfi. Talking about it, the actress was quoted as saying, "Smoking is not good for health and should be avoided. I am a non-smoker, but the point we want to make is that girls who smoke, who are fond of body art or break into a jig are not characterless."
She further added, "Our society has a very small bracket for 'good girls'. That bracket needs to broaden up or change. When a guy is moophat or smokes, he is not considered characterless, but you judge girls too fast. This is seen more in smaller towns. In an arranged marriage too, only a girl is asked all kinds of questions. I really want this to change."
On the other hand, Kriti's alleged relationship with Sushant Singh Rajput has been grabbing headlines time and again. Recently while talking to a leading daily, here's what she had to say-
"Gone are the days when enjoying a movie or dinner with a co-star would be called a date. There is nothing wrong in being friends with your co-actors and if that involves dinners or movies, why not? It's sad if I stop socialising with a friend, just because people are cooking up stories. I am not answerable to any one. I would still hang out with my male friends and people can assume anything they like. As for Sushant, I don't have control over what people talk about us. I have already spoken enough about it."
Directed by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwary, Bareilly Ki Barfi also stars Ayushmann Khurrana and Rajkummar Rao and is slated to release this week.

Youth justice spending has been slashed in the West Midlands - with experts warning teen crime rates could increase as a result.
In 2017/18, funding for youth offending teams (YOTs) across councils in the West Midlands metropolitan area was £4.4m, figures from Freedom of Information request reveal.
This corresponds to a cut of £2.7m in real terms compared to 2012/13.
Five years ago, funding was £6.6m, which would be worth £7.1m today.
These cuts have been made despite evidence YOTs have been effective at preventing young people from getting involved in crime.
Nationally the trend is the same - funding for YOTs across councils in England and Wales has been slashed by £45m in real terms compared to 2012/13.
Commenting on the national picture, the Howard League for Penal Reform - a prison reform charity - warns that reoffending rates will increase as a result.
Youth offending teams work with young people in trouble with the law and try to help them stay away from crime.
They also run local crime prevention programmes, help people and their families at court and help young people at the police station if they're arrested.

According to figures published by the Ministry of Justice and Youth Justice Board for England and Wales, the total number of first time entrants to the youth justice system in the West Midlands has dropped by 80 per cent over the last decade, from 6,340 in 2007 to 1,231 in 2016.
Birmingham saw the biggest cuts in England and Wales in YOTs grants from central government.
In 2017/18 funding was £1.9m, a cut of £1.2m in real terms from 2012/13, when the government offered £2.8m for these services - worth £3.1m today.
Meanwhile, the number of young people having their first brush with the law in Birmingham has dropped by 76 per cent from 2,746 in 2007 to 649 in 2016.
In 2012/13, funding for YOTs across councils in England and Wales stood at £107.8m but it has been slashed to £72m in 2017/18.
These cuts are happening despite the number of first time entrants to the youth justice system falling dramatically.
In 2007 there were 110,817 children and teenagers coming into contact with the justice system for the first time, while in 2016 there were 16,541.
This drop by 85 per cent shows that YOTs have been effective at preventing young people from getting involved in crime, according to the Local Government Association (LGA).
“All children should be treated the same"
Frances Crook, Chief Executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: “I would prefer to see children's services and detached youth workers properly funded, rather than have teams for working with one category of children instead of another.
“All children should be treated the same.
“There is evidence that the more contact that children have with the formal criminal justice system, the more entrenched they are likely to become, which increases reoffending rates.”
3 killed as building collapses in Anambra
Oko (Anambra) – Three persons on Tuesday were killed following the collapse of a four-storey building still under construction in Okeani, Oko community in Anambra state.
The building located close to the Federal Polytechnic, Oko, is owned by an indigene based in Europe.
A source who spoke on condition of anonymity said that the incident occurred at about 2a.m Tuesday after heavy rainfall recorded in the area.
The source said that the deceased, all believed to be non-indigenes and construction workers in the building were fast asleep when the structure collapsed.
A neighbor, Angela Ivories told journalists that one of the survivors and student of the Oko polytechnic, simply identified as Samuel sustained fracture on his hand.
“When the building first showed sign of collapse on Sunday, Musa advised his co-workers to vacate the building, but some of them did not heed his advice,” she said.
According to Ivories, it was that same night they were advised to vacate the building that the structure collapsed.
Anambra State Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Red Cross Society, Prof. Peter Katchy, confirmed the incident.
Katchy said that they were trying to get to the root cause of the collapsed building, and advised those constructing houses to always engage experts.

Kiss frontman Gene Simmons is trying to trademark the “devil horns” rock hand gesture. The bassist filed an application with the US Patent and Trademark Office last Friday (June 9), according to The Hollywood Reporter.

In the documentation, Simmons claims he first made the gesture popular during the band's Hotter Than Hell tour in 1974. The rocker wrote he wants to register the hand gesture for “entertainment, namely, live performances by a musical artist; personal appearances by a musical artist.”
Whether or not he is granted the trademark, fans might love that Simmons even included a drawing in his application.
Francis Queye treks down a dusty path in the baking lunchtime heat between palm nut trees towards a cluster of mud-caked huts. He is carrying a wooden rod with four black lines marked along its length. In a clearing under a tree in the hamlet of Fa-asemkye, he holds it upright to measure the height of a three-year-old boy. He hands him a single pill to swallow with a gulp of water and writes his name, Daniel Bah Joshua, in his notebook.
Queye is one of the thousands of volunteers who are mobilised twice a year across Ghana to perform this procedure. It is a simple routine, but in the coming years it could rid the country of onchocerciasis, an insect-transmitted scourge that affects about 37m people worldwide, the vast majority in Africa.
Known colloquially as river blindness, the disease is caused by a parasite that spreads via the bite of the blackfly breeding on the banks of fast-flowing rivers. Left untreated, worms grow inside the body, causing itching, lumps and eventually blindness, when they enter the eye. A periodic dose of ivermectin — a drug originally developed to tackle parasites in dogs — can both treat and protect against the disease.
With no easy access to weighing scales as he travels about, Queye uses his measuring stick to estimate people's size and assess how much medication they need, before administering between one and four tablets. A cocoa farmer, he was recruited last year to work on an ambitious national campaign to eliminate the disease (technically, elimination means reducing the number of cases to less than 0.1 per cent of the population) within the next four years. “I do this out of patriotism,” he says.
The programme, which is funded by the state and non-governmental organisations, including the UK charity Sightsavers, begins in the factories of Merck, the US pharmaceutical company that developed ivermectin and has been donating it for almost three decades. The medicine is shipped to voluntary drug distributors such as Queye, who seek to reach the millions at risk in remote areas. In the Birim North district of southern Ghana, where Fa-asemkye is located, 62,000 people were given ivermectin last year.

Substantial progress has been made since this so-called “mass drug administration” began. But that was in 1998, and the campaign is continuing, with an estimated 5m people still at risk in Ghana.
In the past few years, the number of districts reporting river blindness has dropped sharply, giving the programme's co-ordinators the confidence to shift from a target of bringing the disease under control to planning its elimination. But the final stretch will be difficult. Ivermectin only kills the baby worms, or microfilariae, in the body, so it has to be given each year for up to 15 years — the lifetime of the adult worms that continue to live and reproduce inside the body. This requires the continued distribution of drugs and laborious surveillance of patients.
“It's a big challenge getting access to the community,” says Thomas Azurago, the health director in Birim North's administrative centre, New Abirem. The district has no ambulance and cars are in very short supply, with just a few motorbikes for health workers to reach remote areas. It is not always easy to find and retain unpaid community drug volunteers, whose goodwill is being stretched as a growing number of competing disease programmes seek them to dispense advice and distribute products, including drugs and anti-malaria mosquito nets.

While most people in the villages are happy to take ivermectin, some have been put off by potential side-effects on a scale from itching to, very rarely, a life-threatening skin condition called Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In Azurago's district, just 2 per cent of people actively refused to take the drug last year, official data show, but about 6 per cent of locals simply did not turn up on the day they were scheduled to receive it, with many busy at work on their farms or away on errands.
The success of the programme has, in itself, been a brake on the final push to elimination. Onchocerciasis is no longer widely seen in communities and, as a result, it is not perceived to be a serious threat. Meanwhile, the health system is struggling to cope with other pressures; Azurago says his colleagues are more concerned about malaria, respiratory infections and a rise in cases of hypertension and other lifestyle-related diseases.

Several hours' drive from Birim North in the fishing settlement of Asubende, which means “by the river” in the local language, half a dozen people in their 60s and 70s sit on benches and talk about how they became blind after years of untreated infection.
“We didn't know the disease was transmitted by flies or that we would go blind,” says Emmanuel Duako, a fisherman, recalling the many members of his parents' generation who were blind. “We thought it was just linked to old age. We didn't know the cause. We used to go to the river to fish and to wash,” he says. Many of his friends also lost their sight.
We didn't know the cause — we thought it was just old age
Mary Bacheyiri, a retired teacher, is a local community drug distributor who works for a range of different health programmes. She visits schools to talk to pupils about the importance of using bed-nets as a guard against malaria-carrying mosquitoes and boiling water to prevent other infections. She says she was motivated to volunteer after her husband went blind from onchocerciasis: “He was tested and diagnosed with river blindness, but he began to itch after starting the tablets and stopped taking them,” she says. “The others who took the drugs were fine.”
The prevalence of river blindness has fallen sharply in Asubende, down from 88 per cent in 1987 to 3 per cent in 2014. But tracking down remaining cases is difficult both for onchocerciasis and another neglected condition in Ghana, lymphatic filariasis, which threatens an estimated 12m people across the country and carries great stigma. Also known as elephantiasis, it is transmitted by mosquitoes and can lead to painful and disabling swelling in the arms, legs and genitals if left untreated. Sores develop that cause further infection, and sometimes amputation is necessary. In most cases, the fluid cannot be drained from the limbs, although men can have surgery to alleviate swelling of the scrotum (hydrocele).

“People can't work, can't walk, have to stay at home and cannot have sex,” says Benjamin Marfo, a surgeon and the deputy programme manager of neglected tropical diseases at Ghana's health ministry. He estimates that several thousand people are waiting for operations for hydrocele and some amputations.
Marfo has just returned from a trip to the country's far north, and describes the difficulty of identifying lymphatic filariasis there. Even though less intrusive diagnostics are being introduced, the traditional technique requires analysis of blood taken from patients at night — the only time when the worms migrate to the surface of the body and can be identified. That requires healthcare workers to bring people together when they would normally be sleeping and to overcome suspicions of occultism that are linked to the drawing of blood. “People sometimes think you are involved in rituals,” he says.
Lymphatic filariasis can be treated with an annual dose of ivermectin combined with albendazole, a drug developed and donated worldwide by GlaxoSmithKline. The medicines cannot cure or reverse the condition but have at least prevented further deterioration for Naomi Cominey, who was diagnosed belatedly after she felt pain, swelling and liquid oozing from her legs.
“At first, people told me it was because I had sinned against my husband, and I shouldn't go to hospital or they would amputate,” she says. Instead, alongside periodically taking the drugs, she still manages to work as a hairdresser. She has learnt to wash her legs carefully and to elevate them at night to ease the swelling.

Greater co-ordination of the distribution of the two drugs since 2007 has helped bring down the number of people at risk, from 12m in 98 districts in 2001 to 2m in 17 districts today. Public health experts say the increasing use of mosquito nets has also helped stem the spread of elephantiasis.
Other man-made interventions in Ghana have had confounding effects. On one hand, building dams in Birim North to allow gold mining to expand has slowed the flow of rivers there, reducing the size of breeding grounds for blackfly. But the larger volume of stagnant water has created an attractive new habitat for mosquitoes and the river snails that carry another neglected tropical disease, schistosomiasis (snail fever).
Cross-border migration means similar momentum is needed on public health from neighbouring countries such as the Ivory Coast, says Nana-Kwadwo Biritwum, the Ghanian health ministry's neglected tropical diseases programme manager. There is, however, good reason to hope the hurdles can be overcome. In the past few years, Ghana has rid itself of polio and Guinea worm, and plans to submit a dossier to the World Health Organization this autumn to say it is now also free of trachoma, a bacterial infection that causes blindness. This would help build confidence that it can also eliminate lymphatic filariasis by 2020 and onchocerciasis by 2025.
That may be scant comfort to an older generation who will continue to bear the burden of infection. Villages such as Asubende have been largely abandoned by younger generations fleeing the disease, says Duako. “Most people moved elsewhere. Those who are still here have no place to go.” But at least the remaining children, some of whom are running around nearby, face a healthier future than Duako and his generation.
China Aircraft Leasing Company (CALC) announced (14-Jun-2017) it entered into an aircraft purchase agreement with Boeing to acquire 50 737 MAX aircraft for the aggregate list price of approximately HKD45.3 billion (USD5.8 billion). The aircraft are expected to be delivered in stages through to 2023. This is CALC's first direct aircraft purchase from Boeing, and is expected to significantly expand and diversify the company's fleet portfolio and enable it to meet the rising demand for aircraft with greater efficiency. CALC currently owns a fleet of 87 aircraft. With this new order, CALC's outstanding order book now consists of 139 aircraft (89 Airbus and 50 Boeing), putting the company on track to deliver a total of no less than 226 aircraft by 2023.

JOHNSON COUNTY, Ind. (WISH) – A Johnson County man is in custody after allegedly stabbing his mother.
According to the Johnson County Sheriff's Office, on Oct. 5 deputies responded to Johnson Memorial Hospital after a female said she had been stabbed by her son. After arriving at the hospital, the woman, Judy Skirvin, told deputies that she had been stabbed in the right arm by her son, James Skirvin.
Judy told deputies that the incident happened between 11 and 11:30 p.m. at a residence in the 3500 block of South 550 South in Franklin. The police report shows that James entered the residence highly intoxicated and was looking for something to eat. It was at that time James began repeatedly kicking a small dog around the house and then threatened to “chop the dog up into little pieces for everyone to see.”
The police report shows that Judy instructed James to grab whatever food he wanted and then exit the residence. James then grabbed a knife, attempting multiple times to cut his mother's torso. During this exchange, Judy did sustain a cut across her right bicep. Deputies state that the cut appeared to be nearly two inches deep.
After talking with the victim's daughter, Judy Skirvin, about the incident as well, deputies went to the residence. Once at the residence deputies did locate James inside a nearby camper. A small pool of blood near one of the entrances of the house was also discovered.
James was then taken into custody and was transported to the Johnson County Jail. She is facing a preliminary charge of battery.
Andre Iguodala ruled out for NBA Finals Game 1 due to knee injury
Oakland, USA, May 30 (EFE).- The Golden State Warriors announced Wednesday that its forward Andre Iguodala will not be playing in Game 1 of the NBA Finals, held on Thursday at the Oracle Arena in Oakland, California.
Iguodala has missed the last four games of his team due to left knee soreness which resulted from a clash with James Harden during Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals.
“I don't think I have much left to play with,” the player acknowledged during media day on Wednesday.
The Warriors' medical team revealed that there has been inflammation around the nerve in Iguodala's left knee.
“I'm making some progress, slower than we expected. But, if you're being realistic, it is what it is,” the MVP ( the best player) of the 2015 Finals said.
Warriors coach Steve Kerr said that the player was frustrated because “his body had just not responded to this point.”
Iguodala, the man in charge of defending LeBron James most of the time in the previous Finals, averaged 8.7 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.7 assists in the series against the Rockets, and played about 27 minutes per game.
FLORIDA (CBS Local) – A woman in Florida has gone viral for all the wrong reasons after getting caught shaving her legs in a hotel pool.
In a video posted to Reddit, the swimmer was outed by fellow pool-goers who can be heard commenting on the public shaving. The May 27 post was quickly up-voted by over 55,000 Reddit users.
Several people commenting on Reddit claimed this personal hygiene foul is just the tip of the iceberg at public pools across the country. “Yeah I used to work at a public pool and for whatever reason they attract the worst of humanity. I would never swim in a public pool after that experience,” one person alleged.
“My leg hurts from running too much and I was considering becoming a swimmer at my local YMCA,” another reader added. “After reading this comment. Nope. I'd rather run on my sprained knee.”
Although the Internet's “court of public opinion” is largely in agreement that the unidentified swimmer committed a serious pool no-no, Florida doesn't actually have rules against shaving in a public swimming area.
A woman has taken being a bridezilla to the next level by holding an “auction” for potential bridesmaids to bid for a place in her wedding.
The shocking tale was posted to Reddit by the bride's sister, who said the idea was “ridiculous” — but her sister and mom are now accusing her of being “selfish” for not wanting to pay.
The 33-year-old stunned sister, who wrote under the username SistersBridesmaid, said: “My sister was always very spoiled by our parents since she's the youngest of four kids and my mom had thought she wouldn't be able to have any more kids.”
“Don't get me wrong, she can be very sweet and caring too, but she's just a very immature high maintenance person. Basically she got engaged a couple of months ago and will be getting married at the end of August.”
“Anyway she still hasn't chosen her bridesmaids. Instead, she has sent out dozens of…invitations, to various girls. It's an invite to attend and participate in a ‘bidding auction' on the six spots in her bridal party.”
“Whichever six of all these chicks bid the most will be the bridesmaids. There's also an auction for being her maid of honor. My sister and her fiancé are using the money to fund the wedding and honeymoon.”
The baffled sister shared how most of the girls who have received a request to be in the bridesmaid bidding war are not close to the bride, who is 22.
And also said the husband-to-be is rich, so the couple isn't lacking in money.
She commented: “She just has a really big social circle from parties and I guess she invited everyone she even vaguely knows.”
“I just find this really awkward and tacky. She's basically having people pay to be in her wedding.”
“I told my sister they weren't lacking for funds because it's obvious and she just said, ‘Well, if they'll already be bidding, we figure we should put their money towards a great event for everyone' as though this is an act of service she's doing for them. It's totally nonsensical.”
The sister said she had always planned to attend the wedding but felt that paying to be in it was unnecessary.
However, this mentality hasn't gone down well with the family.
SistersBridesmaid said: “Now my sister is throwing a tantrum that I haven't RSVPed to the ‘auction,' and got our mom on her side too.
“My mom says I will ‘look bad if I don't put in a bid when it's my own sister' and called me selfish.”
The confused woman reached out for advice from the Reddit community, asking if she should cave and pay to be a bridesmaid or stick to her guns.
Many users were stunned at the bizarre story and couldn't believe the bride-to-be had thought it was an acceptable idea.
One user commented: “In my opinion her sister is highly manipulative. The nutters are those willing to actually pay to be in her wedding party. Why would anyone do this? I can't wrap my brain around it.”
Another said: “Sister wants to measure how much these people ‘love' her, with actual dollar signs.”
And another wrote: “I can't believe other people are going along with it. I'm getting second hand embarrassment from the whole thing.”
The path upward isn't always straightforward. “It's months of paperwork and months of not hearing anything. And it's all terrible,” says Meyerland homeowner Drew Shefman, who says he gave up on his FEMA elevation grant application.

City Officials say 80 percent of Houston was built before flood plain maps were even developed. Many properties that fall in those plains have been subject to three flooding events, in as many years. Now, one answer to mitigate repetitive flooding is home elevation. But, the way upward isn't always straight forward.
Jennifer and Randy Claridge have been through a lot.
“It is really hard, it feels constant. And yes, we lost everything that we owned. We lost all of our furniture, toys and books, all of that stuff, again,” Jennifer Claridge said. “It was heartbreaking seeing that. It was heartbreaking to see my house torn down to studs.”
Claridge said their Meyerland home has flooded every year, since 2015… and they've been navigating the FEMA elevation grant process, ever since.
“We are just waiting….We can't move back in here until this thing has been lifted,” Claridge said. “And, secondly: Yes, having to advocate, having to make those calls… But most of it is just trying to keep up with everything that has to get done in a day: adjusters, and FEMA, and ‘Where is the grant?'”
The Claridges finally heard they were approved for their elevation grant, only days before Harvey hit.
But right around the corner, contractors at their neighbor's home got his house up; just one day before the massive storm.
“I definitely have a mixed swirl of emotions. I'm ecstatic that we beat the flood. That's amazing,” said Meyerland homeowner Drew Shefman. “But my heart aches for my entire community. We didn't flood personally, but everyone I know flooded.”
Shefman said he was done waiting for his FEMA elevation grant application, and self-funded his own elevation.
“The whole process needs to be evaluated differently. What's currently in place is not sustainable for what needs to happen,” Shefman said. “It takes too long, too much red tape, too much paperwork. No humanity in the traumatic events that have already taken place. It's months of paperwork and months of not hearing anything. And it's all terrible.”
Shefman's contractor, Phillip Contreras, is one of a handful of contractors in Houston who are qualified to do private and FEMA grant lifts.
“Currently, right now, we've got seven City of Houston jobs, sponsored by FEMA, and then two private jobs going on,” said Contreras, owner of Arkitektura Development Inc. “Almost anything we touch could be lifted….Elevating houses has been going on for years. I mean, they elevated all of Galveston in the 1900s. It's just the process has developed more and more, over time.”
Contreras said you can even find 18 foot elevations, over in Galveston. And he said the overall process generally takes about four to five months.
“Up to about five feet, it runs roughly about $75 a square foot. On high rises, it could range anywhere from $110 to $130. And it's really going to depend on what the people want. Ya know, some people may want just basic code with basic stairs to get in their home,” said Contreras.
But some people can't settle for the bare minimum, because of homeowners' association restrictions.
“The purpose of these grants is to get homes out of harm's way. To get them high and dry. It's not necessarially to beautify them,” said Jamila Johnson, Managing Engineer for the City of Houston's Floodplain Management Office.
“It may not be acceptable to your homeowner's association that you have five foot platform with wooden stairs as your front porch now,” said Johnson. “It may not be acceptable to you or your HOA that that your house is now up on concrete block columns instead of sitting on the ground, like all your other neighbors' homes…. So all those types of costs are left to the homeowner to deal with,” said Johnson.
Johnson said funding for these types of programs is not where it should be.
“I think that it was not the best decision from FEMA to have such a low funding level for these very needed programs, that are oversubscribed every year,” said Johnson. “Houston would have liked to elevate 150 homes in 2016, but instead, we only got funding for 40.”
The Claridges were lucky enough to be one of those 40 homes. And Randy Claridge said his neighborhood should not be condemned, just because it's flood-prone.
“When Meyerland was built, it was not in the flood plain…. That problem is coming to us. We did not go to that problem,” said Claridge. “This was a good place. This is a good place. And we're fighting hard to protect it and to keep it for the future generations.”
And Claridge said the neighborhood is worth fighting for.
“We weren't looking for this fight, but we're in it,” said Claridge.
And with over 126,000 homes damaged in the Houston area, a lot of people are in this fight with them.
XENIA — A Dayton man was arraigned via video in Greene County Common Pleas Court May 25 for alleged felonious assault and murder.
According to the indictment, a grand jury found that on March 8 Kali N. Christon allegedly caused the death of an individual as a result of committing or attempting to commit an offense of violence, and “did knowingly cause serious physical harm” to the individual.
Fairborn Police Department officers were dispatched to a Fairborn home March 8 to respond to a non-breathing child, a police report says.
The murder charge is punishable by imprisonment for an indefinite term of 15 years to life. Felonious assault is a second-degree felony.
Judge Michael Buckwalter is assigned to the case. Attorney Griff Nowicki said he will represent the defendant.
Christon is being held in the Greene County Jail on a $250,000 no 10 percent bond. Court records indicate a a pre-trial is set for Tuesday, June 5; a final pre-trial for Wednesday, June 27 and a jury trial for Monday, July 16.

Naperville parks opening $7.8 million maintenance facility
hello
They're used to a glorified shed, but now employees of Naperville Park District's trades, fleet, parks and police departments have a place specifically designed for doing their work.
The district's Knoch Park Central Maintenance Facility will open with a ribbon-cutting ceremony at 9:30 a.m. Saturday, featuring 27,000 square feet of vehicle bays and storage lockers, operations offices and fueling stations that are built to function for the next 50 years, Executive Director Ray McGury said.
The $7.8 million maintenance center replaced the Barn Recreation Center and the old central shop on 2.2 acres within Knoch Park at 427 Martin Ave. Although the well-loved teen hangout from decades past is no more, visitors to the maintenance facility can notice its presence.
The Barn's 1965 cornerstone is lodged in the new building's interior wall, below an interpretive sign explaining the former recreation center's history. The 26-foot-tall ceiling of the main meeting room and the red paint and wood paneling also give a slight farming feel.
"It has the design motif of a barn," said Eric Shutes, director of planning.
The building's southwest wing is dedicated to the park police, a small department of two full-time and 30 part-time officers that is gaining more cubicles, new lockers and storage spaces and two TVs where live surveillance footage from cameras at parks will be shown.
Nearby is the parks department's vehicle and equipment bay, the home base for roughly 30 employees who maintain the grounds and landscapes at parks near downtown Naperville, including Knoch Park, Sportsman's Park, the Ron Ory Community Garden Plots and the Bill Young Athletic Fields, among others.
Kevin Finnegan, director of parks, said the department is moving in equipment and materials and plans to start operating out of the new facility next week. Thankfully, he said, the project remained on schedule despite a rainy April.
The trades and fleet departments each have their own bay as well, areas where vehicles can pull through for easy loading and unloading of things such as redwood boards to fix park signs. Seven full-time and five part-time trades workers will use the space, along with three full-time mechanics, Finnegan said.
In between the bays is a custodial area with a washing machine and dryer along with new locker rooms for workers to shower and change. Finnegan said the old central shop had one shower for use by everyone, which hasn't been ideal as the workforce has diversified.
"We increasingly have more women on our staff now," he said.
Park users will be able to stop in the new maintenance facility to use the restrooms, which are just inside the main entrance on the west side, even on evenings and weekends. The facility also includes 50 public parking spaces on the west side and a meeting room that can be available for use by community clubs.
After two major openings in recent years -- Knoch Knolls Nature Center in 2014 and Fort Hill Activity Center in 2016 -- McGury said the park district needed a better hub for the operations that keep its amenities in top shape.
"It's important to take care of all of this, day in and day out," McGury said. "To take care of what you have, we're set up well now for the next 50 years."
MIAMI COUNTY — The Miami County Commissioners signed off on school resource officer agreements for two local school districts.
The board approved agreements between Bethel Local Schools and Miami East Schools and the Miami County Sheriff's Office.
The agreement with Bethel is for part-time SRO services during the 2018-19 school year. It includes 80 hours of service per month, alternating weekly between an 18- and 24-hour schedule. The district has agreed to pay $31,362 for the year.
The Bethel school board approved the agreement at their last meeting.
The commissioners approved a three-year agreement with Miami East Schools, beginning in the 2018-19 school year and ending in 2021.
The deputy will provide 40 hours of service per week during the school year. The cost of the agreement begins at $62,724 the first year and increases the next two years.
Deputies will develop a curriculum of instruction about issues that affect teens, including underage drinking, smoking and conflict mediation.
The commissioners also approved the purchase of a workstation treadmill for the Communication Center at a cost of $1,399.
Center Director Jeff Busch asked the commissioners to consider the purchase at a meeting earlier this year, saying it would give staff a chance to get up and move during their long shifts.

When Black Sabbath was still performing blues covers in bars Jinx Dawson was turning heads with the groundbreaking band Coven. Long before pentagrams and upside down crosses became standard on metal records Dawson shocked labels and critics with her unabashed embrace of the occult. Coven's first record Witchcraft Destroys Minds & Reaps Souls – pulled from shelves right around the time of the Manson murders – is now regarded as a classic, and the sound and look were the boilerplate for the vast majority of the occult rock bands that started a few years into the new millennium (for a deep dive check out Nick Green's authoritative March 2013 feature). Dawson's career with Coven continued intermittently through the decades. She also worked in Hollywood and as a backup singer. But Coven was always her passion and embodied much of how she viewed the world. Dawson has assembled a new Coven lineup that will make their long anticipated live return at Roadburn this week. She is also working on a memoir. Dawson talked to us about family, the return of the occult rock standard bearers and life as a spiritual rebel in a dogmatic age.
How long had you been thinking about bringing Coven back and when did things align for the Roadburn appearance and presumably other shows in the future?
I always wanted to bring the band back but I had a period where my father was very ill. I had to take care of him for almost ten years. My father had cancer of the liver. After a few months we did a few things and his liver spots went away, which is very unusual. But things were starting to break down. He was 86 and had a lot of problems. I was the only one who was qualified to care for him. So I came back from Los Angeles to do that. After he died, it was very hard to get things going. There were a lot of problems in the country with the economy. Then, there was an estate situation and that took about five more years. I did have a reunion of the original players in 2006 and wanted to do something then. But I guess I didn't push enough at that point.
When you did officially decide to put the band back together how did you find the right people to work with, who would keep the original spirit of the band alive?
You have to pull out the leather! (laughs). Ricktor Ravensbruck (The Electric Hellfire Club, Wolfpack 44) wanted me to sing a few songs on a project so I did that in Chicago. Then, I released another album a few years ago and he played guitar on it. The guitar player we had (previously) wasn't going to do another show with Coven – he was always afraid of the band. He wasn't coming back. The rest of them were into the occult and came back into the circle.
What do you think about how so many different generations have picked up on Coven in the decades after your debut? It's almost taken on a life of itself.
It has. All of our musician friends back then said do not do that stuff because it will keep you from being a success and it's too controversial. They said we should just do regular rock and roll. When you are the first one to hack a path you can get left behind because people are afraid of what you are doing. Now I see all of these bands trying to copy what we did. Actually, there were some bands that copied us right out of the gate.
When The Devil's Blood came out the songwriter Selim Lemouchi was incredibly deferential to Coven and mentioned how much your music meant to him.
I do find it nice that newer bands recognize us. The bands that came after us, in the 70s and 80s, never recognized us at all. That was how the business was. You never said where you got things. The music might not have been quite the same but the occult situations were there, as well as the photographs and lyrics. You probably know who I'm talking about. We were probably copied within eight to nine months out of the gate.
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
They say that, but it would be nice if people said where they got the imitation! (laughs)
So, do you follow some of these new bands closely? What kinds of things move you in people that play a similar style as Coven?
I wouldn't say I follow things closely but I do check things out. I am a music lover. But I don't go into it in depth because I think some of these bands act too serious with the face make up. It's almost like they are trying to do a hard sell. The occult is a practice and shouldn't be a hard sell. I do feel that they should be into it rather than dabble. Maybe they are just trying to do a horror show or a film or something? I'm not sure if some of these bands are coming from a knowledgeable or sincere area.
How did the Roadburn gig come together?
After I went on Facebook people started realizing I was available. About six or seven years ago all of these festivals started contacting me. Like I mentioned, the band wasn't a working unit. I was jumping onstage with friends and doing guest spots to keep my chops up. To try to keep a band together seemed like an impossible situation. Walter from Roadburn is one of the folks who contacted me. (Later) I was able then to say I think we can do it.
Roadburn seems like the ideal place for a comeback in that it's an intimate and curated festival. It won't be like you are dropped into a field somewhere.
(laughs). That's good to know! They seem very sincere. You're right: it's a good place to restart.
What can people expect from your stage show? Will you curate an experience like the early days or will you update for a new time?
I don't think there will be much updating to tell the truth. I don't think I've changed much. I've just seen time pass and other people jump into the fray. Of course there will be some new sounds with a new guitarist and bassist. We don't really go for the Halloween look. There will be some added things and some video footage. I think it's going to stand out as very different. I'm excited about it.
How will you select a set from three classic Coven albums?
Most of the songs will come from the Witchcraft… album. I have to do “Blood On The Snow” because we have this incredible video we did with Walt Disney in 1974. And we'll probably do a few songs off the CD that was released in 2013, even though some of those songs were from a 1970 demo for Elektra. I took a few of those into the studio and finished them and added some new songs.
What excites you the most about returning to the stage?
I always liked performing because as a child I was an opera protégé. I was immediately into the stage. I had a band starting when I was 13. So I do like the stage format and bringing a message. I think what's great here is that everybody drew me out to do this. When we did show (in the past) people didn't understand the sign of the horns or the reason for the coffin or the upside down cross. Now that people understand these things I think it will be thrilling. And I just love to sing and love music and meeting people. I've been hiding away for a long time.
When you were ‘hiding away' did you hear from people a lot through letters or the Internet or other means?
The Internet was a big piece of this puzzle, especially when I was caring for my father. Facebook was just coming around when I was caring for him. I did have a punk band in the 80s. I also went on tour with The Doobie Brothers and The Beach Boys. Nobody really knew who I was, which was interesting. I was always upset because I couldn't do Coven again. But I always kept busy in some form. So I'd say I was hiding in plain sight.
What is it about your music that continues to speak to people after the decades?
That's a good question. It's almost like it's the last culture to explore. Everything else in music has been explored. Religion has a bit to do with it. People are tired of what religion has done to the planet. This is all natural to me. But some people who were brought up Christian are looking at a pagan yet futuristic way to live. It's interesting that it's taken so long. It seems like this always happens to me. I will do it and it will be too much so people will overlook it. Then, thirty years later, it's all over the place. I'm happy to see that.
You've been on a very different path your entire life. I have to ask what you think about where we are as a culture and the huge divide in our country between secular people and religious conservatives?
Of course I am against religion. I think it's a path to destruction. It doesn't bring people together. It tears them apart. It's an archaic way people try to figure out why they are on the planet and their purpose. I'd like to see religion thrown out for a more progressive society. I think a lot of what is going on is terrifying, really. When I started in 1968 presidents were getting shot. Then, it kind of mellowed out. But (now) this is a dangerous place and people need to rethink things. People came up with religion in the Dark Ages as a means of control. It's obviously not controlling anybody! Maybe we can embrace pagan things that are more intelligent and respectful of nature.
What about the exorbitant prices that people are paying for an original vinyl copy of your debut? Getting a copy of that is a financial challenge.
Even though I was from money when you see a record being sold for $500 you can be like: “I'd like to have some of that!” (laughs). I do wonder why people are getting that amount and why are they charging so much? It is a rare album because it was pulled when we left Chicago. The Manson murders didn't help the situation. I can see (the charge) for the rarity situation. I have several and I didn't pay $500 for them!
What's been the most difficult lesson you have learned in your life journey?
I shouldn't have ever told people I was from a Left Hand Path family! I probably would have ended up being a pop artist and would be retired now (laughs). But what are you going to do — you have to do what you feel now. My family wasn't really happy about that, either, and my great aunts took me out of a will. But I was like every other kid: I was going to do what I wanted. There are many things and they will be in the book.
Will there be new Coven music?
I do see new music in the future. There will be another one, for sure

Nikki Haley, America's ambassador to the United Nations, suggested that the United States' participation in February's Winter Olympics in South Korea remains up in the air, while the White House said Thursday that "no official decision has been made" regarding the games.
Haley was initially asked Wednesday night on Fox News whether sending American athletes was a "done deal" given the tensions in the region, and responded that the situation is an "open question."
"I have not heard anything about that," she added, "but I do know in the talks that we have — whether it's Jerusalem or North Korea — it's about, how do we protect the U.S. citizens in the area?"
Her comments came on the day President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel — causing uproar among world leaders and fueling the threat of violent protests.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Mission to the U.N. said on Thursday that Haley's statements were taken out of context.
"The United States looks forward to participating in the Winter Olympics in the Republic of Korea next year," the spokesperson said. "As always, the protection of American citizens overseas is our most important priority. We remain closely engaged with the Koreans and other partner nations to secure the venues as we do every Olympics."
On Thursday afternoon, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited security considerations when she said going to the Olympics wasn't set in stone.
But "the goal," she said, is for athletes to compete.
Minutes after the daily press briefing ended, Sanders clarified her remarks in a tweet saying that "the U.S. looks forward to participating" in the Olympics and helping to ensure the venues are secure.
UPDATE: The U.S. looks forward to participating in the Winter Olympics in South Korea. The protection of Americans is our top priority and we are engaged with the South Koreans and other partner nations to secure the venues. — Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) December 7, 2017
The 2018 Olympics are set to take place in the mountainous and remote region of PyeongChang, roughly 50 miles from the heavily protected North Korean border.
Haley, when asked about the safety of the U.S. delegation, said further conversations are necessary.
"What have we always said — we don't ever fear anything. We live our lives. ... What we will do is make sure we're taking every precaution possible to make sure that they're safe and to know everything that's going on around them," Haley added. "So I think that's something where the administration's going to come together and find out the best way to make sure they're protected."

A U.S. Olympic Committee spokesman, Mark Jones, has said that staging a sports spectacle like the Olympics can be a challenge for any host city, which must contend with an influx of international visitors. He added that American officials were working with organizers and law enforcement ahead of time.
Jones added Thursday: "We have not had any discussions, either internally or with our government partners, about the possibility of not taking teams to the 2018 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. We plan on supporting two full delegations in PyeongChang."
But other countries, including France and Austria, have said they're willing to sit out these games if safety can't be guaranteed.

In recent days, North Korea has continued to suggest that war is inevitable as it moves ahead with its missile testing program.
The U.S. this week has run military drills with South Korea by flying dozens of planes in a show of force. The move led North Korea to say in its state-run media that it could escalate the situation "to the brink of nuclear war."
Some Olympic athletes training for PyeongChang told NBC News in recent weeks that family and friends are increasingly asking what provocations in the Korean Peninsula mean to them. But they said they're putting their faith in the U.S. Olympic Committee.
"Anywhere we go I wish we didn't have to worry about what things could happen," said Jamie Greubel Poser, who won bronze in the two-women's bobsled at the 2014 Sochi Olympics in Russia. "We just have to do our best to be aware while staying focused on our priority, which is competing."

— Around 30 firefighters responded to a fire at the Groves Apartments in Raleigh Wednesday morning, according toBattalion Chief Lowell Smith.
Four people were rescued from a balcony at the complex, located at 5070 North New Hope Road.
"They retreated to the safest place which is the balcony in the rear of the structure, and that's where our firefighters found them and got them off by ladder," Smith said.
One person was taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation, and no one else was injured in the incident.
Families from at least two units have been displaced as a result of the fire.

Krystle Smith escaped during the fire.
"I just heard her screaming: 'Fire, fire, my apartment's on fire. Somebody, help me," she said.
"As soon as we opened the door, all we saw was the biggest cloud of black smoke," Smith said.
"The smoke was so thick it was already coming through the house. And we knew we had to get to the porch because the smoke was coming through the house."
Officials said the fire seems to have been caused by a cooking incident.
"We'll get through it," Smith said. "It's just another step in life. So we'll make it like we make it through everything."
On Monday, streets were packed with parents and other guardians behind the wheels and big yellow buses filling the school zones.
As students walked into a new school year, the Clark County School District administrators reflected on the issues of the past school year and how to move forward.
“Kids are are in classes which is important," CCSD superintendent Pat Skorkowsky said. "They're starting to learn on their first day, actually everything seems to be going very well.”
The first day of school in the district wasn't all about excitement. The district faced many challenges in the last school year, including teachers and staff having inappropriate relationships and interactions with students.
“We're very optimistic about this school year," Skorkowsky said. "We know that we've had many challenges in the past year, we're putting together policies and practices in place to ensure that we can prevent that behavior.”
Skorkowsky said they're reflecting on where they've lacked in the past to make a better future for students.
”The social media policy being one of those," he said. "It's also about training though, making sure that everybody knows where the line is and making sure that nobody crosses it.”
Another challenge the district has struggled with is teacher shortages.
Currently, there are over 400 openings they're working to fill. Skorkowsky said they're targeting soon-to-be educators who will graduate in Dec. to be ready for classrooms by Jan.
“We have been used to having a number of openings in the past year unfortunately," Skorkowsky said. "So what we have done is really work on those long term substitutes that are quality individuals who can take on that teacher role in the classroom."
As the first day back to school came to a close, Skorkowsky promised parents that the school district is working around the clock to ensure student safety, despite a past year riddled with arrest and allegations of sexual misconduct.
“We have systems and practices in place that will protect their students, but they should also be vigilant in talking to their students ... checking their students phone engaging in what their side of it is, we can work together to prevent this.”

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. – A year ago, Johnny Cueto did almost no offseason throwing before he arrived for his first spring as a Giant. He was coming off a World Series run with the Kansas City Royals and wanted to rest his arm as long as possible.
The pace is much different this spring. Cueto must hit the ground running to be ready for the World Baseball Classic in mid-March. Yet his arrival in Giants camp might be delayed until the weekend while he remains in the Dominican Republic to attend to his ill father.

And though the current timing would seem especially worrisome, Giants manager Bruce Bochy insisted he wasn't concerned.
Bochy said Cueto has been throwing at the Giants' complex in the Dominican; officials there even filmed the sessions and uploaded them so coaches in Scottsdale could monitor his progress.

“Johnny's smart,” Bochy said. “Johnny knows what it takes to get ready. I'll have to sit down with him and see where he's at (after he arrives in Arizona). We can't take any unnecessary risk. But he's been throwing, so my guess is he'll come in here in pretty good shape.”

The Giants had two familiar faces rejoin the organization as spring training instructors. Former All-Star Ellis Burks and 2010 NLCS MVP Cody Ross were on the field in black and orange.

Accounting standards in the spotlight as life insurers take strain
Algerian authorities have seized more than 700kg (1,543lb) of cocaine smuggled aboard a container ship.
The vessel, which was registered in Liberia, was transporting frozen meat from Brazil and had previously docked in the Spanish port of Valencia.
It was due to offload in Algeria's western port of Oran, but suspicions were raised when the captain refused to dock for three days.
Acting on a tip-off, the Algerian coastguard forced the boat into port.
The drugs were then found in boxes marked with the words "halal meat".
More than 20 people have been arrested over the drugs find.

It was a tough game for the Bowie Lady Rabbits in a sense they were shorthanded, but the outcome was never in question as they beat Holliday at home on Tuesday.
With the flu spreading all throughout this area, Bowie was without three players on Tuesday and only suited out seven in a game they won easily 45-24. It was not pretty though.
The Lady Rabbits at times seemed unsure of the direction to go in their half-offense as Holliday tried everything to take away where they wanted to go. This led to many long possessions with no shot attempts for minutes at a time. Still, Bowie was the better team by a good margin and led 11-0 after the first quarter.
Holliday was able to knock in some 3's in the second quarter but the Lady Rabbits pressing defense and generated enough transition baskets keep growing their lead.
With only two subs, Coach Chuck Hall tried his best to keep his team's energy up by constantly subbing two players in and out while trying to keep his players accountable. Still, there were times the game dragged. Bowie led 26-10 at halftime.

Rozner: Sofa refs finally lose power over pro golf
hello
Lexi Thompson high five fans as she walks to the 18th green in tears during the final round of the LPGA Tour ANA Inspiration golf tournament after she was assessed a four-stroke penalty at Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage, Calif., Sunday, April 2, 2017. Thompson forced a playoff, but lost to So Yeon Ryu.
The days of the couch vigilante are over.
Well, in professional golf, at least.
Yeah, if you're one of those who's been sitting at home and hoping to catch a player brushing a single grain of sand in the bunker, or mismarking a ball by a fraction of an inch on the green, you can find something better to do with your weekend.
And it's far past time for such a reasonable conclusion.
There is no other major sport where you can officiate from home, and golf finally did the right thing and eliminated that possibility with a Monday announcement that has killed this insidious disease forever.
It should have never come to this, but the tipping point was the ruling that cost Lexi Thompson a championship in April.
In the LPGA's first major of the season, Thompson had victory safely in hand when she was walking to the 13th tee on Sunday and was informed -- rather casually -- that she would be docked 4 strokes for a violation that occurred on the 17th green -- wait for it -- on Saturday.
Thompson had marked her ball from the side to avoid stepping in her competitor's line. This is something players do all the time out of pure sportsmanship and there are probably hundreds of infractions each tournament if you consider mismarking a ball by a quarter-inch to be a penalty.
Without robots and lasers, no player can be 100 percent certain that a mark is perfect, though the intention -- as was the case with Thompson -- is always to get it right.
If that weren't ridiculous enough, an email from a viewer a day later changed the tournament, many hours after cards were signed and scores recorded.
What sport changes a score a day later because of replay review? Should only the stars be penalized because they are always on TV? And what if the email arrived on Tuesday?
Thompson lost 4 strokes to the infraction and signing an incorrect score card.
Insanity.
Starting Jan. 1, after the announcement Monday by governing bodies USGA and R&A, along with the PGA of America and all major men's and women's tours, they will no longer accept inquiries from Barcalounger barristers.
Every tournament will have at least one official assigned to monitor the broadcast to help with any judgments, said Thomas Pagel, the USGA senior director of rules.
"The (tournament) committee will take on the responsibility of monitoring in real time," Pagel said. "Essentially, everything you're seeing at home, we've already seen it. We're going to apply the rules accordingly."
Just as crucial, the USGA and R&A have added the "Local Rule," eliminating the punishment for failing to include a penalty on the score card when the player is unaware of the infraction.
Said Pagel, "There may be things that the committee -- after the score card is returned -- will come back and say, 'You know what? We missed that. We didn't catch that as it happened. We're human.' The committee will accept that responsibility."
After the Thompson incident, the USGA announced that a "player's reasonable judgment" will be acceptable when video evidence shows a player might not have taken precisely the nearest point of relief.
There is also the "naked-eye standard" now in place that would have saved Dustin Johnson on the green at the 2016 U.S. Open, Anna Nordqvist in the bunker at the 2016 U.S. Women's Open and Thompson this year, when no one would have known of the problem without super-zoom, video technology.
The newest "couch rule" would have saved Tiger Woods at the 2013 Masters, when an overnight penalty probably cost him the tournament.
Archaic USGA rules have long tormented frustrated pro golfers to the point where this year at Erin Hills they were openly ripping the rules committee and wondering why they were prisoners of such utter nonsense.
To that extent, and at least in the case of a few ridiculous rules, it will be a happy new year on the PGA Tour.

Researchers have discovered how black holes not only consume stars, but how these gravitational powerhouses discard part of what they take in. The findings offer new insights into distant celestial phenomena, researchers say.
“These findings enhance our understanding of how black holes' energy is produced, and, with it, a more advanced sense of the galaxy evolves,” says Sjoert van Velzen, a New York University postdoctoral fellow and coauthor of the paper with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Dheeraj Pasham.
Scientists have long known that nearly all massive galaxies contain a large black hole at their center. Although these central black holes are a tiny fraction of the size and weight of their hosts, they appear to control the growth of the galaxies they reside in. They do this, in part, by pumping huge amounts of energy into the galaxy in the form of jets that emanate from near the surface of the black hole.
Less understood, however, is how these jets are launched from black holes and how they evolve in their earliest stages after formation.
To better understand the physics of black hole jets, the researchers examined massive black holes immediately after consuming a nearby passing star.
“In these violent encounters, called tidal disruption events, the black hole can briefly feed on the debris of the star,” explains Pasham, a postdoctoral fellow at MIT.
The debris of stars forms a disk as it spirals into a black hole. In this process, it heats up to temperatures of a million degrees Celsius, which leads to the emission of X-ray light.
On occasion, these disruption events result in the production of radio emission. With this in mind, the scientists then looked for this emission in an effort to map out the functionality of black hole jets.
Relying on the observations made by Swift, a mission managed and controlled by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, the researchers found a notable pattern of radio emission.
Specifically, they discovered that radio emission from disruption events reverberates with the same light fluctuation patterns as the X-ray light—but only after a time delay of 13 days.
“In other words, the radio emission appears to be an echo of the X-ray emission,” says van Velzen, who conducted the analysis as a NASA Hubble Fellow at Johns Hopkins University. “Because X-rays originate from the hot material falling in and powering the black hole, this coupling between the X-ray and radio suggests that the radio emission must originate from a jet that is regulated by the inner accretion flow onto the black hole.”
They also found a linearity between the energy release in the disk of matter falling into the black hole and the radio-jet power, demonstrating that this disk regulates the jet power. Specifically, the jet transports matter away from black holes, thereby discarding it, while the disk carries matter into the back hole.
“Our results show that the short-lived jet following a tidal disruption behave similar to jets from black holes that are active for millions of years,” notes van Velzen. “This unified view of jet production should make it easier to include the impact of jets into models of galaxy evolution.”
The researchers report their findings in the journal Astrophysical Journal.
Grants from NASA funded the work.

Image copyright Nomad Mania Image caption Travellers claim William Baekeland, who denies any wrong-doing, was formerly known as Jesse Gordon from the West Midlands
Claims that a travel company boss conned customers out of thousands of pounds have sparked an international police investigation.
William Baekeland, ex-director of Atlas Travel and Expeditions Ltd, is accused of taking cash for non-existent trips to exotic destinations.
Travellers said they believed Baekeland was formerly called Jesse Gordon, and hailed from Sutton Coldfield.
West Midlands Police said it was investigating alongside Irish officers.
London-based Harry Mitsidis, who runs extreme travel website Nomad Mania, claims he lost more than £25,000, paid to Mr Baekeland for three different trips.
He said their paths crossed in March 2016 on Polar cruise ship the Ortelius, heading to Bouvet Island in the south Atlantic.
"Bogus"
There, Mr Mitsidis said, he was encouraged, along with others, to book "extreme" trips through Mr Baekeland.
A first trip went ahead, which encouraged Mr Mitsidis to book further expeditions which never took place.
He has made a complaint to Action Fraud, which has been passed to West Midlands Police.
The force said it was notified on 22 March of "allegations against a man accused of defrauding members of the public through a bogus holiday company."
A spokesman said: "It's alleged the suspect was behind a firm that left people thousands of pounds out of pocket having promised exclusive holidays to exotic locations.
"The suspect is linked to an address in Birmingham, plus another in Ireland, and officers are currently liaising with the Gardaí."
Atlas Travel and Expeditions Ltd, no longer lists Mr Baekeland as a director on Companies House.
Its website has also been taken down.
Image copyright Instagram/Williambaekeland Image caption William Baekeland "organised and executed many trips for himself and other travellers", said his associate Josh Radcliffe
Josh Radcliffe, the remaining company director, said there is no accusation the company itself took any money from customers.
He said he was "confident" Mr Baekeland's work was "entirely genuine."
"He has, as a matter of record, organised and executed many trips for himself and other travellers," he said.
"His financial problems came about as a result of over trading and not as a result of deliberate fraud."
Mr Radcliffe said it was Mr Baekeland's "sincere hope and wish" to repay his genuine creditors but he was currently occupied with clearing his name.
Benfica pulled off a classic smash and grab job as they beat Borussia Dortmund 1-0 in their Champions League last 16 first leg on Tuesday.
Greek striker Kostas Mitroglou scored the only goal of the game, prodding home from close range at the second attempt just after half time after Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki stopped his initial effort.
Benfica goalkeeper Ederson, who has relegated former Brazil first choice shot-stopper Julio Cesar to the bench this season, was the star of the show making a slew of crucial saves.
But Dortmund will have many regrets after a wasteful performance, in particular from striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who had a torrid evening, missing three gilt-edged opportunities.
Dortmund had the first clear chance of the night on 10 minutes as French youngster Ousmane Dembele slipped Aubameyang in on goal, but the Gabon striker lifted his shot not only over Ederson but also the bar.
Dortmund were well on top in the early stages but poor control cost Raphael Guerreiro and Erik Durm when well placed to shoot.
The visitors then fashioned a chance with Guerreiro picking out Dembele 10 yards from goal but reported Manchester United target Victor Lindelof bravely threw himself in front of the shot to deflect the ball behind for a corner.
Dortmund should have gone in front on 38 minutes when Benfica centre-back Ljubomir Fejsa dallied allowing Guerreiro to cross from the byline. But with Ederson stranded, Aubameyang was inches away from converting the ball into an empty net from two yards out.
Moments later, Ederson was a relieved man to see Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli wave away Dortmund protests after the goalkeeper clattered into Dembele on the edge of his box.
Having produced nothing in the first half, Benfica went in front three minutes into the second after Mitroglou was left unmarked two yards out to poke home Luisao's header from a Pizzi corner.
Thereafter, the one-way traffic continued heading towards the home goal was relentless.
Ederson saved a point-blank effort from Dembele inside the six yard box before Aubameyang lifted a carbon copy of his first half chance again just over the bar.
Ederson made smart stops to deny Marco Reus and then Lukasz Piszczek before Dortmund were given a lifeline when Fejsa handled a cross from Marc Bartra.
But Aubameyang's miserable night continued with a woeful penalty stroked nonchalantly down the middle that the static Ederson merely punched clear.
Aubameyang was put out of his misery a few minutes later than coach Thomas Turchel replaced him with Andre Schuerle just past the hour mark.
Dortmund continued to press but Reus hooked a volley wide before Ederson showed lightening reactions to save one-handed from a Christian Pulisic volley that took a wicked deflection.

OTTAWA — The federal government for the second year in a row is writing off millions in student loans it will never collect, this time to the tune of $178.4 million.
The money represents 32,554 loans that federal officials believe they will never be able to collect, either because a debtor may have filed for bankruptcy, the debt itself has passed a six-year legal limit on collection, or the debtor can't be found.
Last year, the government wrote off 33,967 loans totalling $176 million.
Federal officials have increased their efforts in recent years to collect outstanding student loans after watching write-offs hit $312 million in 2012 and $295 million in 2015.
The previous Conservative government ordered officials to ramp up collection efforts in order to bring the write-offs under control.
The Liberals' first budget offered a new tool for the Canada Revenue Agency in its collection efforts: legal changes allowing it to use tax information for the purpose of collecting debts from the student loan program overseen by Employment and Social Development Canada. The CRA had expected to receive that power last year, but the federal election delayed political approval.
Figures provided by the CRA late last year showed the agency collected $208.8 million in unpaid loans, a three per cent increase in collections between 2015 and 2016.
The CRA is responsible for collecting loans in default and can do so by withholding income tax refunds to cover the outstanding amount, or by referring cases to the attorney general for legal action — which could lead to garnisheeing wages or seizing assets.

As Obamacare enrollment becomes more restrictive, short-term options become more vital
MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA--(Marketwired - Apr 17, 2017) - AgileHealthInsurance.com is calling attention to the increased importance of short-term health coverage given newly approved enrollment regulations for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) market. Consumers who miss the normal enrollment period will face a longer lock-out period from Obamacare in 2018 as well as a harder time obtaining permission to enroll late on a government exchange. As a consequence, short-term health insurance's year-round availability for major medical benefits will take on even greater value within the private health insurance market.
The new regulation cuts the length of the next Obamacare annual enrollment period in half and makes it more difficult to obtain a special enrollment period. The annual enrollment period for 2018 Affordable Care Act plans will begin Nov. 1, 2017, and end only six weeks later on Dec. 15. Health insurance buyers who fail to enroll during this time will confront more stringent documentation requirements for a special enrollment period should they choose to buy Obamacare insurance before the next annual enrollment period.
The government has issued new enrollment restrictions in an attempt to stabilize the Obamacare health insurance market. The Obamacare market has been hampered by high medical claims, leading to rate spikes and insurer exits due to losses. The government believes that one of the contributing factors to the high medical claims are consumers who wait until they need health care before enrolling in Obamacare coverage. The new enrollment restrictions seek to reduce the incidence of this trend.
"The government's new enrollment restrictions make short-term health insurance more important than any other time in its 30-year history," said Bruce Telkamp, CEO of AgileHealthInsurance.com. "For those consumers who find themselves locked out of the Obamacare market, short-term health coverage will be an indispensible safety net to avoid joining the ranks of the uninsured."
More information on short-term health insurance coverage and plan options can be found at AgileHealthInsurance.com.
AgileHealthInsurance.com was created to educate people about the benefits of short-term health insurance and provide a fast, online process for purchasing these plans. Short term health insurance is a flexible and low-cost major medical insurance for individuals without expensive pre-existing health conditions. It is not Obamacare. Short-term health plans offer consumers the flexibility to choose health plans with the benefits that matter most to them and combine these benefits with broad provider networks.

CHICAGO (Reuters) – Delays in Chinese approvals of imported genetically modified crops have cut U.S. gross domestic product by about $7 billion over the past five years by reducing sales of crops and other goods, an industry group that represents global seed companies said on Wednesday.
The report by CropLife International indicates what is at stake for the administration of President Donald Trump as it seeks better access for U.S. GMO crops into China as part of a trade deal under discussion.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is set to visit Beijing this week for talks, after months of escalating tensions that had threatened a trade war.
The United States said on Tuesday it still held its threat of imposing tariffs on $50 billion of imports from China and would use it unless Beijing addressed its concerns over the theft of American intellectual property.
Global seeds and chemical companies have long wanted wider access for GMO crops in China because it is the world's top buyer of soybeans and a major buyer of other grains.
China does not permit planting of GMO food crops but allows imports of GMO soybeans and corn for use in its massive animal feed industry. But the approval process for new GMO strains is slow, unpredictable and not based on science, according to the U.S. biotech industry.
The sector says delays in Chinese approvals hurt the value of U.S. corn harvests by preventing farmers from using new seeds that can protect crops from pests and weeds.

As a result, farmers spend less on products ranging from fertilizer to equipment, with ripple effects on economic growth, said Scott Richman, senior vice president at Informa Agribusiness Consulting Group, which CropLife commissioned to do the study.
China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, which regulates GMO crop approvals, did not respond to a fax seeking comment on how its reviews affect the U.S. economy.
“We need a system in China that facilitates trade,” said Matt O'Mara, a vice president for the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a CropLife affiliate.
Companies such as Bayer AG, Monsanto Co, DowDuPont and ChemChina's Syngenta have been waiting as long as seven years for China to approve strains of soybeans, canola and alfalfa.
A 53 year old man from Port Elizabeth drowned in front of the Kabeljous Lagoon in Jeffreys Bay yesterday after getting stuck in a rip current.
Tyrone Roberts went into the water to assist some children who were caught in the rip but unfortunately succumbed to the strong currents that are prevalent along this section of coastline.
Jeffreys Bay lifeguards who were on duty at Kablejous Beach, were alerted that a man was in trouble and immediately ran down the shore line to where Roberts was laying on the beach after being helped out of the water by other beach goers.
The children have been swimming in the ocean approximately 400 m away from the area where the lifeguards had set out the designated swimming area for the morning.
Upon arrival the lifeguards immediately began with Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) procedures, but despite being assisted by a doctor shortly afterwards, their efforts were to no avail.
The body of the deceased was taken into the care of the Forensic Pathology Services and Police have opened an inquest docket.
An additional 3 people, an adult man, a 16 year old male and a 15 year old male, were treated for non-fatal symptoms and transported to hospital by ambulance in stable conditions.
Mayor Elza Van Lingen expressed her condolences to the family of Roberts and expressed her gratitude for his efforts in trying to save the children caught in the rip.
“Sadly a life was lost on the first day of the new year and we urge swimmers to always obey the lifeguards and swim in the designated areas.
We can never underestimate the power of the ocean and I thank the Jeffreys Bay lifeguards for their quick response to the situation, as well as to NSRI and EMS for their support,” said Van Lingen.

A Green Day demo tape—so rare the band reportedly doesn't even recall it—has surfaced with three songs recorded between 1992-1993, after their 1991 album, Kerplunk! Reportedly recorded on a boom box, the hissy analog tape features acoustic versions of “J.A.R”, “Having A Blast”, and “Don't Wanna Fall In Love.” According to YouTube user who posted the audio (lifted from a bit torrent site) was forgotten so long ago that the band isn't aware of the tape's existence.

While J.A.R., made its way to the Billboard Hot 100 via the 1995 Angus soundtrack, and “Having A Blast” could be found on their massively successful album Dookie, “Don't Wanna Fall In Love” was relegated at the time to the B-side of a “Geek Stink Breath” 7″ single. It was later released on the Shenanigans compilation album.
Listen to the three recordings below.
Africa Studio/Shutterstock, Creative Photo Corner/ShutterstockOne of the biggest challenges facing today's students isn't multiplication charts or book reports. Believe it or not, it's bullying.
That's right—research shows that about one-fourth to one-third of students report being bullied in school. On top of that, bullying can also lead to depression, anxiety, and lots of school absences. Although it's pretty clear that bullying poses one of the biggest obstacles to K-12 education, it's never been addressed in the classroom—until now.
Introducing: KiVa, the bullying prevention program that just launched in schools across Finland. The name is an abbreviation of the Finnish phrase “kiusaamista vastaan,” which translates to “against bullying.” Finnish educators created the program to teach students about the consequences of bullying, as well as what to do when they see it (especially without teachers or administrators around).
The program consists of in-class lessons and video games that simulate a variety of possible bullying situations. After practicing how they would respond, students can receive real-time feedback and advice from the game.
According to Johanna Alanen, KiVa's International Project Manager, the program teaches essential anti-bullying responses because students “might witness a bullying incident and they have to decide what to do: whether to defend the victim or do something else. …[They need to learn that] their choices have consequences and lead to new situations.”
And so far, it's worked! Educators report that the prevention program has reduced instances of bullying in Finland by up to one-half. Early data also shows that the program might help reduce depression and increase self-esteem for kids who have already been bullied.
Given the program's remarkable success, other countries are considering implementing it, as well. Officials in Italy, the Netherlands, and the U.K. are testing it in their school systems, and the U.S. is in the process of evaluating it.
“Our findings are the first to show that the most tormented children—those facing bullying several times a week—can be helped by teaching bystanders to be more supportive,” Jaana Juvonen, a professor at UCLA, said in a press release.
Until then, we can celebrate anti-bullying moments like this teacher's brilliant strategy to stop bullying. Parents should also make sure to be on the lookout for these warning signs that your child is a bully at school.

Fire damages Elgin mobile home
hello
A fire that started in the laundry room of an Elgin mobile home caused tens of thousands of dollars in damage, officials said.
Firefighters responded to reports of a fire on the 800 block of Suzzanne Lane in Elgin at around 10:24 Monday morning, according to a news release from the Elgin Police Department. After confirming no one was inside, officials upgraded the fire to a "working fire" because it had the potential to spread beyond the home, officials said.
No injuries were reported, but the fire caused about $30,000 in damages.
If you've ever been to a rock concert it's likely you've thrown up the horns hand gesture.
Now Gene Simmons wants to own that.
According to The Wrap, the KISS frontman applied to trademark the gesture that's symbolic of rock concerts for decades. Filed June 9, the application described a “hand gesture with the index and small fingers extended upward and the thumb extended perpendicular.”
The Hollywood Reporter noted Simmons said in the application that the gesture was first used on Nov. 14, 1974 as part of KISS' Hotter Than Hell tour.
Simmons claims the gesture is being trademarked for “entertainment, namely, live performances by a musical artist; personal appearances by a musical artist.”
The specific hand gesture has different meanings. Besides being the symbolism for devil horns or “rock on” in music culture, the gesture is also sign language for “I love you.”
It's not the first time someone has tried to lay claim to a hand gesture. The Hollywood Reporter noted former professional wrestler Diamond Dallas Page had sued hip hop artist Jay-Z over his “Roc-A-Fella” diamond hand gesture, which Page claimed infringed on his similar “Diamond Cutter” gesture.

Financial Conduct Authority chief executive Andrew Bailey says the scourge of high fees charged by big banks on unauthorised overdrafts will be "tackled" by the end of the year.

BARRIE -
Bitter tears flowed in court Tuesday when a mother and father learned that the man who stabbed their 16-year-old son to death on Father's Day in 2007 will now become eligible for parole at an earlier date.
“The pain is still so deep and raw ... it doesn't go away,” mom Liz Hoage told a sentencing hearing as she wiped away tears.
Seven years ago, Joseph Nicholson, of Barrie, was sentenced to life in prison for stabbing her son, Joey Tanner, of Hamilton, three times in the back in June 2007 and for the attempted murder of his friend, Jeremy Rodgers, 17, of Alliston, who suffered a knife wound to the chest and almost died in the same attack.
The jury, which convicted Nicholson, spent five days deliberating before rendering a verdict of first-degree murder which carries a mandatory life sentence with no parole for 25 years.
However, the Ontario Court of Appeal recently shot down the verdict and ordered Nicholson to be sentenced for second-degree murder instead, stating the trial judge did not adequately instruct the jury. Second-degree murder carries a mandatory life sentence with no parole for a period of 10 to 25 years.
“These were vicious, violent, stab wounds,” said Crown attorney Ray Williams, who is asking for Nicholson's new parole eligibility to be set at 16 years.
Tanner and his teenage buddies had been drinking and snorting cocaine as they lingered outside a Barrie apartment building and taunted the young men inside to come out and fight. Inside the apartment, where there was no food in the cupboards, a teenaged single mom on welfare drank with her friends and passed around a platter of cocaine with a straw.
With a flick knife in his hand, Nicholson looked out the window and said “Let's go,” then “bull rushed” out the door toward his victims, who only expected a fist fight.
Within seconds he jabbed his victims with such force his knife penetrated bone, lung, liver and spleen.
As he lay yelping in pain on the ground, dying, blood spilling from his wounds, Tanner cried out for his mom.
Nicholson later smirked and told his friends, “I guess I got a body under my belt now,” court heard.
Williams noted the killer has a criminal record for violent offences and while in prison was caught with a shank and has been in multiple fights. “He is a tornado of violence,” Williams said.
Court heard how Nicholson was passed around to foster homes and that his own mother used to overdose him with Ritalin medication when he was a toddler so she wouldn't have to deal with him.
In court, Joey's father, Bill Tanner, suddenly rose, jabbed a finger at Nicholson in the prisoner's box and yelled: “You look me up when you get out, buddy.” He then rushed out of court.
Nicholson stood and apologized to the grieving mother and asked the judge for a chance.
“Your son did not deserve to die,” he said. “I'm sorry ... I want to rehabilitate myself.”
Outside of court, the family said the Court of Appeal decision has caused them to rehash the pain.
“There are more rights for the killers than for the victims,” said the mother.

Instruments aboard the Landsat 8 satellite captured these visible and thermal images on Sept. 16, 2017, of the A68 iceberg that snapped off Antarctica's Larsen C Ice Shelf.
As the sun rises above the Antarctic horizon after the long, dark austral winter, scientists are getting a better look at the Delaware-size iceberg that sheared off from the frozen continent's Larsen C ice shelf in July.
With the illumination from the sun's rays, new satellite images have captured the iceberg, dubbed A68, and the motley assortment of ice and water surrounding it, in impressive detail. In the coming months and years, scientists will be poring over such images to watch the progression of the iceberg and its parent ice shelf.
The researchers said they also hope to study the area up close, to examine details of the seafloor that have been blocked by ice for hundreds of years and to learn how such a massive shift could alter the local ecosystem. [In Photos: Antarctica's Larsen C Ice Shelf Through Time]
"It's obviously a completely different physical environment once the ice is gone," Susie Grant, a marine biogeographer with the British Antarctic Survey, told Live Science.
Keeping tabs on the iceberg, the ice shelf and the ecosystem in the coming years could also help scientists better understand how other major ice shelves might respond to a warming world, according to Grant.
Scientists have watched for several years as a rift slowly propagated its way across the Larsen C ice shelf, a platform of ice that extends out from the coast and floats atop the ocean. After a couple of surges in 2016 and earlier this year, the rift finally reached the edge of the ice shelf and calved off the iceberg.

But with the sun below the Antarctic horizon, researchers could monitor the event only with thermal imagery and radar, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.
"When it did finally break off, it was just sort of these tantalizing" glimpses, Grant said.
Once the sun re-emerged in August, more satellite views started streaming in ¾ and they haven't disappointed. The "satellite images are extraordinary," Grant said. "To see something of that scale moving across the water."
In mid-September, NASA's Terra satellite and the Landsat 8 satellite captured shots of the iceberg in visible light and of the surrounding area in infrared wavelengths of light. The images reveal exciting details, like the wrinkly-looking rifts that stretch across parts of the iceberg and the mixture of open water and ice surrounding it.

In the psychedelic thermal image, the cold iceberg and ice shelf appear a ghostly white, while the relatively warmer sea ice shows up in shades of purple, and the even warmer (though still sub-freezing) open water pops out in yellow. Bluer shades show the mixture of ice called mélange, which can include snow, sea ice, bits of ice that fell from the sides of the rift and something called marine ice, which forms along the underside of the floating ice, said Ala Khazendar, a scientist with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who uses radar to study polar ice.
The images also show how much the iceberg has moved away from its parent ice shelf. So far, it has been progressing at a steady clip, but how fast it might continue to move is unclear and depends on several factors: winds and ocean currents, as well as whether there are any bumps or ridges on the seafloor that the iceberg might get stuck on, Khazendar said.
If it does get stuck, he said, that will tell scientists something about the topography of the seafloor, which they had no way of viewing before the calving event, Grant said.
That seafloor and the water above it are also being exposed to sunlight for the first time in at least hundreds of years, and this could have major impacts on the local ecosystem, Grant said. For instance, ocean life at the water's surface could suddenly ramp up in productivity. The newly opened area could also see species moving in from neighboring regions, she said. [Antarctica Photos: Meltwater Lake Hidden Beneath the Ice]
The ecosystem will be "potentially dramatically changed" by the calving event, Grant said, though it's "impossible to know anything about that until we can get down and visit."
The British Antarctic Survey and other groups are planning scientific cruises to get an up-close look at the changes to the region, and the sooner that happens the better, so they can establish a baseline before major changes occur, Grant said. Sediment cores drilled from the ocean floor will help scientists establish how long the area has been covered by ice, and sampling of the water will tell them how the temperature and salt content may be changing and what creatures live there, she said.
Those efforts are helped by an international agreement by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, which has 25 international members, to designate the area around the ice shelf as a protected area so that activities like commercial fishing won't hamper scientific work, Gizmodo reported. This is the first time there has been such a designation, Grant said.
"I think that was a really important step," she said. "We were really pleased to have managed to get that."
In the meantime, scientists will glean what information they can from satellite images and airborne observations made by NASA's IceBridge program, which is gearing up for the Antarctic summer season, Khazendar said.
Researchers will be watching to see if the remaining ice shelf begins to flow faster in response to the iceberg's loss, he said, and how the iceberg melts and potentially breaks up into smaller pieces (one such piece already broke off later in July).
"We still need to collect data and analyze them in order to understand how the Larsen C ice shelf is going to react to this event," Khazendar said.
There are concerns that the massive calving event could mark a turning point for the glacier, sending it toward a global warming-fueled collapse like those suffered by its northern neighbors, Larsen A and Larsen B, in 1995 and 2002, respectively. But whether that will happen isn't yet clear, and the ice shelf could recover from the calving event, as these events do happen naturally, Khazendar said.
"It will take us some time before we have some clearer answers," he said.
How Larsen C responds could also give scientists a better idea of how other major ice shelves around Antarctica will respond to the warming waters that are lapping away at the shelves' undersides and causing the glaciers that feed into shelves to flow faster out to the ocean, raising sea levels.
"It could teach us a lot about the fate of other large ice shelves in Antarctica," Khazendar said
Studying the region could also "improve our understanding of how ecosystems might respond to the impacts of climate change," Grant said.

has announced his departure as host on America's Got Talent, after executives reportedly tried to reprimand him over a racial joke he made on his Showtime comedy special.
“I write this from a deeply saddened and dolorous mindset. After days of deliberating over some extremely disappointing news that I was being threatened with termination by Executives because of a comedy special that was only intended to bring communities closer together, I was to be punished for a joke,” Cannon wrote in a message posted on Instagram and Facebook.
“This has weighed heavy on my spirit. It was brought to my attention by my ‘team' that NBC believed that I was in breach of contract because I had disparaged their brand. In my defense, I would ask how so? Or is this just another way to silence and control an outspoken voice who often battles the establishment.”
Cannon caused controversy when he used the N-word during the special. “I grew up like a real n****r. All that stuff. But I honestly believe, once I started doing America's Got Talent, they took my real n****r card. They did!” he said, “Because then like these type of people started showing up to my shows. I can't do the real n****r stuff no more, because then they'll put me on TMZ.”

Let's be honest, anyone that has ever gone to an amusement park has thought about the possibilities of having or seeing one the popular thrill rides fail. I know that upon getting on a roller coaster it always crosses my mind, but that's because I have gotten stuck for a prolonged period of time at a coaster or dungeon drop before.
However, I have never even wanted to consider that possibility with bungee jumping or ride similar to it because the end result would be fatally graphic, pending a miracle. A video is spreading like wildfire on social media as we speak in which a woman is left dangling by her feet during the entire bungee ride facing not one BUT two near death experiences.
The first one: Nearly falling off the ride itself as she was dangling during the course of the entire experience.
The second one: Nearly smashing her head at the bottom panel of the ride as she swings back and forth.
Terrifying.
Check out the video and try not to cringe too much, I can't imagine what crossed this woman's mind during this ride.
Reporters at the New York Times could soon be “vulnerable” to the ax. If the ongoing round of voluntary buyouts being offered to editing staff does not get enough takers, the Gray Lady could begin another round, NYT Executive Editor Dean Baquet recently warned his top department editors.
“Up until now, the company had not indicated that layoffs would happen if targeted numbers weren't achieved,” Grant Glickson, president of the NewsGuild, told Media Ink.
As part of the NYT's ongoing restructuring of its editing ranks, 109 copy editors have had their jobs eliminated. There are estimated to be about 50 new jobs available in the restructured editing operation that the Times envisions for its digital- and video-oriented future.
When the downsizing was first revealed in late May, a memo from Baquet and Managing Editor Joe Kahn portrayed the cuts as a “streamlining” of the editing process and indicated that some of the savings would be used to hire up to 100 more journalists.
But in a mid-June meeting with department heads, Baquet admitted that journalists could be targeted in a new round of layoffs once the editing ranks are culled.
“I just attended a department head meeting with Dean and the rest of the staff,” Metro Editor Wendell Jamieson said in a June 15 memo to his own staff. “While much of the buyout discussions have focused on editors, the buyouts are also available to reporters. Dean made it clear that, should the Times find itself in a layoff situation, reporters will also be vulnerable.” The memo eventually made its way to the NewsGuild, where it triggered a new uproar.
The NewsGuild blasted the decision by Times management to do away with copy editors — and potentially expand its layoffs to reporters. “This proves what we have suspected all along,” said Glickson. “The Times ‘restructuring' of the newsroom is really about the bottom line and not about making the editing process more efficient, as they claim.”
The process is speeding along, however, despite the union's objections. Interviews for copy editors to apply for the new positions are expected to conclude June 27. They are being conducted by 14 top editors — Jamieson, Monica Drake, Nancy Gauss, Steve Kenny, Marc Lacey, Patrick LaForge, Dean Murphy, Caroline Que, Carolyn Ryan, Karron Skog, Dick Stevenson, Archie Tse, Vivian Toy and Susan Wessling. The interview committee will meet June 28 and June 29 to decide who will be called back for a second interview.
The second interview process is expected to end by July 10.
The buyout window closes July 20 — so there will be a 10-day period in which copy editors who have essentially been job eliminated can then “volunteer” for a buyout.
Said one insider, “If you don't have a job after the interview process is complete, you really have no choice but to take the buyout.”
•Happy Mikel, Ighalo are playing again
After his return from the recently concluded AFCON tournament in Gabon, where he worked as a television pundit for a France-based television station, Nigeria coach, Gernot Rohr has been speaking on the growth of African football, Cameroon's emergence as African champions, Super Eagles' 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and more. Excerpts:
Any hope for players in the Nigeria Football Professional League featuring in the Super Eagles?
We are constantly looking to improve the quality of the team and it doesn't matter if you play in Nigeria or Europe. If you have what we want in a player then you ‘re good enough to play for Nigeria. To help the players, we all must do our bit so that they would be able to compete with their counterparts from Europe. The condition of the pitch here (Sagamu) is not good enough for good football. I still have lots of games to watch but I am sure there are lots of good players in the domestic league.
They just need a little help to focus on what is very important and that is their football career.
What was your impression of the 2017 AFCON tournament in Gabon which you attended without the Eagles?
We saw a good tournament at Gabon 2017. I was at AFCON in Gabon and I now realize what it means to participate at the tournament. We also want to play at the AFCON and we must do everything possible to be there. I'm focused on the AFCON because Nigeria cannot afford to miss out of the competition again for the third time in a row. It's a big competition to celebrate African's best teams and Nigeria cannot afford not to be there when the best teams are counted. We will be there but in order to do that, we must eliminate South Africa who are a really good team. I saw some very good teams but I think the best team (Cameroon) won the competition. I think we're interested in this team because we have to play them in the World Cup qualifier and I'm sure we can beat them when we meet.
The level of the game in Africa is getting higher and higher. I saw very good teams. I saw very technical teams like Burkina Faso where I worked only a year and half ago and they have improved tremendously. I saw big favourites fall by the way side like the Ivory Coast. All the teams were well prepared as we saw Zimbabwe and Guinea Bissau and Togo who did relatively well, However, like I said, the best team won the competition and that was Cameroon.
What would you say was wrong with African coaches as the two finalists in Gabon were handled by foreign coaches?
Whether you're foreign or local, what is important is the experience that you have of your working environment. We saw Hector Cuper who's vastly experienced and we saw Hugo Broos who won the cup and he is experienced too. The level of coaching was very good at the AFCON and the level of teams was also very good. We saw good organization, good preparations and a good synergy between coaching and playing staff and that's what I want to have in Nigeria
Cameroon won the tournament and the Super Eagles will be meeting them in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in August. What are your plans for them?
I'm happy for Cameroon and I'm happy for us because we now have to beat the champions of Africa in order to qualify for Russia 2018. We need good preparations. We didn't have any games while Cameroon had six games at the AFCON. They were together for almost a month and half for preparation and tournament proper so they have an advantage over us. We didn't have that but we must make do with what we have and prepare as best as we can because there will not be an acceptable explanation for failure if we don't qualify.
We have two friendly games lined up, all things being equal, and we intend to use these games to test new players and to bond together. This will help forge a spirit of togetherness in the team which is very important
I hope the players realize how difficult it is going to be and give all their best as they have always done. Two games against Cameroon but first we focus on South Africa
We have to be very careful not to focus too much on Cameroon because we are not playing them until the last week of August. Before then we have an equally important game against South Africa in the AFCON qualifiers in June. I understand that Nigerians are concerned about our progress to the 2018 World Cup in Russia but don't forget that we have not qualified for AFCON since 2013 and the crucial game against South Africa is in June, so I want to focus on that.
Our games against Cameroon won't come up for another six months and a lot of things can happen this time. We will get ready for them, play them accordingly when the time arrives. We have six months between now and August when we play them. Between now and then we are going to play two friendly games as well as a qualifier against South Africa. If we do well in those games, it will help our confidence against Cameroon.
How do you feel about Mikel and Ighalo moving to China?
It's fine because they are playing now. The two of them going to China didn't play so much in their clubs and I'm happy that now they will have chance to play more often. They play good football league with very good players from all over the world and I'm happy that our captain has been able to secure a very good contract perhaps till the end of his career. Now he gets to play regularly and he's also the captain of his team so it's a good thing for us. I'm also happy for Ighalo because he will get to play and score plenty of goals.
This is good for the Super Eagles and for our aspirations to be at the World Cup. Playing in China is certainly better than sitting on the bench in their former clubs. As professionals, I expect them to raise their games as they have been doing even when not playing regularly.
Kelechi Iheanacho has not been playing because of City's new signing, Gabriel Jesus. What is your advise for him?
Kelechi is a young player with an awesome future. He's not playing at the moment because Manchester City have got Gabriel Jesus but am sure that Kelechi will come back in this team.
He's a fighter with a good fighting spirit. I spoke with him and I'm sure he will come back into the City team. You know young players and how it is with big teams. Sometimes they play and sometimes they don't get to play because you cannot play all the time when you ‘re at a big club but Kelechi has a good spirit and excellent attitude and I'm sure he will bounce back.

Rail workers are to stage a protest in Birmingham today warning passengers they are paying "more for less" ahead of news on how much rail fares will go up next year.
Commuters and other passengers will find out today how much extra they will be charged from the new year.
The Government links the annual January rise in Britain's regulated fares with the previous July's Retail Price Index (RPI) measure of inflation which will be announced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Regulated fares make up almost half of all tickets and include season tickets, standard returns and some long-distance, off-peak returns.
They increased by 1.9 per cent in January this year but the RPI figure for July 2017 is expected to be around 3.9 per cent which would lead to the highest increase in rail fares since 2012.
Public transport campaigners have called for the Government to use the Consumer Price Index measure of inflation to set rail fares instead.
CPI is generally lower than RPI and is used to calculate changes in benefits and the ONS warned last month that RPI was "flawed" and had "serious shortcomings".
Rail unions said that, even as fares rose, rail engineering work was being delayed or cancelled, skilled jobs were being lost and staff numbers were being cut on trains and at stations and in ticket offices.
Unions are calling for reduced fares, public ownership and protection of jobs during the protests which are taking place nationwide.
They come less than a week after the Government announced a £1 billion investment into the West Midlands' rail network as part of a new franchise awards for the routes currently operated by London Midlands.

A joint venture between Dutch group Abellio, East Japan Railway Company and Japanese conglomerate Mitsui & Co has won the nine-year tenure.
Manuel Cortes, leader of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, said: "When the Tories passed legislation which allowed rail fare hikes year in, year out, they made legal one of the greatest train robberies in railway history.
"Now, the state-owned railway companies of France, Germany, Holland and Italy, who have gobbled up large swathes of our network, are allowed by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling to laugh all the way to the bank at our expense.
"Train companies, with the Government's blessing, hide behind the Retail Price Index as a method of legitimately fleecing more money from hard-pressed passengers at the start of each new year."
In response, a spokesman for the Department for Transport said: "The Government carefully monitors how rail fares and average earnings change and keeps under review the way fare levels are calculated.
"We are investing in the biggest rail modernisation programme for over a century to improve services for passengers - providing faster and better trains with more seats.
"We have always fairly balanced the cost of this investment between the taxpayer and the passenger.
"We are driving the industry hard to improve efficiency to ensure we maximise the value of passengers' and taxpayers' investment in the railways.
"Regulated rail fares are capped in line with inflation for next year. In the five years to 2019, Network Rail is spending more than £40 billion to maintain and improve the network.
"On average, 97 per cent of every £1 of a passenger's fare goes back into the railway."

Security writer: Terrorists Still Obsessed With NYC
Monday morning's terrorist explosion at the Port Authority Bus Terminal subway station is yet another reminder, says The Atlantic's Krishnadav Calamur, of what all New Yorkers know: “Attacks like this one are inevitable in a city that is a permanent target for anti-American terrorists.” Fact is, as “the most recognized symbol of the United States around the world,” New York has been a terrorist target since long before 9/11. And “a successful, or even unsuccessful, attack on New York underscores the ease with which a terrorist can target the city,” particularly its transit system. Terrorism, after all, “is not just the cost of lives lost and affected by an attack, but the act of forcing a society's citizens to change the way they live.”
From the right: Why Did Trump Go All-In for Moore?
As Alabama voters head to the polls Tuesday in the special election for Jeff Sessions' Senate seat, President Trump reversed his earlier waffling and spent the weekend stumping for Republican Roy Moore and recording a robocall for him. What changed? According to The Weekly Standard's Michael Warren, Trump has told those close to him “he thinks Moore will win, and for the president, that's what matters.” This, even as Alabama's senior elected GOP official Sen. Richard Shelby, disclosed that he “couldn't vote for Roy Moore.” So “expect Trump to take full credit for a Moore victory.” And if Moore loses? “Trump will be the first to remind America that, after all, he endorsed Luther Strange (who would have won easily!) first.”
Political scribe: For Once, the Joke's On Al Franken
Why did Sen. Al Franken finally resign? Salena Zito at the Washington Examiner suggests it's because he “would have become a joke, an afterthought, a pariah, a no one.” And the thought of “being reduced to zero status in American politics was a bridge too far for the egocentric Minnesotan,” who's “used to being center stage, needed, wanted, catered to, fawned over and courted.” In the end, she says, “he was defiant, blamed others and was without the grace to show remorse.” That's in line with the “me” generation that began 40 years ago, when it became “cool to be naughty, uncool to be respectful and gentlemanly.” Franken didn't get caught in a political storm; he was “part of the storm that swept out our culture's moral compass a generation ago.”
Conservative: The Police Murder of Daniel Shaver
National Review's Daniel French urges everyone — “if you have the stomach for it” — to watch the “one of the most outrageous and infuriating videos I've ever seen.” It shows a young man named Daniel Shaver being shot death as he was “crawling on his hands and knees, crying and begging police not to shoot him.” Police in Mesa, Ariz., in January 2016 had ordered Shaver and a woman companion out of their hotel room and to raise their hands and fall to their knees. But rather than being handcuffed, they were ordered “to crawl towards police in a highly specific way” without lowering their hands. When Shaver, drunk and terrified, reached behind his back, possibly to pull up his pants, he was shot dead. Says French: “I have seen soldiers deal with al Qaeda terrorists with more professionalism and poise.” The tape was released after the officer was acquitted.
Culture critic: Lindsey Vonn Isn't Representing Trump
Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn made clear in a recent interview that “she would neither accept an invitation to the White House if invited nor would it be President Trump she'd represent at the Olympic Games,” noted Jackie Anderson at The Federalist. Fine: Athletes “aren't obligated to profess allegiance to the federal government once they hit the podium.” But Vonn seems to believe that “by reproving a president whose politics she disagrees with, she's somehow fulfilling a civic duty that was never placed on her shoulders.” As such, she reflects “a trend of “ridiculously blessed celebrities who don't seem to realize that the very nation they spend countless hours condemning is the same one that has paved the way for their successes.”

Free Pizzas for Blaze Pizza Fans in Columbia on Thursday, April 20
LOS ANGELES, CA--(Marketwired - Apr 17, 2017) - Blaze Fast Fire'd Pizza, the fast-casual artisanal pizza concept known for its chef-driven menu and casually hip restaurants, announced today that it will open its second South Carolina location, in Columbia, on Wednesday, April 19th. To celebrate the grand opening, the Columbia restaurant will offer FREE build-your-own artisanal pizzas on Thursday, April 20th from 11:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. to anyone who follows Blaze Pizza on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. The highly anticipated restaurant, which features a 2,800 square foot interior with seating for 71 and an additional 52 seats on an outdoor patio, is located in the Columbia Towne Center, near Regal Theater in Sandhill (471-1 Towne Center Place).
Blaze Pizza is a modern day "pizza joint" serving up artisanal pizzas that are both fast and affordable. Since its first restaurant debuted in 2012, Blaze has quickly become one of the nation's hottest restaurant concepts, with fans lining up each day for the custom-built pizzas, freshly made salads, blood orange lemonade and s'more pies. Each restaurant features an interactive open-kitchen format that allows guests to customize one of the menu's signature pizzas or create their own, choosing from a wide selection of fresh, artisanal ingredients -- all for about $8. The generously-sized personal pizzas are then sent to a blazing hot open-flame oven -- the centerpiece of the restaurant -- where dedicated pizzasmiths ensure that the thin-crust pies are fast-fire'd and ready to eat in just 180 seconds. Restaurants make their own dough from scratch using a recipe developed by critically-acclaimed Executive Chef Bradford Kent (the "Pizza Whisperer"), which requires a 24-hour fermentation period to produce his signature light-as-air, crisp crust. Almost all of the pizza and salad ingredients are free of artificial flavors, colors, preservatives and fillers and for pizza fans with specific dietary needs, Blaze Pizza offers gluten-free dough and vegan cheese. The new Columbia restaurant will also feature a selection of wine and draft beer.
"Our mission at Blaze is really simple -- we're taking pizza back to its roots, "said Jim Mizes, president & COO of Blaze Pizza. "By making dough in-house, carefully sourcing ingredients, and cooking by fire, we're giving guests a great way to enjoy artisanal pizza without the wait. It's changing the way people think about and eat pizza."
Blaze's obsessive attention to detail extends well beyond the food, with a carefully considered, modern approach to restaurant design. Driven by its commitment to "Intelligent Choices for Our Pizzas, People & Planet," the restaurant is constructed with recycled and sustainable materials, uses eco-friendly packaging, and features energy-efficient LED lighting. Additionally, many of the restaurant's unconventional design elements were inspired by the company's celebration of individual expression.
Blaze Pizza is looking forward to continuing to build strong roots within the community. To that end, the company has developed a turn-key in-restaurant fundraiser program that returns 20% of an event's proceeds back to local organizations, and will be partnering with local schools, sports clubs and other organizations to host fundraising events at the new restaurant.
About Blaze Pizza
The first Blaze Pizza® restaurant opened on Aug. 6, 2012, in Irvine, Calif., and quickly gained attention for its chef-driven recipes, thoughtful interior design, and a service culture that celebrates individuality. Now ranked as the overall #2 fast-casual brand in FastCasual.com's annual Top 100 list, Blaze Pizza is building momentum and developing a cult-like following as it expands across the country. The company currently operates 190 restaurants in 32 states and Canada, including the major metropolitan areas of Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Toronto, Dallas, Las Vegas, and Boston. Founded by Elise and Rick Wetzel (co-founder of Wetzel's Pretzels), the concept is backed by investors including LeBron James, Maria Shriver, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Boston Red Sox co-owner Tom Werner and movie producer John Davis.

South Korea fires head coach Stielike after loss to Qatar
hello
SEOUL, South Korea -- Uli Stielike has been fired as South Korea's head coach after poor results in World Cup qualifying.
South Korea's football association made the announcement Thursday, two days after a 3-2 loss in Qatar. It was South Korea's third defeat in the last five qualification games and left hopes of progressing to a ninth successive World Cup uncertain.
Lee Yong-soo, chairman of the KFA's technical committee, says Stielike "has worked hard for the development of Korean soccer but results in qualification for the World Cup have not been what we wanted."
The KFA did not immediately announce a replacement. With two games remaining in Group A - and the top two progressing to the World Cup automatically - South Korea is in second place.
Colors' popular controversial reality show, Bigg Boss has entertained the viewers for 11 seasons. Bigg Boss 11, which was hosted by Salman Khan, has been one of the successful seasons.
This time too, the makers have roped in Salman as the host and are planning something big for the viewers.
The makers are trying to rope in controversial contestants to make the show interesting. It is being said that Kapil Sharma, who is surrounded with a lot of controversies, has been approached for the show.
Recently, the actor-comedian was recently in news for taking legal action against his ex-managers Preeti and Neeti Simoes, and a journalist. It was also said that the actor is suffering from depression.
Post the controversy, his new show, Family Time With Kapil Sharma, which aired three episodes, also went off air. The actor promised back that he will be back with a bang after a break.
Now it is being said that the actor has been approached for the controversial reality show, Bigg Boss 12. It has to be recalled that the makers are trying to rope in controversial contestants and Kapil Sharma is apt for the show!
Well, let us tell you that many celebrities agree to come on the show to clarify the controversies surrounding them. It is also big platform for commoners as well as (less-known) celebrities as they might bag big projects.
The commoners, who participated on the show, Nitibha Kaul, Manu Punjabi, Manveer Gujjar, Sapna Choudhary, Arshi Khan are busy these days (after their Bigg Boss stint).
Also, Shilpa Shinde, who was surrounded with a lot of controversies regarding her show, Bhabhi Ji Ghar Par Hai, succeeded in winning hearts. Hina Khan, who was already popular, is going places now!
We must say that Bigg Boss is one of the platform for the celebrities to come out clean. Although there is no confirmation from the actor comedian, it is a good chance for Kapil Sharma. But, since the actor is suffering from depression, we are not sure that the actor-comedian might participate on the show!
Meanwhile, the auditions of the Bigg Boss 12 have already started. This time, commoners are invited and the twist is the makers are looking for jodis.
Holocaust survivor recounts Nazi terrors to Mundelein High students
hello
A German-born Holocaust survivor and author spoke with Mundelein High School students Monday about the terrors she faced as a 9-year-old prisoner inside the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.
Marion Blumenthal Lazan, whose memoir "Four Perfect Pebbles" has been read by many Mundelein High students this year, recounted how 600 people lived in a barracks building made for 100, two people to each bunk. She talked of malnutrition, dysentery, lice and carts full of the bodies of her fellow Jews.
Roughly 50,000 people died at that camp, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum website, including famed diarist Anne Frank.
"Death was an everyday occurrence," Lazan told the respectfully silent audience.
And then there was the day in April 1945 when Lazan and her family were among the prisoners forced aboard a freight train headed to an extermination camp in Eastern Europe, only to be liberated by Russian troops before reaching their destination.
Emigration to the United States came three years later.
The number of people who were alive during World War II is declining, and that's also true for Holocaust survivors. Lazan appealed to the students to share her story with their families and eventually their children.
"In a few short years, we will not be here to give these firsthand accounts," she said. "I hope you can prevent our past from becoming your future."
Despite the grim history lesson, Lazan, who now lives in New York, also delivered a message of love and tolerance.
She urged the students to "be kind, good and respectful toward one another" as a way to prevent future atrocities. Don't blindly follow leaders, she cautioned, and don't generalize about people who are different.
At one point she introduced her husband, Nathaniel, and the couple received generous applause.
Diane Covert, head of Mundelein High's English and English language learner department, called Lazan's hourlong presentation "amazing."
"Her message of peace and hope and faith is something we really need in our world today," Covert said.
When he returned from a medical leave in early 2016, psychologist Bradley Boivin discovered a troubling pattern among Waupun Correctional Institution inmates who had been held in solitary confinement.
Thirteen of his patients' mental health classifications had been changed without Boivin's knowledge — and in his opinion, without proper assessment.
The re-evaluations came after a July 2015 memo from Deputy Secretary Cathy Jess to psychological staff to reassess the mental health classification of the most seriously mentally ill inmates in solitary confinement, according to a memo provided by Boivin to the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism.
Boivin resigned from Waupun in 2016 because of a “difficult environment” at the prison after he expressed strong disagreement with prison officials over several issues, including the treatment of inmates, especially those with mental illnesses. Boivin said some of the conditions for inmates in solitary confinement are “beyond unacceptable” and “inhumane.”
The mental health reassessment ordered by Jess is part of a push by the administration of Gov. Scott Walker to limit the use of solitary for inmates with serious mental illnesses and to improve conditions for inmates there.
Emily Shullaw for the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism
In its 2017-19 budget request, the Department of Corrections acknowledged that the “overall psychological effects” of solitary confinement are “negative” for inmates already suffering from mental illness and include “increased depression or anxiety, worsening of trauma-related symptoms, insomnia, worsening of psychosis, paranoia, emergence of self-harm behavior, suicide attempts or aggression.”
Boivin agreed that inmates with mental health problems can get worse in solitary.
“Does it (solitary) cause mental illness? Those sorts of things are debated,” Boivin said. “But the reality is you see a lot of mental illness and you see things exacerbated in that environment, and you don't have to be a rocket scientist, a psychologist, to understand that when you put someone in that kind of environment — very loud, everywhere you go if you move even to see your therapist you're shackled — it's just a very vulgar environment. I refer to it as a very toxic environment.”
Emily Shullaw for the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism
Legislative efforts to curb the use of solitary have been unsuccessful. Assembly Bill 1001, introduced in 2016, would have required the state DOC to “develop evidence-based criteria for confining a prison inmate in a solitary cell” and an audit by the Legislative Audit Bureau on the state's use of solitary confinement. Senate Bill 803 would have prohibited the use of solitary for any offender under age 18. Both bills, proposed by Democrats, died without a hearing.
In March, Democratic lawmakers led by Sen. LaTonya Johnson of Milwaukee proposed restricting solitary confinement for any inmate with a serious mental illness to no more than 10 days.
DOC spokesman Tristan Cook said the agency already has made some changes. The number of inmates with serious mental illnesses in solitary dropped from 155 inmates to 91 inmates between April 2015 and April 2016, and the number of inmates in administrative confinement with serious mental illnesses has decreased from 11 to 10 inmates, Cook said.

Walker is proposing additional funding in the 2017-19 budget to improve conditions in solitary, especially for inmates with serious mental illnesses. His budget includes $2.2 million to convert a vacant housing unit at Oshkosh Correctional Institution to house up to 86 inmates with serious mental illnesses or intellectual disabilities who are in so-called restrictive housing status.
The funding would allow inmates to spend 20 hours of out-of-cell time a week, instead of the four hours a week that many prisoners in solitary currently receive. This program requires 10 out-of-cell hours for structured programming and therapy in addition to 10 unstructured out-of-cell hours for activities such as meals and recreation.
The state also is seeking to expand this “10/10” model — currently in use in Colorado — to other prisons. Walker has endorsed a DOC budget request for about $600,000 over two years for increased psychological staff at restrictive housing units at Waupun, Green Bay and Columbia correctional institutions.
At Columbia Correctional Institution, the DOC seeks an additional $773,200 to staff a new Health Services Unit to treat the prison's large population of chronically and mentally ill inmates. With the completion of the unit and the provision of additional staff, it would operate 24 hours per day, seven days per week.
The governor's request also includes $591,000 to buy body-worn cameras for staff working in solitary confinement units, where numerous complaints of mistreatment have been lodged.
The Rev. Jerry Hancock, director of Madison's Prison Ministry Project, a prisoners' rights advocacy group, said the budget request is “laudable” but also a “far cry” from what Colorado and other states are doing to curtail solitary confinement.
“The Department of Corrections finally has recognized that extended stays in solitary confinement is not appropriate, effective or humane treatment for the more than 2,000 seriously mentally ill people in Wisconsin prisons,” Hancock said in a written statement.

The Alabama Department of Corrections is awaiting a decision in a class-action lawsuit alleging the serious mental health needs of Alabama inmates are being neglected. The services, as described by the inmates' attorney, sound similar to those in Wisconsin for prisoners in solitary.
“To the extent that they get any counseling at all, it is a few minutes through their cell door,” Maria Morris, a Southern Poverty Law Center attorney working on the case, told AL.com.
Mental health status questioned
The Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism last year sent surveys to more than 100 inmates held in administrative confinement, a form of solitary in which the length of confinement can go on for years, even decades.
Wisconsin Department of Corrections
Some inmates said in response to the Center's survey that the severity of mental illness among some prisoners in administrative confinement had been downgraded recently by prison officials.
Rayshun Woods, a 30-year-old inmate who spent three years in administrative confinement at Waupun, said he heard from others that their mental health status had been changed to make it appear there were low levels of serious mental illness among inmates in solitary confinement.
According to DOC policy, MH-2 is the highest classification of inmates with serious mental illnesses. It is those inmates, Cook said, that the agency is seeking to move out of restrictive housing.
“About the mental health classification,” Woods wrote, “it came out that inmates with MH-2 are not fit to be in solitary confinement or (administrative confinement), so what they did was drop a lot of inmates' classification (down) …. just so they will not have to release them from (solitary confinement).”
Boivin said in his professional opinion, the DOC's mental health classification system is “arbitrary.” He noted that the agency does not classify antisocial personality disorder — in lay terms often referred to as psychopathy or sociopathy — as serious mental illness because “so many inmates are diagnosed with it.”

Ryan Kelly went to downtown Charlottesville, Virginia, on August 12 for one last assignment before leaving his staff photographer job at The Daily Progress. On that final workday, the 30-year-old captured an image that The Washington Post declared as “The photo from Charlottesville that will define this moment in American history.”
Kelly, who had been at the paper four years, was covering the widespread violence at a “Unite the Right” white nationalist rally in the city. He was standing on a sidewalk when a silver Dodge Challenger crashed into a crowd of protesters. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed and at least 19 others were injured. The driver, James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Ohio, has been charged with second-degree murder.
ICYMI: “If you're telling me his secrets, you're probably telling him mine. Now I know never to trust you.”
Kelly took a photo of the crash that was used by several news outlets and displayed on front pages throughout the country. He told CJR that had the events played out differently yesterday, he might have been among those caught in the crash.
What follows is the harrowing story behind the photo—as told to CJR by the photographer, Ryan Kelly.
*******
Our newsroom had been planning for this event for weeks, if not months, knowing it was going to be a huge day in Charlottesville. It was pretty much all hands on deck. I woke up around 8 and had two cups of coffee, but didn't eat anything. I started photographing at 9 am. There were already a lot of clergy members around the park, and there were counterprotesters.
Sign up for CJR 's daily email
I hitched a ride with my editor downtown, and I started wandering the mall. There were groups on both sides scattered. There were a few small fights that broke out from time to time. People were throwing stuff at each other. A few people were beating on each other. Eventually I came across two large groups of people protesting against the “Unite the Right” rally and they merged together on Water Street. There were well over 100 people.
I walked ahead of them as they marched. I edged over onto the sidewalk to get pictures, and right after I did, the car came screeching past me at speed, plowed into the crowd of protesters and immediately reversed back up the hill. It turned, then took off. Out of instinct, I began taking photos. I just brought the camera to my eye and just mashed the shutter down. I was barely even aware of what I was watching until he was speeding into the crowd.
My instinct was to chase the car because I figured there wasn't a chance he could get very far or he would wreck and there would be an immediate arrest. I thought those pictures would be important storytelling images. As it turned out, once I got out to the cross street, the driver got further than I expected and there was nothing I could do on foot immediately.
ICYMI: While on air, authorities grab journalist and violently drag her on the ground several feet
Right before the guy drove his car down the road, it felt like any other day I would be downtown. Because of that, I didn't feel like I was in danger. Frankly, it was dumb luck that I was on the sidewalk instead of the middle of the road when I was. I was in the road for a few seconds, then moved off, then the car came through. I wasn't anticipating it. I actually saw the car as I walked up to the scene. It was backing up the street and I assumed that he was backing out of the way and trying to go around the block, didn't think anything of it until he was blowing past me 20 seconds later.
If that car had come through 20 seconds earlier, I would have been in the middle of the road, and I would have had my back to him. I wouldn't have seen him coming at all. Honestly, I'm still processing that. It's been such a crazy 24 hours that I haven't been able to sit and absorb it. That was the first thing that went through my head a couple hours after I was done processing images. I was right where the car went, and I am very fortunate.
I've reached out to photographer friends, specifically somebody who has gone through the process of publishing photos that have blown up on a worldwide scale. That was a helpful phone call this morning. It was Sara Naomi Lewkowicz, who did a series on domestic violence. She told me to decide who I'm close with and talk to those people and be with those people. Don't get caught up in the interview requests and stay away from Twitter threads. My wife always shouts at me for getting angry about comments on Facebook that are wrong or misleading. I'm really going to have to make a conscious effort not to do that.
I've been bombarded with people messaging me, tweeting me. I'm trying to keep my head down. Yesterday was supposed to be my last day. Things are developing today. I spoke to my chief editor, and I'm going in a few hours today to cover whatever happens today. The journalist in me is happy to see that part of the story through.
I'll be working at Ardent Craft Ales as a digital and social media coordinator. I've been a beer geek. I love craft beer and I love talking about it. It seemed like a great opportunity to me. It was a job at a brewery, which sounded fun. Also, by virtue of being a photographer at a newspaper with a small staff, I've done a lot of social media work. It felt like a natural fit, and the hours are flexible which means I can still continue as a freelance photographer.
This experience has been bittersweet, and it is way more bitter than sweet. A person died, a lot of people were injured, people were in shock, a community has been terrorized. It's a town that I love. I'm more focused on the fact that it was a horrible day. I happened to be at the place at the time it happened, and I did my job. I'm proud of my newspaper for doing a good job, but I haven't thought about the impact of the photo. I know that it's everywhere. I've had to cut off Twitter notifications, and my email inbox has exploded. I am glad people have seen it. It was a terrible thing and the fact that more people will be more aware of it happening is an overall positive, but I can't say I'm happy to have been there.

Just three points split the top three boats in the Volvo Ocean Race - the in-port races might yet decide the winner. We report from Cardiff on how the race is winding up to its conclusion in the Hague in two weeks' time
Dongfeng Race Team won today's Sky Ocean Rescue in-port race in Cardiff today. At the beginning of this edition of the round the world race it looked like the in-port series might be an interesting sideshow to the main event. Now it might just become a deciding factor in determining who wins the 2017-18 Volvo Ocean Race.
With two offshore stages to go (in fact, for the VO65s they are closer to a long coastal race and an overnighter, first 1,300 miles to Gothenburg and then a 700-mile hop to the Hague), the top three boats are separated by just three points. With two bonus points also up for grabs for the Leg 10 and 11 wins, there are a lot of mathematical combinations which could see a tie at the top when the seven teams finally arrive in the Hague later this month. If that's the case, then the in-port race results suddenly become critical as the tie-breaker. Potentially letting things really go to the wire, there is a final in-port race in The Hague after the last offshore has finished.
Each of the three teams on the leaderboard podium – Dongfeng Race Team, MAPFRE and Team Brunel – has their own demons to shake off. Charles Caudrelier and Dongfeng made no secret of their ambition to win the race. Their whole team structure was changed from the previous race to give them the best chance of achieving that whilst still having a Chinese crewman on board for every leg.
Dongfeng is the current overall leader, but has not yet won a leg. It's entirely possible to win the Volvo Ocean Race by hammering out 11 consistent results, but missing out on the bonus point for every leg win will be making the job harder for the Chinese-flagged team.
MAPFRE took the overall early lead, only losing it after a poor 5th in the Auckland to Itajaii double point leg. Then it happened again, on the double points transatlantic leg. They have wrestled solid results from poor placings – their 5th to 1st comeback into Newport being the most impressive – but Xabi Fernandez's team will want to avoid putting themselves in those situations. With the next leg running to just 1,300 miles there is also no room left to make such a dramatic recovery.
Watch Rob Greenhalgh, watch leader on MAPFRE, discuss the last two legs here:
Team Brunel's form turnaround has been the most dramatic in the race. Expectations were high that the seven-times Volvo Ocean Race veteran skipper Bouwe Bekking would be an early contender, in fact the first half of their race was decidedly lacklustre, with a 6th, 4th, 4thand 5th. But Brunel suddenly had a change of form on the massive Auckland to Itajai leg, winning for double points. Then again, as MAPFRE faltered, Brunel soared, taking the double points transatlantic win. You cannot count any one of these three out right now.
Other factors may come into play though. Watching the practice race in Cardiff Bay earlier this week it was surprising that, even after close to 40,000 miles of sailing these boats and all the weather forecasting and navigation power the teams can muster, several teams hugely over-stood the top mark layline. Simple mistakes can still win and lose points here.
Fatigue is setting in amongst some teams – and some are wearier than others. Some teams have rotated crew more than others throughout the race, making a trade off between consistency and fresh energy. MAPFRE has retained the same crew the whole way round, Brunel solidified their team in the latter stages of the race, while Dongfeng is continuing a planned programme of crew rotation into the final stages. For the next stage three of the 12 crew will switch, including the addition of Fabien Delahaye, who is very experienced in performance analysis and navigation. Having a second navigator may prove to be a strength on these short, stressful, sleep-deprived final stages.
As the unstoppable Volvo Ocean Race juggernaut rolls towards its conclusion, the move back to Europe has also amped up the sponsor activity for many teams. I was a guest of Helly Hansen and MAPFRE in Cardiff, and one of the reasons so many of the Helly Hansen office was in town was to get feedback from the crews. It's too late to amend anything for this race (the team have already had five iterations of kit from Helly Hansen, subtly improved for their very specific demands over the course of the race) but it's the last chance to get the sailors' comments for ongoing product development before they all disappear off to the America's Cup, maxi Med circuit, kiteboarding road trips, or simply turning all their emails off for a well deserved break.
There is a slight end of term feeling to the race. Friendships have been solidified, many of the younger sailors are grabbing the opportunity to enjoy everything this bizarre round the world circus has to offer before it's time to say goodbyes – for example going on a mass outing to the Beyonce and Jay-Z concert in Cardiff.
Spending time in the MAPFRE base it was interesting to see how an easy familiarity has developed – Blair Tuke casually leaning on skipper Xabi Fernandez as he delivered a safety briefing to guests on deck. “Very Latin” was how one team member described the MAPFRE atmosphere – warm, with plenty of affectionate teasing evident, and no doubt the odd explosive moment behind the scenes.
What happens after term ends is also on everyone's mind – the teams have their key stakeholders in their team bases or top of their contacts list right now. In just two weeks' time the CEOs and CMOs who make the decision whether to sign, or not to sign, for the next edition of the Volvo Ocean Race will be gone, back to account sheets and boardroom negotiations. Now is the time to capture enthusiasm for the race, to share what it can offer. Unsurprisingly, there is plenty of speculation about what format that race might take – we'll look at this in more detail in the next issue of Yachting World, out 12th July.
IHeartMedia Inc.'s hard-won bankruptcy accord allows lenders to re-open the deal if bids emerge from a buyer like Liberty Media Corp. -- a development that some senior creditors would welcome, according to people with knowledge of the process.
Those creditors fought hard for language in the restructuring support agreement that lets them continue to explore “consistent alternative proposals,” said the people, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are private. That clause was heavily contested in talks before iHeart filed for court protection, a company lawyer said during a bankruptcy hearing on Thursday in Houston.
The group is open to options including a higher offer from Liberty or other strategic buyers who may be attracted by Liberty's bid for iHeart, the people said. Liberty Chief Executive Officer Greg Maffei had publicly outlined an alternative bankruptcy plan in which Liberty would acquire 40 percent of the new equity, and has said he's willing to consider taking a larger stake.
No formal talks with Liberty are underway, according to the people. French advertising company JCDecaux SA has also expressed future interest in iHeart's healthy billboard subsidiary, Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings.
Wendy Goldberg, a spokeswoman for San Antonio, Texas-based iHeart, declined to comment. Representatives for Liberty and for the creditor group's advisers, investment bank PJT Partners Inc. and law firm Jones Day, didn't provide comments. IHeart, the biggest U.S. radio-station owner, filed for Chapter 11 court protection this week with a pre-arranged plan to cut its $20 billion debt load.
Private Talks
The creditor group includes holders of the term loan and priority-guarantee notes. The bankruptcy plan allows them to conduct private talks with Liberty and any other bidders, without including the company, its private equity sponsors or junior creditors, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Philip Brendel.
“Usually, restructuring support agreements prohibit doing another transaction,” Brendel said. This accord “even allows the senior creditors to keep a potential alternative transaction proponent confidential from the company.” There's also language that would keep junior creditors from being able to hinder a deal with a strategic buyer, as long as they get at least as much compensation as they're being offered in the current deal, Brendel said.
Liberty, controlled by billionaire John Malone, had been buying up iHeart debt in recent months with an eye on getting control of iHeart's radio business after it reorganizes in bankruptcy. In a late bid to play the role of white knight, Liberty and SiriusXM offered to inject $1.16 billion of new money and provide a loan to keep iHeart in business through the bankruptcy process.
Enough Cash
The offer was put aside, with negotiators already close on a plan that didn't need any debtor-in-possession loans. Those tend to be costly and probably would give a lender -- in this case Liberty -- top priority in bankruptcy court. IHeart said in a statement accompanying its filing that it has enough cash on hand to keep operating without a new loan.
That doesn't mean investors have heard the last of Liberty. Maffei told attendees at an industry conference earlier this month there are “enormous” synergies for the ailing iHeart with two other Malone investments -- the majority-owned satellite radio giant SiriusXM Holdings Inc. and Pandora Media Inc., the online music company where Liberty took a minority position last year.
“With the advantages we can bring to the table, we think we can perhaps reduce some of the risks that are inherent in the business,” Maffei said during an earnings call this month. Liberty has also “expressed a willingness and a desire to go higher” with its proposed stake in iHeart in talks with the senior creditor group, he said at the conference.
Sharing Resources
Maffei sees opportunities to cross-promote personalities at the two companies. Howard Stern is the biggest name at SiriusXM, while iHeart has a deal with syndicated radio personality Elvis Duran, among others. IHeart and Pandora, meanwhile, could share advertising technology and sales forces, Maffei said. It doesn't make sense to consolidate all three companies yet, Maffei said, though working with Pandora and Sirius could help iHeart's struggling radio stations to adapt. He also singled out iHeart's sales force as a valuable asset that's larger than those at Pandora and Sirius.
Asked if Sirius or Liberty ultimately will need to control Pandora and iHeart to get the benefits envisioned, Maffei said, “There are things between, in a management services agreement, that allow you to get a lot of it. But, you know, over time does the sum of it require control? We will see.”

FULLERTON, Calif. — Khalil Ahmad ripped the nets for a career-high 34 points, burying 6 of 10 tries from 3-point range, and Cal State Fullerton held off Utah Valley 91-83 on Saturday night.
Jackson Rowe scored 15 for the Titans (6-3), while Kyle Allman and reserve Austen Awosika added 12 points and Arkim Robertson snared 10 rebounds.
Kenneth Ogbe topped the Wolverines (6-4) with 17 points before fouling out. Akolda Manyang added 15 points and nine rebounds, Jake Toolson scored 15 and Brandon Randolph chipped in with 11 points and five assists.
Utah Valley, which came into the game with six wins in its past seven games after opening the season with losses at Kentucky and Duke, nearly shot better from the floor than the free-throw line. The Wolverines connected on 30 of 54 shots (56 per cent) from the floor, but made just 14 of 24 free throws (58 per cent). The Titans had held their opponents to 39 per cent shooting from the field coming into the game.
Ogbe made 1 of 2 free throws midway through the second half to put Utah Valley up 63-62, but Ahmad knocked down a 3-pointer to regain the lead for the Titans for good. Ahmad scored 10 straight points for Fullerton to push the lead to 11 with less than three minutes to play.

MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — The countdown stands at 121 days until Minnesota takes center stage for the Super Bowl. Beyond security and downtown business logistics, one of the biggest efforts will be on the volunteers who will help make the days leading up to the big game run smoothly.
Michael Howard is the communications director for the Minnesota Super Bowl Host Committee.
“It feels like a train that's officially left the station,” Howard said.
Makeshift office space on Nicollet Mall makes sure that train stays on track. Inside a headquarters that showcases the Super Bowl and stepping forward.
In the first 48 hours of putting out the call, 9,000 people signed up to be a part of the volunteer team called Crew 52.
“We had a good sense of that energy and excitement and it just continues to build as we move closer to the game,” Howard said.
Now, more than 30,000 have applied. But, it will be 10,000 people who will get the call back in the coming days that they've made the cut.
More than 90 percent of Super Bowl volunteers are coming from Minnesota. You might be surprised how far some folks are willing to drive to be a part of it.
Like Stacy Mente, from the southwest corner of the state in Adrian. She's a mother of three and family farmer. Mente gets points for her church and 4-H volunteering and for her love of cold weather.
“Being from the farm I totally get it, it's probably going to be cold but I will be prepared,” Mente said.
Mente's application is one of the more than 500 that have come from cities outside the metro. Plenty of people are willing to cross the border, too. Many applicants came from North and South Dakota and Wisconsin.
Stacy Mente found out she made it.
“I think it's exciting. I think it's great,” she said.
One now of many tasked with making the experience an unforgettable one for the 1 million visitors who will be here come February.
“All of the planning continues and we'll be ready,” Howard said.
Volunteers will work three shifts during the 10-day Super Bowl festival.
All 10,000 volunteers for Crew 52 will be notified by mid-October that they made the team. A big training event for all of them will be held in Minneapolis in November.
Estonian energy company Eesti Energia has agreed a €289m deal to acquire compatriot renewables developer Nelja Energia, which has an operational wind portfolio of 287MW.
The state-owned Eesti will take over loans amounting to €199m as part of the takeover through its Enefit Green subsidiary.
Nelja Energia has 17 wind farms in operation in Estonia and Lithuania, and also has biomass interests.
The company is 77% owned by Vardar AS with the remaining shareholders made up of Estonian investors.

Microsoft Patches Shadow Brokers Exploits, Updates Privacy Controls
The hacking group Shadow Brokers last week revealed a large number of Windows vulnerabilities it claims to have stolen from the National Security Agency (NSA), but Microsoft said Friday that it has already patched most of them. The company has also rolled out new privacy settings through its recent Creators Update.
Nine exploits released by the Shadow Brokers have already been patched, while three others only affected users running older, unsupported versions of the Windows operating system, said principal security group manager Phillip Misner on Microsoft's TechNet IT portal. Misner said anyone with those older versions should upgrade their systems to avoid the vulnerabilities.
Since emerging last summer, the Shadow Brokers organization has published five leaks of zero-days and other vulnerabilities it claims to have taken from the NSA. The exploits the group revealed Friday included Windows vulnerabilities as well as hacking tools apparently used by the NSA to monitor messages about financial transactions through the SWIFT telecommunications network for banking.
'Lost in Translation' Leak
Described as the "Lost in Translation" leak, the Shadow Brokers' latest release has been called the group's most damaging dump to date by some news sources. The leak reportedly included "mentions of previously disclosed NSA top secret programs and software," according to Motherboard. The leak also included a tool that appeared to be linked to the Stuxnet computer worm that caused extensive damage to Iran's nuclear facilities in 2010.
The SWIFT-focused hacking tools included in last week's leak indicate "the U.S. National Security Agency had accessed the SWIFT interbank messaging system, allowing it to monitor money flows among some Middle Eastern and Latin American banks," Reuters reported on Friday. Misner noted on the TechNet site that Microsoft has already patched many of the Windows exploits revealed in the leak.
"Of the three remaining exploits, 'EnglishmanDentist', 'EsteemAudit', and 'ExplodingCan', none reproduces on supported platforms, which means that customers running Windows 7 and more recent versions of Windows or Exchange 2010 and newer versions of Exchange are not at risk," Misner said. "Customers still running prior versions of these products are encouraged to upgrade to a supported offering."
New Privacy, Security Options
Last Tuesday, Microsoft also began rolling out its latest big update for Windows 10. Dubbed the "Creators Update," the OS refresh introduced several new security and privacy controls.
A new privacy dashboard, for example, "lets you see and manage your activity data across multiple Microsoft services," Yusuf Mehdi, Windows and Devices Group vice president, wrote in a blog post on March 29. Activity covered in the dashboard includes search history, location data and browsing history for the Edge browser. Users also can specify what diagnostic and usage data is sent to Microsoft.
The Creators Update also added a new Windows Defender Security Center that gives enterprise users a centralized dashboard for controlling security preferences, as well as a Device Health Advisor.
The Creators Update accompanies a change in which Windows 10 Mobile devices Microsoft will continue to support, Windows and Devices Group software engineer Dona Sarkar noted in a blog post on Friday. They include the HP Elite x3 and the Microsoft Lumia 550, 640, 640XL, 650, 950, and 950XL, along with some other Alcatel, SoftBank, Vaio, MouseComputer, and Trinity devices.
"Devices not on this list will not officially receive the Windows 10 Creators Update nor will they receive any future builds from our development branch that we release as part of the Windows Insider Program," Sarkar said. "However, Windows Insiders who have devices not on this list can still keep these devices on the Windows 10 Creators Update at their own risk knowing that it's unsupported."

RENO, Nev. (AP) — Madeleine Pickens wanted the African-American chef she recruited from the country club she owns in Southern California to cook “black people food” — not “white people food” — at her rural Nevada dude ranch and wild horse sanctuary, according to a federal lawsuit accusing her of racial discrimination.
Armand Appling says the wealthy philanthropist and ex-wife of Oklahoma energy tycoon T. Boone Pickens told him fried chicken, BBQ ribs and corn bread would be perfect for the tourists who pay nearly $2,000 a night to stay in plush cottages, ride horses and take Wild West “safaris” on ATVs at her Mustang Monument Wild Horse Eco-Resort.
Appling alleges he was fired 2014 in retaliation for complaining about a hostile work environment. He says Pickens' stereotypical references were commonplace at the Elko County ranch stretching across 900 square miles on the edge of the Ruby Mountains about 50 miles west of the Utah line.
Among other things, he says Pickens, who is white, instructed him to terminate two other black kitchen staffers — one she referred to as her “bull” or “ox” and another who had “too much personality.” He says she told him they didn't “look like people we have working at the country club” and didn't “fit the image” of the staff she wanted at the ranch.
Pickens' lawyers argue that even if all the allegations are true, none of her comments were racially motivated. At worst, Pickens' remarks “reflect a non-racial personality conflict and amount to discourtesy, rudeness or lack of sensitivity,” they wrote in recent court filings.
U.S. District Judge Miranda Du said during a hearing in Reno last week that Appling's lawyers have failed so far to prove the sort of racial hostility needed to win such a civil rights claim. She dismissed the original lawsuit that was filed in February but gave them until Jan. 13 to refile an amended complaint seeking unspecified damages from Pickens' nonprofit, Save America's Mustangs.
“It takes a lot to prove these allegations,” Du told California attorney Willie Williams on Thursday.
Du agreed with Pickens' lawyer, Dora Lane of Reno, that the only comment that specifically referred to race was the reference to “black people food.”
Lane said categorizing foods by ethnicity is commonplace in the restaurant industry. Some restaurants serve Mexican food, others Chinese or Thai food, she said.
“The suggestion that such categorizations are inherently offensive is nonsense,” Lane argued in earlier court documents. “This is especially true here, given that Pickens' alleged comments actually reflect a preference for ‘black people food' rather than a racial anima against ‘black people' or ‘black people food.'”
Williams said Pickens' comments about the fired employees “not fitting in” reinforces a long history of African-Americans not being allowed into elite, private-club settings. Pickens owns the exclusive Del Mar Country Club north of San Diego where Appling worked before she hired him for a 5-month stint in Nevada.
“In many cases, the people fighting to keep African-Americans out of these private clubs would use code phrases like ‘they do not fit the image,'” Williams said in court documents. He added the use of the words “ox” and “bull” implies ownership of property, given “America's long history of slavery where they were considered personal property of their owners.”
Lane argued it was a complimentary reference to physical strength and “was not accompanied by any overtly racial slurs.”
“Indeed, Appling does not allege that he ever heard any overtly racial epithets, such as the ‘N-word,'” she wrote in court documents.
But Williams told the judge last week the comments must be viewed in the context of racial stereotypes.
Du agreed that Lane's arguments focus on the “plain meaning of words” while seemingly ignoring the context of comments made about “African-Americans in history and stereotypes that could give rise to racial animas.”
“If the alleged comments were not directed at him, but others who look like him, it may affect his work environment,” the judge said.

Voice of America report by Madeeha Anwar states that Pakistan has recently launched a smartphone application that will allow its citizens to anonymously report extremist, radical or sectarian-based hate content to the relevant authorities. The app named Chaukas (vigilant) is created by the National Counterterrorism Authority (NACTA), a government body responsible for devising counterterrorism strategies, and is available on both Android and iOS systems.
We begin in Nigeria where the maiden visit of French President Emmanuel Macron to Africa's largest nation dominates the front pages. The Tribune posts a colorful picture of the young French leader as inspected a guard of honour on his arrival at Abuja's Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport on Tuesday afternoon.
Nigerian foreign minister Geoffrey Onyeama who received Monsieur Macron on his arrival, said the official visit was his irst formal meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari since he came to office adding that their talks would cover the areas of security, in the light of French effort to set up the G-5 Sahel force to contain the terrorist designs of Al-Qaeda in the Maghreb, and other armed groups in Sub Saharan Africa.
The Tribune quotes the Nigerian foreign minister as saying that on top of the G-5 Sahel the two leaders were to be looking complementarily into intelligence sharing strategies to boost the mission of a second security grouping, the multinational joint task force fighting Boko Haram in the north of the country and neighboring countries.
Vanguard says lucrative trade with Nigeria is what brought the French leader to Nigeria. The paper quotes Foreign Minister Enyeama, as saying that both leaders were to witness the signing of a MoU for French Energy and Environmental companies to launch a reforestation and agricultural project which would create about 150,000 jobs in Ogun State.
This Day highlights President's Macron's blunt remarks at a press conference that while France was ready to help tackle the terrorism threat, it was Nigeria's responsibility to deal with the violence being unleashed on citizens by Fulani herdsmen.
Macron also said it was imperative for African leaders to know the reason young people join different terrorist groups and put machinery in place to address it.

First ever ‘Tie' in Regional First-Class cricket recorded
But leaders Jaguars still unbeaten
By Sean Devers
When Guyana Jaguars began the action packed final day on 104-4 with 61 required for their fifth victory for the season and with Vishaul Singh, one of only two batsmen with over 450 runs, unbeaten on 48, it appeared that their sixth round CWI Digicel Regional four-day Championship game against the Windwards Volcanoes would be done and dusted in the first session with an easy win for the home team.
What transpired yesterday at Providence was as nail-biting as it was unbelievable and must have left the Jaguars' Coaches fuming.
On a Sunday morning in the midst of Guyana's Christmas season the only disappointment was that only about 12 fans were there to witness an exhilarating climax to a low scoring contest on a track which contributed very little to the totals posted by both teams.
Only Devon Smith, Shiv Chanderpaul and Vishaul Singh demonstrated the patience and maturity to earn fifties in the game.
Three times defending Champions Jaguars, hunting 165 for victory, crashed to 164 all out, 89 minutes into the day's play as the Providence Stadium became the first venue in the West Indies where a First-Class game ended in a Tie.
Despite the historic result, Jaguars remained unbeaten at the top of the points table with 97.2 points with four games to play including two at home.
In over 300 years of First Class cricket only 62 games, including two Test matches, have ended in a Tie and yesterday's result was the first ever in the West Indies. Australia was involved in both Tied Tests with the first being against West Indies in 1960.
Jaguars lost six wickets for 46 runs as off-spinner, Dominican Shane Shillingford captured 5-45, his 40th five-wicket haul at this level, while Left-arm pacer Delorn Johnson, who had 5-46 the last time Volcanoes played at Providence in April this year, supported with 3-45.
With the scores level, Shillingford aborted his run-up as ‘something' got into his eyes and Bramble, five away from his ninth fifty and fourth for the season, who was fast becoming a nervous wreck and was made the wait.
The Jamaican Umpire Christopher Taylor further stalled when he tried to verify the score from the Match Referee and third Umpire on ‘Walkie Talkies' that seemed to be malfunctioning and Bramble, with not the calmest head in the world, was made to wait longer.
When the action eventually resumed a confused looking Bramble, who batted Jaguars to the brink of victory with some entertaining shots, neither went forward nor back and played no shot and the ball cannoned into his pad.
A raucous appeal went up and so did Taylor's finger to spark contrasting emotions. Shillingford and his team erupted in celebrations as if they had won the World Cup, while a depressed looking Bramble stayed a long time at the crease after the decision not believing what had happened a few moments ago before, looking a sorry sight, despondently made his back to the pavilion.
When play began, Singh, with two centuries and two half-centuries this season, soon reached his 12th fifty at this level but just when the little left hander, who only has fewer runs than Devon Smith's 612, was eying another not out, he was LBW to Shillingford at 118-5.
Singh faced 95 balls in his 56 which was decorated with eight well struck boundaries and his demise triggered a dramatic collapse as Shillingford went to work and almost got his team over the line.
Sherfane Rutherford (2) was removed by Johnson at 126-6, Kemo Paul (3) ran himself out at 138-7 and Veerasammy Permaul (5) and Gudakesh Motie (0) were sent packing with the score on 158.
Bramble was fast running out of partners and with only last man Keon Joseph to come, the panic button was activated.
Ironically, it was Bramble who was dismissed as the Volcanoes, who floored three catches late on the third afternoon, handled the situation better than their Guyanese counterparts as the pressure mounted in the dying stages of what turned to be a very competitive game.
Meanwhile, Jaguars head Coach Esuan Crandon said his side did not play well in this game adding that the batting was way below expectations.
“Volcanoes bowlers utilized the conditions a little better than us. Our batsmen didn't display enough fight and determination. Our bowlers did a fantastic job in the first innings by restricting them for 117 but we didn't bowl that well in the second innings, allowing them to score over two hundred runs,” said Crandon.
Speaking of the mood in the Jaguars camp after the games was tied Crandon informed that everyone were disappointed with the result because they felt that Jaguars should have won from their overnight position.
“Nevertheless we are happy that we didn't lose the game and was able to gain some crucial points which still give us a big lead going into the next match,” concluded Crandon.
The next match for the Jaguars is a day/night contest against the Leewards Hurricanes from Thursday at Providence.

This photo, provided by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shows four undocumented Chinese nationals they said were found crammed in the trunk of Jose Emiliano Aguilar's car at the San Ysidro Port of Entry on March 14, 2017.
The son of a famous Mexican mariachi musician charged with trying to smuggle four undocumented Chinese nationals crammed in the trunk of his car across the U.S.-Mexico border is now pleading guilty in the case.
According to documents filed in the United District Court for the Southern District of California in San Diego, Jose Emiliano Aguilar, the 24-year-old son of Grammy Award-winner Pepe Aguilar, changed his plea to guilty on June 6.
Per the documents, Jose's sentencing hearing is now set to take place on Aug. 14 before United States District Judge Anthony J. Battaglia.
The son of the mariachi star was arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers on March 14 at the San Ysidro border crossing in south San Diego, and charged with human smuggling.
Son of Mariachi Icon Pepe Aguilar Faces Smuggling Charges
The Chinese nationals that Jose Aguilar allegedly attempted to smuggle into the United States told officers they had agreed to pay between $3,000 and $60,000 if safely brought into the country. NBC 7's Wendy Fry has more. (Published Friday, March 31, 2017)
At his arraignment in April, he entered a not guilty plea to the federal charge through his San Diego-based defense attorney, Jeremy Warren. At that time, Warren said the Aguilar family was thankful for the outpouring of support from Pepe's fans through the ordeal.
"The Aguilar family is grateful for the outpouring of love and support from thousands of people in the United States, Mexico, and all over the world. They are united and strong and they stand by their son Jose Emiliano. They thank everyone for their kindness and understanding as the case progresses," read the statement from the family.
According to a complaint filed in federal court, Jose allegedly arranged to smuggle four immigrants into the U.S. under a deal in which they would each pay him between $3,000 and $60,000 if they successfully entered the country.
The complaint said Jose drove through a border checkpoint just after 5:45 p.m. on March 14 in a Chrysler 200, accompanied by a woman in the passenger seat.
Jose, who is a U.S. citizen, showed his passport to border agents, while his passenger showed officers her border crossing card. Jose allegedly told officers they were headed to San Diego and had nothing to declare from Mexico.
During a routine primary inspection of the car, a K-9 dog alerted officers to the trunk. Officers told Jose to unlock it, the complaint said. Inside the small space were four undocumented Chinese nationals -- three women and one man. Jose and his companion were detained while border agents removed the people from the trunk.
Son of Mexican Mariachi Star Accused of Human Smuggling
Jose Aguilar, son of Mariachi icon Pepe Aguilar, is accused of attempting to smuggle undocumented Chinese nationals at the San Ysidro Port of Entry. NBC 7's Wendy Fry has more. (Published Friday, March 31, 2017)
They were questioned as "material witnesses" and, according to documents, admitted they were citizens of China without lawful documents to enter the U.S.
Each had made their own smuggling arrangements with Jose, agreeing to pay him to help them get into the U.S., according to the complaint. Two of the Chinese nationals said they planned to head to Los Angeles, while the other two said they were headed to New York City.
A document filed in the U.S. District Court Southern District of California shows Jose was released on a bond of $15,000 following his arrest. His bond conditions included that he not travel to Mexico and that he not possess any drugs or firearms. He also had to report to supervision to a pretrial services agency.

Additional conditions outlined for Jose included that he must undergo psychiatric or psychological counseling, he must "actively seek and maintain full-time employment, schooling, or combination of both," and must live with his mother. He also had to surrender his passport and could not apply for new travel documents.
While Warren previously confirmed Jose's relation to Pepe Aguilar, the defense attorney said this case has nothing to do with the mariachi singer.
"We understand the interest in our client Jose Aguilar because of his father's musical career. However, this case has nothing to do with Pepe Aguilar. Jose Aguilar is young man who will address this matter in court, and not in the press," Warran said in a statement to NBC 7 in March. "We understand that Pepe Aguilar will provide a statement shortly. In the meantime, we ask that you respect the family's privacy."

WESTON (CBSMiami) – Broward traffic homicide investigators have little to go on as they hunt the hit and run killer of an avid bicyclist and family man, fatally injured Sunday morning.
“He was amazing. He was incredibly caring. He loved his children more than anything in the world,” said Robin Mohr Monday, speaking through tears as she remembered her husband, 50 year old Christopher, her childhood sweetheart and father of their two children.
“He and I met when we were fifteen. We got married. We were married for 26 years,” Robin Mohr said.
Her husband, an accomplished bicyclist, was struck Sunday morning about 7:30, as he headed East on State Road 84 in Weston about a mile East of Indian Trace.
The driver of a white car kept going, leaving him to die.
Mohr was always a stickler for safety.
“He always rode in the bike lane, always had a light on the front and back, a helmet, reflective clothing,” his wife said.
Mohr had gone out for an early morning ride, preparing for a hundred mile race next week.
The CPA needed to get back home to celebrate his daughter's birthday – she turned 21 New Year's Day.
Robin Mohr can't conceive of someone not stopping to help her mortally injured life mate.
“You wouldn't treat an animal that way,” she said, weeping. “That person couldn't have a conscience. They destroyed a family.”
The family sat on their Weston patio making funeral arrangements Monday for what they call the perfect husband and dad.
Witnesses did not get a good look at the car that hit Mohr.
Investigators describe it only as an older model white car that will have damage to its passenger side headlights and windshield.
Anyone with information is asked to call Broward Crime Stoppers at 954-493-TIPS.

This Bike Ride Is Absolutely Incredible

LONDON (CNNMoney) -- French workers have won the right to ignore business emails that arrive after hours.
A new labor law that took effect on Sunday gives employees the "right to disconnect" from email, smartphones and other electronic leashes once their working day has ended.
"These measures are designed to ensure respect for rest periods and ... balance between work and family and personal life," the Ministry of Labor said in a statement.
The rule requires companies with 50 or more employees to negotiate new out-of-office email guidelines with staff. Firms have a duty to regulate the use of emails to ensure employees get a break from the office.
If management and staff cannot agree on new rules, the firm must publish a charter to define and regulate when employees should be able to switch off.
French unions have long pushed for a "disconnect" rule, saying digital technologies have created an "explosion of undeclared labor" that is forcing employees to work outside the typical work week.
Some French companies have already put rules in place to bar employees from using their work devices after hours. Some firms even completely shut down their email systems overnight.
The email rule is the latest in a series of measures designed to overhaul France's labor laws.
The government last year introduced new rules that make it easier for employers to fire workers and reduce overtime pay. The changes resulted in crippling strikes.
The country's 35-hour work week has been in place since 2000, but various reforms have softened these rules over time and some industries are granted special exceptions.
France's economy has been stagnating for years and many multinational firms take a dim view of French business regulations.
The International Monetary Fund expects France's economy will grow by 1.3% this year, on a par with 2016.

Mark the time and date: At precisely 12:40 p.m. on Feb. 14, on the 25th day of the Trump administration, a Democrat dealt from the bottom of the deck to play the Watergate card: “What did the president know and when did he know it?” demanded Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings.
It wasn't a question. Cummings was trying to turn the departure of Michael Flynn into a club and use it to batter President Trump like a baby seal.
The White House is shrugging off the cheap shot, but the coast is far from clear. Combined with mistakes and in-house dissension, the necessity of removing the top national security aide less than a month into the job signals that Trump is now face-to-face with his first presidential crisis.
The resistance against him is emboldened, yet there's no silver bullet because there is no single problem. Here are two areas Trump must address to regain momentum and keep faith with the public.
First, better control of his White House staff is essential to stop damaging leaks and circular firing squads. One especially strange example came when a Trump friend publicly criticized Chief of Staff Reince Priebus as “in way over his head” soon after meeting with Trump.
And Kellyanne Conway, who was extraordinarily effective guiding Trump's campaign and articulating his agenda, looks exhausted and off her game. Her glib assertion that the public “go buy Ivanka's stuff” was clumsy, and she did nobody any favors by claiming that Flynn still enjoyed Trump's confidence just hours before Trump fired him.
A second potential pitfall for Trump is that Paul Ryan's House of Representatives seems to be all talk and no action. Jobs, jobs, jobs will not come back with jawboning corporations and regulatory relief alone.
Tax reform is key, yet Ryan seems to think that speeches and tweets will keep the public and his members happy. Trump needs to light a fire under him.
None of this is meant to suggest the sky is falling. It is simply a recognition that, while every new president goes through a shakeout period, Trump's fumbles take on exaggerated importance because the opposition media and Democrats are united in trying to thwart his presidency.
It's been that way since the election, which is why, if you blinked, you missed the new president's honeymoon. Recall that 70 Democrats boycotted his inauguration.
Now comes the Flynn fiasco, a gift to those who hope it will let them drive Trump from office. On cue, The New York Times echoed the Watergate smear in a front-page headline soon after Cummings spoke.
Any suggestion that the incident starts the clock ticking on impeachment is absurd. Flynn was cut loose not because he talked to the Russian ambassador but because Trump believed he could no longer trust him after Flynn misled vice-president Mike Pence about whether sanctions were discussed on the call.
Given the forceful ways aides described Trump's mind-set, it might be the case that Flynn also lied to Trump.
But that's a very different scenario than the one the Dem-media complex is trying to spin. They want to link the call to the ambassador to their larger accusations about Trump having secret alliances with Vladimir Putin.
In their fever, they conveniently ignore the reason why the Justice Department reported Flynn's call to the White House: to wit, officials believed Flynn's lie to Pence, and thus to the public, made him a potential target of Russian blackmailers who knew sanctions were discussed.
Against that backdrop and because of his lack of trust, Trump's decision to fire Flynn clearly is the right one. Moreover, Flynn carried extra baggage because he was paid for an ill-advised trip to Moscow in 2015 where he had dinner with Putin.
Still, even if Flynn's departure is the end of the incident, it's not the end of Trump's troubles. As the president said yesterday, he has been plagued with leaks to the media of important conversations that should have been private, including the one involving Flynn.
Plugging those leaks won't be easy, so it shouldn't be the president's top priority. He's got to stay focused on the big picture — delivering on his major promises of controlling immigration, renegotiating bad trade deals, reforming taxes and rebuilding the military. His top aides also must be single-minded about that agenda, in messaging and execution.
While Trump quickly took fast steps with executive orders, they are limited and implementation is just beginning. The most important one, which suspends visas from seven Mideast countries and Syrian refugees, is blocked by the courts and faces an uncertain fate.
The last thing the president needs is to get bogged down with any one issue. Perception is everything in running the government, and danger follows the image of being beset by outside criticism and internal squabbling. Lost momentum is hard to regain when supporters are demoralized.
To see an example, Trump need look no further than Barack Obama's first two years. Immensely popular at first, he rammed ObamaCare down America's throat, and promptly suffered a shellacking in the first midterm election when the GOP took the House. After that, Obama never got his domestic agenda back on track.
Trump is far from that cliff, but there is little time and even less political capital to waste. In Washington, success is never inevitable.
Bill's bills to pay
Mayor de Blasio's sketchy scheme to raise money from donors to pay his criminal defense lawyers is raising hackles from ethics watchdogs. They rightly argue that it looks like a replay of the political slush fund that put prosecutors on his tail in the first place.
Here is my modest suggestion about what the mayor should do — and I offer it free of charge: He should use his own money to pay his legal bills.
He can do that by selling the two privates homes he owns in Brooklyn. He leases them out for more than $100,000 a year to private tenants, while taxpayers house the mayor and his family in Gracie Mansion.
The mayor's properties carry a combined estimated market value of about $2.5 million. Although both are mortgaged, he could still realize a handsome profit and use it to pay his lawyers.
Here's the best part: The idea is aboveboard and perfectly legal. That's probably why de Blasio didn't think of it himself.
Over time, it can be fixed
It's the definition of insanity.
Year after year, top overtime earners among state workers double and sometimes triple their salaries, and 2016 was no exception. At least five workers pulled in more than $134,000 in overtime alone, with an IT worker topping the list with nearly $180,000.
Tell me again why this can't be fixed.

Stephen King has a pretty good idea why the film adaptation of The Dark Tower flopped with critics and moviegoers – it wasn't violent enough.
So when he was asked in Toronto Thursday night about the TV adaptation of Under the Dome, which was unceremoniously cancelled after three seasons on CBS in 2015, he again didn't mince words.
“Under the Dome started off smart and got dumb,” King deadpanned. “I may get some negative feedback from the network, but I don't care.”
The recent film adaptation of King's It was a smash with critics and audiences, but The Dark Tower, which starred Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, was a massive disappointment.
“The major challenge was to do a film based on a series of books that's really long, about 3,000 pages,” the writer told Vulture. “The other part of it was the decision to do a PG-13 feature adaptation of books that are extremely violent and deal with violent behaviour in a fairly graphic way. That was something that had to be overcome.”
Reflecting on Under the Dome's cancellation to a sold-out audience at Koerner Hall, King brought up a line from the film adaptation of his short story Stand By Me.
“'Wagon Train's a really cool show, but did you notice they never get anywhere? They just keep wagon training.' Well, people on Under the Dome just kept Under the Doming.
“Shows need a beginning, middle and end... don't keep on wagon training.”
King was in Toronto to promote Sleeping Beauties, the new novel he co-wrote with his son Owen.

Cellphone video shows a woman crashing into the gate of a school in Queens, then emerging with a toddler
Police are investigating a bizarre crash in Queens in which a driver allegedly slammed into the gate of a middle school, handed a toddler to a stranger and then ran away, sources say.
A woman in her 20s crashed a gray Honda Civic into the gate at M.S. 210 at 101st Avenue and 93rd Street in South Ozone at about 6:30 p.m., according to law enforcement sources.
No one was hurt, but when she got out of the car, she took a 1-year-old child out of the car and handed the little girl to a stranger, allegedly saying, "I'm going to be arrested" before running away on foot, the sources said.
Police arrived and took the child to the hospital; she's expected to be OK.
The driver has not been found.
Hip-hip Hooray! Part three of my four-part saga got greenlit and published. I must be special. Anyway, here's where we get into the nitty-gritty, cracking the TOP 10. EVER (canon). At least until “Untitled Deadpool Sequel” comes out. But, until then, let's keep the Hype Engine going!
Wonder Woman
About that giving-it-some-time thing, you might be thinking, “Isn't it too early to tell if ‘Wonder Woman' is a top-10 contender?” The answer's definitely no. This is the ultimate DC movie so far.
Entering the shiny halls of Perfectly-Casted Characters, Gal Gadot IS Wonder Woman and Hans Zimmer's theme for the heroine is also one of the very best themes in cinema history, let alone superhero history. Remember how people were signing petitions to get Gadot fired back in 2015? Hindsight is 20/20. Awesome action, beautiful costumes, gorgeous cinematography, a rousing musical score, confident direction, and a great villain prove to the non-believers how Team DC rolls. Extra points for finally having a superhero film ask if humanity is even worth saving.
Scott Pilgrim vs the World
Before 2016's “Deadpool” and 2014's “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Scott Pilgrim vs the World” was a truly bonkers comic book adapted faithfully to film. It's also really good, too. Featuring a killer cast of super alumni like Chris Evans, Brandon Routh, and Brie Larson, this flick is brimming with great characters, especially a shining performance from leading man Michael Cera.
Not only is this a great comic-book movie, it's the only unquestionably good video game movie we have (I think it counts), while also featuring sly nods and even jabs at underground pop culture references. Incredible aesthetics, great stunts, irresistible humor, gorgeous sound design, and taut direction from Edgar Wright make “Scott Pilgrim vs the World” one of the overlooked gems in the comic-movie genre.
X-Men: First Class
I know, I know. Audiences don't like period pieces anymore. Especially with their superheroes. But “First Class” is a fantastic origin, and (*gasps*) prequel story.
This movie had the hefty task of recasting most of the X-Men we know. Matthew Vaughn did that and showed the beginning of Charles' and Eric's friendship spectacularly. The cast has electric chemistry and the villains have real presence. The attack on the manor and especially the beach fight are heart-wrenching. Who knew Kevin Bacon could be that good of a villain, or that a coin could be one of the most brutal murder weapons in cinema history?
Yep, I most definitely said that last part. I also love that someone finally gave us the classic yellow and black costumes from the comics. Remember, mutant and proud.
The Avengers
﻿
The reason why cinematic universes are hip, why studios are vomiting three superhero movies a year every year, but also sort of the reason why people don't see other kinds of movies anymore: this one started a lot, because, frankly, it's got a lot.
Despite having a fair amount to do, along with the extra task of doing what we wanted it to do, you might be surprised how simple it is. But that balance is what I think makes “The Avengers” special. With an ‘80s action aesthetic, smashed into a “Seven Samurai”-style ensemble flick, and the tonal foundation from “Iron Man,” I'm still surprised how a movie focusing on this many characters can make each of their arcs and introductions serve as fluid vignettes, while still working for the rest of the movie. Overall, the story wraps up nicely, and the action is exhilarating.
X-Men: Days of Future Past (Theatrical Version)
Who needs to join the MCU when you can make a Marvel movie this good without them? Still featuring the obligatory mutant chatter about equality and acceptance, this movie also branches out. There are weighty discussions about the right to choose, predestination versus free will, action versus inaction, the right of power, self-sacrifice, cautionary measures, and the consequences of these ideologies throughout.
“Days of Future Past” also doesn't really have any bad guys, just scared and confused people who don't want to be killed by the other side. Overall, with the cathartic action of “The Avengers,” and the moral intrigue of “The Dark Knight,” this movie's more than mutant and proud. “The Rogue Cut” is pretty good too, but I didn't want to put (virtually) the same movie on here twice.
Keep your eyes peeled for part four, the conclusion!
The A7 is to be closed overnight south of Selkirk all next week for roadworks.
The Edinburgh-Carlisle road will be shut at its junction with the A699 Selkirk-St Boswells route north of Hartwoodburn Farm between 8pm and 6am from next Monday, August 21, until the morning of Friday, August 25.
That series of overnight closures is to allow a £280,000 resurfacing scheme to be carried out.
A spokesman for Amey, the company carrying out the work, said: “This programme will benefit around 6,000 vehicles which use this junction each day by improving the condition of the carriageway and associated verges and reducing the need for future, more extensive maintenance.
“To allow this work to take place, there will be a full road closure at this location with a signed diversion route in operation.
“The X95 Borders Buses service will also be affected by the closure.”
While the road is shut, traffic travelling northbound will be diverted to exit the A7 at the North Bridge roundabout in Hawick and head south into Mart Streettaking the second exit onto the eastbound A698 at the roundabout next to the town's Morrisons store.
From there, traffic will join the A68 at Bonjedward, then continue in a north-westerly direction onto the A699 at St Boswells, rejoining the A7 south of Selkirk.
Southbound traffic will follow the same diversion but in the opposite direction.

MIAMI (CBSMiami) – Researchers are now testing Botox injections, typically for cosmetic use, to see if they can treat depression and social anxiety.
Army Veteran Vivian Cooke has long struggled with debilitating depression. She has tried alternative therapies and medication to cope with her symptoms.
“It wasn't effective. Some side effects would be headaches or stomachache,” said patient Vivian Cooke.
Three years ago, she tried something different after hearing about a study testing Botox to treat depression
“We don't believe it has anything to do with looks,” said Dr. Eric Finzi with the Chevy Chase Cosmetic Center.
Finzi said facial expressions are part of the circuit of the brain related to mood.
“Fear, anger, and sadness all go through this muscle so Botox basically inhibits the muscle and calms it down. So it becomes more difficult to feel those negative emotions.
The makers of Botox announced the final phase of testing for depression will begin. Dr. Finzi says previous studies show between 50 to 60 percent of patients benefit from the treatment.
“Our hope is, eventually, it will form a place as one of the tools to treat depression,” said Finzi.
The doctor is also studying whether Botox can treat social anxiety.
Vivian says she noticed a change in her depression almost immediately.
“I found, overall, my mood was better on a day-to-day basis. I had fewer problems with depression,” she said.
Even though the study Vivian took part in is over, she says she will continue to get the injections.
Botox is temporary and typically wears off after three months.
Researcher are also testing Botox to see if it can help patients with bipolar disorder.

Extreme sports riderpulled an epic move in London on Thursday. The daredevil executed a backflip jump over a 75 feet gap between two barges on London's River Thames. He only had 150 feet to accelerate before the jump and 36 feet to come to a stop before he would have fallen in the river. The last man who tried to perform a similar stunt, suffered serious injuries . You can check out Pastrana pull the move successfully below.
Pastrana is set to tour for his live European stunt show “Nitro Circus” in November and December. So it seems more stunts like this are sure to come!

A new algorithm explains how turtle ants know what to do when they lose the scent of other ants because of a broken trail.
Imagine you're a member of the Cephalotes goniodontus species, an ant with a head like Darth Vader that hangs out in tangled tree canopies in Jalisco, Mexico. You're marching along and all of a sudden you hit an abrupt end. How do you know where to go?
These ants never leave their forest canopy, moving instead through a tangle of vines, bushes, and trees along a circuit of trails that link nests and food sources. But, because the food sources come and go, nests disappear and branches break, the ants' circuit changes slightly from day to day.
For a new study, Deborah Gordon, professor of biology at Stanford University, mapped the trails and set up experiments to study how the ants responded when new food appeared or branches broke.
Along with Arjun Chandrasekhar and Saket Navlakha of the Salk Institute of Biological Studies at the University of California, San Diego, she analyzed the data to model how the ants repair and prune their trail network.
“At every node, ants could get lost if others have not been there recently enough to leave a chemical trail.”
“At every node, ants could get lost if others have not been there recently enough to leave a chemical trail,” Gordon says. “So there is an ongoing process that creates not the network with the shortest path, but the network with the fewest junctions where ants have to make a decision and could make the wrong one.
“It seems that evolution has favored keeping the ants together on the same network, rather than saving them effort in how far they have to walk.”
The ants choose which route to take at a junction by following pheromone laid by others that recently crossed that junction. Pheromones evaporate, so the path that recently had the most ants is the most attractive one. Gordon marked the ants with nail polish to find the same ants tend to go along the same trails from a nest.
So what happens if the trail gets broken? Ants use a simple plan known as “greedy search,” working around the rupture in the path by moving back to the nearest junction and choosing a new path from that point.
“Even if there is what looks to us like a neater solution available by going back a few nodes, they never use that,” Gordon says. “They always go right back to the node nearest the break and go from there to the nearest node, and so on. Because the vegetation is so tangled, they are able to find a way to the other side of the break.”
Gordon is also a member of Stanford Bio-X and the Stanford Neurosciences Institute and an affiliate of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.

The Trump administration is giving insurance companies an extra three weeks to decide whether to offer insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act markets, and how much to charge.
The extension comes as insurance companies wait for President Trump to decide whether he will continue to make payments to insurance companies that are called for under the Affordable Care Act but that some Republicans have opposed.
The payments — known as cost-sharing reduction payments — reimburse insurance companies for discounts on copayments and deductibles that they're required by law to offer to low-income customers. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the payments this year would be about $7 billion.
Trump has said he may end the reimbursements, which he calls "bailouts," and has been leaving insurers to wonder month to month about whether they will receive a check.
A White House spokesman says Trump is "working with his staff and his Cabinet to consider the issues raised by the CSR payments."
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says it is offering the extra time so insurance companies can plan ahead in case the government decides to end the payments. In a memo Friday, the agency said many states are now requiring companies to file their rates for 2018 on the assumption that they won't be reimbursed.
Several companies say that without the cost-sharing payments, their rates will see double-digit increases. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina says ending the payments would push its rates up 14.1 percent.
The HHS memo says "there have been no changes regarding HHS's ability to make cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers."
But it then says the agency intends to change the ACA's risk adjustment program to compensate for the loss of cost-sharing payments.
The changes are technical and complex, but Timothy Jost, professor emeritus at Washington & Lee University's law school, says in a Health Affairs blog that the memo just deepens the confusion.
"We still do not know if all of this is needed or not — the Trump administration has not made up its mind," he says.
The cost-sharing payments have been at the center of a political battle over the Affordable Care Act since before President Trump took office.
House Republicans opposed to the health law sued then-President Barack Obama, saying the payments were illegal because Congress hadn't appropriated money for them. A judge agreed but allowed the administration to continue making the payments during an appeal.
Now that Trump is in the White House, and Republican efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act have failed, many Republicans are urging the president to continue the payments rather than undermine the health care markets.

Ottawa Police say two Ottawa men and one Gatineau man are facing human trafficking charges in connection with two separate investigations.
Both began in July.
The first began when a young woman approached the Human Trafficking Unit with allegations.
25-year-old Madani Ba, of Gatineau, has been charged and will be in court Saturday. He's charged with Financial Trafficking in a Person by Exercising Control, Procuring a Person over 18 years, and Trafficking in Persons over 18 years by Recruiting.
The second investigation began in mid-July when one of the alleged victims was identified.
28-year-old Kyle Wilson and 24-year-old Rochelet Davilma, both of Ottawa, were arrested and charged and appeared in court in September. They are each facing charges of Financial/Material Benefit from another person's Sexual Services, Trafficking in a Person by Exercising Control, and Advertising another Person's Sexual Services.
Police believe, in both cases, there may be more victims and are asking anyone with information to come forward.
Anyone with information is asked to call the Ottawa Police Human Trafficking Unit at 613-236-1222, ext. 5005. Anonymous tips can be submitted by calling Crime Stoppers toll-free at 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS), or by downloading the Ottawa Police app.
Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) failed to respond to an invitation to a veterans event in late August and now one Massachusetts-based veterans group has it out for the lawmaker.
On August 26, Veterans Assisting Veterans are hosting a rally that they initially invited Warren to attend. The group has since revoked their previous invitation because as The Boston Herald reported, she favors illegal immigrants over improving services for veterans.
VAV spokesman John MacDonald said, “If you don't want to respond, you don't want to support, we asked you to come to our rally, our message to you is stayed home. We don't want you.” He continued “I think that really demonstrates where her heart is. To me, it's really, really frustrating, and our group is really frustrated.”
These concerns are not recent MacDonald states, as Warren has continually neglected the needs of veterans.
MacDonald made sure to clarify that VAV is in no way against immigration and is thankful for the duty that immigrants have served in America's armed forces. This group made sure to call out Warren for using immigrants for “political theater” while continuously pushing their needs aside.
Here is section of the open letter VAV published in February:
Warren finally responded to the group's letter 113 days later:
The politicians response was not taken well by the public.
The veterans “need advocates,” MacDonald expressed in August in Washington D.C.
“We shouldn't have to fight this hard,” he pleaded.

Mean Girls on Broadway has officially opened, and Tina Fey stopped by the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Friday to share our first musical glimpse of the show.
Fey wrote the play (and the 2004 movie of the same name), and her husband, Jeff Richmond, wrote the music for the show.
The soundtrack hasn't been released just yet, but Fey introduced us to the track that was performed during The Tonight Show.
"This song comes at a pivotal moment in act two, when everyone at school has basically lost their minds," Fey explains.
Barrett Wilbert Weed, who plays the role of Janis Sarkisian in the show, performed “I'd Rather be Me.”
Mean Girls is now playing daily at the August Wilson Theater in New York. The original cast recording of the show's soundtrack will be released on June 15.

Shutterstock (2)Pizza delivery guys are heroes—literally. (Ordering a Domino's pizza might have even saved this man's life!) After all, who else can you rely on to bring a deliciously fresh and mouth-wateringly greasy meal straight to your door in the wee hours of morning? But when it comes to one of the most popular pizza chains, you might want to heed a little advice from these smiling strangers, too. (Here are 13 other things your pizza guy won't tell you.)
Domino's currently offers over 25 pizza toppings, ranging from traditional pepperoni to less common items like Philly steak and mushrooms. But according to a Domino's employee in New York City, there's one topping you should never, ever order.
“Pineapple, all the way,” the employee told SheFinds. “It's on the Honolulu Hawaiian pizza and you can order it as a regular topping, but I don't know why you would do that to yourself or your family. It makes your entire pizza taste like sugar water, in my opinion.”
No surprises there. When it comes to pizza toppings, no food is more divisive than the pineapple. While one camp claims pineapple pizza is to die for, the other swears it's the worst evil to grace the top of a beloved, cheesy slice.
And if you think the pineapple adds a healthy twist to your late night meal, you might want to think again. Truth be told, throwing some pineapple onto your pie won't provide a nutritional boost. Just one slice of Honolulu Hawaiian pizza has 11 grams of fat, 250 calories, and 580 milligrams of sodium. Plus, here's how long it would take to burn off that slice of medium pizza.
Bottom line? Dieters are probably better off sticking with healthier fare. And if you choose to indulge in a guilt-free (sans-pineapple!) slice instead, no judgments here.

MIAMI (CBSMiami/CNN) — President Donald Trump last August asked several top foreign policy advisers about the possibility of invading Venezuela.
It happened during a meeting about diplomatic sanctions the US was enacting on Venezuela, a senior administration official familiar with the comments said.
Trump's aides, including then-national security adviser HR McMaster, vigorously urged him against the notion of a military invasion of Venezuela, warning him it could backfire and explaining that US allies in the region were firmly opposed to such drastic action. Taking military action against Venezuela would be a dramatic escalation of the US's so-far solely diplomatic and sanctions-focused response to the political and economic crisis roiling the South American country.
Still, the official with knowledge of Trump's private comments noted there was “no imminent plan for a military strike” and chalked the comments up to Trump thinking “out loud.”
“The President says and thinks a lot of different things,” the official said. “He just thinks out loud.”
Trump's private comments to his advisers were first reported by the Associated Press. They came a day before he said publicly — standing alongside then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley — that he was not taking “a military option” against Venezuela off the table.
Trump in the following month continued to press Latin American leaders about the possibility, including on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly when he dined with many of those leaders — all of whom said they did not want a US invasion of Venezuela.
Venezuela has been a key focus of the Trump administration's policy toward Latin America, with Trump taking numerous steps to ratchet up pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The administration has enacted numerous sanctions and issued strongly worded statements urging the Venezuelan government to allow free and fair elections to take place.
Vice President Mike Pence has also met numerous times with Venezuelan opposition leaders and has issued stinging criticisms of the Venezuelan government during his recent trips to Latin America.
Trump's comments were not the first time he has raised the possibility of military action against another country. Before the cooling of tensions with North Korea in recent months, Trump deliberated with aides about the possibility of preventive strikes against the Pyongyang regime and in January sought to order the evacuation of US military dependents in South Korea — sounding alarms among the President's top national security aides who worried North Korea might interpret the move as wartime preparations.
Just as with his discussions of military action in Venezuela, Trump's aides dissuaded him from taking such brash action.

After a filing error on a visa form, the U.S. State Department flagged a three-month-old baby for terrorism, requiring embassy officials to interview the child before clearing him. According to The Guardian, young Harvey Kenyon-Cairns was set to fly to Florida with his family but was unable to because his grandfather checked off the wrong box on Harvey's visa waiver form:
On the part of the Esta form which reads “Do you seek to engage in or have you ever engaged in terrorist activities, espionage, sabotage, or genocide?” [Paul] Kenyon ticked yes instead of no.
The elder Kenyon had no idea about his mistake and only found out about it after he grandson wasn't allowed on his flight. “I couldn't believe that they couldn't see it was a genuine mistake and that a three-month-old baby would be no harm to anyone,” he said.” Instead of Orlando, Harvey traveled from his home outside Manchester to London to interview with embassy officials in London, a round trip that took longer than the planned flight across the Atlantic.
According to the elder Kenyon, the U.S. officials did not find humor in the situation (although grandpa said that the only sabotage Harvey had ever committed was against his own diapers). The snafu ended up costing the family nearly $4,000 as a replacement visa did not arrive before their scheduled flights:
“It was a very expensive mistake, but I was hoping the US embassy would realise that it was just a simple error without us having to jump through all the hoops,” said Kenyon. He added: “If you were a terrorist, I suspect you'd not be ticking yes on the Esta form anyway.”

MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Goran Dragic and the Miami Heat got into a groove in the second half.
Big time.
Dragic scored 19 points, and the Heat pulled away from the Memphis Grizzlies for a 107-82 victory on Monday night.
Miami had seven players score in double figures in its second straight win. Josh Richardson had 17 points, and reserves Tyler Johnson and Bam Adebayo finished with 14 apiece.
The Heat shot 65 percent from the field while outscoring the Grizzlies 62-40 in the second half. They went 11 for 14 in the final period.
"In the past, we've had trouble in third quarters," Dragic said. "But now, we are figuring things out. As long as we continue to play like that, we're going to win a lot of games."
Memphis lost for the 15th time in 16 games. Marc Gasol scored 19 points on 5-for-14 shooting and Andrew Harrison had 16.
"We've got to find solutions somehow," Gasol said, adding that the tough defense that was part of Memphis' reputation for years is not part of the team's mentality. "We always had a mindset here where we can have a tough night offensively, but if we don't score, you don't score."
That certainly wasn't the case Monday night.
The Heat carried a 70-60 lead into the fourth quarter and kept up the pressure in the final period. Johnson scored five straight points to run the advantage out to 18, and the lead ballooned to 27 in the closing minute.
"The effort wasn't there," Memphis interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. "To a man, the responsibility that we have to our teammates, to the organization, to the fans, we didn't give the fans what they deserve. We didn't give the organization what they deserve, and, we didn't give one another what we deserve."
TIP-INS
Heat: C Hassan Whiteside missed his sixth straight game with a left knee injury. ... Miami did not register a second-chance point and grabbed only two offensive rebounds. ... Miami's 56.1 percent shooting for the game was a season high for a Memphis opponent. ... Richardson was 3 of 4 from outside the arc.
Grizzlies: G Tyreke Evans had 11 points on 5-for-17 shooting in his 500th career game. ... Memphis is winless in nine games against the Eastern Conference. ... Memphis went 18 for 27 at the free-throw line. ... Memphis is 1-14 since starting PG Mike Conley was shelved by left Achilles problems. ... Harrison's 16 points were a season high.
FOR FIZZ
It was Miami's first trip to FedExForum since Memphis fired former Heat assistant David Fizdale as head coach last month. Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said he had lunch with his former assistant earlier in the day.
"I still feel for Fizz, and what he, unfortunately, had to go through here. That's my brother, and you want him to have a fair shot at it," Spoelstra said, adding: "He's going to get another opportunity."
BAM IMPACT
When Miami center Kelly Olynyk got into foul trouble, Adebayo stepped up. Adebayo, a rookie out of Kentucky, was 5 for 6 from the field and also contributed four rebounds and two blocked shots.
"He really used his technique, energy, multiple efforts and mental stability to be in a lot of places that were pretty disruptive," Spoelstra said.
Olynyk added: "There are plays in practice all the time where you're like: 'Man, this guy's a freak. Where did that even come from?' And he's starting to string more of those plays together every day."
FINAL WORD
Regarding the Grizzlies talking with each other about the overall problems, Gasol said: "I don't think talk does much. It's doing. I always believe that talk is great, and we're going to say the right things, and we can sit down and sing 'Kumbaya,' but it's more about grabbing it and taking ownership of the things we have to do."

OAKLAND — For four straight years, the NBA Finals have featured the Warriors and the Cavaliers.
And Guillermo.
“Four years in a row,” confirmed the affable sidekick from Jimmy Kimmel Live!
Guillermo Rodriguez, 47, was back at Oracle Arena for NBA Finals media day on Wednesday, accompanied by a team of handlers, producers and cameramen, interviewing players and lending his quirky approach to the proceedings.
He showed up wearing a cast on his right arm, which he asked players to sign.
“Is it real?” a TV reporter asked him.
“Yes, it's real. Touch it right there,” he suggested, before yelping, “Ow!”
The cast was real, the injury was not. In fact, Guillermo pulled the cast off and coaxed Warriors rookie forward Jordan Bell into sliding it on his right arm.
Bell, sensitive to causing panic about the state of his health, quickly yanked it off.
Guillermo was feeling good about his relationship with the players after securing an interview with LeBron James at the NBA All-Star Game.
“Everybody loves me,” he said. “LeBron loves me.”

DDMFB vows to support entrepreneurs
Chairman of Davo Dani Microfinance Bank Limited, Austin Enajemo-Isire, has said the Federal Government must be focused and sustain its policies to strengthen the Small and Medium scale Enterprises (SMEs) in the country.
This will boost the country's economy and tackle the challenges faced by the over 17 million entrepreneurs, who must be encouraged to add meaningfully to the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) which has been crippled by revenue shortfall.
Speaking in Lagos on Monday at the unveiling of a new branch of the bank, Enajemo-Isire said government has realised the need to provide the necessary support to entrepreneurs, noting that this could only become practical if policies are sustained.
He lauded government's commitment to tackle the gap in financial inclusion, particularly for SMEs, stressing, “I wish that the will power to drive through this policy is being firmly held to realise the full objective.”
Lamenting that very few SMEs have financial freedom, the chairman argued that the sector needs to embrace the services of microfinance banks to gain financial freedom.
He said the firm is focused on aligning its services with the policy of the government to ensure that government achieves its promises on financial inclusion.
Enajemo-Isire, who was the Managing Director of Standard Alliance Life Insurance for over 13 years, also said the bank has concluded plan to tap into the financial options provided by the Bank of Industry (BoI) and the Centre Bank of Nigeria (CBN), to increase its lending capacity.
The chairman added that a well articulated credit appraisal system has been put in place by the bank to ensure its portfolio at risk continue to perform.
The Managing Director of the bank, Odey Ndoma, said the organisation would not retreat on product innovation and customer focused services.
Ndoma said the bank already has about 20,000 customers and currently making efforts to upgrade its operational profile to reach more entrepreneurs.
He vowed that the financial institution would continue to support entrepreneurs, disclosing that the bank prioritised the need to perform exceptionally to distinguish itself.
Opiant Pharmaceuticals Inc. surged the most since December after President Donald Trump said drug companies would provide free Narcan, a product used to help combat overdoses, to schools in an attempt to fight the opioid crisis.
Opiant makes Narcan and licenses it to Adapt Pharma Inc., which won praise from Trump during a speech at a community college in Manchester, New Hampshire.
Trump invited an Adapt executive to join him on stage and discuss the charitable program. Santa Monica, California-based Opiant jumped 28 percent to $26.34 at the close in New York. The company's market value was $42.7 million as of March 16.
Complaint against Good Hope/ Pomona NDC
Dear Editor,
A shaky coconut tree trunk with the top portion already blown off in my neighbour's yard remains ever so much risky to fall and damage my property at Aurora Village in Region 2. But what is even more worrying is that the owner has refused to cut it down and the Government agencies in the district are refusing to take the appropriate action in keeping with their responsibility to provide a service to the community.
The imminent collapse will inevitably put me in unnecessary expenses to effect repairs when with the proper step could be taken. This could well have been avoided as a stitch in time saves nine. It is beyond my understanding for the negative response being shown by the Public Health Department and the Good Hope/Pomona Neighbourhood Democratic Council in failing to do their job in a proper manner not as a favour but in the line of their duty.
Both of these bodies are under obligation to deal with my predicament but their functions turned out to be non-existent and impotent so what are they paid to do? For several months approaches were made to deal with my complaint with only promises being made with no action which is unreasonable and unacceptable. Can someone advise me as to what can be done now?

The average Brit considers themselves to be 79 percent good – and 21 percent bad, according to a new study.
Researchers took an in depth look into how the nation sees themselves - with some surprising results.
According to the data most of us (45 percent) claim we would do anything for anyone, while a further 28 percent would consider themselves to be a “good egg”.
However, behind the smiles and the niceties, 90 percent of us claim to have a dark side – with the average Brit owning up to doing something bad six times in the last 12 months.
Saying something spiteful to hurt someone else (25 percent), sharing a secret had promised you'd keep to yourself (22 percent) and kissing someone you shouldn't make Brits naughty list.
One in twenty (5 percent) even admitted to having an extra marital affair and 16 percent have sworn at a stranger in the street after a minor disagreement.
The ‘good v bad' study, which was carried out by online casino playojo.com also revealed women claim they are more likely to have a dark side than men (61 percent).
In fact, a sinister one in ten (11 percent) of the 1,500 adults polled said they have a dark side that no one knows about.
Yesterday a spokesperson for playojo.com casino said: “On the whole the research shows most people consider themselves to be good person - but we all have a tendency to go off piste from time to time.
“The research highlighted that most people are aware of their weaknesses whether that be telling a few fibs, losing our temper or snooping at something we shouldn't.
“No one can be perfect all the time and we are all capable of behaving badly when tired, stressed or under pressure.
“We realised there was a level of distrust among players in the online casino industry and we pledged to give them a more rewarding and fairer alternative.
“At PlayOJO.com we've re-written the rules for online gaming – We give players back control of their money with no sneaky terms and conditions in the small print. We don't have wagering requirements and we give money back on every bet, win or lose. In fact, we're not bad for an online casino.”
To keep our dark side in check more than two thirds (67 percent) of the population felt they need the occasional chance to misbehave.
And nearly two thirds (64 percent) of respondents said they find people who are ‘holier than thou' a bit boring and felt it was good to have an edgier side.
High stress levels and a bad temper were the most common weaknesses of those polled with a quarter complaining that money was their Achilles heel.
Telling lies, the opposite sex and alcohol were also listed as common character flaws the survey found.
A quarter of the adults polled (24 percent) said they have suffered life changing consequences as a result of being badly behaved and 39 percent said they often felt guilty after getting up to something they shouldn't.
Nearly half of Brits said they often come across as sweetness and light but harbour vicious thoughts about people they dislike.
BRITS MOST COMMON MISDEMEANOURS….
1. Lied about how much money you have spent
2. Said something spiteful to someone
3. Told a secret you said you would keep quiet
4. Lied about your whereabouts

NEW YORK — AOL Instant Messenger is about to put up an away message forever.
AIM will officially shut down on December 15 after 20 years in service, its parent company announced Friday. The news marks the end of an era for anyone who came of age with the internet in the late 90s and early 2000s.
When AIM launched in 1997, using the World Wide Web required a desktop computer with a clunky dial-up connection that tied up the phone lines. Perhaps more than any other product, AIM helped establish the internet as a place to hang out rather than being a simple utility.
AIM offered a platform for people to express themselves with embarrassing screen names, profiles filled with colorful fonts and emotional lyrics, and as many messages as you could send before someone in your house kicked you offline.
The product earned a coveted spot in pop culture, making cameos in You've Got Mail and Sex and the City.
But the service that defined the internet for a generation of users failed to evolve with them.
A decade after AIM launched, Apple kicked off the smartphone era with the release of the original iPhone. Untethered from their computers, internet users shifted to a range of messaging apps and social networks like Facebook and Twitter.
AIM, with a brand recognized by millions, could have capitalized on this shift and emerged as a lead player in the billion-dollar messaging space. Instead, it faded further and further from relevance.
Oath, the company created earlier this year from Verizon's merging of AOL and Yahoo, acknowledged this unfortunate fact in its announcement Friday of AIM's shutdown.
“AIM tapped into new digital technologies and ignited a cultural shift, but the way in which we communicate with each other has profoundly changed,” Michael Albers, VP of communications product at Oath, wrote in a blog post.
Case in point: The announcement of AIM's shutdown was made on Twitter and Tumblr, two of the newer communications platforms that helped displace it.
Eulogies poured in for AIM on Twitter, with users remembering old screen names and lamenting the passage of time. As one user put it, “I can't decide which John Mayer song I should quote to express my sadness at the death of AOL Instant Messenger.”
Farewell, AIM. We hope that somehow you'll ~BrB~.
The Lagos State Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources, Mr Wale Oluwo says the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) has no business operating in the downstream oil sector.
Oluwo said this while speaking at a Breakfast Business Lecture organised by the Island Club in Lagos tagged: “Petroleum Industry Bill: Challenges and Opportunities''.
The commissioner, who was the chief host, said that the agency has no business regulating the price of petroleum products.
He said the issue of regulating the downstream sector would be addressed by the recently passed Petroleum Industry Governance Bill (PIGB) by the Senate.
He said the Federal Government has been regulating the price so that the rich would take advantage of the masses which he said was not correct.
“If you must regulate the price, you must ensure that you have a very deep pocket to subsidise these products.
“If you do not have deep pocket, the market will help you by creating a black market that sets a price that suits itself.
“I don't belong to the school of thought that says prices that go up will not come down.
“Prices do come down as long as there is competition. I like the PIGB and we would like to see more reforms in oil and gas.
“It is in Nigeria that I see products and commodities that are characterised by inelastic demand and for which we cannot have close substitutes to be subsidised by the government,” he said.
Oluwo said that these are markets and products which the private sector should be pursuing and falling over themselves.
“So our problem is structural and we must continue to handle it from the structural correction perspectives.
“In Nigeria, we subsidise all commodities including electricity, gas, petrol, interest rates, foreign exchange, etc,” Oluwo said.
The commissioner, however, congratulated the Island Club for the business meeting and argued that Lagos State Government would take advantage of the rare oil discovery in Dahomey basin as against the usual Niger-Delta.

NEW YORK (AP) — The CEO of the nation's third largest pharmaceutical company is resigning from the President's American Manufacturing Council citing “a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.”
President Donald Trump lashed out almost immediately Monday at Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier on Twitter, saying Frazier “will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!”
Frazier's resignation comes shortly after a violent confrontation between white supremacists and protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one person dead and 19 injured.
Frazier said in a tweet on Monday that the country's leaders must “honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy.”
Trump is being criticized for not explicitly condemning the white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville.
Individual qualifying for the second day of state is also on the line.
“They're throwing the biggest, baddest skills they can to be one of the top four in each event,” DL head coach Steve Zamzo said. “They're to the point where their skills are what they are. They've proven all season long that they're one of the top teams. You don't get those big scores without big skills. They're working on things to get bigger.”
A dozen gymnasts make up the section roster including Peyton Jernberg, Justine Lawrence, Alexis Ostlie, Emily Smith and quad-captain Johanna Jernberg.
Senior captain Mathia Olds, who suffered a recent ligament injury in her arm, will miss the section meet.
Emma Disse recently returned to practice after missing three weeks with a knee injury. She will likely compete, but is still in a wait-and-see mode this final week of practice.
“I'm just starting to practice fully; this week it's day by day,” said Disse.
The Lakers have dealt with injuries all season and over the course of winning back-to-back state titles. This year's lineup looked different nearly every meet but did not deter the team from continuing pursuit of the school scoring record.
“We have so much depth and we still got the 151s without our full team,” said sophomore Lexi Yliniemi.
The school record is 151.775 and the Lakers have been within decimal points of it multiple times. That isn't the only record in sight.
“We really want to break the state record; it's easy to think about sections because we just have to think sections first, then state,” Yliniemi said.
Topping their own school mark at state will also garner the Class A team scoring record of 150.400, set by Perham in 2005. DL finished 0.175 points off the mark last year in Minneapolis.
First things first and that's to win Saturday in Perham and the formula for success was found early in the year.
“One of our biggest things is the team,” said senior captain Leah Chavez. “That was one of our problems early in the year; we would think more individually than as a team. Once we started focusing on the bigger picture; we had to think of it as one unit. When we do that we perform much better.”
The varsity was undefeated this year and hasn't lost a meet since winning the section for the first time in Perham in 2014. There were two narrow victories this year that helped push the team to new levels.
“A few of the meets this season were really close and sometimes we felt like we didn't deserve to win a meet, at least twice this season,” said Chavez. “They were really close calls. Just because we've won two state titles doesn't mean we have to stop working. Getting that close to another team really helped push ourselves and be like, we really need to start buckling down.”
Chavez has responded from an early season injury that caused her to miss the first three meets of the year, but has been healthy down the stretch.
So has the fourth captain and 2015 state all-around champion Molly Lyngaas, who has led the team on bars this year in the only event she can compete in due to a pair of foot injuries that caused her to miss all of last year. Getting a shot at returning to state after her comeback is a big deal for the former champ.
“This is the most I've been excited,” she said. “I just want to do the best for my team at sections and see where it goes from there.”
Lyngaas will return to Minneapolis with more than just state meet history, she has big time life experience to back that up.
“I learned a lot through this whole experience,” said Lyngaas. “Being patient and being able to push through things. Before, when I had a bad day in the gym it was hard for me to push through that kind of thing. This taught me, definitely, how to push through if something doesn't go my way.”
The likely duo of sophomore Cora Okeson and freshman Jackson Hegg are expected to compete in the all-around at sections. Both proved they can finish atop the podium multiple times this season.
Okeson and Disse have top spots at state to defend, as well.
Okeson was last year's silver all-around medalist. Disse is hoping to get back to top form to defend her state floor exercise individual title.
“Sections is the number one goal for right now,” she said. “If I get farther than that, I definitely want to get back up there.”
The Laker junior has a lot of personality that she used with a nearly flawless routine to win last year.
“It's all about showing it off,” Disse said.
She also knows what it takes to get the opportunity.
“It's one routine at a time,” she said. “One routine, one vault at a time and the energy builds up and momentum keeps flowing. That's what keeps us going. Everyone is focusing on what they have to do. As long as everyone does their job, we'll get to where we need to be.”
Yliniemi also has the chops to win an individual title but was hampered by an ankle injury at state in 2016. Up and down the Laker lineup are threats to the top of the podium.
“I have a lot more confidence going in this year,” Yliniemi said. “We just have to compete how we do in practice.”
Peyton Jernberg, another sophomore, placed on vault and floor at state last year. Lawrence provided key numbers at state team. Anyone from the 12 rostered gymnasts can be the key to repeating.
“You're comfortable with it; it's not new,” said Zamzo. “You get nervous because there's a lot at stake. Still, there is that comfort. The team is a big thing. These girls work well together and are very sisterly-like where they care about each other.”
DL will send five gymnasts to each event Saturday, Feb. 18 at Prairie Wind Middle School in Perham. The top four scores will be used for team calculation and the top four overall scores in all-around and each apparatus qualify for state.
“Obviously, the individual is important, but it's team first,” Chavez said.
The Section 8A championships are scheduled to begin at 12:45 p.m. with the march of teams and anthem. Competition begins at 1 p.m.

Image copyright Atari Games Image caption The console is designed to share some of the original aesthetics of the seventies style
It's the latest attempt to cash in on gamers' nostalgia - a throwback console that promises "100+" classic games built in, with new online play.
Pre-orders for the Atari VCS went into overdrive on Wednesday, with a campaign on crowdfunding site Indiegogo raising more than $2m (£1.5m).
That's well in excess of the $100,000 the company was aiming for, and a remarkable endorsement of the long-lasting appeal of the Atari brand.
Now all the company has to do is deliver on its promises. That may not be straightforward, as attempts to build retro game consoles have had mixed results.
On the one hand, you have Nintendo. Once it launched its classic SNES, it took just over three months to shift more than four million units (two of which went to a mother I met a few days before Christmas in a store near where I live in Oakland. She hugged the attendant when he came back with extra stock, repeating "thank you, thank you" over and over.)
But on the other, there's the Sinclair ZX Vega+. It raised £512,790 and was meant to be released in 2016, but is still yet to see the light of day.
Indiegogo has threatened to use third-party debt collectors to recoup backers' money if the product isn't released by the end of this month. The company behind the project Retro Computers Ltd, blamed hardware issues and a legal dispute for the repeated delay.
'Weakness for nostalgia'
The Atari VCS is a more ambitious effort, promising not only retro gaming but new titles and other entertainment features. According to a promotional video, the console will also offer a voice assistant.
But its primary selling point will be the chance to play some of the games that paved the way to the multi-billion dollar games industry we know today.
"Despite the stereotype, gamers aren't all kids playing Fortnite instead of doing their homework," said Rachel Weber, senior editor at GamesRadar+.
"They're adults with serious disposable income and a weakness for nostalgia. Nintendo already proved there's a demand for an easy way to play older games with the NES and SNES Classic Editions, so it's no surprise that Atari wants to cash in too."
The console made a brief appearance at last year's Games Developers Conference - but attendees were only able to look at the console, not play it.
But thousands of backers have decided to put trust in the team to hit their target of shipping the product by May 2019.
"While turning to Indiegogo might feel like a risk, it's actually a smart move for a company with such a recognisable brand," Ms Weber said.
"Canny creators can use it to generate awareness and build a community - which I suspect is what Atari is doing with the VCS, the funding is just a perk.
"Atari has avoided the pitfalls of asking too much, or promising more than they can deliver. The campaign has already smashed its target, so demand isn't a problem, but whether or not the machine is anything other than a novelty has yet to be seen."

The club captain has seen manager Antonio Conte prefer other options in his three-man backline this season, restricting the chances for the veteran centre-back to play.
And Terry, who has made 578 appearances for the club to sit third in the list of Chelsea's all-time appearance makers, is calling time on his Chelsea career this summer, though he is determined at present to focus on helping the Blues be successful.
Terry said via Chelsea's official site: "After 22 years there is so much to say and so many people to thank at this great football club.
" From coaches, team-mates and staff to the fans who have given me so much support down the years, I can't thank you enough. There will be opportunities for me to speak further about this over the coming weeks", he continued .
"I will decide on my future in due course, but for now I am committed to helping the team achieve success this season."
Terry has made just five Premier League appearances for the Blues this season and is out of contract in the summer.
He has made three appearances in the FA Cup and will hope to play his part in the Blues winning the competition.
A former England captain, the 36-year-old is likely to receive lucrative proposals to continue his career elsewhere, however it remains to be seen whether he will remain in the Premier League or move abroad.

So is it too early to wonder where the Pete Shinnick and Judy Bense statues will land at the beautiful and buzzing University of West Florida campus?
I figure Coach Shinnick's statue would go outside the football stadium being built on campus. Maybe a statue of him arranging building blocks with all of his players' numbers on them. After all, he did build a championship team from scratch.
And for former UWF President Judy Bense, who shepherded the advent of UWF football, maybe a statue of her outside the school's archaeology institute, looking toward the football stadium with a hand over her brow like she's Lewis and Clark looking West at the great unknown.
(I'm sure Bense and Shinnick hate the idea; especially easy-going Shinnick who is only 52, despite already securing his legacy in the annals of Pensacola sports history.)
More: Bense broke the mold as UWF president
Don't take it from me. Take it from Pensacola News Journal sports writer Bill Vilona, a member of the Pensacola Sports Hall of Fame and one of the most respected sports reporters — broadcast or print — in the city's history.
Bill recently wrote: "... this once non-existent program, a non-starter of an idea until three years ago, has produced one of the most captivating sports feats in Pensacola history. Maybe the greatest."
"Maybe the greatest" moment in sports history. And the UWF Argonaut football team can eclipse that moment this Saturday when the young team — a lot of sophomores — plays for the NCAA Division II National Championship against Texas A&M-Commerce in Kansas City, Kansas.
Sure, there are so many great sports stories in Pensacola's past, from Roy Jones to Emmitt Smith to Justin Gatlin to national and state championship high school teams.
But this is college football. In the South.
And UWF is our school. It's where many of us studied, partied and started our adult lives. Me, I was a journalism student at UWF, honing my craft at the school paper, The Voyager. There was nothing like this then. We could have never dreamed that someday we would have a football team like real schools, much less a team that would be playing on national television for a national championship.
With Roy, Emmitt and Justin, our only option was the television — often just in sports news highlights.
We're closer — in proximity — to the Argos.
More: Judy Bense named UWF president emeritus by trustees
We get to watch them live, in person, during home games. Now, we watch them in the middle of Pensacola playing at the beautiful Community Maritime Park on Pensacola Bay — the location is a recruiting tool on its own. In a few years, we'll watch them at the new stadium at the lush, rolling campus.
Yes, UWF has already built its football legend before its built its stadium. How wonderfully warped is that?
Bense is retired and a local treasure — even without the football resume.
Shinnick? Well, wouldn't it be great if he was at UWF forever? Could happen, but let's be honest. Other programs will be salivating for a still-young coach who can build championship teams in a jiffy from scratch. Can you blame them?
No, it's not too early to start talking about statues. It's not even too early for a national championship.
Everyone's saying that even making the playoffs for the 2-year-old team is gravy. Our Argos might as well go for the mashed potatoes and meatloaf while they're at it. They're already at the head table.
Go Argos!
(And if the Mardi Gras folks are looking for grand marshals for any parades, I nominate the UWF football team.)

China Premier Li Keqiang's aim to eliminate import taxes on cancer drugs and significantly lower those for other medicines may provide a boon for global drugmakers looking to the world's second-biggest pharmaceutical market for growth.
“For hot-selling consumer products in the market, including medicine, especially anti-cancer drugs urgently needed by the people, we will lower import tariffs to a relatively large extent, and work hard to reach zero tariff for anti-cancer drugs,” Li said Tuesday at a press conference at the close of the annual National People's Congress in Beijing.
The initiative on drug tariffs was part of a broader pledge by Li to further open the economy, including the manufacturing sector. The message comes as Chinese leaders prepare for further deterioration in trade relations with Donald Trump's White House. The U.S. plans to impose tariffs worth as much as $60 billion on Chinese products as early as this week, Bloomberg has reported.

A further easing of taxes on medicines should benefit companies from New York-based Pfizer Inc. to the U.K.'s GlaxoSmithKline Plc, as well as Chinese drugmakers. Pharmaceutical companies climbed in Hong Kong after Li spoke. The MSCI China health-care index touched the highest level since 2005, led by a 15 percent gain by CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Ltd.
The move continues efforts to follow President Xi Jinping's call to meet citizens' demands for improved living standards and better quality products in the world's largest consumer market. In November, China announced import tax reductions for a range of medicines, including various antibiotics and insulin products, to 2 percent from as much as 6 percent.
China's medical imports stood at $28.7 billion in 2017, according to the General Administration of Customs. The country's pharmaceutical market is second only to the U.S. in size, and its medical expenditure is expected to grow as much as 8 percent a year to $170 billion in 2021, according to researcher QuintilesIMS.
"There's no doubt that this measure by the State Council will further lower the economic burden of Chinese cancer patients, and help increase their access to innovative drugs," said Kang Wei, managing director of R&D-Based Pharmaceutical Association Committee, an industry group representing foreign drug companies in China.

Denholm's annual fair, held on the village green on Saturday, was a scorcher of a success, according to its organisers.
After last year's washout weather, Saturday's sunshine, helped to boost visitor numbers and ensure the green was packed all day.
The event included performances by Hawick Scout Pipe Band and was a chance for local groups to raise money by hosting stalls and games.
Youngsters also enjoyed face-painting, a dog show, fancy-dress contest, visit from the Rulewater alpacas and football tournament.
One of the organisers, Gwen Crew, said: “The weather helped to make it a very successful day. The car boot drew people in in the morning, and the various events in the afternoon were very successful.
“It was a day for all ages, with everything from families to pensioners all enjoying the barbecue or the afternoon teas in the church.
“The fun dog show, held for the first time this year, was just hilarious. It was really well supported.”
The annual fair used to be a sideshow for the village bogie race, axed for health and safety reasons, but is now a standalone event.
Gwen added: “It was a good day and obviously it supports a lot of the charities in the village as well as the community council, primary school, playgroup and church.
“It was a super community event with lots of locals and visitors alike joining in.”

Medal of Honor recipient humbled by appreciation in Illinois
hello
SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- A Medal of Honor recipient says he's humbled by the appreciation he's been shown by the people in Illinois.
The State Journal-Register reports 71-year-old James McCloughan (mih-KLOO'-uhn) of South Haven, Michigan was the keynote speaker during the main program of the Veterans and Gold Star Family Day Event at the Illinois State Fair on Sunday.
McCloughan, who was accompanied on stage by Gov. Bruce Rauner and Springfield Mayor Jim Langfelder, called all of the veterans and current service members his heroes.
McCloughan received the Medal of Honor from President Donald Trump at the White House on July 31. He's the first Medal of Honor recipient under Trump.
McCloughan, a combat medic, is credited with saving the lives of 10 members of his company during a Vietnam War battle despite his own serious wounds.

Ever since, Prabhas starrer Baahubali 2 has thrashed all the records of Hindi movies, it has become one hot topic of discussion, whether there will be any other movie that can break the record of Baahubali 2!
When it comes to Bollywood movies, we can expect record breaking numbers only from three stars i.e., Aamir, Salman & Shahrukh Khan.
Recently, in an interview with DNA, Salman took a sly dig at Prabhas' fans and revealed by it's difficult for Bollywood movies to achieve that number!
Salman Reveals The Main Reason Behind Baahubali Success "I will tell you why numbers have become such a big thing. The most amazing thing about Baahubali's success is that the Hindi audiences are so accepting."
'South Audience Know Us, Yet Our Films Don't Do Well' "They have made a Telugu film so large, even though they do not know south heroes apart from three or four of them.
South audiences know us there; yet, our films do not do that volume of business because their fans have an extraordinary sense of loyalty to their actors."
'Fan Following Is Very Strong' "Fan following is very strong - if there is a Kamal Haasan fan, then he will be a Kamal fan forever; Rajinikanth fan will be a Rajinikanth fan for life."
You've To Agree With Salman! "We have piracy here; one should try indulging in piracy there, fan clubs wouldn't allow it. Whether a politician or the underworld does it, they don't give a damn; they will fight it."
Salman In Awe Of Hindi Audience "Hats off to the Hindi audiences. They love movies, and go and watch English, Chinese, and south films."
Salman Boasts His Fans "A Salman Khan fan will also watch an Aamir Khan film and a Shahrukh Khan film. And, if the film is good, they will appreciate it."
Despite Being A Superstar, Does Competition Keep Salman On His Toes? "I keep myself on the toes all the time. It is not about competition, it is about you competing with yourself."
Salman's Thought On Film Collection Is On Point! "Even when you talk about collections, it is your collections and has nothing to do with anybody else."
'One Should Not Put Anyone Down' "I believe one should never put anyone else down but try and raise their own level."
How Sweet! "Once you do that, others will also raise their own levels. Some people put others down, do negative publicity. I do not feel the need to do that. I have not learnt this from my seniors."
On the work front, Salman Khan is all set for the mega-release of his forthcoming film, Tubelight (June 25, 2017).

If only Snap CEO Evan Spiegel's alleged words about the app being "only for rich people" could disappear just like all of those Snapchats being sent.
The recently unsealed contents of a lawsuit brought by a former employee have angered Snapchat users in India, after it was alleged Spiegel, the world's youngest self-made billionaire, said he did not want to "expand into poor countries like India."

"This is ridiculous," fired back a spokesperson for Snap on Monday. "Obviously Snapchat is for everyone! It's available worldwide to download for free. Those words were written by a disgruntled former employee. We are grateful for our Snapchat community in India and around the world."
The remarks were contained in a complaint filed in January by Anthony Pompliano, a former employee of Snap, who is suing the now-public company for attempting to "destroy his career and reputation."

Pompliano's lawsuit also includes allegations Snap inflated its user metrics and that Spiegel's alleged comments about not wanting to go to India were made when he suggested exploring new markets.
"Snap did not give investors misstated user metrics back in 2015; nor did Snap employees commit any of the panoply of alleged bad acts that litter Pompliano's complaint. Snap will demonstrate as much at the appropriate time in the appropriate forum," the company said in the unsealed complaint.
Snap has also been hitting back on Twitter, retweeting some users who are supporting the company. "Ppl outraged over ONE claim with no proof?" one person wrote.
Other users took to Twitter to air their distaste.
Vattenfall has won the right to build the up to 750MW Hollandse Kust Zuid 1&2 offshore wind farm in the Netherlands on a subsidy-free basis.
The Swedish company beat rivals including Innogy and Statoil to develop the project due online in 2022-23.
Dutch Economic Affairs and Climate Minister Eric Wiebes said: “Thanks to drastically lower costs, offshore wind farms are now being constructed without subsidy.
“This allows us to keep the energy transition affordable. Innovation and competition are making sustainable energy cheaper and cheaper, and much faster than expected too.”
Bids were submitted on 21 December with officials judging submissions on a range of quantitative and qualitative criteria including completion time, output and risk management.
The construction of the 700MW to 750MW wind farm is expected to involve an investment of more than €1.5bn.
Industry sources said the project could feature next-generation offshore turbines such as GE's 12MW Haliade-X officially launched earlier this month.
Under the terms of the concession, Vattenfall is allowed to build turbines with a maximum tip height of 300 metres and rotor diameter of 250 metres.
Vattenfall said it will now make final preparations for Hollandse Kust Zuid 1&2 including the design of the wind farm. It will also finalise the tender process for major components.
"“Winning the bid for Hollandse Kust Zuid is a result of our continuous cost reduction efforts along our entire value chain and the solid track record and portfolio approach of our company," said Vattenfall wind head Gunnar Groebler.
"We are very happy to enlarge our contribution in making the Dutch energy system more sustainable and support our customers, large and small, on their way to become climate smarter," he added.

Hill presented the latest news about the construction of the new Empower Me Center on South Hartmann Drive, which is planned to include more than 37,000 square feet.
Empower Me started 18 years ago as a summer-focused camp serving children and young adults with special needs and their families, but future plans include year-long activities and events, as well as resident cottages for young adults and indoor and outdoor recreation areas specifically designed for young people with disabilities.
According to Hill, the nonprofit organization has served more than 10,000 children in the past, and there are participants from three states and Tennessee counties.
“We are always seeking ways to encourage gardening in our local community,” said Adams, “no matter whether it is the residential home garden, commercial areas, school campuses or a facility such as Empower Me Center, which will bring people into gardening and learning about plants and the environment who otherwise might not have that opportunity.”
Hill said the goal of the Empower Me Center is to first, help the children whose special medical and behavioral needs prevent them from access to other facilities and to have year-round activities.
“We want to meet … each child's physical, mental and emotional needs,” she said, as she described several of the children and young adults who have continued to return to Empower Me each year.
Some of the disabilities that prevent the young people from attending other day camps or enjoying sports and other activities are cancer, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, post traumatic stress disorder from physical or emotional abuse, microcephaly, schizophrenia and many others.
Empower Me employs occupational and physical therapists, speech language pathologists, special education teachers, social workers, nurses and college students preparing for a career in these fields, so that each young attendee has personal attention and is encouraged to be as independent as possible.
For more information on Empower Me and its future or to volunteer, visit empowermecenter.com, call 615-453-0005 or email empowermedaycamp@aol.com.
The Year-Round Garden Club is a nonprofit organization, and its goals are education and increased public awareness of the benefits of gardening and protection of the environment, as well as the botanical arts. It is a member of the National Federation of Garden Clubs.

DuPage Democrats opposing proposed merger of county offices
hello
Legislation is being considered in Springfield to pave the way for the DuPage County Election Commission to merge with the county clerk's office.
But DuPage Democrats who have floated the idea of returning election oversight power to the county clerk say they're opposing the state measure because they believe it's flawed.
State Sen. Don Harmon, an Oak Park Democrat, last week introduced the proposed state law that would give any county board the authority to create a five-member board of election commissioners within the county clerk's office.
If the legislation is approved, the election commission in DuPage would become a division of the clerk's office by the end of the year.
"We're working to support this bill in Springfield," county board Chairman Dan Cronin said Tuesday. "We hope for a swift passage so we may continue down the path of streamlined, efficient local government providing taxpayers savings and better services as we combine these two offices into one."
The move comes decades after election oversight was stripped from the clerk's office to create the election commission. Another state law is needed now because officials want to keep the bipartisan oversight of elections.
The 1973 state law that formed DuPage's election commission required both political parties be represented on the three-person election commission board. Republicans hold two of the three seats.
County Clerk Paul Hinds, who is a Republican, has said he doesn't want DuPage to go back to a system where the county clerk is the sole election authority.
But Robert Peickert, the DuPage Democratic Party chairman, says he's concerned about increasing the election commission board to five members because Cronin, a Republican, still would have the power to appoint four of them.
The county clerk would be the fifth member and serve as the panel's chairman.
"To be truly bipartisan, the (county board) chairman must appoint Democratic members recommended by the Democratic Party of DuPage County," Peickert wrote in a Feb. 8 letter to Democratic state senators and representatives. He is asking Democratic state lawmakers to vote against the legislation.
But county board member John Curran said the proposed legislation would require a county board chairman to seek the advice and consent of the county board for the appointments. Right now, Cronin doesn't need county board approval to appoint election commissioners.
While elected Democrats and Republican officials would be consulted, Curran stressed that county board members are the democratically elected representatives of DuPage's residents. He said those board members -- not the political parties -- should have the final say on who is appointed.
Another concern Democrats have with the state measure is that it doesn't cap how much commissioners are paid. Currently, DuPage's three election commissioners receive $27,500 a year.
Jean Kaczmarek, who for years has called for the commission to merge with the clerk's office, said the legislation includes a provision that lets existing commissioners keep their salaries for the duration of their terms.
Meanwhile, DuPage is opposing another proposed state law that would eliminate the commissioners' salaries.
Kaczmarek argues that the salary of the commissioners should be cut.
"You had the opportunity to create a bill which eased divisiveness and gained respect," Kaczmarek said to county board members on Tuesday. "You missed it."
Cronin said the state measure would give county board members the authority to set the salary. If it's approved, he said the pay will be reduced.
Overall, he said the proposed merger is expected to save taxpayers at least $300,000.
"This is about saving money and consolidation," Cronin said. "People are losing sight of the big picture here."
As I discussed in my recent best gifts for cats post, it takes a certain kind of pet obsessive to buy their pet a Valentine's Day present.
We already know that people go in for buying their pets a Christmas gift, with 74 percent of owners saying they would — including 59 percent who said their dog would get their own stocking. It just seems wrong to leave them out of the festive giving season. They're part of the family, too.
But Valentine's Day? Apparently so. I discussed this with my contact over at Barkly Pets the other day and she said she read that fully 20 percent of U.S. consumers (that's everyone, not just pet owners) would buy a Valentine's Day gift for a pet. Business Insider seems to back this up, as well.
Being a dog owner myself, I'll take just about any excuse to buy my three knuckleheads something to chew on, play with, or destroy for their joy and amusement. As it is, I might just pick something up randomly at the pet store, anyway, so buying a little something on Valentine's Day really doesn't seem all that absurd.
What should I get my dog for Valentine's Day?
The way I look at it, there are essentially two categories here. Category one: Something simple and just fun. Toys, treats (especially ones they might not always get to have) — things like that. Category two: Use this as an excuse to get something you've been considering for awhile, but haven't quite pulled the trigger to buy. These are probably higher-ticket items like pet cameras or a smart dog collar. In addition to these, we've included a few items that really aren't for your dog at all, but reference the joys of dog ownership.
Another possibility would be to consider something like the aforementioned Barkly Pets, which is an app-driven, on-demand dog walking service. Whether you just get them a special walk the day of or initiate a schedule of regular walks, they'll appreciate the extra activity. Even if you walk your dog every day, adding in another one here and there while you're at work (or really anytime: the service is available 365 days a year from six in the morning to midnight) will only serve them well in the long run. For my young husky mix, no amount of exercise will ever be enough for him, and the stimulation of walking with someone new now and again keeps him engaged.
The price point on this list varies quite a lot, but generally sticks to the lower end of things. Humans expect things like chocolate, candy, and flowers, so buying something on par with these things for your dog makes perfect sense. That being said, if you want to splash out, we've got you covered there, too.
Go ahead, spoil your canine friend a little with our list of the top 15 best Valentine's gifts for dogs.
1. Up Country All Hearts Dog Collar
Up Country
Switching out your dog's collar to match a festive season is an easy way to let your dog celebrate. Valentine's Day is no exception. This collar is embroidered with hearts to fit the theme perfectly. It's hand sewn in the U.S. and is available in four different sizes, all of which are adjustable. There's even a matching leash if you want to go all-out. A cheaper play on this idea is available from Mirage Pet Products, as well, while Up Country also offers another variation on the hearts theme.

Price: $21.99 to $32.20
2. Up Country Hearts and Flowers Sweater for Dogs
Up Country
Here's another offering from Up Country, this time a hand knit sweater. We've discussed holiday dog sweaters before because they're just so adorable. This one isn't so overtly tied to any specific holiday, but the heart will do the trick for Valentine's. There are four sizes available:
Small: Chest girth 13-16 inches, length 9-12 inches
Medium: Chest girth 17-19 inches, length 12-15 inches
Large: Chest girth 20-23 inches, length 15-18 inches
XL: Chest girth 24-27 inches, length 18-22 inches
Need more options? Browse more Up Country products here.
Price: $40 to $49.99
3. AStorePlus Heart Bear Fleece Costume
AStorePlus
For smaller breeds, you could take the Valentine's dress up to a new level with this fleece bear costume. There's a big ol' heart on the back to fit the theme, while the hood turns your little dog into a cuddly bear. Especially good if your dog is cold at this time of year. There are five sizes:

Price: $5.90
4. Super Design Heart Melamine Bowl Stand
Super Design
Since you have to swap out your dog's bowl to clean it regularly, anyway, why not sub in this heart-covered option for February 14th? Available in one, two, and three cup sizes, this is your standard melamine bowl stand complete with non-skid rubber grip and a stainless steel bowl insert. Both pieces are dishwasher safe, and you can either opt to use it as a raised feeder or as a set for food and water.
Though it isn't necessarily for your dog, you might also ponder your pet food container options while you consider this bowl.
Price: $14.94
5. Petcube Bites in Rose Gold
Petcube
Of all the pet cameras I've tested, the Petcube stands out as my favorite. I like the sleekness of the design, the total ease of use, and the interactive fun the treat-flinging mechanism allows. My dogs like it too (though this might have something to do with the treats in question). The Bites come in three colors, but in order to best celebrate Valentine's, I recommend you opt for the Rose Gold, which is definitely on trend regardless of the holiday. For an in-depth look at the Petcube Bites, see my head-to-head comparison with the PetChatz HD here. The unit ships with treats, but if you should need more, most of the options on our best dog training treats post will work perfectly.

Price: $179 (28 percent off MSRP)
6. Sojos Good Dog Crunchy Natural Dog Treats
Sojos
Speaking of treats, you know you'll have a couple of sweet things on Valentine's, so sharing the love with your dog makes sense, too. Though any of the flavors would certainly make a good gift for your dog, the Peanut Butter & Jelly variety is the only one on an on-theme box. My dogs go absolutely nuts for this flavor, enjoying them in both this variety and the Old Mother Hubbard version. These aren't grain free, but they are wheat and corn free, being made in the U.S. of oat flour, rolled oats, peanut butter, strawberries, eggs, and canola oil. Give your dog a few cookies to munch.
Need more options? Browse more Sojos products here.
Price: $7.35 to $8.35 (12 percent off MSRP)
7. PetPeek Fence Window for Pets
PetPeek
Here's something a little different. My husky mix is the most curious dog I have ever met. We have a large picture window and he lays in front of it all day, watching people go by in the street. He wants to greet everyone when he's out in our yard. We have a chain link fence, but for those of you out there who don't, this is one way to let your curious dog see what's going on outside their confines. Another true thing about my husky is that without the access he has, he would pretty quickly create his own by digging under the fence. This should help alleviate that impulse. It's 9.5 inch acrylic dome that will serve as your dog's porthole to the world. Like the Sofa-Scratcher on our best Valentine's Day gifts for cats post, this allows your dog to do something they wouldn't normally be allowed to do.
Price: $37.89

10. Ethical Pet Leather Dog Toy
Ethical Pet
Now for a few dog toys to make Valentine's fun for your dog. The first is this leather squirrel, which is among the toughest dog toys I've ever seen. These real leather toys are fused and double-stitched and put up with a huge amount of abuse. I was surprised when even my blue nose pit couldn't get one of these apart. They're pretty flat, so they fly pretty well when thrown like a frisbee. There's also a squeaker inside, of course. In addition to this squirrel, you could try any of the following:
The options without little legs that can easily be isolated seem to last a little longer. Still, it's a dog toy, so it's meant to be destroyed. Just let them have at it.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Kyle Hendricks outpitched Stephen Strasburg, and the Chicago Cubs opened defense of their first World Series title in 108 years by beating the Washington Nationals 3-0 on Friday in Game 1 of their NL Division Series.
Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo produced RBI singles in the sixth inning for the first two hits off an otherwise-dominant Strasburg. Hendricks was even better, giving up only two singles in seven strong innings.
Rizzo added an RBI double off reliever Ryan Madson in the eighth. Carl Edwards Jr. threw a perfect inning and Wade Davis finished the two-hitter for a save.
Game 2 in the best-of-five series is Saturday, with Jon Lester set to start for Chicago against fellow left-hander Gio Gonzalez.
Strasburg didn't allow a hit until there were two outs in the sixth. Javier Baez reached on third baseman Anthony Rendon's error to start the inning and was sacrificed to second by Hendricks. One out later, Bryant drove in the first run with a single to right-center and went to second when Bryce Harper missed the cutoff man.
The next batter, Rizzo, singled to right in front of a diving Harper to make it 2-0.
With a heavy beard and a lot of sweat on a muggy, 77-degree night, Strasburg dialed up his fastball to 97 mph and occasionally used an unhittable changeup. To cheers of “Let's go, Strasburg!” from many in a sellout crowd of 43,898, he held the Cubs without a hit for 5 2/3 innings and wound up with 10 strikeouts, a playoff record for the Expos-Nationals franchise.
In only his second postseason appearance — remember the shutdown of 2012 and the arm injury of 2016? — the righty showed precisely the sort of power and poise that made him the No. 1 pick in baseball's amateur draft. Until, that is, the sixth inning. That's when everything changed in a matter of minutes.
Until then, the Cubs managed only one baserunner, and that was via a walk. But Baez led off with a bouncer that Rendon gloved, then bobbled while trying to transfer it to his throwing hand. It was Rendon's first error since July 22; he made only seven in 145 regular-season games.
After Hendricks' bunt moved Baez to second, 2016 NL MVP Bryant lined Strasburg's 60th pitch, a four-seam fastball, to right-center for the game's first run. Harper's throw missed the cutoff man, and Bryant took second. Two pitches later, on another fastball, Rizzo sent a sinking shot to right, where Harper came up just short trying to make a diving catch, and suddenly it was 2-0. As pitching coach Mike Maddux came out for a mound visit with Strasburg, Rizzo whooped it up at the bag, high-fiving first base coach Brandon Hyde.
Strasburg wound up allowing those two unearned runs in seven innings, with three hits and one walk.
Hendricks went about things differently — his best fastball is about 10 mph slower than Strasburg's — but was every bit as good. The slender righty from Dartmouth, who led the NL in ERA last season, did not give up a hit after the second inning. He walked three batters and struck out six.
In the Washington ninth, Ryan Zimmerman was called out when catcher Willson Contreras' throw hit the player in the back as he ran to first on a dropped third strike.
While the Cubs are no longer the “Lovable Losers” after last year's championship, the Nationals were the NL East champions for the fourth time in six seasons but have yet to win a playoff series.
Their undoing in the past has often been poor hitting and bad relief pitching, and it was the former that was most glaring this time.
Yes, Harper — wearing shoes with “Pray for Las Vegas” written on the side following the recent mass shooting in his hometown — did single in the first inning, but was 0 for 3 in his other at-bats as he tries to regain his timing after returning recently from a long injury layoff. Rendon, Zimmerman, Daniel Murphy, Trea Turner and Jayson Werth were a combined 0 for 17 with three walks.
SUSPENSION
Less than a half-hour before the game, the Nationals announced that assistant hitting coach Jacque Jones has been suspended with pay pending an internal investigation. The team said the suspension is connected to a legal matter. The 42-year-old Jones retired as a player in 2008 after 10 years with four teams.
SCALISE'S PITCH
House Majority Whip Steve Scalise threw out the ceremonial first pitch, less than four months after the Louisiana Republican was shot while practicing for an annual charity baseball game featuring members of Congress. Scalise returned to the House last week.
UP NEXT
Cubs: Lester makes the 20th postseason start of his career, which includes three World Series titles and an NLCS MVP award last year. He is 9-7 with a 2.63 ERA over his postseason career.
Nationals: Gonzalez goes in Game 2 instead of two-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer, who is slated for Game 3 at Wrigley Field on Monday. Scherzer has been dealing with a sore right hamstring. It will be Gonzalez's first playoff start at home since Game 5 of the 2012 NLDS against St. Louis, when he was staked to a 6-0 lead in a game Washington lost 9-7.
A lack of willing volunteers has been cited as the reason why Melrose will not see in 2018 with its popular firework display, which has attracted around 4,000 people from across the region to the town each Hogmanay.
The decision was taken by Melrose and District Community Council (MDCC) due to a number of challenges, including the difficulties to obtain sufficient volunteer support for the event.
Having initially been held as a one-off celebration in 2000 to mark the new Millennium, the fireworks display has grown in popularity.
A MDCC spokesperson said: “We share the disappointment that many people will have regarding this decision.
“However, after carefully considering all options alongside Police Scotland, Scottish Borders Council and other agencies, we had no option but to end the annual Hogmanay fireworks display.
“This is mainly due to it being very difficult to get enough volunteers to support such a big event.
“The community council is extremely grateful for the support it has received from various agencies and members of the public over the last 17 years, which includes planning in advance for the event, fundraising towards the cost and help on Hogmanay itself.”
Leaderdale and Melrose Councillor, David Parker, added: “Melrose and District Community Council has worked very hard in running this event on a voluntary basis for a great many years.
“However, the event has become more difficult to manage as it has grown in popularity and the community council simply does not have the resources to run an event of this scale at this time of year.
“As a result, the decision has been made to bring an end to the display, which is completely understandable in the circumstances.
“I know this decision was not taken lightly, and only made after detailed consultation with all the relevant agencies, but there was no option available to run this event safely.”
Police Scotland's Inspector Tony Hodges said: “It is unfortunate that this annual celebration which was enjoyed by many local residents and visitors alike is no longer going to be being held.
“However, we fully understand and support the community council's position.”

NEW YORK (AP) - San Jose Sharks forward Evander Kane has been suspended for Game 2 against Vegas because of a cross-check to the head of Pierre-Edouard Bellemare.
The NHL announced the ban Friday. The league said Kane's second cross-check after the whistle was "not a hockey play" and served no purpose other than hitting an opponent in the head.
The play came in the third period of a series opener that San Jose lost 7-0 to the Golden Knights.
Kane has been a key component for the Sharks since being acquired in February. He's plays wing on the top line and had three goals in a first-round sweep against Anaheim.

While rumors are rife that the wedding is slated to be held on 15th December, a certain section of media claims that the duo have already tied the knot.
Virat and Anushka have neither confirmed nor denied the news but reports suggest that the wedding will be held in Italy.

I can't wait for it." Katrina Kaif's Response Kat chose to avoid the question and instead added, So, we have come to that part of the night. This part of the night, this is what I do." Bhumi Pednekar The actress said, "Well, I am a little confused, what's happening? Are they? (laughs) Well if it is true, then congratulations. They are quite a power couple. They are amazing individually and together." Taapsee Pannu "Let's first get it confirmed that it is happening. Why are you guys after their lives? Let them get married in peace, and if at all they are getting married, just let them be!", quipped the 'Judwaa 2' actress. Sushant Singh Rajput The actor looks surprised and thanked the reports for informing him about the news. He later added, "I don't know (laughs). This is really good news. Thank you for informing me. I want to congratulate them. One is among my favourite actors and the other is one of my favourite cricketsr. So for me, it's a double joy." Chupke- Chupke If rumours are to be believed then 'Virushka' will tie the knot in a private ceremony at Hotel Borgo Finochito in Italy. One also hears that the couple will throw a lavish wedding reception on 26th of this month.
Well, let's hope that the lovebirds make some official announcement soon!

TROY — Cycling is a favorite sport in the United States and around the world. Troy resident, Richard “Dick” Wagar, loves to cycle so much that he spent over four months riding solo from Spring Lake, N.J. to Illwaco, Wash. in 2017 and shared his experience with Troy Rotarians during their weekly meeting on Jan. 30.
Before his first push away from the curb, Wagar spent months mapping out the route he would take, relying on public resources, websites, and information from Adventure Cycling Association. He calculated how much weight his road bike could handle in terms of food, clothing, camping equipment, and electronic devices. He opted to modify the tires and spokes, and added lights and an odometer for security, safety, and visibility. He also made the strategic decision to travel from the East Coast to the West Coast of the United States, knowing his early morning start times would have the sun at his back and improve the chance that motorists would see him easily. It also allowed him to avoid the Midwest's heat and tall corn in the summer months and enabled him complete rides through more populated areas before vacation season began. The only slowdown he could not avoid on this course was the wind. On an average day, he covered 53 miles. Depending on weather, fatigue, and any other disruptions, Wagar was on his bike 68 days and rested for four days in total. He typically rode 5.5-6 hours a day, and then would either set up a tent to camp overnight, or find lodgings at the nearest city, township, or village. By the time he reached the Pacific Ocean, Wagar had pedaled 3,621 miles.
His days consisted of personal hygiene, stretching, eating, cycling, researching the weather and route for the next day, and doing laundry. Before drifting off for his well-earned sleep, he updated a journal with his thoughts and experiences after each ride. Along the way, he documented much of his trip with pictures. He learned how to outrun dogs safely and to have a spray repellent at the ready should he encounter any bears in Yellowstone National Park. The only detour he was forced to take was due to a forest fire in Montana that took him about 10 miles out of the way. In all, it was a trip of a lifetime and one that allowed him to see the beautiful country, meet wonderful people, and do a lot of deep thinking as the miles passed by.

Troy Rotarians and the Troy Rotary Foundation support several community projects annually. During the 2016-17 Rotary year, over $16,000 in scholarships and community aid was distributed from the fund. In addition to the financial support, Rotarians volunteered nearly 400 hours to several service projects. The Troy Rotary Club is a member-involved, goal-oriented service club focused on socio/economic issues that have an impact both locally and internationally. Follow the organization's activities on Facebook at Troy Rotary Club. To learn more about Rotary and membership in the club, visit www.troyohiorotary.org.

The man who posted the now-viral video of a black woman and an Orthodox Jewish man clashing aboard a packed subway train says he “regrets” sharing the clip on social media.
“Didn't think this video would go as viral as it has. I myself have been called racist just for posting, which is weak, but no matter,” Twitter user @chrisfrench_ tweeted Tuesday – days after posting the footage.
“I regret posting now, because everyone has run rampant with the ‘angry black woman' narrative, and it's really disheartening,” the tweet continued.
The nearly two-minute clip begins in the middle of the heated confrontation aboard a Bronx-bound 4 trains.
“You said I'm racist so you tell me what I'm being racist towards … because you're Jewish and I said if a Jewish family got on here, somebody would have got up. That is not a racist statement. That is a factual statement,” the woman can be heard yelling at the man as they both stand on the moving train.
The man in the video has been identified as Yossi Wolfe, a 31-year-old Wall Street Journal software engineer.
The woman, whose identity was not immediately known, could be heard shouting over Wolfe in the video, saying, “You need to learn the difference between race … Judaism is not a race. It is a religion.”
After Wolfe told the woman to “calm down,” tensions rose.
“No, I need to calm down now because I'm schooling your a–,” the woman says. “You guys think you're so f—king smart, but guess what? I'm gonna teach you a lesson on this f—king train today.”
She continues: “We are different. Understand that. You know why? Because your people treat my people different in our community!”
Wolfe later went on Twitter to say that an “elderly lady did make an effort to defuse the situation.”
“After a while, the lady who was screaming let us all know that the reason why she was in such a bad mood was because her husband was arrested that day,” Wolfe said in the tweet.
The video, which Twitter user @chrisfrench_ posted on May 24, has collected more than 178,000 views on Twitter.

Associated Press
Dennis Rodman has delivered a message from President Donald Trump to North Korea — sort of.
On Thursday, the former NBA player gave the country's sports minister a copy of Trump's book "The Art of the Deal," a present intended for North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
It wasn't signed by Trump, who was Rodman's boss for two seasons of the "Celebrity Apprentice" reality TV show. Rodman has said his visit has nothing to do with the White House.
Some other highlights of what has so far been a low-key Pyongyang trip for the often flamboyant celebrity, who has visited the North four times before:
___
HANGING WITH NORTH KOREAN ATHLETES
While his previous visits in 2013 and 2014 often drew controversy, Rodman has said this week he's just here to meet old friends and have a good time.
He and his small entourage have been spending time hanging out with young North Korean basketball players and visiting local sights.
He watched a North Korean men's basketball team and met Sports Minister Kim Il Guk. Along with the Trump book, other gifts he presented for Kim Jong-un include a copy of "Where's Waldo? The Totally Essential Travel Collection," a mermaid puzzle, two sets of soap and two autographed jerseys.
Rodman also met North Korean Olympic athletes, including judo gold medalist An Kum Ae.
"All of you guys should be proud of yourselves, because, you know, a lot of people don't give you guys credit, because this is such a small country, and not many people from North Korea can compete around the world," Rodman said.
He continued: "But for you guys to come back here in your country, with a medal, that says a lot about North Korea, because people don't really take North Korea so seriously about sports or anything like that."
___
"AN OLD FRIEND"
Rodman, one of the only Westerners to have personally met Kim Jong-un, has been criticized for a prior trip where he sang "Happy Birthday" to Kim and suggested an American missionary was at fault for his own imprisonment in North Korea, remarks for which he later apologized.
But the sports minister made clear Rodman is viewed fondly in Pyongyang.
"In the past, our respected supreme leader met you several times and he used his precious time to watch the basketball match with the players you brought here. In the past he met you, so our people all know you well," Kim Il Guk told Rodman. "And also we feel that you are an old friend."
___
NO ROLE IN STUDENT'S RELEASE
Rodman's arrival on Tuesday came just hours after the North decided to release Otto Warmbier, an American university student who had been imprisoned for 15 years with hard labor for trying to steal a propaganda banner.
Warmbier, who had been confined for 17 months, has apparently fallen into a coma not long after his confinement began and Pyongyang issued a statement Thursday saying it decided to let him go for "humanitarian reasons."
Officials in Washington and Pyongyang said Rodman played no role in the release. Behind-the-scenes discussions regarding Warmbier had been underway well before his visit.
The 22-year-old Warmbier, a University of Virginia undergraduate, was convicted and sentenced in a one-hour trial in North Korea's Supreme Court in March 2016. He got 15 years in prison with hard labor for subversion after he tearfully confessed that he had tried to steal the propaganda banner.
His father, Fred Warmbier, told Fox News that his son was "terrorized and brutalized" and has been in a coma for more than a year.
The report of Warmbier's release on the North's official Korean Central News Agency made no mention of Warmbier's health.
Although U.S. citizens are not banned from visiting North Korea, the U.S. State Department strongly advises against it.
With Warmbier's release, three other Americans remain imprisoned in North Korea.

Graduate student Nicholas Posegay, AB'16, has won a Gates Cambridge Scholarship to study at the University of Cambridge beginning in the fall. One of 36 U.S. recipients chosen from a pool of approximately 800 applicants, Posegay will pursue a PhD in Asian and Middle Eastern Studies.
The Gates Cambridge Scholarships, announced Feb. 9, are awarded to students who exhibit outstanding intellectual ability and leadership potential, and who demonstrate a commitment to improving others' lives.
As an historian, Posegay is interested in exploring interfaith interactions in the medieval Middle East—a period in which Jews, Christians and Muslims shared a textual and intellectual tradition and engaged in a free and lively exchange.
He said drawing on this robust past can contribute to better understanding of the area today. “Educating others about the Middle East, with an emphasis on linguistic and religious diversity, is the best way for me to contribute to broadening perceptions about multiculturalism in the region,” Posegay said. “The Gates Cambridge Scholarship allows me to work toward this goal at a University that has resources which are unparalleled in their value to my research.”
Posegay completed his undergraduate coursework in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations in just three years. Now in the final year of a joint BA/MA degree in Middle Eastern Studies, he plans to graduate in June.
“Nicholas's proposal to study interactions between Jews, Christians and Muslims in the medieval Middle East is both fascinating as a research topic and has clear relevance for today's efforts to find solidarity despite ethnic, religious and linguistic differences,” said John W. Boyer, dean of the College. “We congratulate Nicholas on this achievement, and look forward to reading his scholarship."
Dispelling stereotypes of Middle East
In an effort to read original texts from the medieval period, Posegay has studied Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac and Judaeo-Arabic. In 2016 he was the recipient of a U.S. Department of State Critical Language Scholarship to study intensive Arabic in Morocco; this year he has continued his Arabic language studies through a Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship from the U.S. Department of Education.
During his time in the College, Posegay served as a docent at the Oriental Institute Museum, leading tours involving the history, culture and archaeology of the ancient Near East. He also worked as a membership and development assistant, authoring education materials for tours and working on the annual lecture series. In 2015, he co-founded UChicago Majalla, a student-run, Arabic-language journal he continues to edit.
After earning his doctorate at Cambridge, Posegay plans to share his knowledge as a professor, with an eye toward dispelling negative stereotypes of the Middle East. ‘It is my hope that my teaching will enable students to analyze historical events—as well as modern conflicts—with a multifaceted perspective that goes beyond notions of ‘intractable' religious feuds.”
Posegay is the 22nd UChicago student to receive a Gates Cambridge Scholarship since the award's inception in 2001. He was supported throughout his application process by the College Center for Scholarly Advancement, which assists undergraduates and College alumni through the highly competitive application processes for prestigious national scholarships and fellowships.
HOUSTON — Odell Beckham Jr. got it done last week at the Pro Bowl in Orlando, Fla. He so impressed the NFL with his professionalism and interaction with fans that Troy Vincent, the league's NFL executive vice president, sent the Giants a letter praising the emotional receiver.
“He was a stellar ambassador of our sport to fans, coaches, his fellow players and all who came into contact with him during the week,'' Vincent wrote in the letter, a copy of which The Post obtained. “Throughout the skill challenge and each day's activities, Odell went above and beyond in his engagement. From signing autographs to taking pictures to encouraging others, we found his cheerful attitude and dynamic smile as an example to all.''
No doubt, the Giants were pleased to receive the news about Beckham's comportment, even if it came at a no-pressure event such as the Pro Bowl. Beckham ended his third NFL season experiencing some turbulence. He partied in Miami with fellow receivers Victor Cruz, Sterling Shepard and Roger Lewis only six days before a playoff game at Green Bay. Beckham was terrible in that game, nearly dropping as many passes as he caught (three) and afterward allegedly punched a hole in the wall in the hallway at Lambeau Field in frustration. That prompted Giants general manager Jerry Reese to state publicly that the time has come for Beckham, 24, to “grow up.''
The letter from Vincent was sent to Reese, co-owner John Mara, Ben McAdoo and David Tyree, the Giants' director of player development. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and Beckham's agent, Zeke Sandhu, also were sent a copy.
The three-paragraph letter concluded by stating, “Odell single-handedly took our engagement efforts to a higher level. You should be proud to have him representing your club and your city at the Pro Bowl and I didn't want to go another day without writing to acknowledge his extraordinary efforts.''

Fears over a dengue vaccine in the Philippines have led to a big drop in immunisation rates for preventable diseases, officials have warned.
Health Under-Secretary Enrique Domingo said many parents were refusing to get their children vaccinated for polio, chicken pox and tetanus.
The fears centre on Dengvaxia, a drug developed by French company Sanofi.
But Sanofi and local experts say there is no evidence linking the deaths of 14 children to the drug.
However, the company had warned last year that the vaccine could make the disease worse in some people not infected before.
Dengue fever affects more than 400 million people each year around the world. Dengvaxia is the world's first vaccine against dengue.
The mosquito-borne disease is a leading cause of serious illness and death among children in some Asian and Latin American countries, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
What did Mr Domingo say about immunisation rates?
"Our programmes are suffering... (people) are scared of all vaccines now", he warned.
Mr Domingo added that vaccination rates for some preventable diseases had dropped as much as 60% in recent years - significantly lower that the nationwide target of 85%.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Dengue is a potentially deadly mosquito-borne disease
Mr Domingo expressed concerns about potential epidemics in the Philippines - a nation of about 100 million people, many of whom are impoverished.
What triggered fears about Dengvaxia?
More than 800,000 children were vaccinated across the country in 2016-17. Fourteen of them have died.
Dengvaxia immunisations were halted last year, as the Philippines launched an investigation into what caused the deaths.
On Saturday, Doctors for Public Welfare (DPW) said a clinical review conducted by Philippine General Hospital forensic pathologists had determined that the deaths were not linked to the vaccine, the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported.
What about Sanofi's reaction?
In a statement to the BBC, the French company said: "The University of the Philippines - Philippine General Hospital expert panel confirmed yesterday that there is currently no evidence directly linking the Dengvaxia vaccine to any of the 14 deaths.
"In Dengvaxia clinical trials conducted over more than a decade and the over one million doses of the vaccine administered, no deaths related to the vaccine have been reported to us.
"Clinical evidence confirms dengue vaccination in the Philippines will provide a net reduction in dengue disease, including severe dengue and, thereby, reduce the overall public health burden associated with this disease."
Last November, Sanofi announced that its vaccine could worsen the potentially deadly disease in people not previously infected.
"For those not previously infected by dengue virus, however, the analysis found that in the longer term, more cases of severe disease could occur following vaccination upon a subsequent dengue infection," the firm said in a statement.
Sanofi says Dengvaxia has been registered in 19 countries and launched in 11 of them.
In its latest advice on the vaccine, the WHO said that "until a full review has been conducted, WHO recommends vaccination only in individuals with a documented past dengue infection, either by a diagnostic test or by a documented medical history of past dengue illness".
Before there was Google Hangouts, there was GChat. But before GChat, there was AIM messenger — a place that many of us now remember for emo away messages with song lyrics, inside jokes or statuses that possibly seemed much cooler at the time than they actually were.
AIM, also known as AOL Instant Messenger, announced it is shutting down at the end of this year — an announcement that reminded everyone that it still existed and made everyone for some reason tweet out their embarrassing AIM screenname (mine was ninabeana with some number attached, for the record.)
All good things come to an end. On Dec 15, we'll bid farewell to AIM. Thank you to all our users! #AIMemories https://t.co/b6cjR2tSuU pic.twitter.com/V09Fl7EPMx — AIM (@aim) October 6, 2017
People, of course at this announcement were … emotional.
Hi Travis! Remember when you had an entire list of saved away messages & would choose them based on mood you were in? #AIMemories — AIM (@aim) October 6, 2017
Which is perfect. Because everything about AIM — a method to instant message before we all understood how to communicate in instant time speak — was emotional. Also, for many of us, it was used in middle and high school which is sort of an emo time anyway.
In fact, one of the most perfect things that came from AIM was this Twitter account — complete with all of the away statuses that you definitely wrote at some point.

LOS ANGELES — Wendy Carrillo, a community activist and a former radio host who ran on a platform of equality for women at work, and a single payer health care program in California, will face Luis Lopez, a board member of Planned Parenthood and advocate of affordable housing in a Dec. 5 runoff election to decide the winner for the 51st Assembly District seat.
The pair received the most votes Oct. 3 in a special election to fill the vacancy left when Jimmy Gomez was elected to Congress in June.
Carrillo collected 3,604 votes in 129 precincts, compared to 3,283 votes for Lopez.
“Let's go win this seat for the hard-working families of #AD51,” Carrillo posted in her Facebook portal after she clinched the first-place spot.
Carrillo will find in Lopez a seasoned opponent for the post. Lopez unsuccessfully ran in 2012 for the same Assembly seat, losing to Gomez in the runoff.
“Thank you neighbors! We won tonight based on strong relationships of trust throughout our district,” Lopez said. “This push to victory was earned by our volunteer army of hundreds. Now onto the Dec. 5 runoff.”
The Los Angeles County Registrar's Office reported 8, 577 mailed-in ballots, and 8,733 votes cast at 129 precincts. Voter turnout was under eight percent.
Mike Fong, a Los Angeles Community College District board member, came in third place with 2,852 votes, followed by attorney Gabriel Sandoval and dermatologist Ron Birnbaum.
Carrillo served as communications aide for presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in 2016, and challenged Councilman Gil Cedillo in the March 2017 primary for the city's First District office.
Carrillo, a former communications manager for the Service Employees International Union, received the union's support of $314,000 in mailers and canvassed on her behalf.
She voiced support for a $15 minimum wage in California, the Affordable Care Act and programs to eradicate homelessness and increase the supply of affordable units in the district.
After her victory, Carrillo received the endorsement of Jimmy Gomez.
“Wendy Carrillo will make an excellent Assembly member for the people I represented in the California state Legislature,” Gomez said. “She is a proven working class progressive who understands that she must represent everyone in the 51st District.”
An immigrant from El Salvador brought to this country when she was 5 years old, Carrillo graduated with a master's degree in communications at USC, earned a bachelor's degree from Cal State Los Angeles and a community college diploma from East Los Angeles College.
Lopez reported contributions for $118,584 during the race and expenses of $106,995, and said Carrillo spent more than $170 per vote, compared to $61 invested on each of his.
“Despite being outspent by six of our opponents, we prevailed and we'll fight on to the general election,” Lopez said.
Lopez earned a master's degree in public policy from the John F. Kennedy School at Harvard University, and works in the nonprofit health care cancer research organization City of Hope in Duarte.
Born in East Los Angeles, Lopez was a social science analyst with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington, D.C., and a manager of data projects with KPMG Consulting Inc.
Lopez ran on a platform to close the Scholl Canyon landfill in Eagle Rock, supports a universal health care system in the state, and promised to eradicate homelessness in the 51st Assembly District.
Recently, Rajkumar Hirani and Vidhi Vinod Chopra showcased the trailer of Sanju to Rishi Kapoor and actor was seen praising son Ranbir Kapoor like never before! He was pleasantly surprised seeing the terrific performance of his son and while getting teary-eyed, he said, "The way Rajkumar Hirani has presented Ranbir is the biggest superb thing, the boy has really done well. I am so proud of him. I swear on Neetu and Ranbir, I did not think it was Ranbir, I thought it was Sanjay Dutt."
"You don't know how emotionally triggered I am right now at the point where Vinod (Chopra) and Raju (Rajkumar Hirani) have shown me this trailer. The first appearance of Ranbir from the jail, I thought it was Sanjay Dutt."
When Ranbir was asked about his reaction after seeing his dad all emotional, here's what the actor said:
Ranbir Got All Emotional "Besides being my father, he is also an actor I really admire and respect... He never tells me to my face that I've done good work, not that I expect it either. But when you hear such words coming from him, it is incredible, it really moved me, made me emotional."
This Was A Wonderful Gift "Every father wants their son to do well, but my father is very careful that he won't give compliments for free. He always tells us 'kasar reh gayi hai, work harder' (There is still scope for improvement, work harder)'. This was a wonderful gift," Ranbir said at the trailer launch of "Sanju".
Ranbir On His Mom's Reaction After Watching Sanju Trailer The actor added that his mother loves his performance in all his films.
"My mother is my biggest fan, whatever I do she loves. When she saw 'Bombay Velvet' she thought it was the greatest film in the world," he said.
Ranbir Also Talked About Collaborating With Sonam After 10 Years "We never got an opportunity to work together again but Sonam is still the same, she hasn't changed. Her personality is still the same. The only thing which has changed is that she has become an even better actress. Both of us really enjoyed working with each other," he said.
Produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, "Sanju" also features Paresh Rawal, Manisha Koirala, Dia Mirza and Anushka Sharma The film is scheduled to release on June 29.

Lots of locals put long-shot money on the Golden Knights, some as a souvenir, others with real expectations. (FOX5)
Ken Boehlke stood outside the Golden Knights' practice arena on Wednesday with a smile on his face and a small piece of paper in his hands.
"Normally it just sits on a shelf," he said. "Every once in a while I pass by it and have a little chuckle."
The paper is a betting ticket from the Westgate Superbook. Boehlke made the bet in January, 2017: $5 on the Vegas Golden Knights to win the Stanley Cup.
"A $5 bet at 100:1, so I'll win $500 if they win the Stanley Cup," Boehlke explained.
"It was not supposed to be an actual moneymaker," he said with a laugh. "I said to myself, 'I'm gonna buy a ticket every single year for the history of the franchise.'"
But the souvenir bet soon got serious. The Vegas Golden Knights started hot and continued to win, at one point working their way to the best record in the league. It didn't take long for Boehlke to realize he may be cashing his keepsake ticket.
"They're beating all these teams and I'm like, 'Well wait a minute here, this might be a Stanley Cup winning team!'"
Boehlke wasn't the only bettor having that realization. Lots of locals put long-shot money on the Golden Knights, some as a souvenir, others with real expectations.
"I was watching them and ... I decided they are the best team," Matt Boyer said. In Oct, he put $11 down on the Golden Knights to win it all. His possible payout: $1,150.
But even though Boyer has more than $1,000 on the line, he said he's not too worried as the team heads into the Stanley Cup Final.
"I'm strangely not that nervous," he explained. "The bet itself, I'm not thinking too much about. I'm thinking about the story and how awesome it is, I mean I put $11 on it, worst-possible-case scenario I lose $11!"

A San Marcos man was sentenced Monday to 50 years to life for the first-degree murder of his girlfriend.
Edward Andrew Long was convicted Feb. 16 for the death of Elizabeth Antoinette Perez. She was found on June 13, 2016, inside her car that was parked on Interstate 15 in Escondido with a single bullet through her head.
Long was arrested nine days later in Las Vegas and charged in connection with her death.
Police are unclear if Perez was killed in her car, though the front driver and passenger windows were shattered, and what the circumstances of the death are.
Long initially became a person-of-interest after police served a search warrant at his house. He was later arrested when police performed a traffic stop in Las Vegas.
Long has a criminal record and police said the killing was premeditated.
AN Askeaton man who went “head to head” with another man as part of an ongoing family feud in the area, contested a charge of threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour.
His solicitor, Pat Enright, described the incident as a “fair fight” between two parties who had willingly participated.
Peter Harty, St Mary's Terrace, Askeaton told Judge Mary Larkin at Newcastle West court that he was “approached” to fight a man from “the other side of the trouble” at the Town Park in Askeaton on March 14 last year.
He had gone down to the scene, sent by his father, to look for his brother, he explained. There was a crowd of people there, “all fighting each other”, when he was approached to fight. “The minute I landed, it was put to me straightaway,” Harty said.
“The two of us went head to head. We had a few boxes. The rest were roaring at us,” Harty said in evidence.
Garda Liam Hallett arrived at the same time as himself, Harty said and “ stood back and watched” the fight between him and Mikey Harty.
“He didn't ask me to stop.”
The fight was then broken up by people from each side.
But Harty and his solicitor stressed that he, Harty, had had no part in the incidents before he arrived.
Earlier, Garda Hallett told the court he had received a report of a disturbance and went to investigate. He was on his own when he came on a crowd of 20 people at the Town Park, all members of the extended Harty family.
Peter Harty was at the scene, the garda said and wasn't involved in any fight initially but he became involved with another man who had previously come before the court. He asked them to desist, he said.
“They were boxing the heads off each other. They would have been roaring at each other.
It was unsafe for me to deal with it,” the garda said. “There was verbal interaction, effing and blinding.” But he did not hear any threats. “My fear was had the situation not been brought to a close, the parties would have been injured and other people present could have become involved.”
He judged the scenario to be “dangerous, hostile and volatile”, he continued, and called for back-up. Splitting them up was not a “safe option”, the garda said. He estimated the fight lasted three minutes.
In cross-examination, Mr Enright put it to him: “After a couple of minutes in the best traditions of a fair fight the parties were separated by friends and relations. The parties went their separate way and that was the end of that.”
It was he said, a case of “two men throwing a few slaps at one another”. “They went into if of their own free will…not really more than throwing shapes,” he said.
“I don't agree,” Garda Hallett replied. He also rejected Mr Enright's suggestion that he was “effectively” refereeing the one-on-one fight, with his baton at the ready.
Mr Enright argued there was no breach of section 6 of the Public Order Act as there was no evidence of any threat. But Inspector Alan Cullen counter-argued, saying the behaviour was such that any “reasonable member of the public” would be in fear.
After hearing the evidence, Judge Mary Larkin convicted Harty of the charge.
“He is not a man who goes out looking for trouble,” Mr Enright said in mitigation. “Perhaps through culture or other reasons he got involved in things he might not have anticipated when he got up that morning.”
Judge Larkin, fining Harty €300, said: “I find find it extraordinary to understand in this day and age, where there are mediators to resolve issues, that we have to step up to one another and box the head off each other and shout.”
“It is of concern that it is continuing to happen in the context of one family,” she added. “This is hugely unacceptable behaviour.”
She fixed recognizance in the event of appeal at €250.
France will grant asylum to around 80 refugees from the Aquarius rescue vessel which was at the centre of a bitter European dispute over migration last month, the country's asylum office said on Tuesday.
French officials interviewed 135 of the mainly African migrants aboard the charity boat that was left adrift in the Mediterranean after being turned away by Italy and Malta before being accepted by Spain.
Of the 135 who were screened in Spain, "around 80 will benefit from France's protection," Pascal Brice, head of the Ofpra asylum office said.
France will also grant asylum to 52 people rescued by the German charity boat Lifeline last month, which was also stranded for days last month after picking up migrants in distress off the Libyan coast.
That ship carrying more than 230 people aboard was eventually allowed to dock in Malta.
The row over who should take in the Aquarius -- which was carrying a total of 630 people rescued from smuggler boats off Libya -- came to symbolise the deep discord in Europe over how to share responsibility for the thousands of migrants that have landed on Europe's shores since 2015.
French President Emmanuel Macron was criticised for not offering safe haven to the Aquarius while heaping criticism on Italy's new populist government for what he called its "irresponsibility" in turning the ship away.
Brice said among the 135 Aquarius migrants interviewed, mostly Eritreans and Sudanese, several decided to stay in Spain.
Besides the French team on site, Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands and Portugal also sent officials to evaluate asylum requests, underscoring a "European dimension" that could be a model for the bloc, Brice said.
At an EU summit last Friday the bloc's 28 members agreed to consider setting up "disembarkation platforms", most likely in North Africa, in a bid to discourage migrants and refugees boarding EU-bound smuggler boats.

At least 2 Aurora men shot dead at Wisconsin auto racing event
hello
UNION GROVE, Wis. -- A Wisconsin sheriff says three men were shot and killed during an auto racing event, at least two of those men from Aurora.
Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth says authorities responded to the Great Lakes Dragaway in Union Grove around 7 p.m. Sunday after receiving reports about shots being fired.
Beth says the three men were shot by another man at point-blank range near a food vendor. No suspects have been arrested.
Two men died at the scene, and the third died while en route to a hospital. The sheriff says at least two of the men were from Aurora.
The sheriff's office estimated that more than 5,000 people were at the raceway for an event known as "Larry's Fun Fest."
Union Grove is about 25 miles south of Milwaukee.
Dion Waiters celebrated his 26th birthday in Memphis on Sunday with nerve pain in his right elbow and a broken heart after the Philadelphia Eagles, his favorite NFL team, lost quarterback Carson Wentz to a season-ending torn ACL injury.
“That's probably one of the happiest, saddest wins I've ever had. Ever,” the Philadelphia native said of seeing the Eagles rally to beat the Rams, but lose Wentz in the process. “I was in a good space up until about 6:30, 6:45, everything just … I had a very emotional day, man, the highs, the lows.”
Waiters' fandom aside, the Heat's starting shooting guard is also experiencing a bit of a low with his own health.
After hyperextending his right elbow in last Wednesday's loss at San Antonio setting a hard screen, and then shooting 1 for 10 with two points in Saturday's win over the Nets in Mexico City, Waiters said at shootaround Monday his arm is “still messed up.”

He wore an arm sleeve in the first half versus the Nets, but then took it off in the second half because it was bothering him. He said he's practicing with it to get acclimated to it. But it doesn't feel comfortable.
“I'm going to see if I'm going to wear the sleeve or try to get taped, something, figure it out, man,” Waiters said. “Because it's like a tendon. I can't really bend my arm. First, I just got to practice with it. If I can practice with it and just keep wearing it all day, every day and get used to it until the pain goes away, then that's what I'm going to have to do. But I already told myself, I went out there and missed the first couple of shots, I said, ‘Oh.' I actually made a layup.”
Waiters said he “can't really [extend]” his arm the way he wants to.
“It's a nerve, so it's annoying. I ain't making no excuses.”
Waiter has had an up-and-down run shooting the ball even before he tweaked his elbow. Before he went 8 of 12 from the field and scored 22 points against the Spurs in Wednesday's loss, he was 1 for 10 in a loss to the Warriors Dec. 3, 3 for 10 at the Knicks on Nov. 29, 2 for 10 at the Bulls on Nov. 26 and 0 for 10 against the Pacers on Nov. 19. All of those performances were sandwiched between much better shooting nights.
“The Brooklyn game a lot of those shots were in his wheelhouse,” coach Erik Spoelstra said. “My challenge to him is how else can you affect the game. Can he dominate on the other end of the court and come down with 11, 12 rebounds, six deflections and a bunch of timely, multiple efforts on defense. There are a lot of ways to impact winning and he's starting to learn a lot of different facets.”
Last week, the FCC announced the results of its incentive auction for low-band 600 MHz spectrum, and T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) was the biggest winner — by far. The Un-carrier scooped up an incredible $8 billion worth of spectrum, gobbling up 45% of all low-band spectrum being auctioned off.

Low-band spectrum is incredibly important in terms of network strategy, as it can travel further and penetrate buildings better to provide indoor coverage. That makes it useful for both urban (where building penetration is important) and rural (where signals need to travel long distances) markets. T-Mobile now has 40 MHz worth of spectrum in the 600 MHz band throughout most of the U.S.:

And here's what T-Mobile's LTE coverage should look like by year's end:

That's a lot of spectrum
Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT
On average, T-Mobile collected 31 MHz of spectrum nationwide, quadrupling the company's low-band holdings in the process. CEO John Legere says that T-Mobile will use the new holdings to intensify competition withVerizon (NYSE: VZ) and AT&T (NYSE: T)in markets where the two currently enjoy duopoly status. Once T-Mobile's LTE network expands into these markets, many of which are rural areas, it will aggressively undercut in its typical Un-carrier ways.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime spectrum auction and @TMobile just cleaned up! Here's what it means… pic.twitter.com/kLwoV1wVBY John Legere (@JohnLegere) April 13, 2017
Interestingly, Verizon voluntarily sat out of the auction altogether, which is a bit confusing since Big Red just re-launched unlimited data plans in February. You'd think that the largest U.S. carrier would want more spectrum to beef up its network even further to cope with an expected increase in traffic, but it seemingly has other plans up its sleeve. Verizon has ample 700 MHz holdings and may be keeping some powder dry for high-band spectrum in the 2 GHz and higher range, according to FierceWireless.
Ma Bell also played it conservatively, spending a relatively modest $910 million in the auction. The FCC had structured the auction to favor smaller companies in the name of competitiveness, but Verizon and AT&T still qualified to participate.

Legere points out that Verizon and AT&T's low-band holdings are already fairly congested because this spectrum has been in use for quite some time. In contrast, T-Mobile will be opening up entirely new bands for its customers, which theeccentricCEO compares to “a new, clear multi-lane freeway where speeding is encouraged.”
T-Mobile is already working with network equipment vendors and smartphone manufacturers to ensure 600 MHz compatibility, with compatible phones expected later this year.
The Un-carrier will keep stealing customers

Environment variables on Unix systems -- how to understand, modify, and appreciate them
Simply put, environment variables are variables that are set up in your shell when you log in. They are called “environment variables” because most of them affect the way your Unix shell works for you. One points to your home directory and another to your history file. One identifies your mail file while another controls the colors that you see when you ask for a file listing. Still another sets up your default search path.
If you haven't examined your environment variables in a while, you might be surprised by how many of them are configured. An easy way to see how many have been established in your account is to run this command:
$ env | wc -l 25
The env command (or printenv) will list all of the enviroment variables and their values. Here's a sampling:
$ env | sort | head -10 DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/1000/bus HISTCONTROL=ignorespace HISTFILE=/home/shs/.history HISTIGNORE=history:pwd:man *:ls:ls * HISTSIZE=100 HISTTIMEFORMAT=%h %d %H:%M:%S> HOME=/home/shs LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LESSCLOSE=/usr/bin/lesspipe %s %s LESSOPEN=| /usr/bin/lesspipe %s
In this sampling of settings, we see a signalling setting, settings which control how many previous commands are displayed when you use the history commands, what commands are ignored, and how history information is formatted. We also see some locale data, and settings for the less command.
You can display a single variable with a simple echo command.
$ echo $HISTFILE /home/shs/.history
You can create a variable on the command line by using a command like “myvar=11”, but it's not really an environment variable unless you also export it and it won't be available in subshells. If, instead, you typed “export myvar=11”; the variable will then also be available if you initiate a subshell.
Environment variables will only be remembered if you make them permanent (as far as “permanent” goes on a Unix system) by adding them to one of your startup files – like .~/bashrc, ~.profile or ~/.login.
You can get rid of environment variables fairly easily with the unset command, but remember to remove them from the file in which they were set up initially. If you remove a variable that you need, you might have some interesting consequences.
$ unset HOME $ cd /tmp $ cd -bash: cd: HOME not set
Fortunately, reversing the change is just as easy.
$ export HOME=/home/shs $ cd $ pwd /home/shs
Some environment variables are set up in system files like /etc/profile that are read before your local setup files when you log in.
Environment variables can be changed or unset, but they can also be augmented. If your search path is set up in /etc/profile, you can redefine it in your local .profile or add to it with a command like this:
PATH=~/bin:$PATH:/apps/bin
In this case, your personal bin directory (~/bin) would then be searched before other directories on your path and /apps/bin would be searched last provided it isn't also included in the initial $PATH.
Environment variables help to configure your account so that it's easier to use, but can also be changed to suit your needs and preferences.

Weed socks have been on stoners' radars for what seems like forever. Why? They're extremely versitile. If you're looking to really show your stoner spirit, you can get bright, long ones. If you'd prefer to keep your smoking lifestyle on the down low, you can easily hide them underneath a pair of pants.
Always remember that weed socks aren't to be all, end all, when it comes to stoner clothing. Don't pigeonhole yourself into just socks. Consider these awesome weed clothes, too.
Just like regular socks, weed socks come in a variety of lengths, colors, and cuts. This piece is set up in three different sections: Ankle weed socks, crew weed socks, and over-the-knee weed socks. Each capsule has a superlative headline, making it easy to determine whether it fits your needs or not.
Another thing to keep in mind, while browsing this list: Gender doesn't matter. Each pair is designated for men or women, solely for sizing.

CLEVELAND (AP) — Yan Gomes singled home Austin Jackson from second base with none out in the 13th inning as the Cleveland Indians rallied from five runs down to stun the New York Yankees 9-8 Friday and snatch a 2-0 lead in the AL Division Series.
Jackson drew a leadoff walk in the 13th from Dellin Betances and stole second. Gomes went to a full count before pulling his bouncer just inside the third-base bag, easily scoring Jackson. The Indians poured out of their dugout to mob Gomes, who ended the 5-hour, 8-minute thriller.
The Indians posted their biggest comeback win in postseason history, overcoming an 8-3 deficit, a terrible start by ace Corey Kluber and a potentially serious injury to slugger Edwin Encarnacion.
Francisco Lindor hit a grand slam in the sixth to rally Cleveland, right after a close call on a hit by pitch that the Yankees didn't challenge.
New York had its chances late, but the Yankees stranded the go-ahead run at third in the ninth and 10th — and had pinch-runner Ronald Torreyes picked off second in the 11th by Gomes from the behind the plate.
Cleveland will try for a sweep in Game 3 Sunday at Yankee Stadium. Carlos Carrasco is set to start for the Indians against Masahiro Tanaka.
Jay Bruce connected for a solo shot in the Cleveland eighth that made it 8-all. As they've done so many times in a season becoming more special by the day, the defending AL champions battled back and can now put the Yankees away in New York — just as they did in the 2007 ALDS.
Josh Tomlin, who had been scheduled to start later in the series, pitched two perfect innings for the win.
Aaron Hicks hit a three-run homer off Kluber and Gary Sanchez and Greg Bird hit two-run shots for the Yankees, who may have caught a bad break before Lindor's homer.
Down 8-3, facing New York's vaunted bullpen, the Indians came back.
New York starter CC Sabathia was lifted with one on and one out in the sixth for Chad Green, another one of the Yankees' flame-throwers who got an out before Gomes doubled. Green came inside and Lonnie Chisenhall was awarded first by plate umpire Dan Iassogna on a hit by pitch.
TV replays showed the ball slightly change direction — it appeared to hit the knob of Chisenhall's bat.
Yankees manager Joe Girardi said there wasn't enough evidence within 30 seconds to justify a challenge. He said the team later saw a slow-motion replay suggesting he should've contested the call, but it was too late.
Lindor then stepped in and hit a towering shot off the inside of the right-field foul pole to make it 8-7, triggering a seismic celebration.
As Lindor rounded the bases with Cleveland's first postseason slam since Jim Thome in 1999, Progressive Field shook the way it did last November when Rajai Davis hit a two-run homer in eighth inning of Game 7 off Aroldis Chapman, then with the Cubs and now closing for the Yankees.
When Lindor reached the plate, he wrapped his arms around Jason Kipnis waiting in the batter's box.
TAMPA, Fla. — Police in Florida are investigating an incident at a nightclub where a photographer said he was “sucker punched” by singer Chris Brown.
Tampa police spokesman Stephen Hegarty says 28-year-old Bennie Vines Jr. was hired by Aja Channelside to take photos during an event hosted by Brown.
Vines told officers that while he was snapping photos early Monday, Brown punched him. Brown was gone by the time officers arrived. Vines refused medical treatment and told officers he wants to prosecute because of a minor lip cut.
The club confirmed the incident on its Facebook page Monday and apologized to patrons.
Brown, singer of the hits “Run It!” and “Deuces,” completed probation in a 2009 felony assault case for an attack on singer Rihanna, his then-girlfriend.
An email to the representative listed on Brown's website was not immediately returned.
Four Silicon Valley Execs Charged in Trade Secrets Theft
Four Silicon Valley executives have been charged in an alleged conspiracy to steal trade secrets from their employer, an unnamed semiconductor manufacturer.
The men -- Liang Chen of Saratoga, Donald Olgado of Palo Alto, Wei-Yung Hsu of San Jose and Robert Ewald of Aptos -- are accused by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiring to use stolen information in a competing startup based in the U.S. and China.
The technology related to the high-volume manufacturing of semiconductor wafers to be used in lighting and electronic devices.
The company is not named in the indictment but public records show that the men were employed by semiconductor company Applied Materials Inc. of Santa Clara around 2012, the time of the alleged crime.
They allegedly downloaded information about the technology from their employer's confidential internal engineering database, including over 16,000 drawings. They also shared emails describing their plans to use the technology in a new company and tried to recruit investors to fund the company.
Each man has been charged with one count of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets and eleven counts of possessing stolen trade secrets, according to the indictment, announced Wednesday by U.S. Attorney Brian J. Stretch and Federal Bureau of Investigation agent John F. Bennett. The charges were issued in an indictment handed down on Nov. 30, 2017, by a federal grand jury.
If convicted, they face up to 10 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine for each charge.
Chen, 52, was a corporate vice president and general manager of the alternative energy products division; Olgado, 54, was a managing director of engineering within the product business group; Hsu, 57, was a vice president and general manager within the semiconductor LED division; and Ewald, 60, was a director of the energy and environmental systems within the alternative energy products division.

By PAUL LADEWSKIAssociated Press
CHICAGO (AP) - The Milwaukee Brewers have found a left-handed complement for Ryan Bryan in the batting order, and everything is right in their world at the moment.
Early season sensation Eric Thames homered in his club record-tying fifth straight game and the streaking Brewers turned back the Chicago Cubs 6-3 on Monday night. The victory was their sixth in the last seven games.
Milwaukee never trailed after the Thames hit an opposite-field homer to snap a 3-3 tie in the third inning. Jeromy Burnitz became the first and last Brewers player to homer in five straight games in August, 1997.
"You've just got to ride the wave and enjoy it," said Thames, 30, who played in Korea last three years. "There's always dark times around the corner, so you've just got to take it in stride."
Braun and Jeff Bandy also went deep for Milwaukee, the only team to hit as many as three homers in a game off Chicago starter John Lackey (1-2) last season.
"It's unique that Ryan's not getting the attention after a five-home run start in the first couple weeks of the season," manager Craig Counsell said. "But he's happy with it, I guarantee you."
The Cubs lost for a fourth straight time, their worst stretch since a five-game skid from July 5-9 last season. At 6-7, the defending World Series champs have lost four consecutive games at Wrigley Field for the first time since May, 2014.
"There's no panic on our side at all," Kyle Schwarber said. "We know that we're a good baseball team and we'll bounce back. We have to turn the page."
Brewers starter Chase Anderson (2-0) pitched five innings of three-run, seven-hit ball to pick up the victory. He walked two batters and struck out five. Neftali Felix pitched a scoreless ninth for his fifth save in as many tries.
Milwaukee added a pair of insurance runs in the eighth inning on Braun's RBI double and steal of third base followed by catcher Willson Contreras' throwing error.
"We did a lot of things well," Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. "We have to take better care of the latter part of the game."
Chicago trailed 3-1 when Albert Almora Jr. reached Anderson for a two-run double in the third inning. The hit scored Jason Heyward and Miguel Montero, who had led off with singles.
It took the Brewers three batters to break through against Lackey in the first inning.
After the Thames extended his hit streak to 10 games with a one-out double, Braun unloaded his seventh homer in the last nine games versus the Cubs. Braun's 651st extra-base hit moved him into second place with Paul Molitor on the Brewers' all-time list.
Chicago closed to within 2-1 on Ben Zobrist's two-out single in the bottom half of the inning.
Bandy quickly restored the two-run lead with a homer to open the second inning.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Brewers: RHP Matt Garza (strained right groin) had his rehab start moved from Triple A Colorado Springs to Class A Wisconsin on Monday due to forecast of rain in Nashville. The hope is that Garza can pitch with no limits before his return to the parent club this weekend. ... RHP Junior Guerra (strained right calf) began workouts on a treadmill. Counsell offered no timetable for his return.
LIKE OLD TIMES
Former Cubs Jason Hammel, Jorge Soler and Travis Wood received their 2016 World Series rings in a pre-game ceremony. All play for the Kansas City Royals, who had an open date.
"That (the organization) put in the effort to bring us three back to get our rings here is pretty special," said Wood, who was granted free agency after five seasons with the team. "Last year was one to remember for sure."
TRADING PLACES
Chicago RHP Carl Edwards Jr. was activated after bereavement leave and OF Tommy La Stella was placed on the same list. Edwards was available for the opener of the three-game series.
La Stella is 1 for 4 with one double and one RBI in six games this season.
UP NEXT
Brewers: RHP Jimmy Nelson (1-0, 1.38) will take a 1-6 career record versus the Cubs into his start on Tuesday.
Cubs: LHP Brett Anderson (1-0, 0.84) will get the call against the Brewers on Tuesday. He has no decisions in two career starts against them.

Kennedy appointed Saint Joseph High School principal Christopher Lushis Freelance Writer
After months of carefully considering how to best uphold and continue traditions of excellence at Saint Joseph High School, Bishop Kevin C. Rhoades chose last week to appoint John M. Kennedy as its new principal, beginning July 1.
The appointment follows the retirement announcement of current principal Susan Richter, who has led Saint Joseph High School for the past 13 years.
Kennedy, a graduate of the University of Notre Dame, has spent 24 years working in education, with 21 of those in the South Bend Community School Corporation. He currently serves as principal of Washington High School, where he taught math from 1997-2004.
In a statement regarding the decision, Bishop Rhoades said: “I am very happy to appoint Mr. John Kennedy as the new principal of Saint Joseph High School. I am deeply grateful to our Superintendent of Schools, Mrs. Marsha Jordan, and to the Search Committee for their hard work in recent months and for their recommendation of the hiring of Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy has much experience as a leader in secondary education. He has a deep Catholic faith and commitment to the mission of Saint Joseph High School. I look forward to our work together in the coming years in service of the students of Saint Joseph High School and their human, intellectual, and spiritual formation. Mr. Kennedy will lead the high school forward, building upon its rich heritage and history and upon the wonderful leadership of Mrs. Susan Richter. I pray that Saint Joseph High School will continue to grow and flourish in its mission under the leadership of Mr. Kennedy.”
Kennedy began his educational career by performing service work at St. Catherine's Indian School in Santa Fe, New Mexico, followed by three years of teaching at St. Pius X High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before returning to South Bend. His experience in school administration has included serving as assistant principal at Riley High School, South Bend, from 2004-11; principal of South Bend New Tech High School from 2011-15, and principal of Darden Primary School from 2015-17.
“It has been a privilege to work in the South Bend schools. I have learned a lot and worked with many great teachers, students and families,” said Kennedy, reflecting on his journey. He added that one of his greatest accomplishments at Washington High School was to have “brought a positive spirit that renewed the energy of many of our staff, and supported many students through the challenges of high school.
“At this point in my career, I am thrilled to begin a new journey at Saint Joseph High School and the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend. Saint Joseph is a fantastic school with phenomenal families. I look forward to building on the strengths of Saint Joseph and developing a vision that aligns with the tenets of faith, character and excellence, yet takes the school to new heights and prominence. I am thankful to Bishop Rhoades for this opportunity and look forward to the work of leading such a great school.”
Kennedy's introduction and immersion into the Saint Joseph High School community began with his family. His wife, Kathy, is a 1987 Saint Joseph alumna and their son Marty will graduate this spring as co-salutatorian, after having served as student body president. Their son Zachary will enter as a freshman this fall. The Kennedys are members of Corpus Christi Parish in South Bend.
Kennedy expressed excitement about his return to working in Catholic education and taking a larger role in shaping an environment that “builds character in students through the Catholic faith and offers the opportunity to truly develop leaders and difference-makers in our community and in our world.”
In his hope for what is to come at Saint Joseph, he exclaimed: “The sky is the limit for us to be a leader in Catholic education and in education across the board. I envision Saint Joseph graduates as being prepared to take on the issues and problems of our community and the world, becoming the kind of problem-solvers that make a difference in a positive way.”
He indicated that he seeks to “challenge students to think critically, dialogue and wrestle with issues and challenges of the day throughout their time at Saint Joseph, so that they will be prepared for whatever they take on in college, in career, and also in making the world a better place. I know that sounds a little cliché, but I believe that is what we need.”
Kennedy emphasized that he is eager to connect with the students and build strong relationships with faculty and staff members. He added: “I think the challenge for a high school principal is always to meet every student's need and to guide and help them through their challenges while letting them flourish with their individual gifts. How do you do this? You tailor your instruction to meet the needs of students, through a variety of instructional methods, projects and activities to engage learners that have a variety of interests and abilities. You can differentiate to meet those needs. This is a place where students of a variety of backgrounds, abilities, and interests can grow and be successful. I am looking forward to working with everyone who decides to become a part of our school community.”
He thanked Susan Richter for her efforts in leading the school forward with courage and resilience.
“She has given an enormous amount of dedicated service to Saint Joseph and primarily led the transition to a new state-of-the-art building. I think this community is indebted to her for that, for the work she has done, and the time and effort she has spent. She strikes me as an outstanding spiritual leader as well as educational leader, and a model for all the Saint Joseph students.”

Miguel Andujar collided with Houston's Yuli Gurriel trying to make a play at third in the seventh, but remained in the game after being looked at by the training staff.
Andujar said he got hit in the left side of his head, but was OK and Aaron Boone added: “I don't think it's anything big.”
Aaron Hicks was hitless in 15 at-bats before a sixth-inning double in the Yankees' 5-3 win over the Astros Wednesday night at the Stadium, but Boone said he still values what he brings to the team.
“When he's not getting hits, he's getting on base 35 percent of the time,'' Boone said. “And he's a real center fielder that can really legitimately play center field. He has power and in a lot of ways is still a young player who's still developing and is highly productive.”
That's Boone's polite way of saying you shouldn't expect to see Clint Frazier back in The Bronx anytime soon, regardless of how well he hits with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.
“[Frazier] continues to grow and establish himself as a big part of our future,'' Boone said. “Aaron is a really good player for us and plays a premium defensive position. You can't just fire anyone out in center field.''
Boone said Luis Severino would start one of the games of the doubleheader on Monday in Detroit and the team was discussing who would pitch the other game. Boone said he preferred to have a starter as opposed to using the game as a bullpen day.
Adam Warren threw three scoreless innings for Double-A Trenton. … Austin Romine extended his career-high hitting streak to nine games, and is 12-for-26 in that stretch.
Muguruza beats Stosur in 1st round at Brisbane International
hello
BRISBANE, Australia -- French Open champion Garbine Muguruza finished off a first-round match for the first time at the Brisbane International, and extended Sam Stosur's unhappy run in the process with a 7-5, 6-7 (2), 7-5 win on Monday.
The fourth-seeded Muguruza saved three set points in the first and rallied from a break down in the third to finish off in 2 hours, 45 minutes on a humid afternoon. In two previous trips to the season-opening tournament, Muguruza struggled with injuries and hadn't completed a match.
"It was a battle," Muguruza said. Stosur "played very well today. She served like a beast. It took three hours for that battle to see what happens in the end."
Muguruza beat Stosur in the French Open semifinals last year and went on to beat then No. 1-ranked Serena Williams in the final to claim her first major title.
The loss extended a slump for Stosur, the 32-year-old Australian who hasn't won a competitive single match since the first round of the U.S. Open in September and hasn't advanced past the second round at her home tournament in Queensland state.
No. 5 Svetlana Kuznetsova, No. 6 Elina Svitolina and No. 8 Roberta Vinci were among the women's seeds advancing Monday.
Svitolina, the only player to beat both Serena Williams and Angelique Kerber in 2016, opened with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Olympic champion Monica Puig.
Kuznetsova beat American Louisa Chirico 6-2 6-4 and Vinci was pushed all the way in a 7-6 (4), 6-7 (4), 7-6 (5) win over qualifier Kateryna Bondarenko.
American qualifier Asia Mohammed advanced with a 7-6 (5), 6-1 win over Donna Vekic, and Zhang Shuai of China beat Laura Siegemund 4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-3.
In the men's draw, another of Australia's local hopes went out in the first round with No. 8-seeded David Ferrer beating error-prone Bernard Tomic 6-3, 7-5.
Nicolas Mahut advanced to the second round with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over fellow Frenchman Stephane Robert and Kyle Edmond held off American qualifier Ernesto Escobedo 7-6 (4), 7-6 (6).

This story originally aired February 15, 2017.
Florida's 67 school districts have one, undesirable, common thread these days: their increasing problems in staffing their classrooms, according to a report in the Orlando Sentinel.
The number of Florida university students graduating with education degrees has fallen since 2006 by nearly 5,000, while public-school enrollment has grown, by nearly three million this year. One of the core issues, perhaps the largest, in recruiting and retaining teachers is the paycheck.
“I don't think you're going to have any argument or debate in terms of trying to find a way to raise the compensation level for our teachers,” says Escambia County Superintendent Malcolm Thomas. “It's something that superintendents work through each and every year.”
Thomas appeared recently at a meeting of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on PreK-12 Education, as President of the Florida Association of District School Superintendents.
“Speaking for Escambia, we've tried to give some sort of pay raise every year since 2009. It's not always been sufficient, but it's all that we had,” Thomas said.
“Money matters; they want to be able to meet the needs of their families. They want to feel secure, but they didn't go into teaching to become rich,” said state Education Commissioner Pam Stewart.
Stewart said in the not-so-recent-past, school districts in Florida were able to sit back and wait for a legion of teachers to come to them. But not anymore. Now, districts have to go out and find them.
“Where we find those [college] students, those high-performing students, and we all encourage them to go into teaching,” said Stewart. “
While teacher shortages have been evident for some time at the high and middle school levels, they're now being seen in elementary schools, where positions historically were the easiest to fill. Escambia County's Malcolm Thomas told the committee that the numbers are no longer there.
“In the past, with the University of West Florida in our back door, for years and years we never worried about having teachers,” said Thomas. “Because they would always have hundreds and hundreds of teachers graduating. Their last graduating class in the fall, less than 50 teachers; I needed to hire almost 300.”
Because of that, the Escambia County District has begun an aggressive recruiting program, going across the Southeast. And beginning teachers are placed in the START Program.
Under START, every beginning teacher hired in Escambia County are assigned a master teacher who does not have classroom responsibilities. Each START teacher has 15 teachers they support and will be their “sidekick.”
Escambia County spends about $500,000 per year on rookie teachers in the START Program. Thomas testified that the landscape for teachers in Florida has changed drastically over the past couple of years, including a shift in salary schedules away from longevity.
“Now, we've got performance-based components that are required to be in those salary schedules,” Thomas said. “Just a few short years ago we had a system where almost every teacher received the same rating. Now you've got a system where teachers are going to range from highly effective, all the way to unsatisfactory.”
A number of education bills have been filed for the 2017 legislative session, which kicks off March 7. Among them, one that would curb what Thomas calls “over-testing” of students.
Miss Coon has yet again set up the small town of Scooterville in the gym.
By Jessica Paul
Miss Coon has yet again set up the small town of Scooterville in the gym. Students navigated some new streets on scooters to imitate driving in the real world. This year each of the Scooterville drivers has a Plevna School Driver's License. They also have paying jobs and must buy the scooter that they wish to drive. Scooterville includes two-lane highways, a four way stop, and other intersections, complete with many stops, yields, one way, do not enter, and speed limit signs. Scooterville also has a carwash, a church, an art store, a school, a coffee shop, a grocery store, a movie theater, a fire station, a post office, a restaurant, a hospital, a clothing store, houses, and even a jail. The traffic offenders who end up in jail do jumping jacks to pay for their crimes committed on the streets of Scooterville. Everyone enjoys learning to drive in Scooterville!
Criticism for hate speech, extremism, fake news, and other content that violates community standards has the largest social media networks strengthening policies, adding staff, and re-working algorithms. In the Social (Net)Work Series, we explore social media moderation, looking at what works and what doesn't, while examining possibilities for improvement.
From a video of a suicide victim on YouTube to ads targeting “Jew haters,” on Facebook, social media platforms are plagued by inappropriate content that manages to slip through the cracks. In many cases, the platform's response is to implement smarter algorithms to better identify inappropriate content. But what is artificial intelligence really capable of catching, how much should we trust it, and where does it fail miserably?
“A.I. can pick up offensive language and it can recognize images very well. The power of identifying the image is there,” says Winston Binch, the chief digital officer of Deutsch, a creative agency that uses A.I. in creating digital campaigns for brands from Target to Taco Bell. “The gray area becomes the intent.”
A.I. can read both text and images, but accuracy varies
Using natural language processing, A.I. can be trained to recognize text across multiple languages. A program designed to spot posts that violate community guidelines, for example, can be taught to detect racial slurs or terms associated with extremist propaganda.
A.I. can also be trained to recognize images, to prevent some forms of nudity or recognize symbols like the swastika. It works well in many cases, but it isn't foolproof. For example, Google Photos was criticized for tagging images of dark-skinned people with the keyword “gorilla.” Years later, Google still hasn't found a solution for the problem, instead choosing to remove the program's ability to tag monkeys and gorillas entirely.
Algorithms also need to be updated as a word's meaning evolves, or to understand how a word is used in context. For example, LGBT Twitter users recently noticed a lack of search results for #gay and #bisexual, among other terms, leading some to feel the service was censoring them. Twitter apologized for the error, blaming it on an outdated algorithm that was falsely identifying posts tagged with the terms as potentially offensive. Twitter said its algorithm was supposed to consider the term in the context of the post, but had failed to do so with those keywords.
A.I. is biased
The gorilla tagging fail brings up another important shortcoming — A.I. is biased. You might wonder how a computer could possibly be biased, but A.I. is trained by watching people complete tasks, or by inputting the results of those tasks. For example, programs to identify objects in a photograph are often trained by feeding the system thousands of images that were initially tagged by hand.
The human element is what makes it possible for A.I. to do tasks but at the same time gives it human bias.
The human element is what makes it possible for A.I. to complete tasks previously impossible on typical software, but that same human element also inadvertently gives human bias to a computer. An A.I. program is only as good as the training data — if the system was largely fed images of white males, for example, the program will have difficulty identifying people with other skin tones.
“One shortcoming of A.I., in general, when it comes to moderating anything from comments to user content, is that it's inherently opinionated by design,” said PJ Adelberg, the executive technical director of Stink Studios New York, an agency that uses A.I. for creating social media bots and moderating brand campaigns.
Once a training set is developed, that data is often shared among developers, which means the bias spreads to multiple programs. Adelberg says that factor means developers are unable to modify those data sets in programs using multiple A.I. systems, making it difficult to remove any biases after discovering them.
A.I. cannot determine intent
A.I. can detect a swastika in a photograph — but the software cannot determine how it is being used. Facebook, for example, recently apologized after removing a post that contained a swastika but was accompanied by a text plea to stop the spread of hate.
This is an example of the failure of A.I. to recognize intent. Facebook even tagged a picture of the statue of Neptune as sexually explicit. Additionally, algorithms may unintentionally flag photojournalistic work because of hate symbols or violence that may appear in the images.
Historic images shared for educational purposes are another example — in 2016, Facebook caused a controversy after it removed the historic “napalm girl” photograph multiple times before pressure from users forced the company to change its hardline stance on nudity and reinstate the photo.
A.I. tends to serve as an initial screening, but human moderators are often still needed to determine if the content actually violates community standards. Despite improvements to A.I., this isn't a fact that is changing. Facebook, for example, is increasing the size of its review team to 20,000 this year, double last year's count.
A.I. is helping humans work faster
A human brain may still be required, but A.I. has made the process more efficient. A.I. can help determine which posts require a human review, as well as help prioritize those posts. In 2017, Facebook shared that A.I. designed to spot suicidal tendencies had resulted in 100 calls to emergency responders in one month. At the time, Facebook said that the A.I. was also helping determine which posts see a human reviewer first.

“[A.I. has] come a long way and its definitely making progress, but the reality is you still very much need a human element verifying that you are modifying the right words, the right content, and the right message,” said Chris Mele, the managing director at Stink Studios. “Where it feels A.I. is working best is facilitating human moderators and helping them work faster and on a larger scale. I don't think A.I. is anywhere near being 100 percent automated on any platform.”
A.I. is fast, but the ethics are slow
Technology, in general, tends to grow at a rate faster than laws and ethics can keep up — and social media moderation is no exception. Binch suggests that that factor could mean an increased demand for employees with a background in humanities or ethics, something most programmers don't have.
As he put it, “We're at a place now where the pace, the speed, is so fast, that we need to make sure the ethical component doesn't drag too far behind.”
Intel Unveils as-a-Service Offering for IoT Device Onboarding, Security
Earlier predictions that we'd soon see 50 billion devices connected via the Internet of Things might have proved overly optimistic, but the billions of IoT machines already online pose a dual problem, according to Intel.
One, deploying devices at scale -- for example, 10,000 "smart" light bulbs at a time -- can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. And, two, ensuring that IoT devices and data are secure is challenging.
Intel today launched a new offering it said can solve both those challenges: Intel Secure Device Onboard (SDO). Unveiled at the IoT Solutions World Congress taking place Oct. 3-5 in Barcelona, Intel SDO is being offered on an as-a-service basis to IoT platform providers.
The SDO service not only automates and accelerates IoT device onboarding, but uses authentication and encryption technologies to help those devices operate securely, Intel said.
'Zero Touch' Provisioning
Using a "zero touch" model for provisioning, Intel SDO allows multiple devices at a time to dynamically discover a company's IoT platform details for automatic registration and configuration. The service also uses Intel's Enhanced Privacy ID to authenticate devices anonymously and set up encrypted communications.
The growing use of IoT devices has raised security concerns, as studies and reports show they can be prone to remote hacking and used to launch widespread malware attacks. Recent incidents have involved vulnerable devices ranging from baby monitors and drive-through washes to Segways and even Internet-connected fish tanks.
"Shipping default credentials, error-prone human authentication of headless devices, and potentially vulnerable software updates represent fundamental risks to IoT that grow the surface area available for attacks like the Mirai Botnet," Rick Echevarria, vice president of Intel's software and services group, wrote in a blog post yesterday. "That is why the IoT industry needs to automate security and leverage the protections that hardware can deliver. Given the sheer volume of IoT devices (Gartner predicts there will be 20 billion by 2020), security automation is essential to turning the tide."
Weatherford, one company taking part in an Intel SDO pilot program, has tested the service with controllers and wireless sensors used in oil and gas production. According to Intel, Weatherford said it could eventually use the service to manage as many as 870,000 sensor data points for 290,000 wells.
Promoting Blockchain with Oracle
Intel today also launched a "National IoT Strategy Dialogue" aimed at helping the U.S. become "the global IoT leader for decades to come." The report calls for developing and implementing a national IoT strategy, coordinating development of IoT standards and regulations both domestically and internationally, and creating incentives to invest in secure, data-driven infrastructure.
"The report marks the culmination of 16 months of technology industry collaboration, including extensive outreach to a range of federal government stakeholders for their input on advancing IoT policy," according to Marjorie Dickman, Intel's global director and associate general counsel for automated driving and IoT policy. The goal is "solving important societal challenges and driving US competitiveness for years to come," she said.
Meanwhile, another technology from Intel is being used to provide cloud-based blockchain services to enterprise users. Yesterday, at Oracle's OpenWorld conference in San Francisco, which runs Oct. 1-5, Intel announced that its Xeon Scalable processors are helping to power Oracle's Blockchain Cloud Service.
Blockchain services use distributed ledger technologies to provide confidential recording and verification for a variety of different online transactions.
Working together through the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger project, Intel and Oracle plan to continue developing ways to simplify transactions via both blockchain and traditional databases, manage transaction privacy, and promote security for blockchain-enabled smart contracts.
In Memoriam
Intel today also announced that former CEO Paul Otellini, 66, died yesterday in his sleep. A native San Franciscan who joined Intel in 1974, Otellini in 1989 became chief of staff to then-CEO Andy Grove and served as chief operating officer from 2002 to 2005. He was named CEO in 2005, and held that position until retiring in 2013.
According to Intel, the organization "generated more revenue during his eight-year tenure as CEO than it did during the company's previous 45 years." As CEO, Otellini also helped expand Intel's business partnerships, acquisitions, and market positions in security, software, and mobile communications, Intel said. Otellini is survived by his wife, Sandy; his son, Patrick; and his daughter, Alexis.

The family of a man killed in the Las Vegas mass shooting has filed a lawsuit. Robert Kovacik reports for the NBC4 News at 5 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 6, 2017. (Published 5 hours ago)
The Santa Clarita family of a man killed in the Las Vegas mass shooting has filed a lawsuit aimed at freezing the gunman's assets.
John Phippen, 56, of Valencia was killed at the Route 91 Harvest Country Music Festival on Sunday when 64-year-old Stephen Craig Paddock shot and killed 58 people and injured more than 500 others.
The attorney for Phippen's family filed a lawsuit in Clark County, Nevada. It seeks to block Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley, and his brother, Eric, as Paddock's rightful heirs. NBC News reports Paddock was a successful gambler, earning at least $5 million in 2015.
"This is an action for the benefit of all the victims to preserve these assets," said the Phippens' attorney, Richard Patterson.
Patterson says he plans to file suit against Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and its parent company, MGM Resorts International. He also said one other victim could be joining the lawsuit.
"We hope that this doesn't happen again," Phippen's son, Nathan, told NBC4 News outside of the courthouse. "This is a terrible loss for not only our family, (but) the community and the world because we lost an amazing person."

CEDAR CITY–Southern Utah University introduced its new fleet of 17 red and white aircraft to the Southern Utah community on Saturday at the Red Sky Rally, located at SUU's three newly acquired hangars at the Cedar City Airport.
The 10 new Cirrus SR20 fixed wing planes and seven Robinson R44 four-seat light helicopters are owned by SUU and round out the overall fleet of 25 aircraft used in SUU's aviation program. These additions to the fleet brought the community out to celebrate the growth of SUU's aviation program that is on track to be fully owned and operated by SUU. In the past, the program was run in conjunction with the private contractor Upper Limit Aviation. While some of the original aircraft are still leased to SUU, they will be replaced in the future with additional Cirrus aircraft.
As part of the Red Sky Rally event, members were able to get up close and personal with the aircraft on display in front of the hangars. An SR20 played host to curious onlookers as they climbed into the pilot's seat for a look at the cockpit. Pilots and aviation instructors and crew were spread throughout the hangars doling out information on how to read an avionic weather code, the flight paths of the SUU aircraft, safety procedures, women in aviation opportunities and the flight program. In addition, balsa wood planes were given away along with other prizes throughout the night. The event was finished off with the band VanLadyLove giving a concert in the hangar.
A ribbon cutting celebrating the opening of the new hangar and the new aircraft brought Cedar City Mayor Maile Wilson, SUU President Scott L. Wyatt, Executive Director of the SUU Aviation Department Mike Mower and Cirrus representative Matthew Carrigan to the stage for a few minutes to launch this new era in SUU's aviation program.
“There is a big pilot shortage happening, not just domestically in the United States but internationally, and places like SUU that are collegiate and have an aviation program are set up for success right away to fill that pilot shortage,” said Carrington.
President Wyatt emphasized SUU's reason for their commitment to this program as answering the global need for pilots. “This program is evidence we care about the economy,” Wyatt said. “We are becoming more global as a university.”
The fleet growth and addition of what Carrington refers to as “the best-selling single piston aircraft in the world for the past 14 years,” meets several criteria for SUU's aviation program.
Mower pointed out three key factors important to the program; safety, quality of instructors and training in a relevant aircraft.
“These aircraft are the safest most sophisticated trainers in the world right now,” said Carrington. Each airplane is built around the rocket propelled parachute that deploys from the back of the plane when something catastrophic happens. The plane then floats down to safety. Carrington also mentioned additional safety features that have made the 150 knot Cirrus SR20 the chosen trainer plane for flight training programs across the country including the Air Force Academy and airlines.
“The plane itself is built from composite material opposed to traditional metals so that makes it much stronger and much lighter. There is a roll cage built in much like racing cars have to absorb any kind of impact. The seats are rated up to 26 G-force. They also have built in airbags,” Carrington said. “We are trying to take a lot of the safety features you have in your everyday automobile and put them into aircraft such as this, especially when it is an environment where someone is 17 or 18 years old and coming into a collegiate environment and flying the aircraft.”
“At the end of the day we want everybody to come home safe and aviation has inherent risks and we want to mitigate them as much as possible. That is why we went with the Cirrus. That is why we went with the type of helicopter that we did.” Mower said.
Mower explained that the large addition of new aircraft creates a lower student to aircraft ratio. “So our student per aircraft ratio is smaller. That means more airtime, more potential. So, if they are working, going to school it opens up more availability with the fleet.
As for the mission to provide a high quality of instructors Mower said, “Our instructors are not paid hourly they are paid salary. Their sole focus is to give any one on one instruction to the student that is needed at no additional cost.”

Americans always do things differently, including political coups! What's underway now in Washington is nothing less than a slow-but-steady anti-Trump Coup. The goal is to bring down Trump and replace him with Pence. But it's not really about persons…it's about policies, power, money, control, domination, and ideology.
Aligned against Trump and his alt-right cabal is a never-before coalition all intent for their own differing reasons on bringing him down or at the very least weakening him so badly he cannot undo them:
Intelligence Agencies
Republican Establishment
Neocon Establishment
Congressional Leaders of both parties
Major Media including “mainstream” right-wing
Major Corporations and Executives
Obama Legacy appointees
Democratic Party
Stay tuned! Things are going to be far more messy and bloody and dangerous!
A brave Dundee woman was given an extreme spring makeover when her head was shaved to raise money for a foodbank charity.
The newly hairless hero, Joy Watson, went under the clippers at Hillcrest HQ to raise funds for The Trussell Trust.
The Trussell Trust runs a network of over 400 foodbanks across the UK, including 6 across Tayside and the surrounding areas.
Joy said: “The work of Dundee Foodbank and The Trussell Trust is invaluable to people and families across Scotland.
“It is worthwhile cause that I was extremely keen to support and raise money for.
“My new look will take a bit of getting used to but I'm already looking forward to the time it will shave off getting ready in the mornings.”
Joy staged the event, which has already raised over £600, as part of Hillcrest Housing Association's 50 Grand to Lend a Hand staff challenge.
With 50 Grand to Lend a Hand, part of the housing association's 50th Anniversary celebrations, Hillcrest staff from across Scotland are putting on various events to raise a total of £50,000 for a range of charities and good causes.
ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) — On a cool and rainy afternoon during the first week of classes at Centennial High School in this well-to-do Baltimore suburb, about 50 members of the boys' cross-country team sauntered across the parking lot for their after-school run.
Meanwhile, about 30 kids in helmets and pads were going through drills on the pristine artificial turf field at the school's hillside football stadium.
“It used to be the other way around,” said Al Dodds, Centennial's cross-country coach, who has 64 boys on his team this year. “Now, there's a small turnout in football and cross-country is huge.”
Across the athletic complex, a practice football field sat empty, even though it was recently mown and painted with yardage lines and hash marks. In years past, the junior-varsity team would have been relegated to that grass field. But on this day they had the stadium to themselves, as they will for every practice this fall. Centennial isn't fielding a varsity football team because not enough kids signed up to play.
The situation at Centennial — where a long history of losing has dampened students' enthusiasm for football — is unique to this part of central Maryland, but there are plenty of similar examples around the U.S. Participation in high school football is down 3.5 percent over the past five years, according to the annual survey by the National Association of State High School Federations, or NFHS.
The decline would be much steeper if not for a handful of states in the South and the West. Throughout the Northeast, the Midwest and the West Coast, in communities urban and rural, wealthy and working-class, fewer kids are playing football.
“I've never been interested in football,” said 16-year-old Zach Deming, a cross-country runner at Centennial with the solid build of a defensive back. “I'm afraid of getting hurt badly, like getting a serious concussion.”
The risks of football have never been more apparent. This summer, researchers at Boston University said they'd found evidence of a brain disease linked to repeated head blows in nearly all of the 202 former football players they studied. The athletes whose brains were donated to the study had played football in the National Football League, college and even high school.
The report doesn't confirm chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, is common in all football players, because many donors or their families participated in the study because of the players' troubling symptoms.
After years of denials, the NFL acknowledged a link between head blows and brain disease and agreed in 2015 to a $1 billion settlement to compensate former players who had accused the league of hiding the risks.
“There's no question about it. The amount of publicity, beginning with the NFL and what you see on national news, has caused concern among parents,” said Bob Gardner, the NFHS executive director. “Probably some who would have been more inclined to let their young men play, maybe are making different decisions now.”
A study published last month in the medical journal Translational Psychiatry showed that kids who played football before age 12 were more than twice as likely to have mood and behavior problems.
The news hasn't escaped the parents at Centennial, one of the top-rated public high schools in Maryland, where 97 percent of students go on to college after they graduate. Just 10 percent of students qualify for free or reduced-price meals, an indicator of poverty.
“Families around here are more into academics,” Zach said.
Maryland is one of 14 states where participation in football was down 10 percent or more over the past five years, according to NFHS data. In all, 41 states saw a decline between the 2011-12 and 2016-17 school years, and just nine states and the District of Columbia saw increases.
In West Windsor Township, New Jersey, which borders Princeton University and has a median household income of $137,000, one of the two public high schools dropped varsity football this year, and the other might have to do the same next year.
Trinity High School in Manchester, New Hampshire, also disbanded its varsity team, with hopes that it could return in a lower division next year.
At the first practice, the team “had three seniors, one junior, 12 sophomores and one freshman,” athletic director Chip Polak told the New Hampshire Union Leader in August. “Two of the seniors have never played any kind of organized football and the other senior is dealing with concussion symptoms.”
In Ventura County, California, northeast of Los Angeles, Thousand Oaks High School disbanded its junior-varsity team this season because it needed sophomores and juniors to fill out the varsity roster. In Marin County, north of San Francisco, Novato High School announced that it wouldn't field a varsity team this year, but the program got a last-minute reprieve when more athletes than expected showed up for practice.
The decline in participation isn't just limited to wealthy, coastal communities. Among the states where participation is down more than 10 percent are Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois. Population in Illinois has also declined over that period, while in Michigan and Wisconsin it has only grown slightly.
Researchers at the University of Colorado, who studied data from the NFHS and the Census, said in an analysis published Sept. 26 that high school football participation peaked in 2009 before beginning a decline that is likely to continue.
The NFL is paying attention to the numbers and trying to find ways to get kids playing the sport.
“It is important for kids to play sports because it's healthy, it's fun, and they learn important values,” NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said. “Of course, we think football is the best team sport and we aim to ensure there are a range options for young players today — both tackle and flag.”
While participation in tackle football is down, flag football is becoming more popular. Participation in the NFL Flag program run by USA Football for kids ages 6-17 increased by 66 percent from 2013 to 2016, with 385,000 kids playing last year.
In high schools, the expense of the sport and increasing specialization by young athletes are also factors. And while football is declining, other sports are growing, among them soccer and lacrosse. But football is different because it remains the nation's most popular spectator sport, and schools expect to sell tickets on Friday nights.
“The key thing about football is that it's such an important part of the financial picture of schools. Some of these schools rely on the attendance in high school football to pay for these other sports,” Gardner said. “While we certainly applaud the growth of all sports, we remain vigilant about what's going on in football because of the economic impact.”
Around the Centennial football program, there is optimism that varsity football could return next year if the JV team can put together a reasonably competitive season. The team has a strong freshman class, some of whom have never played organized football before.
Toward the end of the 2-hour practice, coaches wanted the first-team defense to get some full-speed reps. That required some creativity.
“If you're not on first-team defense, I need 11 of you to make an offense,” an assistant coach barked. “I need a running back, I need a fullback, I need five linemen, I need a tight end, I need two wide receivers. Let's go!”

When the Vegas Golden Knights went up on the boards at sports books across the valley, fans put down their money on a what they expected to be a unique souvenir of the team's inaugural season. But soon, the bet slips turned serious.
That includes Kar Yung Tom's bet that the NHL's newest team would hoist the Stanley Cup in 2018.
"I was like, 'let's just put $200 and see what happens,'" he said.
Kar Yung Tom bet the $200 last June, before the Golden Knights participated in the expansion draft. At the time the team's odds at the William Hill Sportsbook, where he wagered the bet, were 200-1.
"Two-hundred dollars to win, basically, $40,000," he explained. The 33-year-old hockey fan from Montreal, Canada was in Las Vegas last year for a 'Magic the Gathering,' tournament when he decided to make the bet.
"Vegas being a new team, I was just really excited about the the team they could put together, and thought that at 200-1 it was worth a shot," Tom said.
He wasn't the only one to take that shot. Fans from all overtook a chance on the upstart team, thinking it was a novelty bet. It left the sports books open to massive losses. William Hill Sportsbooks, the book that took Tom's bet, expects to lose six-figures if the Golden Knights win the Western Conference and more than $1 million if the Golden Knights go all the way.
"It's the biggest [liability] I've seen since we've been here. You just don't see this very often," Nick Bogdanovich, William Hill US Director of Trading, said.
So, what's it like watching the Golden Knights hit the ice with $40,000 on the line? At first, Tom had his doubts.
"Once they drafted their team, I was disappointed. I thought that I might as well burn my ticket. I was not happy with the choices they made," he explained.
But, don't worry, Tom didn't burn his ticket. On Monday, he was confident as ever, ready to cheer on the Golden Knights as they head into the Western Conference Finals.
"The first two rounds is the least stressed I've been even though its the biggest prize, because they just look so dominant," Tom said.
"I wish I put more money in!" he added with a laugh.

Edinburgh and Stirling are to be next cities for installation of ultrafast broadband cabling into customers' homes and businesses.
CityFibre announced the Scottish cities will follow Aberdeen in getting one gigabit per second potential speeds, along with Coventry and Huddersfield.
Those already set for the roll-out - in a tie-up with Vodafone - are Aberdeen, Peterborough and Milton Keynes.
CityFibre said it aimed to make digital inadequacy "a thing of the past".
The move means that the existing networks across Edinburgh and Stirling, linking up public offices, schools and hospitals, will now have additional cabling into homes.
The network in Edinburgh currently has 150km of cabling, in the city centre and Leith and extending to Portobello, Lasswade and Corstorphine.
Stirling has 24km laid, with links as far as Bannockburn and Stirling Agricultural Centre.
'Game-changing infrastructure'
The cost of the investment in the two cities is estimated by CityFibre at £110m.
Vodafone has a deal to market the ultra-fast broadband exclusively, until it reaches a fifth of the potential market.
The latest round of investment came as the cabling company announced an agreed takeover by a consortium of investors, led by Goldman Sachs fund, valuing CityFibre at nearly double its preceding share price, at a total £538m.
Greg Mesch, chief executive at CityFibre, said: "Edinburgh and Stirling will be among the first cities in the UK to benefit from this game-changing infrastructure programme, which will have a transformative impact on homes and businesses alike.
"We're moving closer to our vision of a Gigabit Britain, where digital inadequacy is a thing of the past and full fibre connectivity is the norm. For residents of Edinburgh and Stirling, the future is now."
Councillor Kate Campbell, Edinburgh's housing and economy Convener, said: "Edinburgh's already a well-connected city, but this investment will take it to the next level.
"Particularly welcome is that households will see a direct benefit for the first time. The additional capability this has already brought to schools, libraries and other community facilities has made a real difference for everyone who uses them.
"We will work closely with CityFibre to ensure the roll-out is as smooth as possible and residents are kept fully up-to-date with their plans."
Stirling Council leader, Councillor Scott Farmer, added: "Fast and reliable access to the internet is a cornerstone of everyday life for business and personal use and the roll out of these plans will help equip Stirling for today and the future.
"This project underpins Stirling's ambition to have world class connectivity and is just one of the many ways Stirling Council is transforming the area to make sure it is a place where everyone can thrive."

As sports fans, we sometimes take things for granted. It's not entirely our fault. In this day and age, it just seems as if we've just seen everything. So when something truly special happens, it doesn't always attract the appreciation it deserves.
Such is the case for the amazing rivalry that has developed between the Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers over the last few seasons.
We have seen some mighty clashes over the years. There's no denying that the competition during the 1980s between Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers and Larry Bird and the Boston Celtics was fierce.
From 1980-1989, at least one of these two teams was represented in each NBA Finals. The Lakers took home five titles, while the Celtics managed to win three. Los Angeles and Boston owned the decade, but at the end of the era, these two legendary franchises only met in the championship three times in four years.
A look at rivalries in other sports reveals similar storylines.
The Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers lead the way for the NFL, having met three times in the Super Bowl. However these three match-ups occurred in 1976, 1979, and 1996. You'd have to go all the way back to the early 1950s, before the NFL-AFL merger, to find the same two teams vying for a championship in three consecutive years (the Detroit Lions and Cleveland Browns, 1952-1954).
>>MORE: NBA Coverage
In the NHL, you also have to turn back the clock to the early 50s, when goalies did not wear face masks, to find the sport's latest and only trilogy. The Detroit Red Wings and Montreal Canadiens met in the Stanley Cup Finals from 1954-1956. No two teams have done this since.
It's been almost a century in MLB. The New York Giants and the New York Yankees are the only teams to meet in three straight World Series, and it happened from 1921-1923.
Intense rivalries, at the highest level, do not happen often. This is why what the Cavaliers and Warriors have accomplished over the last few years is a truly spectacular.
For the first time in American sports history, two teams will go toe-to-toe in the championship for the fourth consecutive year.
But it didn't always look as if the Warriors and Cavs' round-four matchup would happen.
Golden State dealt with injuries to all four of the team's all-stars this season. Kevin Durant and Steph Curry sat out the most of the four, combining to miss 45 games during the regular season. Curry was also absent in the postseason until Game 2 of the Conference Semifinals.
Golden State then had to get past a Houston Rockets squad that led the league in wins and was structured to match up against this Warriors squad, which obviously was no easy task. They lost former Finals MVP Andre Iguodala in Game 3, and found themselves down 3-2 — backs to the wall — heading into Game 6.
But the Warriors battled and found a way to persevere, winning Games 6 and 7 to clinch their spot in the Finals.
Things looked even more uncertain in Cleveland this season. After Kyrie Irving forced his way out of town last summer, LeBron James was left with a rather weak supporting cast.
Upon struggling throughout the first half of the season, the Cavaliers shook things up at the trade deadline. Cleveland sent six players packing to various cities while infusing the team with some youth by acquiring Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr., George Hill and Rodney Hood.
The Cavs finished the season as the Eastern Conference's No. 4 seed, and needed seven games to get past the Indiana Pacers in the first round of the playoffs. Things also looked gloomy during the Eastern Conference Finals, as James and Co. went down 3-2 against the Celtics.
But as we've seen many times before, James put Cleveland on his back and guided the team to back-to-back victories, even playing all 48 minutes in Game 7.
LeBron has now scored 612 points in the 2018 playoffs, the most ever in a single postseason heading into the Finals. He needs only 148 points to break Michael Jordan's record of 759 points in the 1992 postseason, and considering that he is averaging 34.0 points per game through the first three rounds, this seems like a realistic accomplishment.
So NBA fans, one year later, we are right back where we left off — Golden State vs. Cleveland, Round 4. And everyone should be thrilled with this Finals matchup.
We must applaud what these two franchises have done over the last four seasons. We should enjoy watching five of the last six NBA MVPs who will play in this matchup.
And, most importantly, we should appreciate the moment, as we are watching something that has never been done before, and may never happen again.
We are witnessing American sports history.

INDIANAPOLIS—On June 12, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit largely affirmed a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of sections of the Administration's executive order that attempted to suspend and limit the U.S. refugee resettlement program and also attempted to ban the entry of people from six Muslim-majority countries.
A statement from Bishop Joe Vasquez of Austin, Texas, chair of the Committee on Migration regarding the Ninth Circuit ruling follows:
“I am heartened by the decision of the 9th Circuit to maintain the temporary halt implementing certain provisions of the March 6th Executive Order. Upholding the injunction will allow us to continue welcoming and serving refugees fleeing persecution. Together with my brother bishops, we believe it is possible to simultaneously provide for the security of our country and have a humane refugee policy that upholds our national heritage and moral responsibility. We remain dedicated to accompanying and supporting our brothers and sisters who for various reasons have been forced to leave their homeland. We follow the example of Pope Francis and pledge to them “a duty of justice, civility and solidarity.”

A Birmingham manufacturer which counts brands such as Jaguar and Bentley among its clients has undergone a £22.5 million management buyout.
Erdington-based Precision Micro makes more than 50 million high-precision metal components each year for major global manufacturing customers across multiple markets.
The MBO has been backed by LDC, the private equity arm of Lloyds Banking Group, from owner Meggitt, the global aerospace, defence and energy group.
As part of the deal, LDC has invested £13 million of equity for a unspecified "significant stake" in the company, supporting a management team led by current managing director Ian McMurray.
Precision Micro also operates offices in Germany and The Netherlands and more than 75 per cent of its £15 million sales come from overseas markets.
Its roots date back to the early 1900s when it was founded as a division of engravers V Siviter Smith before establishing itself in Birmingham in 1962 and being acquired by Meggitt in 2012.
Mr McMurray said the investment would enable the company to take full advantage of several positive, global trends in its core markets.
"We see enormous opportunity across our markets as equipment manufacturers look for ever-more cost-effective, reliable, safe and high-performing components," he said.
"Securing the backing of an experienced and supportive partner like LDC means we can invest further in the business, leveraging our technical expertise and processing capabilities to further support our customers around the world with increasingly sophisticated requirements.
"This is an exciting time for our team as we invest in our future growth."
LDC's investment director Chris Handy added: "Precision Micro's reputation for technical excellence, service and innovation is world-class.
"Our investment is all about helping Ian and his team unlock the business' potential by facilitating further investment in its processing capabilities, manufacturing capacity and new product introduction, helping it stay ahead of its market."
Joining the board are Dave Johnson as non-executive chairman and Chris Handy as non-executive director.
Mr Johnson has held several senior positions at companies including Lucas, BTR and Dunlop Aerospace.
Banking facilities were provided by HSBC and advising on the deal were Gateley, BDO, Springboard Corporate Finance, Freeths and Cattaneo.
“The public has been given kind of half a loaf,” said R. Stephen Stigall, a federal prosecutor in the Justice Department's national security unit from 2002 to 2017. “You don't know what else was in those warrants.”
But the memo does not explain what other information about Page the FBI included in its application for the warrant.
The memo says the FBI persuaded a federal judge to approve electronic surveillance of Page on Oct. 21, 2016, three months after Page traveled to Moscow while he was a volunteer for the Trump campaign.
FISA permits the government to monitor suspected foreign intelligence agents. FISA proceedings are classified, and the Republican memo was classified until President Trump declassified it over the FBI's objections.
“The fact the the FISA warrant was renewed three times suggests to me that the FBI was getting foreign intelligence out of this warrant, as it suspected it would,” said Robert Litt, a former general counsel for the director of national intelligence and now an attorney for Morrison & Foerster law firm.
Warrants granted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), such as the one approved for Page, are valid for only 90 days and can be renewed only if a judge is convinced the warrant has yielded valuable intelligence.
The memo also reveals that a federal judge renewed a surveillance warrant on another Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page, three times after the initial approval in October 2016.
The memo clarifies that the FBI investigation into the 2016 election was triggered not by a controversial dossier financed by Democrats, but by information about George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser who met with Russians in early 2016 and is now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller.
The Republican memo released Friday about the federal investigation of President Donald Trump makes two points that some legal experts say support the integrity of the investigation and undermine Republican attempts to discredit the FBI.
“The memo seems to be sort of self-defeating in acknowledging how much other material was involved in triggering this investigation.”
House Republicans said the memo shows the FBI abused its authority by relying on the so-called dossier about Trump and Russia to monitor Page, and not telling the FISA court that the dossier was funded by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. The memo says the dossier “formed a critical part of the Carter Page FISA application” and that “material and relevant information was omitted” from the FBI's application to monitor Page.
A Democratic memorandum that may be released disputes that, according to a person familiar with that memo. The Democratic memo says the FBI, in its warrant application, informed the FISA court that the dossier came from a politically motivated source, though it did not say that the Democratic National Committee had funded the research.
The dossier was written by former British spy Christopher Steele, who had been hired by Fusion GPS, a Washington, DC, research firm that Democrats commissioned in 2016 to investigate Trump's business dealings in Russia.
Page, an unpaid foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign from March 2016 to September 2016, went to Moscow in July 2016 and gave a speech critical of US policy toward Russia. Page acknowledged in November 2017 testimony to the House Intelligence Committee that, while in Moscow, he also met with Russian officials, including the deputy prime minister.
The memo makes no mention of other information about Page that the FBI might have included. Page had been interviewed by the FBI in 2013 in connection with an investigation into a Russian diplomat who was later charged with espionage.
“Carter Page may not be a pivotal player,” said former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti, who is a Democratic candidate for attorney general in Illinois. “You're left wondering, why did this guy have any significant role in the presidential campaign? It's hard to understand.”
The memo is clear, however, that information about Papadopoulos “triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in July 2016.” Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a mysterious professor who'd told him the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. Papadopoulos is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.
Papadopoulos's role in sparking the investigation also “underscores how much stuff the FBI was working with,” said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor.
“The memo seems to be sort of self-defeating in acknowledging how much other material was involved in triggering this investigation,” Vladeck said. “That concession is stunning to me.”
Other aspects of the memo are sure to be disputed. The memo says, for example, that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe told the House Intelligence Committee that “no surveillance warrant would have been sought” without the dossier.
But Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democratic member of the committee, said that is a mischaracterization of McCabe's testimony. "They've seriously mischaracterized his testimony. If that's what he said, they would have quoted directly from the transcript of his testimony, that they possess," he said.
Litt, the former national intelligence counsel, said that he suspects the statement attributed to McCabe is “a paraphrase and out of context.”
“I suspect what Andrew McCabe said was not that the Steele dossier was critical to giving probable cause [against Page], but that when the FBI got the information from Steele, who is trusted and respected, it increased the FBI's interest in moving forward,” Litt told BuzzFeed News.
McCabe left the FBI this week under criticism from Trump and possible scrutiny for his role in investigating Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.
Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, also disputed the memo's assertion about McCabe. “The investigation would have begun and continued even if Christopher Steele hadn't come along,” Schiff said.
The possibility that the Steele dossier was biased because it was funded by Democrats would not automatically disqualify it, said Stigall, the former federal prosecutor.
“Most federal judges, when they review things, they understand fundamentally that most witnesses and informants have some type of bias anyway,” said Stigall, now a lawyer at Ballard Spahr. “People come to law enforcement with some type of baggage. Everybody has it.”
Steele took his findings to the FBI in mid-2016 while he was still working for Fusion GPS, the research firm that Democrats paid to investigate Trump's business dealings in Russia.
Stigall said concerns about Steele's funding source would have been offset by his background working for the British intelligence agency as a Russia expert. “You don't get to be an MI6 officer unless you're fully vetted and found to be credible,” Stigall said.
Still, opponents of the Trump-Russia probe saw the memo as damning.
“It's a pretty devastating blow to the Justice Department, the FBI and the Mueller investigation,” said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group that frequently sues the federal government for records. “We learned there is no Russia-collusion story without the dossier, and if there is no Russia-collusion story, there should have been no special counsel.”
Emma Loop contributed additional reporting to this story.
