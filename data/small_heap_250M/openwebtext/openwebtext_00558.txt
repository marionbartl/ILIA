We don't get to watch New York Giants OTA practices until Thursday, but they are having one today, and Giants.com has video of quarterback Eli Manning throwing passes. See?
This is important because, as you may have heard, Manning had ankle surgery in early April and was supposed to be cleared to start running by around now but wasn't expected to be practicing on the field with his receivers and the rest of his offensive teammates as they learn the new offense being installed by Tom Coughlin and new coordinator Ben McAdoo. The fact that Manning is on the field, taking snaps and throwing passes has to be considered an encouraging sign for the Giants.
Manning values practice time as much as anyone in the league and didn't want to miss any, let alone an entire spring's worth. Coughlin said on draft weekend that Manning had already been out on the field some and that he would be allowed to practice if he had no setbacks, and that appears to be what's happening. The Giants will surely monitor Manning to make sure he doesn't put himself at risk of further injury by practicing. But we all know that Manning hasn't missed a game since becoming the Giants' starting quarterback in 2004 and that he's a quick healer. So it now has to be considered possible that he has something close to a full offseason to prepare for 2014, and that he'll be a full go for training camp when it starts in late July.
VIDEO: Carbon nanotube fibre breakthrough
New nanotube fibres have unmatched combination of strength, conductivity, flexibility
Scientists from Rice University in Texas have unveiled a new carbon nanotube (CNT) fibre that looks and acts like textile thread and conducts electricity and heat like a metal wire. The following article was published on the University's website just a few days ago and the scientists are published in this week's issue of Science.
Rice University's latest nanotechnology breakthrough was more than 10 years in the making, but it still came with a shock. Scientists from Rice, the Dutch firm Teijin Aramid, the U.S. Air Force and Israel's Technion Institute this week unveiled a new carbon nanotube (CNT) fiber that looks and acts like textile thread and conducts electricity and heat like a metal wire. In this week's issue of Science, the researchers describe an industrially scalable process for making the threadlike fibers, which outperform commercially available high-performance materials in a number of ways.
“We finally have a nanotube fiber with properties that don't exist in any other material,” said lead researcher Matteo Pasquali, professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and chemistry at Rice. “It looks like black cotton thread but behaves like both metal wires and strong carbon fibers.”
The research team includes academic, government and industrial scientists from Rice; Teijin Aramid's headquarters in Arnhem, the Netherlands; the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, Israel; and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) in Dayton, Ohio.
Watch the video for the breakthrough fibre..
“The new CNT fibers have a thermal conductivity approaching that of the best graphite fibers but with 10 times greater electrical conductivity,” said study co-author Marcin Otto, business development manager at Teijin Aramid. “Graphite fibers are also brittle, while the new CNT fibers are as flexible and tough as a textile thread. We expect this combination of properties will lead to new products with unique capabilities for the aerospace, automotive, medical and smart-clothing markets.”
The phenomenal properties of carbon nanotubes have enthralled scientists from the moment of their discovery in 1991. The hollow tubes of pure carbon, which are nearly as wide as a strand of DNA, are about 100 times stronger than steel at one-sixth the weight. Nanotubes' conductive properties — for both electricity and heat — rival the best metal conductors. They also can serve as light-activated semiconductors, drug-delivery devices and even sponges to soak up oil.
Unfortunately, carbon nanotubes are also the prima donna of nanomaterials; they are difficult to work with, despite their exquisite potential. For starters, finding the means to produce bulk quantities of nanotubes took almost a decade. Scientists also learned early on that there were several dozen types of nanotubes — each with unique material and electrical properties; and engineers have yet to find a way to produce just one type. Instead, all production methods yield a hodgepodge of types, often in hairball-like clumps.
Creating large-scale objects from these clumps of nanotubes has been a challenge. A threadlike fiber that is less than one-quarter the thickness of a human hair will contain tens of millions of nanotubes packed side by side. Ideally, these nanotubes will be perfectly aligned — like pencils in a box — and tightly packed. Some labs have explored means of growing such fibers whole, but the production rates for these “solid-state” fibers have proven quite slow compared with fiber-production methods that rely on a chemical process called “wet spinning.” In this process, clumps of raw nanotubes are dissolved in a liquid and squirted through tiny holes to form long strands.
Shortly after arriving at Rice in 2000, Pasquali began studying CNT wet-spinning methods with the late Richard Smalley, a nanotechnology pioneer and the namesake of Rice's Smalley Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology. In 2003, two years before his untimely death, Smalley worked with Pasquali and colleagues to create the first pure nanotube fibers. The work established an industrially relevant wet-spinning process for nanotubes that was analogous to the methods used to create high-performance aramid fibers — like Teijin's Twaron — which are used in bulletproof vests and other products. But the process needed to be refined. The fibers weren't very strong or conductive, due partly to gaps and misalignment of the millions of nanotubes inside them.
“Achieving very high packing and alignment of the carbon nanotubes in the fibers is critical,” said study co-author Yeshayahu Talmon, director of Technion's Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute, who began collaborating with Pasquali about five years ago.
The next big breakthrough came in 2009, when Talmon, Pasquali and colleagues discovered the first true solvent for nanotubes — chlorosulfonic acid. For the first time, scientists had a way to create highly concentrated solutions of nanotubes, a development that led to improved alignment and packing.
“Until that time, no one thought that spinning out of chlorosulfonic acid was possible because it reacts with water,” Pasquali said. “A graduate student in my lab, Natnael Bahabtu, found simple ways to show that CNT fibers could be spun from chlorosulfonic acid solutions. That was critical for this new process.”
Pasquali said other labs had found that the strength and conductivity of spun fibers could also be improved if the starting material — the clumps of raw nanotubes — contained long nanotubes with few atomic defects. In 2010, Pasquali and Talmon began experimenting with nanotubes from different suppliers and working with AFRL scientists to measure the precise electrical and thermal properties of the improved fibers.
During the same period, Otto was evaluating methods that different research centers had proposed for making CNT fibers. He envisaged combining Pasquali's discoveries, Teijin Aramid's know-how and the use of long CNTs to further the development of high performance CNT fibers. In 2010, Teijin Aramid set up and funded a project with Rice, and the company's fiber-spinning experts have collaborated with Rice scientists throughout the project.
“The Teijin scientific and technical help led to immediate improvements in strength and conductivity,” Pasquali said.
Study co-author Junichiro Kono, a Rice professor of electrical and computer engineering, said, “The research showed that the electrical conductivity of the fibers could be tuned and optimized with techniques that were applied after initial production. This led to the highest conductivity ever reported for a macroscopic CNT fiber.”
The fibers reported in Science have about 10 times the tensile strength and electrical and thermal conductivity of the best previously reported wet-spun CNT fibers, Pasquali said. The specific electrical conductivity of the new fibers is on par with copper, gold and aluminum wires, but the new material has advantages over metal wires.
For example, one application where high strength and electrical conductivity could prove useful would be in data and low-power applications, Pasquali said.
“Metal wires will break in rollers and other production machinery if they are too thin,” he said. “In many cases, people use metal wires that are far more thick than required for the electrical needs, simply because it's not feasible to produce a thinner wire. Data cables are a particularly good example of this.”
Additional co-authors include Behabtu; Rice graduate students Colin Young, Dmitri Tsentalovich and Amram Bengio; Rice postdoctoral researchers Xuan Wang and Anson Ma, now with the University of Connecticut; Technion's Olga Kleinerman and Yachin Cohen; AFRL's Steven Fairchild, John Ferguson and Benji Maruyama; and Teijin Aramid's Ron ter Waarbeek, Jorrit de Jong and Ron Hoogerwerf.
The research was supported by Teijin Aramid BV, Teijin Limited, AFRL, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Technion's Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute, the Department of Defense and the Welch Foundation.

Andrea Bargnani has torn the ulnar collateral ligament in his left elbow ( Cacciola ).
He is out indefinitely, the team announced, after an MRI revealed the tear on Thursday.
The Knicks said the injury occurred during the third quarter of Wednesday's game against the 76ers.
Here's the video of the play where he injured himself:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbLpm-W5GEo
As per my previous post about the Knicks lack of bench depth, this story seems right on time.
The Knicks are officially falling apart at the seams, with Amar'e Stoudemire and Kenyon Martin already banged up, Cole Aldrich and Jeremy Tyler will have to play a lot of minutes and that leaves the Knicks even more vulnerable than they already were. This is obviously a freak play and not an indictment on Bargnani's ability to stay healthy, but still, this could not have come at a worse time. The Knicks face stiff competition in the next few weeks and that means more minutes for Carmelo Anthony (who is already leading the league in minutes) and likely more losses for the New York Knicks.
The Emmy Award-winning drama series Breaking Bad wraps up its final season next Sunday, September 29, ending a five-season run that introduced millions of fans to the meth business.
Breaking Bad chronicles the moral decline of Walter White, a chemistry teacher who evolves into a drug kingpin to support his family after a terminal cancer diagnosis. White enters the world of large-scale methamphetamine production and sales while staying one step ahead of the authorities.
But how plausible is White's swift rise (and fall) in the meth business? To separate fact from fiction, STATEside turns to Distinguished Professor Ralph A. Weisheit from Illinois State University's Department of Criminal Justice Sciences. Weisheit's research interests include rural methamphetamine production, and he's the co-author of the 2009 book Methamphetamine: Its History, Pharmacology and Treatment.
As someone with such vast experience studying all sides of meth production, abuse, and treatment, what do you think of Breaking Bad?
Breaking Bad is a very well written show and is tremendously entertaining. It is a mix of truth and fiction but has a heavier dose of truth than one usually finds in television dramas. What ultimately makes it a good show is not just the attention to technical details about meth production and distribution, but that it is also a morality play about how good people can engage in evil acts.
What does Breaking Bad get right when it depicts meth?
The creators of Breaking Bad had some knowledgeable people advising them. There are too many points of accuracy to list them all, but a few are worth mentioning.
For example, one of the early episodes shows Walt, the chemistry teacher turned meth cook, and his associate Jesse, the former student and amateur meth cook, manufacturing methamphetamine. The equipment they use is spot on and they were making meth with what is known as the red phosphorous or Red-P method—a method common in the West. The show accurately shows the importance of access to precursor chemicals and how the limited access to ephedrine/pseudoephedrine led them to switch to what is known as the P2P method, a method frequently used in large scale production. It is a method to which Mexican producers turned after Mexico outlawed all ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in 2008.
The show accurately reflects the level of honor, almost reverence, shown to meth cooks who are able to produce a highly potent product. There is also a powerful example of child neglect by extreme users, and there are examples of the paranoia that goes with heavy use. The show accurately illustrates some of the problems that arise in conducting an illicit drug business.
In general, the enforcement side of the story is also pretty accurate, particularly the actions of the DEA. They monitor the kind of meth sold on the street for clues as to who is producing, and they rely heavily on informants. As in the show, in real life many narcotics agents exhibit a passion for their work. For them it is not simply a job, but a calling.
What does Breaking Bad get wrong?
In the end the show is fiction and takes some liberties to keep the audience interested. Hank, the DEA agent and brother-in-law of Walt, the meth cook, experiences much more violence than most agents will ever see. It also is unimaginable that he and his partner would meet and try to arrest Walt in the desert without backup nearby, given that they consider him both a major producer/distributor of meth and a violent man.
As with other depictions of the drug business there is also a distorted image of the money involved. While it is true that the very highest levels of the business can make a great deal of money, most low-level dealers make very little. The structure of the drug business has sometimes been compared to the structure of a legitimate business, such as McDonald's. A few at the top become very rich, but the vast majority gets by on minimum wage. The show also exaggerates the level of violence in the meth business, at least as it operates in the U.S. The violence depicted in the show is pretty accurate for Mexican trafficking organizations. Drug trafficking in the U.S. is violent, but the violence usually doesn't reach the level shown in the program.
In the show, the meth produced by the P2P method was described as just as pure at that produced by the Red-P (ephedrine) method. In the real world, the P2P method is used for large scale production but yields a product that is less potent than that produced by the Red-P method.
Why is meth such an interesting subject for you to continue exploring?
For me, meth is interesting on a variety of levels. First, I have had a long standing interest in the general issue of illicit drugs. Second, meth is one of the few illicit drugs (marijuana aside), that is produced domestically. Third, as a domestic drug it is our problem and not one we can blame on other countries.
Fourth, in addition to its psychopharmacological effects, meth that is produced domestically is unique among drugs in that the production process yields hazardous waste that endangers children present during meth production, contaminates the buildings in which it is made and the soil onto which meth trash is dumped. Fifth, I have a longstanding interest in rural crime, and meth production is largely a rural phenomenon, particularly in the Midwest. Sixth, meth tends to exaggerate existing urges in its users. For example, a violent person is likely to be more violent under the influence of meth and someone with a strong sex drive will be even more sexual under the influence of meth.
Finally, meth is a drug that has attained almost mythical status. On the one hand it is being labeled “The Most Dangerous Drug on Earth,” while it is also a drug that is legally available by prescription for attention deficit disorder, narcolepsy, or extreme obesity.
How do you think pop culture depictions of meth affected its real impact?
As has happened in the past with other drugs, pop culture depictions of meth paint a distorted picture of the drug and that leads to distorted responses. Meth has been described as instantly addictive, but no drug is instantly addictive. For most (but not all) who try the drug it is instantly pleasurable, but that is not the same as addictive. There are controlled users of the drug and those who receive the drug from their doctor with a legal prescription seldom become addicted. The hideous teeth of heavy meth users is a reality for some, but not most meth users. It is also a reality for some, but not most, users of other drugs. There were initial reports that no effective treatment existed for meth, similar to what was once said about cocaine. That isn't true. Abusers respond to treatment with success rates similar to that for other drugs.
There is no question that methamphetamine is a drug about which society should be concerned, just as it should be concerned about heroin, cocaine, and prescription drug abuse. However, our response to the drug should be based on what we know, not on our worst fears.

Near the beginning of this year, the web comic Axe Cop took the Interwebs by storm. It was a pretty inventive premise. Professional comic book artist Ethan Nicolle, age 29, would illustrate a comic written by his younger brother, Malachai.
The hook? Malachai was five years old, and his idea for a comic revolved around Axe Cop--- a cop with an axe. A typical comic would feature bad guys, explosions, several power transformations and dinosaurs with machine guns for arms. I was hooked.
Axe Cop has teamed up with the popular web comic Dr. McNinja. A compilation book will be published by Dark Horse. The comic has been profiled in USA Today, Wired Entertainment Weekly, New York Magazine and more. There's an Axe Cop Motion Comic series that's up to 3 episodes now. It's kind of a big deal.
Which is what made some levels of fail displayed by the artist even more disappointing.
So,
A fan by the name of Keisha Ng posted that she felt Scott Pilgrim had a number of troubling stereotypes and racial themes, especially when it came to Knives Chau and that as an asian woman it bothered her. She ended her comment with "Anyhow, Ethan, I really hope that if an axe cop movie is made that you can include some more characters of color—asian and latino and black kids need to know that they have secret attacks, too."
Ethan's response was... well... here, I'll just quote it (the blog doesn't make permalinks to individual comments):

Stereotypes make great comedy because in general they are true. Whatever anyone has to say about the damage done to people's self image when it comes to stereotype comedy, I think what is much, much, MUCH more destructive is labeling people as victims and giving them all this pity to wallow in… THAT is disabling. Stereotype jokes will always exist, and they will always be funny to most people. They are funny because they contain truth and absurdity. Victimhood and it's butt-ugly cousin hypersensitivity both need to be punched in the face and left out in the cold. I'm fat and white and I grew up poor… fat, white trash stereotypes do not bother me IN THE LEAST. I can recognize the truths, and the absurdities and laugh at them both. I don't think I help anyone out by being soft on them and denying reality. We all need to be able to laugh at ourselves and the hypersensitivity we are all perpetuating is making us all spineless babies.
OH ETHAN NICOLLE NO.
So... people complaining about stereotypes are actually worse than those that perpetuate stereotypes?
Stereotypes are true, and thus, are funny all the time?
No matter how hurt a marginalized group is by stereotyping, the stereotyped group is being damaging by talking about it?
Stereotype jokes are funny to most people, and so people should just shut up about it?
"Let me tell y'all what it's like/bein' male, middle class and white" except, he means it for serious?
Those who point out stereotypes are denying reality, soft, and babies?
What the hell?
This becomes even more mind boggling when you read his explanation for why he regrets drawing a 90 page comic about Jesus teaming up with Ernest Hemmingway to go killing Nazi Werewolf Hitler. He says "

He says " I started out with the attitude, 'a joke is a joke. If you can't take a joke, move on.' I guess I adopted the philosophy that humor makes anything OK." And while when it comes to Christianity, such an attitude is apparently not okay, I guess when it comes to using marginalized groups as the butt of jokes, it's perfectly fine. Then again this is also the same entry where he also says "I'm beginning to sound like a woman... 'you should have done what I told you not to do!' "
ETA: His follow-up comment in that thread is full of even more fail. Here's his response to a commenter who identified herself as South Asian:
Keisha my point is that it doesn't help anyone to coddle them and protect them from generalizations. Fat comic artists are generally lazy, bad with women and socially awkward. That description is not totally true of me, but it is partially true. It's more than 50% true. No one would laugh at or even present a stereotype if it was not true to some extent. If something like “your about as good at ballet as a Native American” you would just confuse people. Stand back and ask what is really offensive about saying asians in general are bad drivers. Is it true? So what? Is it really worth getting all bent out of shape about? Wouldn't life be better if you could just laugh at the joke and make one back?
And of course not all stereotypes are true of all people all the time… no one I have ever met would claim that. That is a point that is literally meaningless.
There are two battles to fight here… you can fight the battle to shut up all jokes about stereotype, or you can fight the battle of people taking victim status upon themselves and being too weak to enjoy life. The first battle will NEVER be won, because most people are OK with generalizations, because generalizations contain an element of truth. If you can't generalize, you can't be truthful. The second battle is much more practical and it makes everyone stronger. If people aren't making victims of themselves it's much harder to stop them from being happy.
Why do you sit and watch a movie and focus on how left out you feel? How often is a fat, poor artsy guy made the hero of a film? Not very often. I don't care. Movies aren't made to appease me. To think so would be narcissistic. It seems as absurd as being offended that Avatar focused on blue people… it made me feel left out because I am as pasty white as boiled pork meat. Lighten up sister! You seem to be taking yourself much too seriously. You'll choke all the joy out of life. In every group or stereotype there are wonderful things, embarrassing things, and hilarious things. Denying that doesn't help anybody out.
Sorry if you feel I've been too harsh. Feel free to email if you want to discuss this any further.
Yes. He really does introduce an Asian stereotype, call people who call out stereotyping too weak to enjoy life, say there is an equivalence in representation between the under-representation of those and other marginalized groups with white poor artists, call her feeling left out narcissistic, compare real minorities to fake blue aliens, tell her to lighten up, and that she is taking herself too seriously.
astolpho
Also, what is it with talking about colors that don't exist in reality when discussing race? Blue people, purple people... it's kind of ridiculous.

ETA the second: So, Doug TenNapel weighs in with a comment, which I can't directly link to, but if you visit the comment link and do a Find for Richard Taco (seriously), you'll find the whole wall of text, but I wanted to highlight the money quote: Your complaints end up saying more about your weakness than his. And you'll just have to trust me on this one, he is respectful and happy about all cultures. Ask him what he thinks of Asian cultures instead of misconstruing what he said. He didn't in any way comment on Asians, he only commented on our white, racist culture's celebration of victimhood. In that sense, you're not acting like a South Asian… you're acting like a spoiled, white American. Asian cultures don't claim victimhood at all. That's a European, progressive, cry-baby attribute we should all shed in the name of being good and being happy. Wow. Wow... a consertive white dude lectures minority on what a real Asian is, and... I... really?

Experts have said it is unlikely that the special counsel's probe will wrap up anytime soon, given the scope of the investigation that has reached into the upper echelons of the White House.
Mueller's team has brought charges against four individuals in the Russia probe, most recently Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty on Dec. 1 to lying to the FBI.
Flynn made a deal to cooperate with federal investigators examining allegations of collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russia during the 2016 election.

Ex-Supersonic Robert Swift—who was charged two months ago with a gun crime—was arrested Tuesday about an hour away from Seattle for armed robbery, reports KIRO. According to KIRO's report, Swift and his accomplice are not criminal masterminds:
According to sources, the 7-foot-1 former NBA basketball player and 28-year-old Carlos Abraham Anderson of Everett put masks over their faces and attempted to rob a home in broad daylight. Witnesses notified the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office. “I believe there were a couple of people who called in, they saw masked subjects on the property, reported that at least one of them was armed with a weapon, one possibly with a baseball bat,” Sheriff's Office spokesperson Shari Ireton told KIRO 7. “It appeared they were either trying to make an entry or knocking on the door.”

The terrible heist planning could be because of Swift's state of mind at the time: KIRO reports that he told deputies while being arrested that he was high (likely on heroin, as he's an admitted heroin addict). Swift also had an outstanding warrant for arrest, as he failed to show up for a day-before-Thanksgiving court appearance on that previous weapon charge.
Swift's life has been spiraling downwards for awhile now. It looks like it may have finally reached the bottom.

For many clients who aren't religious, like Drexler, this concern has been a reality for some time. “Their entire lives have been wrapped up in religion, and they were raised and socialized to have that be everything,” says Patricia Guzikowski, a licensed professional counselor based in Wisconsin. “It is hard for them to make a transition.”
Guzikowski provides distance counseling for clients throughout the U.S., many of whom identify as atheists living in religious communities. She's spoken with women who are afraid of losing custody of their children during a divorce, as a result of losing their faith. She's counseled ex-Mormons and former Jehovah's Witnesses secretly over the phone or through email conversations, so that their families and friends do not find out.
Reddit threads are filled with similar stories of people seeking guidance after religious renunciation. An atheist teenager, whose dad is a preacher, asks for help on how to cope with a loss of faith. In Alabama, one person searches for a non-religious therapist to deal with depression. Another, in Dallas, seeks a secular trauma counselor for PTSD.
And then there's “Grief Beyond Belief,” a support network on Facebook for people who have lost a loved one and want to grieve faith-free. “If you're grieving without a belief that you're going to be reunified or that your loved one is somewhere better, your needs are really different,” Rebecca Hensler, the group's founder, says.
Hensler started the page shortly after the death of her infant son in 2009, and was surprised by the response. She saw stories that read like her own: parents who weren't comforted by the idea that their baby was now “in Heaven,” or that death might be anything other than death itself. Today, the page has nearly 20,000 likes. Users post daily about what it's like to mourn alongside pressures from family, friends, or their counselors. “I couldn't count the number of posts from people who share stories about being in therapy, and then the therapist offers to pray with them or talks about Heaven,” Hensler says. “It's so profoundly harmful to that therapeutic relationship.”
What groups like Grief Beyond Belief ultimately hint at is a basic ideological divide in the way Americans deal with their problems: Some people are comforted at the thought of a higher power, while others are repelled by it. Applying a similar logic to therapy, people want counselors who share their beliefs and can understand their struggles. Perhaps that is part of the reason faith-based counseling has garnered strength in recent years: For religious patients and therapists who've felt underrepresented in a traditionally secular therapeutic community, these programs represent an invaluable part of their identity.
“I identify as a female, wife, daughter, aunt, and Catholic,” says Jill Duba Sauerheber, a licensed clinical counselor in Kentucky. “But I'm also very careful about advertising that I'm a Christian counselor, because I'm a counselor—that's what I am. … When you label yourself as anything, you automatically begin to narrow your client pool, and potential clients can make assumptions about you.”
Inch for inch, Game of Thrones may have the tallest cast on television, especially with the latest addition.
HBO has confirmed to us that Icelandic strongman Hafþór “Thor” Björnsson has joined the cast of Game of Thrones for the show's fourth season, and will be taking over the role of the Mountain, Ser Gregor Clegane.
Though the 6'9″-tall performer doesn't have any professional acting experience, he has racked up an impressive list of accolades. At only 24 years old, Thor has won the title of “Iceland's Strongest Man” for the last three years in a row, and placed third in the 2012 “World's Strongest Man” competition. WiC sources are reporting that Thor was on set in Belfast earlier this August, and that he is currently in Dubrovnik with the rest of the cast, preparing to film scenes for season four.
It is not known at this point whether it will be a speaking part, or if the strongman's face will be covered by the Mountain's helm most of the time. This is a point of interest as Thor is twenty years younger than Rory McCann, the actor who plays Gregor's younger brother, Sandor Clegane.
The role of the Mountain was originated in season 1 by Conan Stevens, and recast with Ian Whyte in season 2. The character did not appear on Game of Thrones during season 3 and many had speculated that the role might be recast a second time.
Ours is the Fury: Thor has a great look for the Mountain, despite being somewhat younger than what we'd expect in the role. The make-up department, facial hair (real or fake), and the helm will help disguise his age. In interviews with Thor, it appears that he speaks English with a strong Icelandic accent, so I'm wondering if he will be dubbed if he has any dialogue in the role. All in all, he's a very promising addition to the cast!

Rasha went missing late afternoon last Saturday. Her peers describe hanging out as normal with the 20-year-old Syrian in the Greek refugee detention camp. Then she vanished. Last Tuesday her friend Amira, 15, received a flurry of images on her phone. Rasha was lying naked in bed with a man. Superimposed upon his head were grotesque cartoon faces and an accompanying message from the anonymous caller: “I promise I will kidnap you also.”
This was far from being the first threat that the teenage refugee from the Syrian city of Qamishli has received since arriving on the Aegean island of Chios six months ago. Existence in the razor-wire-fenced detention centre, a former factory known as Vial, deep within the island's mountainous interior, is fraught for a child hoping for a fresh start in Europe, preferably the UK.
Fellow refugees intimidate her routinely. “Men say they will attack me, they try and trap us by saying don't go to Souda [another refugee camp on the island] or go into the town. They say: ‘If I see you there, I will attack you. I will kidnap you and kill you.'”
Amira is among scores of unaccompanied minors on Chios who are eligible to claim asylum in the UK under the so-called Dubs amendment. A year ago the UK government announced it would urgently offer sanctuary to a sizeable proportion of Europe's vulnerable child refugees, a figure widely understood to be about 3,000 minors until, in February, the Home Office unexpectedly stopped the scheme after helping just 480, one child for every 130,000 UK residents. Not a single unaccompanied minor has been transferred from Greece to the UK under the Dubs scheme.
On Tuesday the last chance to reopen Dubs will be heard in the high court in London, a legal challenge that describes the Home Office's premature closure of Dubs as unlawful and “seriously defective”.
The three-day hearing holds potentially profound ramifications for Chios, which is separated by a slim strip of water from Turkey, so close that Amira can see its summer homes and factories from the island's coast. Beyond lie the borders with Syria and Iraq from where each day people board a motley flotilla of rubber boats and dinghies to attempt the short but perilous crossing to Europe's gateway.
What those that successfully make the crossing quickly encounter could hardly be further from their aspirations of a civilised and safe world. The child refugees of Chios describe being stabbed by local people, police beatings, attacks by the far right, knife fights among drunken adult asylum seekers, and sleepless nights in flimsy tents on pebble beaches.
Most children, Amira included, are too petrified to visit the camp's toilets at night for fear of abuse. Stranded on Greece's fifth-largest island and unable to move until permits are processed, some 4,000 refugees are currently housed in its two overcrowded camps. And the situation is about to get seriously worse. In a fortnight the British government will withdraw its funding for mobile outreach teams in Chios. Soon afterwards, the European commission's humanitarian efforts will be replaced by the Greek government.

Refugee groups claim that the UK, along with the international community, appears satisfied to put Europe's increasingly forgotten migrant crisis behind it. The Conservatives' recent election manifesto even raised the possibility of reviewing the “international legal definitions of asylum and refugee status”. The Home Office has yet to send an official to Chios.
For Greece as a whole, which currently has 62,000 stranded refugees, campaigners say that the Home Office employed only one individual with responsibility for the Dubs scheme.
“Chios is at breaking point. But with funding for services on the island coming to an end for many large NGOs, it feels as if Europe is turning its back on the island,” said Alex Green of Help Refugees, one of the few charities that will remain on the island.
The withdrawal of resources from Chios will leave its unaccompanied minors in an even more parlous position. Last Tuesday, Erez – who claimed to be 16 but looked three years younger – had been in the park near Souda, a favourite haunt among child refugees because it is possible to access wifi leaking from a nearby taverna. Shortly after 6pm Erez was approached by three local people who pinned down his slight frame, then one dragged a knife along the inside of his right arm.
Sixteen hours after the attack, his arm lacerated and dotted with globules of dried blood, he was adamant that he would not be involving the police. “They don't care about us, the police beat us with truncheons. If they see us in coffee shops or away from the camp, they tell us to get off the streets because they are not for us,” said Erez, who wants to make it to London and whose only belongings are a pair of battered flip-flops, a shirt and the shorts that he has lived in since arriving on Chios three months ago.
Erez was attacked close to the precipitous walls that loom above the refugee camp and which have provided an ideal launching pad for far-right groups to indiscriminately hurl rocks and petrol bombs upon the tents below. Some of these assailants are alleged to have links with Greece's main neo-fascist party, Golden Dawn.

Antipathy towards the refugees is steadily growing, with numerous shopkeepers complaining that their presence is undermining tourism.
Last Thursday night an anti-refugee march through Chios attracted up to 400 local residents.
Tensions flourish elsewhere, particularly among the myriad ethnicities and nationalities that reside cheek by jowl in the camps.
Amira says she has been targeted by men because she dared make friends with non-Arabs. “They threaten to kill or kidnap me because I am friends with people from Afghanistan. They say: ‘You are Arab, so why do you do speak to Afghans?' I say we all follow Islam, we are all refugees, but they don't listen.”
Girls and women describe daily life as hazardous. Hidden among the streets behind Souda is the first emergency shelter in Greece for women refugees outside of the camps.
Those who set up the facility describe egregious rates of gender-based violence. Of the 5,000 women and girls who have passed through its doors since July, its founder, Gabrielle Tan of Action from Switzerland, estimates that a majority have endured some form of harassment or violence. Of the single women travelling from Syria via Turkey, 80% are victims. The camps of Chios are chronically unsafe places for women, with no gender segregation making night-time particularly treacherous.
The latest reported incident was at the start of June when a woman was walking to the food queue in Souda and a man attempted to sexually assault her and threatened to rape her. That night six men attempted to break into the hut where she slept.
“There is no safety for them if they don't have a man in their group. Upon arrival in Greece, we've observed they remain extremely vulnerable to exploitation, harassment and gender-based violence in the camps,” said Tan.
Her records identify a correlation of attacks on women increasing when there is overcrowding. Currently Souda holds more than 1,100 refugees, a figure that medical staff on the site say is almost treble the number it can safely hold.
But still women travelling alone arrive – 34 came from Syria last month. One of these, Enas Soan, 30, from Daraa in the south-west of the country, sleeps by herself on the beach because she has heard horror stories from women at Vial and is uncertain of her destiny. “I am stranded, I don't know where to go or what to do.”
Refugee flows through Greece were supposed to stop when the EU and Turkey announced what was seen as a groundbreaking agreement to stem arrivals in March 2016. For a period it worked, and the 850,000 refugees that had arrived in the country in 2015 were soon replaced by a steady, but determined, influx. But the deal now appears to be faltering.
On Chios, 951 refugees – the vast majority of whom are Syrians – arrived in May compared with 21 deportations and 19 voluntary returns. There are rumours that smugglers in the Turkish port of Izmir are offering discounts.
Dr Angela Kallerpi, of Médecins du Monde Greece, said the health of Souda's inhabitants was deteriorating fast. She cited a dearth of medicines, a scabies outbreak and a recent mass bout of food poisoning. Investigations found that people had been storing food inside tents during the day because of Ramadan and eating it at sunset, despite the fact that it had gone rotten.
But psychological issues are the biggest concern. Cases of self-harm, mental illness and attempted suicides have reportedly soared. Kallerpi describes children with a latticework of small self-inflicted cuts on their arms. One recent study found that a third of the refugees on Chios were experiencing mental health problems. A Syrian refugee self-immolated himself in March and died. At the end of June, Médecins du Monde will lose its one dedicated psychologist at Souda because of European funding cuts.
For those like Abdul, 17, from Aleppo, it is a significant loss. The teenager is “very stressed” and has not been sleeping well in his tent on the beach. “Everywhere there is danger, drugs. When I leave camp I see dangerous things. The men in my tent get drunk and make me sing in Arabic. If I don't, they punch me. I see people getting stabbed, blood everywhere. No one can help me.”
Another unaccompanied minor, Ali, 16, also from northern Syria, says that he has witnessed pregnant women being hit. “I don't feel safe anywhere, in the camp and outside.”
Kallerpi is no doubt that the violence is tied to the sense of stagnation. “It's getting more dangerous, but at the same time there's a feeling that the authorities are keen to sweep the entire issue under the carpet,” she added.
Alex Green, of Help Refugees, agreed that, even as the need deepens, the world appeared to be turning its back on the Chios refugees. “For children, especially those travelling alone, this situation is terrifying. It's unacceptable that these young survivors of war have become victims of politics.”
Amira, who wants to become a doctor – hopefully for the NHS, because she “wants to give health instead of making money” – said she would have never contemplated travelling to Chios if she had learned the truth about the entrance to Europe. “Syria was more dangerous, but I feel worse here. If I'd have known Europe was like this, I would not have come.”
Saturday, July 22, 2017 Readings for Feast of Saint Mary Magdalene, July 22 22 July: Saint Mary Magdalene – Feast “Sir, if you carried him away, tell me where you laid him, and I will take him.” Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned and said to him in Hebrew, “Rabbouni,” which means Teacher. Jesus said to her, “Stop holding on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father.” John 20:15b-17b
What a privilege! Mary Magdalene was the first person to see the risen Lord, and there is no doubt that many would have concluded that she was the most unworthy person to receive such a blessing.
We know the story of Mary Magdalene well. She was a very sinful woman who was almost stoned. Jesus did not condemn her and told those who wanted to stone her that the one without sin should cast the first stone. One by one they left Mary, and Jesus forgave her and reconciled her to the Father.
After that, she became a faithful follower of Jesus and radically changed her life. For that reason, we now call her “saint.” But this passage above tells us even more about Jesus and His mercy.
This passage is taken from the account of Jesus' Resurrection. Mary had gone to the tomb only to find it empty. She sat there weeping thinking that someone took Jesus' body away. But suddenly, before her eyes, Jesus was there and alive. His words were piercing and profound. He said, “Stop holding on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father.” There are two things to say about this passage.
First, it was indeed a wonderful blessing that Jesus appeared to her first. This sinful woman was now the first witness and first messenger to the Resurrection. This tells us that Jesus does not discriminate against us because of our past sins. He does not have a long memory holding us forever accountable for what we've done in the past. His forgiveness is absolute when given and it completely restores us to grace if we are open. This is what happened with Mary. Jesus chose her, this formerly sinful woman, to be His first witness of His Resurrection.
Secondly, this passage reveals that Jesus does want us to cling to Him, just not in a purely human way. Mary had come to know Jesus on Earth and now Jesus wanted to deepen His bond with her once He ascended into Heaven. At that time, He wanted to be more than just physically present, He wanted to dwell within her soul and unite Himself to her, and to us, in the most intimate and profound way.
Reflect, today, upon the desire in the Heart of our Lord that we cling to Him in Heaven. Hear Him say to you, “I have now ascended to my Father and I invite you to cling to me with your whole heart. Let me in and allow me to dwell within you in all intimacy. I love you and want to be one with you. Will you let me into your heart?”
Lord, I do want to cling to You. I do choose to be one with You in every way. Come live in my heart and make me one with You. Jesus, I trust in You.

When it finally launches on the market, the 2017 Acura NSX will be one of the most advanced performance cars in production, a feat made all the more impressive when you factor in that you won't need to be a millionaire to afford one (Acura hasn't mentioned pricing but the sticker is expected to fall well below $200k). The individual components found on the car are impressive in their own right, but in the new NSX they're combined in a sexy, mid-engine package that Acura assures us will also be one of the best-handling cars on sale.
DON'T MISS: Ford Moving Quickly To Ensure Cheap, High-Volume Carbon Fiber Production
We're talking about a lightweight, multi-material spaceframe chassis in which a twin-turbocharged V-6 is paired with a nine-speed dual-clutch transmission and works in conjunction with a trio of electric motors powered by lithium-ion batteries. Yes, if you're a tech head, your dream car has arrived in the form of the new NSX.
Starting with the chassis, the engineers decided on a spaceframe design that combined lightweight aluminum and carbon fiber with high-strength steel to boost rigidity while keeping weight down. But it's not just about materials as the engineers also employed some advanced construction techniques, including the auto world's first use of ablation casting, which results in the design flexibility and rigidity of traditional casting with the ductility and energy absorption characteristics of extruded material.

On top of this, the new NSX also features three-dimensionally formed ultra-high-strength steel A-pillars. This allowed the engineers to keep the pillars thin, improving visibility, while at the same time providing the strength to ensure the cabin remains intact in the event of a rollover. Finally, the aluminum-intensive spaceframe is complimented with a carbon fiber floor to add further strength and rigidity.

With the chassis sorted, attention was turned to the body, where airflow—for both aerodynamic needs and cooling—dictated how each panel was formed. Computational fluid dynamics was used extensively during development to allow the U.S.-based development team to maximize the performance of a powertrain being developed in Japan.
According to Acura, the engineers managed to achieve an impressive balance between drag and downforce without the need for any active aero components. At the same time, the body has been designed to also ensure that enough cool air reaches the car's 10 heat exchangers responsible for cooling the electric motors, V-6 and transmission. This has been achieved mostly through the use of vents and precision ducting in key areas around the body.
2016 Acura NSX internal view
For the powertrain, the engineers went with a design that's similar to the one in the Porsche 918 Spyder, a car that was priced close to $1 million. At the heart of the powertrain is a longitudinally-mounted, dry-sumped twin-turbo V-6. It's mated to a nine-speed dual-clutch transmission and one of the three electric motors, and drives the rear wheels. The rear electric motor aids accelerating, braking, and transmission shift quality, and is also used to recharge the battery.

Up front, the remaining two electric motors help provide more forward traction, as well as vector torque to improve handling to a level that the driver should enjoy an “on rails” experience. They do this by applying a precise application of torque, even negative amounts if necessary, at each of the front wheels at any moment. Variable gear ratio steering is also featured to further enhance the handling.
Unfortunately, Acura is still withholding the key performance numbers such as the horsepower and torque, as well as the acceleration and top speed for its new NSX. Hopefully we'll get those numbers soon but already it's safe to assume that buyers won't be disappointed.

Use the simulator to make your own projections for the 2019 federal election.
Note: This is the first version of the model for the 2019 election. It's a very basic model with potentially some mistakes. It'll be improved over time.
Simply enter the voting intentions you want in the first table and see the results, riding by riding. You are responsible for entering percentages that make sense (i.e: each party must be between 0 and 100 at the maximum; the percentages must sum to 100 or slightly less in each province or region).
The numbers here are NOT the current projections from this site, based on the latest polls. It's a simulator available to the public where everyone can enter his/her percentages. The model is likely to be modified until the next federal election.

Quake Live, the popular free-to-play multiplayer arena game, has been changed and repriced to $9.99 after five years of being free, causing outrage from fans of the classic shooter series.
To reprice comes after iD Software, developers of Quake, were acquired by Bethesda in 2009. Other changes include the removal of previous player stats and Linux support.
The game, which was released in its modern form in August 2010, was originally launched as a free-to-play version of Quake that could be played via a web browser plug-in, and was later added to Steam, creating a large and loyal community around the free competitive game.
Since to reprice and removal of Linux support and stats, the game's Steam page has been flooded with negative reviews, and disappointed fans have taken to social media to display their dissatisfaction with the new changes.

WHAT THE Quake Live is not a Free to Play game anymore? — Skynord (@SkynordYT) October 30, 2015
The changes have also warranted several reddit posts and image board threads opposing Bethesda's decision.
But some users defended the publisher. One reddit user claims that John Carmack, co-founder of iD Software and lead programmer of the Quake series, had previously spoken at a convention of Quake Live's lack of profitability, and of the fact that the title regularly lost money from its free-to-play model.
The user went on to state that after five years, Bethesda had no choice but to either shut down the game, or charge for it, and defends their decision to do the latter to keep the game alive.
Despite the presence of some players defending the new changes to Quake Live, it appears a large majority are against them, with some long-time fans even threatening to quit the game altogether, despite the fact that those with the game already installed are allowed to keep it for free.
John Carmack has not publicly commented on the situation, and his only notable public acknowledgment of the changes is limited to a retweet of the announcement made by Quake Live on Twitter.

This article is part of a series about my experience porting apps from Windows Phone to Windows 8. Official porting guidance can be found here and don't forget to follow the Building Windows 8 blog and the Windows 8 App Developer blog for the latest information.
This article will be what my co-worker and friend Ryan Lowdermilk likes to refer to as a “SEO piece”. What Ryan means is while it may not make for easy chair reading, it will still meet a need for those searching for a particular piece of information. The information in this article is how commonly used Windows Phone APIs and XAML features map (or do not map) to their Windows 8 counterparts.
There won't be a lot of dialogs in this article. I'll mention what the API is used for, show the Windows Phone version and show the Windows 8 version. If there are any important tricks to note, I'll list those too.
XAML Namespaces
As mentioned in the first post, namespaces are declared differently
WP – xmlns:imgsch="clr-namespace:ImageSearch;assembly=…"
W8 – xmlns:imgsch="using:ImageSearch"
We change clr-namespace: for using: and we no longer have to specify the assembly name. This is nice because the namespace is resolved across assemblies, so we don't have to have multiple namespace declaration if the same namespace is used in multiple dlls.
XAML Constants
Native Types (string, int) are in a different namespace:
WP – <sys:String x:Key="AppName">Foo</sys:String>
W8 – <x:String x:Key="AppName">Foo</x:String>
These kinds of constants are rarely used in Xaml, but they do come in handy for reusable strings like the application name. Just be aware that in Windows 8 you use the x: prefix for these types.
Touch Input
Windows 8 has a unified input system and no longer supports mouse-specific events:
WP – MouseLeftButtonUp="eventhandler"
W8 – PointerReleased="eventhandler"
The eventhandler above would get called whenever the user releases the right mouse button, raises their finger off the display or removes the pen from the surface. All three input devices are considered “pointers” and each “pointer” can be tracked individually if desired.
Even better, consider using the new gesture and Item events:
W8 – Tapped="eventhandler"
W8 – ItemClick="eventhandler"
Note: Don't forget IsItemClickEnabled="True"
The Item events like ItemClick are especially valuable because you know that a) an item was actually tapped and b) which item it was. This is so much better than trying to use the SelectionChanged event or LeftMouseButtonUp and checking the SelectedItem property.
Event Handler Changes
RoutedEventArgs is still used for most control events like button click. However, RoutedEventArgs is now in a different namespace (and you'll have to change it in your code behind):
WP – System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs
W8 – Windows.UI.Xaml.RoutedEventArgs
Since mouse events are gone,MouseButtonEventArgs is too. Mouse events are traded for gesture or pointer events:
WP – System.Windows.Input.MouseButtonEventArgs
W8 – Windows.UI.Xaml.Input.TappedRoutedEventArgs
W8 – Windows.UI.Xaml.Input.PointerRoutedEventArgs
Navigation
On Windows Phone we navigate to a Uri and we pass any parameters as part of the query string. On Windows 8 we navigate to the Type of the page and parameters can be passed as whole objects.
Windows Phone 7 NavigationService.Navigate(new Uri("/DetailsPage.xaml?Id=5", UriKind.Relative));
Windows 8 Frame.Navigate(typeof(DetailsPage), e.ClickedItem);
Storing Settings – Local
Both Windows Phone and Windows 8 provide a way to store application settings between runs on the same device.
Windows Phone 7 settings = IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings; settings["exampleSetting"] = "Hello Phone";
Windows 8 settings = ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings; container = settings.CreateContainer(“main", ApplicationDataCreateDisposition.Always); settings.Containers["main"].Values["exampleSetting"] = "Hello Windows";
Storing Settings – Roaming
Windows 8 provide a way to store application settings that will get synchronized across the users devices. For more information see Guidelines for roaming application data.
Windows Phone 7 Not an option
Windows 8 settings = ApplicationData.Current.RoamingSettings; // The rest is the same as local settings
Storing Files – Local
Both Windows Phone and Windows 8 provide a way to store files that belong to the application.
Windows Phone 7 using (var store = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication()) { store.CreateDirectory("SampleDirectory"); rootFile = store.CreateFile("SampleFile.txt"); // Open stream rootFile.Close(); // Stream must be closed }
Windows 8 folder = ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder; // This is a StorageFile. It is not open. file = await folder.CreateFileAsync("SampleFile.txt", CreateCollisionOption.ReplaceExisting); // Writes text and closes file in one line await FileIO.WriteTextAsync(file, "Hello World");
Storing Files – Roaming
Windows 8 provide a folder for files that will automatically get synchronized across the users devices. For more information see Guidelines for roaming application data.
Windows Phone 7 Not an option
Windows 8 folder = ApplicationData.Current.RoamingFolder; // The rest is the same as a local file
Storing Files – Temporary
Windows 8 provide a folder for files that will automatically get deleted by the system maintenance task.
Windows Phone 7 Not an option
Windows 8 folder = ApplicationData.Current.TemporaryFolder; // The rest is the same as a local file
Creating a Secondary Tile
Both Windows Phone and Windows 8 offer secondary tiles, but they are created and updated in different ways.
Windows Phone 7 tileData = new StandardTileData { // Set tile data } ShellTile.Create(new Uri("/ItemDetail.xaml?Id=123", UriKind.Relative), tileData);
Windows 8 tile = new SecondaryTile( tileId, // Tile ID shortTitle, // Tile short name title, // Tile display name "Id=123", // Activation argument TileOptions.ShowNameOnLogo, // Tile options "ms-appx:///images/someImage.png" // Tile logo ); tile.RequestCreateAsync();
Updating the Primary Tile
Important : On Windows 8, tiles are created using XML instead of classes. Microsoft has created helper classes to work with tiles as objects instead of XML. These helper classes are included in the App tiles and badges sample. The Windows 8 code below leverages these helper classes.
Windows Phone 7 tile = ShellTile.ActiveTiles.First(); if (tile != null) { tileData = new StandardTileData { // S et tile data } tile.Update(tileData); }
Windows 8 wide = T ileCo ntentFactory.CreateTileWideImageAndText01(); square = T ileCon tentFactory.CreateTileSquareImage(); wide.SquareContent = squareContent; // Set wide and square tile data wide.TextCaptionWrap.Text = "This tile uses images"; wide.Image.Src = "ms-appx:///images/redWide.png"; square.Image.Src = "ms-appx:///images/graySquare.png"; // Update TileUpdateManager .CreateTileUpdaterForApplication().Update(wide.CreateNotification());
Updating the Secondary Tile
Important : On Windows 8, tiles are created using XML instead of classes. Microsoft has created helper classes to work with tiles as objects instead of XML. These helper classes are included in the App tiles and badges sample. The Windows 8 code below leverages these helper classes.
Windows Phone 7 tile = ShellTile.ActiveTiles.FirstOrDefault(<LINQ Query>); if (tile != null) { tileData = new StandardTileData { // Set tile data } tile.Update(tileData); }
Windows 8 wide = TileContentFactory.CreateTileWideImageAndText01(); square = TileContentFactory.CreateTileSquareImage(); wide.SquareContent = squareContent; // Set wide and square tile data wide.TextCaptionWrap.Text = "This tile uses images"; wide.Image.Src = "ms-appx:///images/redWide.png"; square.Image.Src = "ms-appx:///images/graySquare.png"; // Upd at e TileUpdateManager .CreateTileUpdaterForSecondaryTile(tileId).Update(wide.CreateNotification());
Toasts
Important : On Windows 8, toasts are created using XML instead of classes. Microsoft has created helper classes to work with toasts as objects instead of XML. These helper classes are included in the Toast notifications sample. The Windows 8 code below leverages these helper classes.
Windows Phone 7 var toast = new ShellToast
{
Title = "Title" ,
Content = "Toast content" ,
NavigationUri = new Uri("ItemDetail.xaml?Id=123", UriKind.Relative)
}; toast.Show();
Windows 8 toast = ToastContentFactory.CreateToastImageAndText02(); toast.TextHeading.Text = "Heading text"; toast.TextBodyWrap.Text = "Body text that wraps."; toast.Launch = “Id=123"; toast.Image.Src = "ms-appx:///images/graySquare.png"; ToastNotificationManager.CreateToastNotifier().Show(toast.CreateNotification());
Location
Windows Phone 7 watcher = new GeoCoordinateWatcher(); watcher.PositionChanged += watcher_PositionChanged; watcher.TryStart(false, TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(2000)); // Handler private void watcher_PositionChanged(object sender, GeoPositionChangedEventArgs<GeoCoordinate> e) { … }
Windows 8 locator = new Geolocator(); locator.PositionChanged += locator_PositionChanged; // Handler private void locator_PositionChanged(Geolocator sender, PositionChangedEventArgs e) { … }
Accelerometer
Windows Phone 7 accelerometer = new Accelerometer(); accelerometer.ReadingChanged += ReadingChanged; // Handler private void ReadingChanged(object sender, AccelerometerReadingEventArgs e) { … }
Windows 8 accelerometer = Accelerometer.GetDefault(); if (accelerometer != null) { accelerometer.ReadingChanged += ReadingChanged; } // Handler private void ReadingChanged(object sender, AccelerometerReadingChangedEventArgs e) { … }
Open Photo
Windows Phone 7 chooser = new PhotoChooserTask(); chooser.Completed += chooser_Completed; void chooser_Completed(object sender, PhotoResult e) { if (e.TaskResult == TaskResult.OK) { BitmapImage bmp = new BitmapImage(); bmp.SetSource(e.ChosenPhoto); } }
Windows 8 var picker = new FileOpenPicker(); picker.ViewMode = PickerViewMode.Thumbnail; picker.SuggestedStartLocation = PickerLocationId.PicturesLibrary; picker.FileTypeFilter.Add(".jpg"); var file = await picker.PickSingleFileAsync(); if (file != null) { … }
Capture Photo
Windows Phone 7 chooser = new CameraCaptureTask (); chooser.Completed += chooser_Completed; void chooser_Completed(object sender, PhotoResult e) { if (e.TaskResult == TaskResult.OK) { BitmapImage bmp = new BitmapImage(); bmp.SetSource(e.ChosenPhoto); } }
Windows 8 var camera = new CameraCaptureUI(); var file = await camera.CaptureFileAsync(CameraCaptureUIMode.Photo); if (file != null) { … }
Capture Video – System UI
On Windows Phone 7 there is no system-provided UI for capturing video (though a custom UI can be created). On Windows 8, the system UI can be used to capture MP4 and WMV files.
Windows Phone 7 Not an option
Windows 8 CameraCaptureUI camera = new CameraCaptureUI(); camera.VideoSettings.Format = CameraCaptureUIVideoFormat.Mp4; StorageFile file = await camera.CaptureFileAsync(CameraCaptureUIMode.Video); if (file != null) { … }

FRANCE LOCK YOANN Maestri will face a disciplinary hearing after Six Nations Rugby commenced a misconduct complaint against him regarding comments made to the media about referee Wayne Barnes.

France's victory over Wales in the Six Nations last weekend came in controversial circumstances, with les Bleus' back row Damien Chouly barging over for the winning try in the 100th minute of play.
The score came after an interminable series of scrums close to the Welsh tryline in a bizarre passage of play that also included claims of a bite on Wales wing George North, and the suspicious replacement of France tighthead Uini Atonio for a Head Injury Assessment.
Six Nations Rugby continue to investigate the replacement of Atonio with Rabah Slimani – a superior scrummager who had already been taken off for Atonio earlier in the game.
However, Six Nations organisers have also confirmed that Maestri will be brought before a disciplinary hearing following his comments about referee Barnes after the game.
Speaking to French website Rugbyrama after his side's 20-18 win, Maestri said he felt “a little disgust at having been refereed this way until the end [of the game].”
Maestri's frustration centered around the fact that France were not awarded a penalty try in that madcap extra 20 minutes, when the vice-captain believed his side were the dominant force.
“The Anglo-Saxon referees constantly talk about fair play,” said Maestri. “They see us, the French, as cheats but it would be better to concentrate on this Anglo-Saxon composure, which sometimes lacks of bit of candour.”

Maestri now faces punishment for his comments following last weekend's game in Paris, although Six Nations Rugby has not confirmed a date for the hearing.
“Following an investigation, Six Nations Rugby has commenced a misconduct complaint against France vice-captain, Yoann Maestri, following comments made by him to representatives of the media about the referee following the same match,” reads this morning's statement from the Six Nations.
“A disciplinary hearing will now be convened by the Chair of the Six Nations Disciplinary Panel, Professor Lorne Crerar.”
Meanwhile, Six Nations Rugby has also confirmed that Virimi Vakatawa will not face sanction after a disciplinary hearing was convened to consider his accumulation of a yellow card and citing commissioner warning in the Wales game.
Vakatawa was sin binned for a deliberate knock-on and later served a citing commissioner warning for a high tackle.
However, the Six Nations disciplinary committee yesterday decided that “although the player had been guilty of both acts of foul play, no further sanction was necessary.”

Another week of NFL action in the books, another week closer to death. It was a pretty average week; nothing too crazy happened. A quick summary:
The Seahawks managed to stay relevant by edging out the woeful 49ers.
The Jets put up a fight against New England, but ultimately lost.
The Lions lost again (no surprise) and replaced their OC with a man named Jim Bob Cooter. The Vikings are 4-2 without anyone seeming to notice because the Vikings are incredibly dull even when they do neat stuff.
The Dolphins utterly and completely vaporized the Texans. Arian Foster tore his Achilles and is out for the year, and moron backup Ryan Mallett overslept, missed the plane, and was cut on Tuesday.
The Steelers, who managed to beat the Cardinals last week, somehow then lost to a bad Chiefs team without Jamaal Charles OR Jeremy Maclin.
The Cardinals took care of business against the Ravens, who are now 1-6 and have lost each game by less than eight points.
The Panthers continue to dominate, taking advantage of an Eagle team unable to cut down on the mistakes.
The Colts lost to New Orleans. Chuck Pagano's job is officially in major trouble.
The Jaguars won the London game, but tried desperately to lose it first. Bills starter EJ Manuel became the first starting QB to lose in three different countries.
The Chargers are a mess and the Raiders continue to surprise.
Kirk Cousins had one of his good days against the sad sack Buccaneers, who gave up a 24-point lead to lose in the final minute.
The Giants played like crap, but still overcame the floundering Cowboys, who have yet to win without Tony Romo and suffered a very public blowup and media overload because of Greg Hardy.
I went 9-5 last week, not the best outing, but still ahead of the curve. Thankfully, these lost games gave us some great images to work with, especially more Fabio Rob Ryan. So, let's see who surprised!
Condemns Escalating Azerbaijani Military Aggression; Calls for Implementation of Royce-Engel Peace Proposals
WASHINGTON—House Intelligence Committee Ranking Democrat Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) delivered powerful testimony today before key House foreign aid appropriators, calling for the expansion of U.S. assistance to Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabagh) and Armenia, and the implementation of measures to check escalating Azerbaijani aggression, reported the Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA).
Rep. Schiff, who also serves as a Vice-Chair of the Congressional Armenian Caucus, offered his recommendations during a hearing of the U.S. House Appropriations Subcommittee on State-Foreign Operations, led by Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) and Ranking Democrat Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), as this panel prepares the Fiscal Year 2018 (FY18) foreign aid bill.
Video from Schiff's testimony is available below.
“We appreciate Congressman Schiff's leadership in supporting a broad array of Armenian American foreign aid priorities, including continued U.S. support for Artsakh, increased assistance for Armenia's international peacekeeping missions, and a substantial contribution to Yerevan's efforts to settle Middle East refugees,” said ANCA Executive Director Aram Hamparian. “We will continue to work with members of the State-Foreign Operations Subcommittees in both the House and Senate and with appropriators in both chambers to strengthen the U.S.-Armenia partnership and promote a durable and democratic peace for the Republic of Artsakh.”
In voicing his support for increased U.S. assistance to Artsakh, Rep. Schiff noted that he is “deeply disturbed by the escalation of violence in the last year and the major military assault by Azerbaijani forces against the people of Artsakh,” noting the “strong evidence of human rights abuses on the part of Azeri troops, and the appalling desecration of the bodies of Armenian and Artsakh citizens.” Schiff went on to outline three concrete steps Congress can take to address these concerns, including implementation of the Royce-Engel peace proposals, the suspension of U.S. military aid to Azerbaijan, and the expansion of humanitarian aid to Artsakh.
Schiff stressed that the U.S.-Armenia relationship “is founded upon a shared commitment to freedom and democratic values,” citing Armenia's participation in U.S. led peacekeeping deployments. He emphasized the importance of ongoing foreign military financing assistance for peacekeeping purposes, funding for U.S. training opportunities for Armenian officers, and recommended no less than $40 million in U.S. economic assistance to Armenia.
Schiff also focused on the important role Armenia has played as a “regional safe haven for Middle East refugees,” noting that over 20,000 individuals from Syria have found a new home in Armenia. The Congressman requested that the Subcommittee's proposed FY18 foreign aid bill include provisions supporting Armenia's efforts through aid and international organizations.
Why is it that so many of nature's most awe-inspiring specimens seem to meet their end under such stupid circumstances? Some of you may recall reading about The Senator in recent weeks. The massive tree — which stood for over 3,500 years in what is now Longwood, Florida — was the oldest pond cypress tree in the world, and was believed to be the fifth-oldest tree on the planet. And on January 16th of this year, after smoldering unnoticed for over a week, The Senator became engulfed in flames and fell to Earth, utterly destroyed.

For over a month, officials have been puzzling over the cause behind the tree's igneous undoing. Now, according to Florida's WFTV news, they finally have their answer:
In January, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Service initially suspected an arsonist, and also believed that lightning could have caused the fire. However, through Crimeline tips, they learned [26-year-old Sarah Barnes] and a friend were inside the tree taking methamphetamine. Agents said Barnes took pictures of the fire and downloaded the images to her cellphone and computer. Officials said she showed people the images, and said "I can't believe I burned down a tree older then [sic] Jesus."

Yeah. We're having a hard time wrapping our heads around the absurdity of the situation, ourselves, Sarah.

Cop acquitted in Beardsley Park stomping Bridgeport officer found not guilty in attack on man in Beardsley Park
Bridgeport police officer Clive Higgins gets a hug from a fellow police officer after being found not guilty, after his trial outside of Federal Court in Bridgeport, Conn., on Wednesday Jan. 14, 2015. Higgins was one of three officers involved in a stomping of a suspect in Beardsley Park in 2011. less Bridgeport police officer Clive Higgins gets a hug from a fellow police officer after being found not guilty, after his trial outside of Federal Court in Bridgeport, Conn., on Wednesday Jan. 14, 2015.

BRIDGEPORT -- He said he never stopped praying.
And then at 2:47 p.m. Wednesday, Police Officer Clive Higgins' prayers were answered.
That's when a U.S. District Court jury ended what a family member described as 13 months of hell. After deliberating for just 2½ hours, jurors cleared the suspended cop of any wrongdoing in the May 20, 2011, videotaped beating of Orlando Lopez-Soto in Beardsley Park.
Upon hearing courtroom deputy Yelena Gutierrez read the verdict, Higgins, tall and muscular, rose with a big smile and tears welling.
He nodded thanks to the 11 white and one black Fairfield County residents who sat in judgment as the jury. After they left, he hugged his lawyers, Assistant U.S. Public Defenders Paul Thomas and Kelly Barrett.
U.S. District Judge Jeffrey A. Meyer then told Higgins he could leave the courthouse "a free man" after being on trial for the past three days.
"I never stopped praying," said Higgins, a 12-year police veteran who teaches Sunday School at Mount Aery Baptist Church. "I did a whole lot of praying. Now, God has spoken."
Higgins maintains, "I never did anything wrong."
The jury's decision is the third in recent weeks clearing a police officer of what activists like Scot X. Esdaile, state president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, claim is police misconduct. From Day 1, the backlash sparked by decisions clearing an officer in the fatal shooting of a teen in Ferguson, Mo., and another in the chokehold death of a Staten Island man, hovered over this case.
"This result is very shocking," said Esdaile. "It's a gross miscarriage of justice."
Esdaile said jurors treat police officers differently than others.
"It's not an issue of color, but of right and wrong," he said. "The NAACP did not fight so long and so hard to get diversity in departments, only to have a police officer conduct himself in that manner."
Frank Riccio II, a local defense lawyer who represented an East Haven police officer convicted in a similar federal case, said jurors are instructed to return a verdict of not guilty if they have any reasonable doubt as to a defendant's role.
"So a verdict of not guilty does not necessarily mean that the defendant is innocent," he said. "It means that the government did not prove their case beyond reasonable doubt."
Higgins was the last of the three police officers to face a federal criminal charge stemming from the incident, which Timothy Fennell videotaped while relaxing in the park.
Previously, Elson Morales and Joseph Lawlor, two other 12-year police veterans assigned to the Violent Crime Initiative task force, pleaded guilty to a federal misdemeanor charge for violating Lopez-Soto's civil rights by kicking him. They resigned from the department and face up to a year in prison.
Neither testified against Higgins.
"An armchair quarterback would question why the government did not call those two officers (Morales and Lawlor) as witnesses," Riccio said. "Maybe their testimony would have made a difference."
Instead, First Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Gustafson and Assistant U.S. Attorney Anastasia King relied primarily on Fennell's video recording, which has drawn nearly 430,000 views on YouTube since appearing in January 2013.
It shows Lopez-Soto falling to the ground after being jolted by a stun gun, with Morales in pursuit.
Morales and Lawlor are seen kicking the prone victim, and Lawlor is even seen stomping on him. It shows Higgins pulling up in a cruiser, walking around Morales and launching a kick.
Thomas called no witnesses in Higgins' defense. Instead, he relied on his blistering cross-examination of Lopez-Soto, a twice convicted gun-toting, crack dealer who he described as an "outlaw" for leading police on a high-speed chase down city streets in an unregistered, uninsured minivan.
He also used FBI Special Agent Emil Parelli's interview of Higgins to tell his client's side of the story. Parelli testified that Higgins was concerned Lopez-Soto was armed and kicked him to keep him from getting up.
Thomas pointed out that Lopez-Soto was wearing an empty holster around his waist, while a loaded 40mm handgun, marijuana and crack cocaine were in the van.
The defense lawyer urged the eight-man, four-woman jury to review the video much like an NFL referee responds to a football coach's challenge on a controversial call.
He said what actually happened still "remains as blurry as the video that is the heart of the government's case."
Afterward, Thomas said the jury "took a very careful look at the totality of the government's evidence and found it unconvincing."
"From the onset, Higgins consistently represented that he didn't want Lopez-Soto to get up," said Edward Gavin, a Bridgeport lawyer who handled the officer's case in its early stages.
After the verdict, Higgins repeated his concern that Lopez-Soto presented a danger to people in the park.
"We had information 10 days before the May 20 arrest that he was terrorizing the East Side with a gun," Higgins said. "This guy was running around crazy."
Following the Beardsley Park incident, Lopez-Soto was taken to St. Vincent's Medical Center for facial cuts and bruises, one of which required a stitch.
Bridgeport paid him $198,000 to settle the brutality lawsuit he brought.
U.S. Attorney Deirdre Daly, who sat through portions of the testimony, said her office respects the jury's verdict and complimented the FBI and prosecutors "for their hard work" on the case.
"Our office will continue to prioritize civil rights investigations," she said.
Meanwhile, several police officers rolled up to the courthouse to congratulate Higgins as he left. He told everyone he could that his lawyers "were amazing."
He remains on administrative leave, Police Chief Joseph Gaudett said in a written statement Wednesday.
Higgins, who wears a back brace and walks with a cane, said his focus now is to recover from back and knee injuries he said were suffered on the job. When asked if he would return to police work, he said that it was up to his doctors.
"I'm a Christian man," Higgins said. "I should never have had to go through this nonsense. I was hired to protect the citizens of Bridgeport and that's all I ever tried to do."

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Germany's Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier at the Kremlin in March | Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP via Getty Images German foreign minister: Ease Russia sanctions ‘step-by-step' In some EU nations hurt by Russian sanctions, a backlash is growing to extending them in July.
BERLIN – German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier believes easing EU sanctions on Russia — provided it fulfils certain conditions — is an important element in the hunt for a solution to the fighting in eastern Ukraine.
“We should be smart when it comes to dealing with these sanctions,” he told foreign journalists in Berlin on Tuesday. “To me, ‘smart' means that if there is truly substantial progress — and currently there is no such progress, yet — we can consider easing sanctions, step-by-step.”
The EU's sanctions on Russia's energy, financial and defense sectors, imposed following Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula two years ago, expire in July. Over the next month, the bloc is to decide whether to renew them.
“It's no secret that several countries within the EU are skeptical” —Frank-Walter Steinmeier
So far, the European Council and the European Commission have stressed that any lifting of sanctions would be tied to Moscow implementing all conditions laid down in the Minsk ceasefire agreed in February 2015, aimed at halting the fighting in eastern Ukraine between pro-Russian separatists and Kiev's government forces.
"I want to state clearly that our stance vis-à-vis Russia, including economic sanctions, will remain unchanged as long as the Minsk agreements are not fully implemented," European Council President Donald Tusk said last week on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Japan.
However, a backlash is growing in some countries — particularly those whose exports have been hit hard, such as Germany itself, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Austria and Italy — against plans to extend the strict sanctions regime without changes.
“It's no secret that several countries within the EU are skeptical,” Steinmeier said.
At the same time, those EU countries that feel most vulnerable to what they perceive as Russian aggression, such as the Baltic states and Poland, oppose the idea of lifting sanctions. They have the backing of the United Kingdom.
Steinmeier stressed that while further progress in implementing Minsk is a precondition for lifting certain sanctions, Russia should be given incentives for improving security in eastern Ukraine or cooperating to hold elections in the region.
"I'm not proposing that we say 'tomorrow we'll get rid of this or that sanction,'" Steinmeier said, adding that discussing the sanctions instead of just extending them was also important to prevent conflict among the 28 EU countries.
Steinmeier's Social Democrats have historically pushed for close political ties with Moscow.
“We have the responsibility to preserve unity in the EU, after the migration debate we had last year which put Europe under immense stress, and ... with another stress factor coming up on June 23," he said, referring to the U.K. referendum on EU membership.
Steinmeier said he expects substantial discussions about Russian sanctions ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers on June 20, adding: "Whether my proposal becomes reality depends on how talks over the next month with our European partners go. The signals coming from European capitals are very different: The ones from Budapest are different than those from London."
Steinmeier's Social Democrats (SPD), currently part of conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel's 'grand coalition' government, have historically pushed for close political ties with Moscow.
DETROIT -- Tennessee Titans controlling owner Amy Adams Strunk said the Titans were fined over their ownership structure shortly after she assumed her role in March 2015.
A league source said the fine was six figures; a second said it was "a lot."
Strunk said the team appealed, but the league still has the money.
"We don't think there's anything wrong with our structure," Strunk said Sunday as she headed for the locker room at Ford Field after the Titans' 16-15 win over the Lions. "So that's where we differ."
Strunk said the disagreement is not heading to a lawsuit.
"We are going to get it resolved," she said.
Strunk is in charge of the team, but she does not own a majority stake.
She and her sister, Susie Adams Smith, each own one-third of the team; the wife of team founder Bud Adams' deceased son and her two sons each own 11 percent.
"We don't comment on specifics about our owners' relations with the league," Titans CEO and president Steve Underwood said. "As you know, we have had an ongoing dialogue with the league for over two years, and we expect to continue this conversation.
"Just so the record is clear, the club is not for sale and has never been for sale."
The NFL said it would not comment.
At the Super Bowl in San Francisco, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell addressed the team's ownership.
"We have ownership policies, the ownership policies are lengthy, but essentially they require a single owner to represent the club locally, but also at the league level," he said. "We work on the basis of 32 individual owners, each having a vote. When league matters come up, whatever they may be, we work on a vote of 24 of the 32. It's a very important principle to owners and their partners.
"They want to know who their partner is, they want to know who's responsible for how the team is operated locally and they want to know that their partner is sitting at the table when they are making difficult decisions. So we will try to encourage our policies to encourage that type of behavior."
Before that news conference, New York Giants team president and CEO John Mara said he didn't think there was a big issue in Tennessee and said the steady hand of Underwood made him comfortable with the Titans.
"I don't know if it's a major issue, no," he told ESPN. "I don't think so. As long as you have a good, capable executive running the team, which I think Steve is, and I think they've got a good team, a good coach and a good general manager. They'll be fine."
RICHMOND, Va. — Virginia is one of the leaders when it comes to the nationwide craft beer boom, which is at a nationwide record high.
The Brewer's Association, who represents small and independent American craft brewers, released 2015 industry data that shows there are more breweries than ever before in the states. Craft brewers now represent 12 percent market share of the overall beer industry, but because of their premium-priced offerings, their sales represent a 21 percent market share.
Virginia was one of four states, all in the South region, that saw a net increase of more than 20 breweries. This trade association news came the same day that Oregon-based Deschutes Brewery announced Roanoke will be the site for their East Coast production facility.
Brewers in Virginia benefitted from the 2012 Senate Bill 604, a change in state law which allowed breweries to serve beer without selling food. Since then brewers have said they had a financial motivation to open.
It was a year after SB 604 passed that David Hunter started the Fans of Virginia Craft Breweries on Facebook. He was hooked on Virginia craft beer after trying Midnight Brewery's Rockville Red. He invited 50 of his friends to join his Facebook group in March 2013 and now the page has almost 8,000 members statewide.
“There were four breweries in Richmond at the time [SB 604 passed] now we're in the teens, with many more on the way,” Hunter said, in a previous interview.
There will soon be a total of 15 breweries/cideries (and a meadery) open in Richmond city, and a total of 26 breweries operating in the metro-area. More than half of all the breweries in the Richmond-metro area are in the city.
Richmond craft brewers continue to flourish
Currently, within Richmond's 60 square miles, there is almost one brewery per 10,000 people. That's based on 2010 Census data that excludes people under the age of 20. It's one brewery per 10,413 persons. Within a two-mile radius there are 11 breweries.
This year in the small, historic neighborhood of Scott's Addition, five breweries are set to open.
Ardent Craft Ales, Black Heath Meadery, and Isley Brewing are already open in Scott's Addition. Reservoir Distillery has been producing whiskey on Summit Street since 2009, and recently opened a tasting room at 1800 Summit Avenue. Within the next two months, Buskey Cidery, Veil and Three Notch'd plan to open. Vasen Brewery and Blue Bee Cidery will open in fall 2016, maybe sooner for Blue Bee.
Outside of Scott's Addition, Castleburg Brewery, on Ownby Lane near Hardywood, has an April opening planned. Stone Brewing just opened, but is not yet selling beer brewed in Richmond. Outside of the city, off Midlothian, Steam Bell Beer Works has a spring opening planned. Kindred Spirits in Goochland hopes to open in May.
Double-digit boom, nationwide
Over the past eight years, craft brewers have seen a double-digit boom, nationwide. In 2015, the number of operating breweries in the U.S. grew 15 percent, totaling 4,269 breweries — a record high.
Of those craft brewers, 2,397 are classified as microbreweries; 1,650 are brewpubs and 178 are regional craft breweries. The Brewers Association says 620 new breweries opened last year – and only 68 closed.
Last year the output for craft brewers increased to 24.5 million barrels, with a 16 percent increase in retail dollar value. The total U.S. beer market grossed $105.9 billion
Combined with already existing and established breweries and brewpubs, craft brewers provided nearly 122,000 jobs, an increase of over 6,000 from the previous year.
UPDATE: Neighbors are not surprised a shooting happened in the area. They say there have been numerous robberies.
"There has been four robberies that I know of at that house," neighbor Jessica Ponder says. "The homeowner who shot the man was just protecting his property."
A suspected burglar is dead after a homeowner was forced to shoot the man as he attempted to enter a home Saturday night.
According to a press release, Rusk County deputies responded to a shooting around midnighton Dec. 17 to a home on County Road 102 West Henderson.
It was reported that a white male had entered the home without the consent of the owner. During the incident, the intruder failed to stop when advised to by the 51-year-old homeowner.
The homeowner fired one shot, striking the intruder in the chest and causing him to stop and fall down. The intruder, identified as 20-year-old Samuel Brown from Longview, was later pronounced dead and an autopsy ordered.
The case remains under investigation at this time and will be presented to the Rusk County Grand Jury.
It has been a busy week for the plankers, in which they have suffered their first casualty, gained 100,000 converts and prompted a statement from Prime Minister Julia Gillard. In the early hours of Sunday morning, 20-year-old Australian Acton Beale fell seven storeys to his death from the balcony of an apartment block in Kangaroo Point, Brisbane. He and a friend had been performing planks on their journey home from a night on the town. The planking craze had only truly exploded in Australia two days earlier, when police arrested another young man for planking on the hood of an unoccupied police car. Nate Shaw, a 20-year-old, pointed out that he had done no damage and hurt no one, but was nonetheless charged with being found - quite literally - on police property without excuse.
The arrest made headlines, and the Planking Australia Facebook page grew almost overnight from 8000 fans to well over 100,000. But dedicated hipsters will have heard of planking years ago. Though it is now biggest in Australia, it is an English - some would say, quintessentially English - creation. It began 14 years ago with a pair of bored kids. Gary Clarkson, then 15, and his friend Christian Langdon, 12, would perform the plank in public places, amusing one another and baffling onlookers. Back then, it was known simply as the Lying Down Game.
It was a pointedly pointless way for the boys to pass the time. As Clarkson puts it: "It was just a really stupid, random thing to do." For its first 10 years planking spread at a snail's pace, from Clarkson and Langdon to their friends at school and, after a while, on to other kids from the neighbourhood. Then, in 2007, when the pair created a Facebook group for their game, the pace accelerated. Soon, they had a few thousand followers. Photographs of plankers trickled in from all over the world: American plankers on the tops of their televisions, British plankers in trees, and Europeans on country roads and the banks of fjords. The craze began to garner its first major press coverage in September 2009, when a group of seven accident-and-emergency staff were suspended pending disciplinary hearings for playing the game while on a night shift at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon.
They had been planking on resuscitation trolleys, ward beds, floors and even the helipad. They might not have been caught had they not then posted the photos to Facebook, under the slightly self-defeating name The Secret Swindon Emergency Department Group. An employee of the hospital's governing body told the press: "It reflects badly on the department and some people may lose their jobs." Things escalated. A few days later, in Stoke-on-Trent, a mass gathering of plankers for a simultaneous lie down attracted more than 100 people.
The photos posted to Facebook became bolder and more bizarre. One audacious airport worker performed the plank in the idle engine fan of a jet plane. It's not clear - and Clarkson and Langdon don't remember - where exactly the idea for planking came from. Some commenters have linked the practice to the 1995 video for the Radiohead song, Just. In the video, a man lies down on a busy London road and a crowd of strangers gathers to try to understand and help him.
He refuses to move, or to tell them why he's lying there. They persist, and eventually he relents. He tells them - but not us, the viewers - and all we see, in a long slow punchline of a shot, is that now the entire crowd is lying down on the pavement as well. Whether the video is the inspiration or not, it captures something of planking's essence. Loading "People generally think you're mad," as creator Gary Clarkson puts it. "That's sort of the point."

15 April 2013 | Margaret Thatcher (1925-2013)
The official obituaries have been, as often happens, partial in both senses: sympathetic and incomplete. With regard to the divisive effect of her reign, one omission was significant and glaring: Section 28.
Lest we forget, this nasty, brutish and short measure of the third Thatcher administration, was designed to slander homosexuality, by prohibiting state schools from discussing positively gay people and our "pretended family relations". Opposition to Section 28 galvanised a new generation of activists who joined with long-time campaigners for equality. Stonewall UK was founded, to repeal Section 28 and pluck older rotten anti-gay legislation from the constitutional tree. This has taken two decades to achieve.
Pathetically, in her dotage, Baroness Thatcher was led by her supporters into the House of Lords to vote against Section 28's repeal: her final contribution to UK politics. She dies too early to oppose Parliament's inevitable acceptance of same–gender marriage.
Thatcher misjudged the future when, according to her deputy chief whip, she "threw a piece of red meat (Section 28) to her right-wing wolves". Some of these beasts survive her, albeit de-fanged. When, to take a recent example, a disgraced cardinal delivers anti-gay diatribes, the spirit of social Thatcherism is revealed as barren, hypocritical and now pointless.
Thatcher's acting was mannered and unconvincing; from her pious St Francis quotation (sneaking a prompt from the script in her hand) as she first entered Downing Street; to her scripted gags at Conference; to the ludicrous "We are a grandmother"; to dolling herself up as Elizabeth 1, in cloak and ruffled collar. After a dinner for President Mubarak, I heard her refer to "my government". I wonder what the real Queen thought about that gaffe.
Her womanliness was a weapon, we are told, in cabinet. At the end of a Downing Street reception, I was the last to leave, alone with Mr and Mrs Thatcher. In that low voice, trained to sooth, she said flirtatiously: "Mr McKellen, I like your suit. Where did you get it?" "It's Japanese, Prime Minister." She grimaced like a nanny: "Naughty, naughty!" and closed the double doors in my face.
After opening in the National Theatre's Richard 111 in Paris, I was having breakfast alone in bed, watching the television relay from London, where the cameras were fixed on the front door of Number 10, waiting for Mrs Thatcher's final exit as Prime Minister. She had been in Paris earlier that week, when the vote went against her on the first ballot. The ambassador gave the NT actors the champagne he'd had cooled for her victory party that was never held.
Now the phone rang: "This is 10 Downing Street". I thought it was a colleague having a joke but no: "The Prime Minister has been trying to reach you. She has it in mind (so the officialese goes) to recommend that the Queen give you a knighthood." Flummoxed, I asked for time to think it over. Then, just as I put down the phone, the big black shiny door opened and the Thatchers emerged, she's crying a little. It was if she had kept the world waiting until she knew for sure that I'd been contacted. Of course not. But nevertheless, I suppose the very last thing Thatcher did as prime minster was to organise my knighthood. Ding dong, maybe, but thanks all the same.

The simple answer is that wood doesn't melt because it burns first. If that seems a little like giving your son the brush-off, we can go into some more detail.
Typically substances go through two phase transitions as they're heated up: solids melt into liquids, liquids boil into gases. There are plenty of exceptions to this basic pattern, though, and in some cases a chemical reaction transpires before the phase transition can take place. Here is the reaction we're talking about is combustion: anything with a combustion temperature lower than its melting temperature will burst into flames before it starts getting gooey.
So say you're heating up a hunk of wood. Up through 500 degrees Fahrenheit or so, mostly what you're doing is driving off moisture. As the temperature increases, though, the wood starts to break down chemically, liberating the lighter organic compounds (methane, methanol, etc) into the surrounding air in a process called devolatilization.
Somewhere north of 1,000 degrees these compounds will start to burn, and the resulting heat will ignite the final, the least volatile portion of the wood: the stuff, largely carbon, that combustion pros refer to as char. After the char burns, what's left is the ash, which consists of wood's inorganic components — most often calcium, potassium, and magnesium compounds. And these minerals will in fact melt, usually at between 1,900 and 2,200 degrees. My assistant Una reports seeing huge wood-fired industrial furnaces where the molten ash runs down the walls like honey.
OK, someone pipes up from the back, but what if you heated the wood in a vacuum, so it couldn't burn? Sigh. Well, the water and volatile matter would evaporate off in the early going, leaving behind the char. The inorganic stuff would then melt as described above, and finally, if you cranked the temperature way up to 6,400 degrees or so, the carbon itself would liquefy — which I guess is as close to melting wood as you're going to get.
Dear Cecil:
Long ago you determined that it still cost less than a penny to mint a penny. It's a far different world today, and I find it hard to believe that the cost of minting a penny is less than the face value.
Cecil replies:
No flies on you, Westerr. It's true that as of 1998, when last we discussed this topic , minting pennies wasn't a losing proposition. Each one then cost about four-fifths of a cent to manufacture, giving them a low but still positive profit margin — or seigniorage, as it's known in the currency biz — of 20 percent. But that was then. Stamping out a one-cent piece now costs about 1.25 cents. Given pennies' vestigial role in the economy, the government's insistence on minting them has gone from pointless atavism to expensive hobby.
What happened? Well, copper's gotten a lot pricier in the intervening decade — 75 cents a pound on the London Exchange in '98, $3.84 as of deadline — but a penny is only 2.5 percent copper. The rest is zinc, and thanks to greatly increased demand from China, that's been in short supply for a while now, sending the price up from 47 cents a pound to as much as $1.50. Zinc production is catching up, creating some relief, but it's doubtful that making a zinc-copper penny will ever cost less than a penny again.
And the penny's not even the big problem. The reigning negative-seigniorage champ is the humble nickel, which now has an extravagant price tag of about 7.7 cents. Nickels are 25 percent nickel and 75 percent copper, so here we're dealing with the big price hike for copper plus a similar one for nickel: $2.10 a pound ten years back, $11.92 now. As demand for nickel has gone way up (China again being a major consumer), America has stopped supplying it: we had no nickel mines in operation last year, and we sold off the last of our strategic reserves in 1999. (According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the Energy Department's got maybe 14,000 tons of nickel lying around that's been “contaminated by low-level radioactivity,” but that's little help. Who's going to take a radioactive nickel?)
Concerned about coins disappearing from circulation, the mint introduced a regulation last year levying a $10,000 fine against anyone who melts down pennies or nickels for the metal. Great, but they'll have to catch a lot of melters to put a dent in the many millions we're losing annually by making the coins at all. Amid general resignation that neither the penny nor the nickel is going away anytime soon, the House just passed a bill requiring that henceforth both be made from less-expensive steel. The Treasury Department opposes it, but something's gotta give. A country that's $9.4 trillion in the hole could clearly stand to quit throwing so much good money after bad.

Former Assassin's Creed game designer Patrice Desilets believes his former employer, Ubisoft, should invest the time and effort to give players the choice to play as a woman in Assassin's Creed Unity, something the developer pulled back on due to "the reality of production."
At E3 this week, Unity creative director Alex Amancio explained why the cooperative multiplayer game features four versions of protagonist Arno and why the developer excluded the option to play as a female assassin.
"It's double the animations, it's double the voices, all that stuff and double the visual assets," Amancio said. "Especially because we have customizable assassins. It was really a lot of extra production work."
In an interview with Polygon, Desilets said that Amancio's reasoning — that it would create extra work — was valid, but that Ubisoft should put in the effort to let players have gender options.
"It's true. If you do a big giant character and a small character, or a woman and a guy, it's different," Desilets said. "But that shouldn't stop you. With all the time, money and people on that project, you could've done it."
The game designer, who was terminated by Ubisoft last year and is currently involved in litigation with his former employer but still has friends on the Assassin's Creed team, hoped that the publisher would be bolder with its game design choices as they relate to diversity.
"You know what would have been really awesome? Four women," he continued. "Then people would be like, 'Wow, they've got big balls.' Imagine four girls. It would have been really a strong message of what Assassin's Creed Unity is about."
Desilets, who has two young daughters, said he thinks that some game publishers and developers get caught in a cycle of making and selling games to a particular audience, and that informs decisions like the choice to prioritize male avatars over offering gender options.
"They always try to sell the same thing," he said, referencing the commercial underperformance of female-led games like Remember Me as cited evidence for why certain games don't sell well. "So it's easy to win the argument: 'See, that's the only thing that sells' — because that's the only thing to buy.
"That's why the game that I'm designing, I'm giving control back to the player," he said. "Which gender do you want to play? Let's start there."
A former soldier who participated in a riot at a north Belfast interface told police he had suffered a psychotic breakdown and felt he was fighting the Taliban, a court has heard.
Newtownabbey man James Burns - who served two tours of Afghanistan during his career in the Army - was handed a three-year sentence at Belfast Crown Court after he admitted being involved in a riot in July 2015.
The court heard the 26-year old, from Hydepark Manor, was present for around three hours, during which time he was seen throwing missiles such as bottles and bricks at police lines. At one point, he was also observed setting a bin on fire.
Despite a request from his barrister that his case should be deemed exceptional and that he should be spared a jail term due to significant mental health issues, Burns was handed a three-year sentence.
Her Honour Judge McCaffrey told the former soldier he will spend 18 months of his sentence in prison, with the remaining 18 months on licence when he is released.
After sentence was passed and he was being led from the dock in handcuffs, Burns shouted that the sentence was a “f***ing disgrace” and said “give that 18 months to Tony Blair.”
Before she passed sentence, Judge McCaffrey was told that trouble flared in the area on July 13, 2015 following a Parade Commission's determination banning an Orange lodge and loyalist band from returning past the nationalist Ardoyne shop fronts area.
Around 25 police officers were injured after police lines were pelted with masonery, bricks, bottles and other items including fireworks.
The riot was recorded by police and Burns was captured on CCTV. Present for around three hours, a prosecutor said Burns was “masked at times, and other times he wasn't.”
Two days after the riot, Burns attended a police station voluntarily and said “I'm here to hold my hands up.” He made full admissions of his involvement and claimed he thought he had a psychotic breakdown on the day in question, and was fighting the Taliban.
Telling the court the Crown accepted Burns had mental health issues, the prosecutor said he came before the court with 47 previous convictions.
Defence barrister Declan Quinn confirmed Burns suffered from a range of mental health deficiencies - many which are linked to his former career in the Army.
Mr Quinn revealed Burns has been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, suffers from nightmares about strangling people and “hears the voice of a friend who was killed in Afghanistan.”
Burns has also abused Tramadol and other medication and has a history of drugs and alcohol misuse.
Regarding the offence itself, Mr Quinn said Burns regretted his involvement and is not sectarian but rather became involved in a “crowd mentality”.
Mr Quinn concluded by saying: “He is not a bad or dangerous individual, but he got himself into a position where alcohol played a major factor ... and there was an element of playing to the ground and playing to his peers.”

I'm aiming at you, lover
Cause killing you is killing myself – Orson Welles (director), The Lady from Shanghai,1947
He's invincible. He beheads. He smuggles. He conquers. He's the ultimate jack-of-all-trades. No Tomahawk or Hellfire can touch him. He always gets what he wants; in Kobani; in Anbar province; with the House of Saud (which he wants to replace) trying to make Putin (who he wants to behead) suffer because of low oil prices.
If this was a remake of Orson Welles's noir classic The Lady from Shanghai, in the mirror sequence the lawyer (American?) and the femme fatale (Shi'ite?) would also get killed; but The Caliph of Islamic State would survive as a larger than life Welles, free to roam, plunder and “give my love to the sunrise” – as in a Brave Caliphate World shining in “Syraq” over the ashes of the Sykes-Picot agreement.
He's winning big in Iraq's Anbar province. The Caliph's goons are now closing in on – of all places – Abu Ghraib; Dubya, Dick and Rummy's former Torture Central. They are at a mere 12 kilometers away from Baghdad International. A shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile (or MANPAD) away from downing a passenger jet. Certainly not an Emirates flight – after all these are trusted sponsors.
Hit, in Anbar province, is now Caliph territory. The police forces and the province's operational command have lost almost complete control of Ramadi. The Caliph now controls the crucial axis formed by Hit, Ramadi, Fallujah; Highway 1 between Baghdad and the Jordanian border; and Highway 12 between Baghdad and the Syrian border.
The Caliph's goons are no less than taking over the whole, notorious Baghdad belt, the previous “triangle of death” in those hardcore days of American occupation circa 2004. Message to Donald Rumsfeld: remember your “remnants”? They're back. And they're in charge.
Both Ramadi and Fallujah have been reduced to an accumulation of bombed-out schools, hospitals, homes, mosques and bridges. Residential streets are virtually deserted. According to the United Nations, there are the least 360,803 internally displaced persons in Anbar, as well as 115,000 others in areas under The Caliph's control. At least 63% of the 1.6 million people living in the province are classified as “in need” – with hair-raising minimal access to water, food and health care, and receiving little to absolutely zero humanitarian support from that fiction, the “international community.” US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power is not screaming her lungs out for R2P (“responsibility to protect”).
How could the Pentagon's spectacular Full Spectrum Dominance possibly not see any of this happening? Of course they see it. But they don't give a damn. The Pentagon occasionally uses AH-64 Apache helicopters to attack some of The Caliph's goons in Ramadi and Hit. But Apaches can be easily hit with MANPADS. They are stationed at Baghdad International and their only mission is to protect the airport. Who cares about local, civilian “collateral damage”?
Married to the Mob
In Kobani, the former third-biggest town in Syrian Kurdistan, in the far northeast, The Caliph also wins big. Another biblical exodus has reached 300,000 refugees – and counting, with over 180,000 headed to Turkey.
The Caliph counts on indirect help from The Sultan (or alternate Caliph), aka Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan. Tehran is – rightfully – furious, as it sees the “West” – and Turkey – betraying the Kurds all over again. It's no secret Sultan Erdoğan is doing nothing because he wants to screw the guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Syrian-Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD); let them die instead of repelling The Caliph and then be strong enough to threaten Turkish domination of those huge, essentially Kurdish patches of Anatolia. Thus the only thing Sultan Erdoğan does support is aimless bombing by the Pentagon cum coalition of the clueless-cowards.
Anybody who believes the US Central Command's spin that House of Saud and United Arab Emirates fighter jets conduct “bombing raids” on the outskirts of Kobani gets a one-way ticket to Oz. Imagine these clowns being able to deploy precision-guided bombs or trained laser spotters. To start with, the Pentagon has zero local intel – as in zero operatives able to paint lasers on targets. Thus the “coalition” can barely hit the odd tank (out of 25 around Kobani) or Humvee out of 2,000 crammed in a valley for almost two weeks now.
But the “coalition” certainly is able – miraculously! – to hit Syrian state infrastructure, as in energy installations. In June, the official Pentagon excuse was, “We don't have any drone assets in Iraq.” Now there's no excuse for drones which can read a “Smoking Kills!” warning in a packet of Marlboros not hitting The Caliph's assets in Kobani – or in Anbar province for that matter. So it's down to a mix of incompetence and neglect. It was so much easier to hit Pashtun wedding parties in the Waziristans. Especially because no one was paying attention.
Erdoğan's own goons, meanwhile, have instituted a curfew on all major towns and cities in southeast Anatolia, and are even gunning down peaceful Kurdish protesters. Fifteen million Kurds in Anatolia cannot be wrong; Erdoğan wants Kobani to fall. Ankara remains for all practical purposes the top logistical hub for The Caliph's goons. The Sultan is using The Caliph as a proxy army to smash the Kurds.
Terminal evidence has been offered by the leader of the Kurdish PYD, Salih Muslim, meeting Turkish military intel and asking for help. Conditions: abandon any hope of self-determination for Syrian Kurds; give up all your self-governing towns and regions; and watch as we install a Turkish “buffer”/no-fly zone inside Syrian territory.
Don't expect the Obama “Don't Do Stupid Stuff/We Have No Strategy” administration to sentence, “Erdoğan must go”. Besides, the pathetic club of National Security Advisor Susan Rice and her deputy Ben Rhodes has no clue about what's goin' on.
To the Green Zone!
Tehran, for its part, has clearly identified Erdoğan's nasty game. The Sultan knows monster B1-B bombers flying over Kobani are absolutely useless – while The Caliph's goons deploy massive car bombs and keep advancing. “Boots on the ground” will be needed. Enter NATO asset Turkey. But with one condition: regime change in Damascus, or at least a prelude, via that “buffer”/no-fly zone over Syria.
The Big Picture remains the same. Sultan Erdoğan and the House of Saud want regime change in Damascus (Erdoğan dreams of a Sunni puppet as a vassal of Ankara; the Saudis want their own Wahhabi schemer). Israel merrily agrees. And if that comes with a bonus – attacking the new Iraqi government, still supported by Iran, in the American-made Green Zone – even better. The lowdown: “Don't Do Stupid Stuff” translates as the Gulf Cooperation Council, Turkey and Israel using Washington to advance their quite explicit agenda.
Sultan Erdoğan, as a Mob boss, does seem to heave learned a thing or two from watching Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. He's extracting the maximum pound of flesh from the bewildered “Don't do Stupid Stuff” team. The Sultan is boldly aiming at Turkish boots on the ground gloriously invading Syria in NATO “humanitarian intervention” mode. And all this sold as NATO offering “protection” to a member-nation. NATO's new secretary-general, former Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, has just been to Ankara. Saudi Arabia has already “voted” out loud for the “buffer”/no-fly zone. Same for General Francois Hollande, that pitiful excuse for President of France.
Once again, it's Tehran to the rescue. The Foreign Ministry has duly announced Iran is ready to liberate Kobani from The Caliph's goons (and they can do it) if Bashar Al-Assad says the word. Now that's how you work the chessboard; NATO is left with zero excuses to mount an invasion of Syria, whatever Mob Boss Erdoğan comes up with.
Operation Hands Off My Toyota
The Caliph also wins big in the “bleeding the Pentagon” department. A single US “strike” against his goons – involving F-15s, F-16s or F-22s – costs up to US$500,000. The Pentagon has just revealed it has spent no less than $1.1 billion against The Caliph since June.
What for? Virtually all the assets being destroyed by American bombing are made in the USA, deployed to the Iraqi army and then duly captured during The Caliph's offensive. So here we have the Empire of Chaos spending a fortune from the US Treasury to smash tanks, Humvees and other gear already paid for by American taxpayers. No wonder taxpayers are fuming. Thus Operation Hands off My Toyota.
Additionally, the Pentagon does not have a clue on how to build its Obama-designed proxy “rebel” force to fight The Caliph (with no US soldiers or marines; only fanatic Wahhabis and assorted mercenaries).
To start with, they have no clue who the hell qualifies as a “moderate rebel”. The rabble must be “vetted” – and then sent to, of all places, Saudi Arabia for training. There the guy in charge will be – who else – a Special Ops honcho, Major General Michael Nagata. Even under the most optimistic scenario, the Pentagon won't have its proxy “moderate rebel” army on the ground in Syria before the summer of 2015.
Hefty bottles of Chateau Margaux can be bet that all this prime US weaponized know how it will ultimately end up captured by The Caliph's goons. The same applies to reliable “rebel” intel on the ground.
But the real Dadaist masterpiece is that first these “rebels” will be politely asked by the Pentagon to forget about getting rid of Assad to fight The Caliph. At least for a while. Re-enter Stoltenberg, the new NATO head: “Next year, at the ministerial meeting, we will take decisions regarding the so-called spearhead but, even before it is established, NATO has a strong army after all. We can deploy it wherever we want to.” OK, tough guy; why not “Syraq”?
If this all sounds like a plot straight out of hit series Blacklist, that's because it is. Why not get Red (James Spader) to fight The Caliph? And then again, what if Red is The Caliph? He pretends to fight himself – and he wins, handsomely. Back to Welles' The Lady from Shanghai: “Killing you is killing myself”. Yet nobody could possibly want The Caliph dead when he's such a smashing, undisputed box-office success.

Will the new fall TV shows succeed in depicting disabilities honestly?
The increase in disabled characters is heartening but visibility isn't everything. Many shows, particularly comedies, depict physical, mental and developmental disability in a clumsy, ill-considered way.
The upcoming fall TV season will include an unprecedented number of disabled lead characters, largely thanks to NBC. Their new slate includes the sitcoms Growing Up Fisher, which depicts a blind man, Mel (J.K Simmons), and his family dealing with divorce, and The Michael J. Fox Show, in which the actor plays a news anchor with Parkinson's. The network is also remaking the '60s drama Ironside with Blair Underwood as the titular cop on wheels. These shows will join FX's already-airing The Bridge, which includes a main character who has Asperger syndrome.
But while an increase in disabled characters is heartening and perhaps suggestive of a growing commitment to diversity, visibility isn't everything. Many shows, particularly comedies, depict physical, mental and developmental disability in a clumsy, ill-considered way. Although 30 Rock was satirical, its treatment of disability mirrored real world ignorance. It framed disabled characters as objects of pity (the girlfriend who can't be dumped because she's deaf and uses a wheelchair), grotesques (an “inbred” foreign prince) and weirdoes (Kathy Geiss, the barely verbal CEO's daughter whose final scene crudely parodied the achievements of autistic activist Temple Grandin). The return of Arrested Development highlighted how horribly ableist the show has always been. (What's funnier than giving an amputee a literal “big hand”? Pretty much anything, it turns out).
One of the worst offenders—and I mean that literally—is Glee. The show, now going into its fifth season, has included many disabled characters, winning an award from the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences for “television with a conscience” as a result. However, Artie, the primary disabled character, is hugely problematic. Not only is he played by a non-disabled actor, Kevin McHale (who appears uncomfortable in his wheelchair), he often requires non-disabled characters to school him in the reality of his physical limitations. In fact, a key purpose of disabled people on the show is to allow non-disabled characters to demonstrate their wisdom and compassion. When cheerleading coach Sue allows Becky, who has Down syndrome, onto the squad, it proves she isn't a monster, and when Rachel's being a witch-with-a-B about having a sore throat, she visits her handy local quadriplegic, former athlete, Sean, for some perspective. Although Zack Weinstein, an actor with a spinal cord injury, played this role, he was presented passively, lying down looking wistful while other characters sang over him, a tableau that only perpetuates all-too-prevalent stereotypes about disabled people as tragic figures.
In drama, disability is often lazily used to signify a character's inner turmoil: We know Dr House is emotionally damaged because he walks with a cane, and in PBS' Sherlock, Watson's limp clears up as soon as he has a juicy murder to take his mind off his troubles. (Hey, we've all been there.) At the other extreme are characters whose disabilities give them preternatural talents, as if as compensation. This may relate to intellectual ability—Monk's OCD makes him an exceptional detective—or to ass kicking: the Russian mobster-fighting, CIA head of tech ops on Covert Affairs just happens to be blind.
ABC Family's Switched at Birth, which has four deaf actors in lead and recurring roles, is one of the few shows to attempt a realistic portrait of disability. Its preposterous premise involves parents from different sides of the tracks accidentally raising each other's kids, but not only does it address the challenges of being deaf and the politics of the deaf community in a nuanced way, it also explores class and race issues, while remaining more like an entertaining program than an afterschool special. Earlier this year, the show broke new ground by screening the first all-ASL episode ever seen on TV, which was truly revolutionary. But it was marred slightly by the use of intrusive and unnecessary background music. And in many episodes, cameras cut away while characters are signing, meaning that people whose first language is ASL would be unable to follow the dialogue without subtitles, suggesting the show is more invested in its hearing audience.
Similarly, Parenthood, which has been widely praised for its sensitivity toward Asperger syndrome, has not wholly impressed some autistic people. Although Max Burkholder plays now-adolescent Max Braverman with wit and charm, his storyline is primarily told from the viewpoint of neurotypical parents adjusting to their child's diagnosis rather than showing his perspective. It doesn't help that the actor works with a doctor specializing in autism to get his portrayal right, rather than speaking to people with the condition. To prepare for her role as bipolar CIA officer Carrie Mathison in Homeland, Claire Danes watched YouTube videos documenting people's real life manic episodes, studying the illness from the outside in.
But there seems to be an increased willingness for actors to work with experts with actual lived experience. Journalists at the recent Television Critics Association press tour noted the specificity of Blair Underwood's knowledge of paralysis, the result of his work with David Bryant, who is paraplegic. For her part on The Bridge, Diane Kruger consults with a man with Asperger syndrome to craft an accurate depiction. This attention to detail is especially impressive given that her character's condition is not immediately disclosed. Many other shows, including Sherlock, Community, and The Big Bang Theory, include characters who are coded as having Asperger's without explicitly labeling them as such, thus ducking out of any responsibility to accuracy.
However, it would be more progressive to see disabled actors, including wheelchair users and people with Asperger syndrome, take on these kinds of roles. In Breaking Bad, RJ Mitte might not have cerebral palsy to the extent of his character, Walt Jr., but his insider's understanding allows for a more realistic portrayal. In CSI, the fact that Doc Robbins uses prosthetic legs and a cane is neither a source of shame nor a defining characteristic, probably because the actor who plays him, Robert David Hall, shares his disability. And Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage, who has achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism, bagged an Emmy and a Golden Globe for his role as Tyrion Lannister. I'm too squeamish to watch the show, but disabled actress Mandy Colleran assures me, “Tyrion is a fully formed, properly rounded character. He isn't a cipher.”
Still, disabled actors playing well-drawn disabled characters in lead roles on network TV are harder to find. That's why The Michael J. Fox Show has the potential to be such a breakthrough. Not only will Fox play a character with the same illness as himself, but he's also helped to create the role. Judging by early footage, the show finds humor in fame and family but will also wring laughs from his disability. The difference compared to most comedies is that these jokes are informed by experience rather than assumptions, allowing for the subversion of stereotypes (“inspirational” montages of the type Glee would sentimentally celebrate are mocked twice in the trailer alone). Of course, the fact that Fox is a star means he's been given a platform few artists have access to. It would be unfair to place the pressure for an increase in mainstream opportunities for disabled writers and performers on the success of his show. But if it does find an audience, it could be the start of a new era of disability on TV.
It is well past time.
The first law of musical robotics: rock hard.
We've seen plenty of robotic musical experiments, but finding a robot that can seriously shred is another matter altogether. Meet the robotic string instrument, Poly-tangent, Automatic (multi-) Monochord – let's just call her PAM. Built by Expressive Machines Musical Instruments, a group of University of Virginia PhD students and composers, PAM is capable of creating raucous musical performances like the one above, by composer and EMMI member Steven Kemper.
Musical robotics is cool, but it also hasn't evolved much technologically in fifty years. It's gotten cheaper and more accessible, but the fundamental design hasn't changed – and that accessibility hasn't translated into widespread use.
Now, the EMMI crew, in anticipation of a residency at Amsterdam's famed STEIM research center, are hoping to take robotic music to the next level. MARIE is a project to put robotic music in a form that you can easily take on the road. They want to make the project open, so others can benefit, complete with schematics and code.
There are several aspects that make the MARIE project special beyond just road-ready design. The new instruments are intended to be more modular and controllable, to make the robotics as flexible as classic MIDI and analog modular gear has been. They also benefit from acoustic sound creation, controlling columns of air and physical strings instead of just digital or electrical models as on synths.
Acoustic design is at the heart of the EMMI robotic instruments – part of what makes robotics a compelling medium for new, digitally-controlled soundmakers. All photos courtesy EMMI.
To fund their vision, the EMMI crew have started a Kickstarter project. You get something in return from your investment, including even training on robotics and good, old-fashioned instruments like the sax and bassoon. (That should put to rest any fears that these guys want a robot-only musical future.) Here's how they describe their work:
MARIE is a set of virtuosic and expressive music robots that are portable, reliable, user-friendly, and fit within the dimension/weight limits for international checked baggage. In other words, these are music robots for touring musicians. The hope of EMMI and the EAR Duo is that the usability and portability of MARIE and similar music robots will finally push this powerful technology out of research labs and onto stages around the world. Within this aim, the entire project will be publicly documented online and the source code and hardware diagrams all provided as public knowledge for other enterprising musicians and technicians to construct similar robots.
EMMI-ers, I hope you keep CDM posted as you go. It looks like a very worthy project indeed.

As we reported earlier this afternoon, the Steelers had an especially heavy presence at the Baylor Pro Day today.
Mike Tomlin, Kevin Colbert and Joe Greene were just some of the staff members on hand to watch defensive lineman Andrew Billings go through his paces.
Related Steelers Mike Tomlin, Kevin Colbert, Mean Joe at Baylor Pro Day to see Andrew Billings
According to James Palmer of NFL Network it appears the Steelers took the initiative to get to know the potential 1st round pick a little better by taking him out to dinner on Tuesday night as well. A dinner with “Mean” Joe even, a fellow Texas born native, who grew up less than 90 miles away from the young draft prospect:
You could see the excitement on Andrew Billings' face when he told me he got the chance to have dinner with Mean Joe Greene last night — James Palmer (@JamesPalmerTV) March 16, 2016
To hear Billings was excited by his meeting with “Mean” Joe is understandable, given the legendary player he got a chance to meet with and an honor many in SteelerNation will love to have had.

Given his years in scouting for the Steelers, although officially retired these days, Greene was often used to evaluate the quality of a prospects character. The fact that the team brought in Greene to clearly assess Billings, says a lot about how interested they must be in him ahead of the draft. There is a good chance Billings would be available to the Steelers with pick no. 25.
By all accounts Billings looked good in his drills and tests, that can only have impressed the watching Steelers representatives:
At the end of the Baylor Pro Day, David Smoak of ESPN had a chance to talk to “Mean” Joe and ask him a little about his thoughts on the days activities and Andrew Billings in particular.
I caught up with Steelers Legend/Temple Dunbar High Joe Greene at #ProDayBU #YMTC https://t.co/85725AUi7r — David Smoak (@DavidSmoak) March 16, 2016
If you click on the link above you will be able to hear a short interview, but for those of you unable to listen to audio right now, we have transcribed much of what “Mean” Joe said:
“Today I'm just looking at this defensive lineman, this is my first time out in two years, so what a better place to come than hometown, this is like hometown.” “(Billings) He has the body type for the position, he's strong, he's quick and I saw a little nasty in him”
Many did not expect Billings to run in the 40-yard dash, given he had put up a decent time at the NFL Scouting Combine. Greene had an interesting perspective on Billings change in heart and also stressed the importance of family and support that the young prospect has behind him:
“That means he is a competitor, he had a time that he ran at Indianapolis at the Combine and he wanted to beat that, and we talked a little bit last night and he said he probably wasn't going to run, but he came in here today, saw the excitement that was surrounding his teammates and he decided to be a part of it.”

“These young men that are coming in to a new environment, it is so important that they have support at home, because it really is easy to go in the wrong direction and you can be down that path and not even know it, but that support at home definitely helps.”
Greene was taken by the Steelers in the 1st round in 1969 out of North Texas University, a relatively unknown school at that point and went to high school in Temple, so it is no surprise he can relate to the much younger Billings born in Waco, Texas.
We hope to have a bit more about Billings later in the week as we will be looking into this exciting prospect in more detail. Until then, here are a few highlights of the potential Steelers draft target, as compiled by Blake Harris and the good people of Harris Highlights, who do exceptional work in putting so many of these videos together:
Here are our previous columns on tackle prospects:
We'll limit today's batch to two players because each has an unusual aspect to his story. Dallas Thomas of Tennessee is talented and position-versatile, but he's been off the radar with a torn labrum which prevented him from participating in combine drills and tests.
FSU prospect Menelik Watson's journey is a remarkable story, and he's showing the potential to be just as remarkable a player.
Dallas Thomas - Tennessee 6-5, 306 lb
I've liked Dallas Thomas ever since he first started at left tackle as a sophomore in 2010. He started there his junior year as well, but he was moved to left guard for his senior campaign. He took the chance to show that he also has the skill set for the interior. He has the attitude for either position - mean without being undisciplined.
He's a little on the smaller side for an NFL tackle, standing 6-5” and weighing ‘only' 306 lb, but a year in a quality NFL strength program should put another ten-plus pounds onto his frame. He's played at least six pounds heavier at Tennessee without any loss of footspeed or balance, so another ten shouldn't be a problem, and he might be able to put on more. He's nicely proportional, with powerful legs that anchor well, a good bubble, and strong shoulders.
He shows consistently good footwork - I like to watch him pull and trap. He noticeably likes putting the hammer on someone. Thomas gets to the second level well enough, but I have noticed that he doesn't always either expect a certain target or find one quickly enough. He shows good hand use and excellent physical flexibility, though - he also consistently demonstrates a nice pad level that's rare at the college level, and he fires out into defenders without difficulty. He plays with the requisite ill temper for the position and finishes his blocks well - he doesn't stop until the whistle blows.
I don't know the reason for his move to guard for his senior season, but it gave him a chance to show teams that he can work both inside and out (he also took some snaps at left guard his junior year). He isn't quite the multifunctional player that Alabama center Barrett Jones is, but he's probably better than Jones as a tackle and as effective as a guard - he just hasn't played center. He took on his interior play as an opportunity to show both his good moves and his bad intentions, and he did it well.
Thomas dropped off the fan/draftnik radar due to his torn labrum, for which he had surgery on February 7, but scouts are very aware of him. He won't be fully recovered for 4-6 more months and will have to get stronger at that point - that could affect some teams' plans for him. However, on a purely skill-oriented basis, I think that he's as good (or better) a candidate as, say, Justin Pugh.
Menelik Watson - Florida State - 6-5, 310 lb
Menelik was said to be the name of the son of King Solomon and Makeda, the Queen of Sheba. That Menelik would become the first Solomonic King of Ethiopia. Fittingly enough, this player could end up as one of the elite - the royalty, if you will - offensive tackles in a few years' time.
Watson grew up in Manchester, England, and saw sports as his way to get out of the cycle of poverty. He was very athletic from a young age. His ever-growing physical body outgrew his first choice, soccer (the quickness of his footwork has some roots there), then tried life as the captain of a traveling basketball team.
Despite Ryan Clady's offseason experience, NFL offensive linemen are often encouraged to use basketball in the offseason to improve their footwork. Watson didn't know yet that this was a harbinger of things to come. He had a brief interest in boxing, but then he went to a Florida State Seminoles game and fell in love with football.
He entered Saddleback Community College without having ever taken a rep in the game of football, and there he fulfilled his academic requirements and played right tackle before spending the 2012 year playing for Florida State.
His coach at Saddleback got into the ear of FSU line coach Rick Trickett, until Trickett watched some of Watson's film.
"He did things you couldn't coach," Trickett says now, some 16 months after initially meeting Watson..."He just has instincts."
If you've ever watched any game film of offensive linemen, I'd recommend that you watch some of Menelik's. He's a little older than the ideal, and he lacks experience (just as was the case with Philip Blake last year), having played only one year of Division I football. He's leaving school to support his family, even though his technique is still very raw. He lunges at times rather than move his feet and hands together, which harms his balance; he doesn't know how to handle some situations, and understandably lacks the experience you'd want to see.
But he's an unreal athlete with unusual flexibility and strength, and he's someone who knows what it means to maintain his body in professional game shape. He has an NFL body and NFL talent. When I watched his film, I saw an understandable combination of errors and excellence. I quickly had no doubt that excellence was winning. As Trickett said - some things you can't coach. The rest, Watson is learning quickly:
If you look at the 1:06 mark, you can see how well Watson moves his feet against the pass rush, effortlessly sliding from a combination block with the guard, to handling the outside rusher. Let the tape run through the play at the 1:16 mark, and you'll see Menelik moving to the second level and pancaking his target so thoroughly that the defender's helmet flies off. There's a fumble next that didn't involve him, but on the following running play, he gets to the second level with ease - but then he fails to get his helmet between the defender and the running back, so the defender runs free.
Overall, he gets to the second level as well as anyone; at the 1:58 mark, he takes out the safety before the RB can get there. He's very fast in short areas, has a wide base in pass pro, and moves his feet quickly and smoothly. He can anchor extremely well, and when he gets his hands into a defender, that guy stays blocked. I came away very impressed after watching his film; he won't lack for suitors later this month.
These are the kinds of issues that you'd accept when you take him - he's incredibly talented and hasn't had enough time to fully mature in the game yet, but his upside is as high as any OT I've watched this year in a deep class. Teams who are short a right tackle will look long and hard at him. I didn't see anything that suggested that he won't be able to move to LT over time.
The bad blood between Jose Bautista and the Texas Rangers still remains.
Despite Bautista's skill set and contract demands being a fit for the club, conversations between the two sides reportedly went nowhere and won't go any further, one source told Jeff Wilson of the Star Telegram.
Bautista's history with the Rangers is well documented. He hit the series-altering home run in Game 5 of the 2015 ALDS that was followed by the bat flip. Several months later, Bautista was the recipient of a Rougned Odor punch to the jaw.
The free-agent slugger's market, which was once believed to be robust, is running out of options. The Boston Red Sox informed Bautista's agent that they had no room to add him, while Baltimore Orioles general manager Dan Duquette said he wouldn't sign Bautista because the fans view him as a villain and don't like him. The Blue Jays reportedly will only offer less than the $17.2-million qualifying offer he rejected last month.
While some teams are concerned with his perceived attitude, Bautista remains one of the best bats on the free-agent market. The 36-year-old has averaged 36 home runs, 93 RBIs, and a .929 OPS over the last seven seasons.
Getting Started with Medical Marijuana
Modern research suggests that cannabis is a valuable aid in the treatment of a wide range of clinical applications. These include pain relief — particularly neuropathic pain — nausea, spasticity, glaucoma, and movement disorders. Marijuana is also a powerful appetite stimulant, specifically for patients suffering from HIV, the AIDS wasting syndrome, or dementia. Emerging research suggests that cannabinoids and terpenes found in cannabis work together synergistically to help protect the body against some types of malignant tumors.
Currently, more than 60 U.S. and international health organizations — including the American Public Health Association, Health Canada and the Federation of American Scientists — support granting patients immediate legal access to medicinal marijuana under a physician's supervision. Several others, including the American Cancer Society and the American Medical Association support the facilitation of wide-scale, clinical research trials so that physicians may better assess cannabis' medical potential.
In addition, a 1991 Harvard study found that 44 percent of oncologists had previously advised marijuana therapy to their patients. Fifty percent responded they would do so if marijuana was legal. A more recent national survey performed by researchers at Providence Rhode Island Hospital found that nearly half of physicians with opinions supported legalizing medical marijuana.
Safety and Efficacy
Cannabis and its psychoactive cannabinoid, THC, are considered incredibly safe for human consumption. The Drug Awareness Warning Network Annual Report, published by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), contains a statistical compilation of all drug deaths which occur in the United States. According to this report, there has never been a death recorded from the use of cannabis. In fact, many studies show it is physically impossible for a human to die from a cannabis overdose.
The documented use of cannabis as a safe and effective therapeutic botanical dates to 2700 BC. Between 1840 and 1900, European and American journals of medicine published more than 100 articles on the therapeutic use of cannabis. In fact, cannabis was part of the American pharmacopoeia until 1942, and is currently available by prescription in Canada, the Netherlands, Israel, and Germany.
Therapeutic Benefits
The cannabis plant has been around for centuries. It is believed to have originated in Central Asia, but has expanded its reach to an international scale over time. People all around the globe consume cannabis and their reasoning is largely the same: it makes them feel better.
We know that humans have cannabinoid receptors housed inside the body that are ready to bind with cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant to provide therapeutic benefits for a variety of ailments. In fact, cannabinoid receptors are present in humans before birth and the compounds themselves are even found in a mother's breast milk. Medical cannabis gains merit when you consider our bodies are naturally tuned to interact with cannabinoids, and even more so when you acknowledge the growing evidence of benefits to cannabis consumption.
Cannabis & Digestion
It is no secret – experiencing “the munchies” is one of the most obvious cannabis clichés. Despite the silly connotation, studies suggest that the endocannabinoid system actually helps modulate appetite. This is especially interesting for the treatment of eating disorders. In fact, a study published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders suggests that cannabinoids may prove effective in treating anorexia.
Cannabis is also famously used to reduce the feelings of nausea but studies suggest it could have a number of digestive benefits as well. Medical marijuana could play a role in a number of digestion-related health conditions including:
Medical Marijuana For Pain Management
Chronic Pain is one of the most common ailments for which doctors prescribe medical marijuana and a recent survey published in The Spine Journal found that 1 out of 5 patients at a Colorado spine center were using cannabis to manage their pain. Of those, nearly 90% said it greatly or moderately relieved their pain.
The spine clinic study was merely a survey, which means more research will be necessary on the potential role of cannabis in treating back pain. With that said, plenty of people will tell you it helps manage pain and science is beginning to back their claims. Studies suggest medical marijuana could offer relief for various types of pain, including the following:
Cannabis & Mental Health
A common misconception of cannabis is that has detrimental effects on mental health. It is possible that high doses of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) could trigger anxiety in some patients, and some believe it could expedite the onset of predisposed personality disorders, but this has yet to be proven by any reputable studies.
The recent trend in the mental health field has been to investigate our relationship with cannabis. In turn, studies have linked cannabinoids to a number of mental health concerns. The research catalog is still growing, but a few mental health conditions for which cannabis could be beneficial are as follows:
Your Brain On Cannabis
Not only has cannabis been linked to mental health, cannabinoid receptor activity in the brain before birth suggests that the compounds could be play a role in brain development. Cannabis has been linked to the creation of new neurons in the brain, or neurogenesis, and overall brain plasticity. In addition to its role in brain development, medical cannabis is believed to have neuroprotective properties that help treat the following conditions:
Medical Marijuana For Cancer
One the most intriguing potential applications for medical marijuana is cancer treatment. It has long been prescribed to counter the side effects of chemotherapy, but oncologists across the world are working on trials to determine whether cannabis can be used to treat cancer itself. Many patients choose to take the Rick Simpson Oil treatment plan in an attempt to cure the cancer, but there are many different methods of going about treatment.
Past research showed promise for THC in cancer treatment, but many are skeptical of using THC-based products because of its psychotropic effects (eg. the “high”). As a result many oncologists have redirected their focus toward cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG). A recent British study, however suggests that cannabinoids may be most effective against cancer when combined in a manner that allows them to act synergistically with one-another. Below is a short list of studies and research supporting cancer treatment with medical cannabis to get you started:

Becoming a Patient
There are just four basic steps to becoming a legal medical marijuana patient in your state:
PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A 59-year-old man has been charged with abuse of a corpse after the body of his 87-year-old father, who died more than a year ago, was found inside the father's Aurora home.
Edward Fitchett is being held on $280,000 bail in Marion County jail. He appeared in court Friday. He is also charged with theft and criminal mistreatment.
He was arrested Thursday after Marion County sheriff's detectives found the body of Henry Conley Fitchett inside the home. Prosecutors say he died more than a year ago and the son is accused of moving his corpse sometime in December 2015.
Edward Fitchett's wife, Rose, told the Oregonian/OregonLive Friday that her father-in-law's body was found inside a freezer.
Family members contacted police last month to report that Fitchett had not been seen since last September.
Before his arrest, Edward Fitchett told KOIN-TV that he wanted to know where his dad was
South African cricket (The Proteas) participation in the Cricket World Cup has been rather underwhelming if truth be told as they have found ways to knock themselves out without ever reaching a final, a fact which they are desperate to rectify. We take a look at their results in the Cricket World Cup since their readmission to international sport in 1991.
1992 – Australia and New Zealand
This was the Proteas first attempt at a Cricket World Cup and they sent an inexperienced team in terms of international cricket to this tournament, having made their international re-entry only a year before. They lost in the semi-final against England in rather unusual circumstances. They were still well in the game, needing 22 runs off 13 deliveries with two competent batsmen at the crease – David Richardson and Brian McMillan. Ten minutes of rain was enough to reduce what promised to be a tense finish to a rather tame result determined by a calculator. When play resumed the target remained at 22, but now off 7 balls. As Brian McMillan took guard the scoreboard updated to a target of 22, off one ball… The jury is out as to why this happened in the first place as a reserve day had been set aside in case of rain and there have been accusations that the broadcaster, Channel Nine, had insisted that the game ended that day to please the television audience. Pakistan went on to beat England by 22 runs in the final.
1996 – India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka
This Cricket World Cup proved to be one of the most forgettable of South Africa's participation. Although they topped their pool they were knocked out in their quarter final against the West Indies, a team that had lost by 73 runs to minnows Kenya. This team was not a weak one and included Hansie Cronje, Jonty Rhodes, Alan Donald, Jacques Kallis, Brian McMillan and Shaun Pollock. The 1996 version of the Cricket World Cup was the coming of age of Sri Lankan cricket when they beat Australia by seven wickets in Lahore, Pakistan.
1999 – England
If South Africa are honest with themselves, this is surely the one that got away. They had the Player of the Tournament, Lance Klusener, in their ranks, as well as the core of the team that played in the 1996 World Cup. They breezed through their pool and lost only one game in the Super Sixes, to Australia. They then faced Australia again in the semi-final, which is possibly the most tense play-off match ever played in a Cricket World Cup. The game ended in a tie and Australia advanced to the Final based on their superior run rate. This game will always be remembered for two incidents though. Herchelle Gibbs caught Steve Waugh on 56 but dropped the ball when he tried to throw it up in celebration. Waugh was reputed to have asked Gibbs: “How does if you feel to drop the World Cup?”, but by Waugh's own admission this never happened. The second incident was the one that ultimately cost South Africa the game. Lance Klusener was on strike during the final over and called Alan Donald through for what would have been the winning single. Donald was bewildered at first and turned his back on Klusener at first, before dropping his bat and then trying to run through for the winning run. He ended up short of his ground and the game was tied.
2003 – South Africa/Zimbabwe/Kenya
This was a home tournament for South Africa and they were rather embarrassingly dumped out of the tournament in the group stages after yet another tie in a Cricket World Cup game, this time against Sri Lanka. When the heavens opened over Durban (after continuous drizzle) South Africa were exactly on the Duckworth Lewis par score of 229, but coach Eric Simons forgot about the +1 part to actually win the game and the message was never delivered to Mark Boucher that they needed a single to win the game and he blocked what turned out to be the final ball of the game. This calamity ended up costing Shaun Pollock the South African captaincy and Eric Simons his coaching position. In the opening game of the tournament, South Africa lost to the West Indies by 3 runs after they were docked an over in their own run chase due to a slow over rate while they were in the field. The tournament was won by Australia, beating India at the Wanderers by 125 runs.
2007 – The West Indies
This edition of the Cricket World Cup certainly had a number of highlights and shocks. Herchelle Gibbs smacked Netherlands bowler Dan van Bunge for six consecutive sixes in the same over. This earned him $1million to be donated to a charity of his choice. Being a patriotic South African, he nominated a South African charity, only to be told the cash had to be donated to a local charity. Gibbs was offered nationality of St. Kitts and Nevis, an act which to this day has not been carried through. The tournament was also rocked by the death of former Protea and then Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer under strange circumstances in his hotel room. After some sensationalist reporting, no foul play was found. South Africa were knocked out at the semi-final stage by Australia. They had decided to attack the Australians from ball one and were in deep trouble at 28 for 4 and were eventually bowled out for 149. The Australians easily passed this, losing only 3 wickets in the process. They went on to beat Sri Lanka in the final by 53 using the Duckworth Lewis calculation after rain showers.
2011 – India/Sri Lanka/Bangladesh
South Africa were once again strong in the Group stages and won 5 out of their 6 games, losing only to England by 6 runs on a crumbling MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. They played New Zealand in the quarter final and we're looking well set to overhaul the target of 221 which they had been set. It was at that point the Kyle Mills, 12th man on the day, was sent onto the field with a bottle of water for the bowler and created a scene on the pitch by shouting and swearing at the batsmen. Some would call it a stroke of brilliance, others would call it extremely unsporting. The fact is that a young Faf du Plessis was rattled and was out a few balls later. The South Africans collapsed after that and were bundled out for 172, a 49 run loss and their World Cup aspirations had been extinguished. In the final, India beat Sri Lanka by 6 wickets, to the delight of the entire Indian population.
The Proteas have certainly learned many hard lessons in their attempts to win a Cricket World Cup. Hopefully for them, this will be their year.

Gautama Buddha (approx 563BC-483BC) was the original or ‘Supreme Buddha' – a spiritual teacher who reached enlightenment and whose teachings Buddhism was founded on. The accepted story is that Gautama was born into a Royal family, but upon leaving the palace and witnessing the poor, sick and dying of India, he turned his back on worldly possessions and went in search of spiritual fulfilment. After years of meditation and studying with priests, Gautama reached enlightenment at age 35 and spent the rest of his life travelling and teaching disciples.
– Thanks to reader Aidan for submitting this quote.
– I am by no means an expert on Buddha so if you have insights on Buddha or his teachings, feel free to share in the comments.
– This quote is disputed on Wikiquotes as not being Buddha's. Everywhere else I searched has him as the author so I went ahead with it.
I have been working on a project that is a real-estate web portal. One of the main features of the portal is maps. You can search for a property on the map using certain criteria. You can see what other objects – supermarkets, hospitals, kindergartens – are located near it, or you can drill into information about specific properties.
Initially I choose to use OpenStreetMap to render maps, the main reason being the level of detail that it provides. For instance, you can see things like factories, industrial zones, suburb borders, schools, etc. This information is quite important when you are looking for a new place to live.
But (and there's always a ‘but'), I ran into a problem when I got my first Retina MacBook Pro. Maps looked a bit blurry on it. It turned out that the problem was the Retina (hi-res) display.
What I needed was special tiles that rendered with a bigger scale factor to make them sharper. I was looking for a free, ready-to-use solution, but couldn't find one. There are some commercial projects that you can use, but they cost money, which we didn't really have for that project.
Furthermore, I needed to keep tile format the same so I don't need to make any modifications on front end.
Fortunately, OpenStreetMap not only serves up map tiles, but gives you access to the huge geo database underneath as well. So, I decided to render my own tiles from this database.
In this article I'll present my solution. Importantly, this solution will use Docker to build and run. Using Docker helps avoid problems running shared libraries across different platforms, because most of the tools in that area written with C++. The hope is that you'll be able to easily set up this solution in your own environment.
Let's get started
To support Retina image display, we need to generate tiles with 2x resolution. The web client can then request these images and render them into the same sized area on a web page that was previously being used for the non-Retina images.
For instance, if we have an image ‘foo.png' with a size 128px x 128px that is being rendered by an tag, the client will implicitly give that tag an area of 128px x 128px. For a Retina-grade image, we would now have the client request an image with size 256px x 256px, but explicitly keep the display area at 128px x 128px.
So instead of having the client request pre-rendered tiles from the OpenStreetMap.org service, we'll have it request them from a custom back-end that can render high-resolution tiles. Also, rendering our own tiles can be handy if:
We want to customise how map looks, i.e. create our own look and feel.
We want to have control of what objects we want to show on the map (roads/rivers/building/etc).
Generally speaking, if you need flexibility and you have computed resources, then rendering tiles yourself is the way to go. Let's take a look at the solution!
Solution Overview
We will setup our own render server with a custom map style. That renderer will generate map tiles as png images with scale factor 2. We need a custom style mainly to change the font size, because it's too big for the new tiles. Otherwise, objects would be rendered closer together, but the font size would remain the same. Also, it's handy to be able to change a style to use our own colour scheme or drop some object type that we don't need.
As an example, our solution will render Melbourne city. It will render a map that will look like this:
Which we can contrast to the original one from openstreetmap.org:
Here are projects that the solution will use to render our tiles:
Mapnik: It's our base tool that does the actual rendering. We use it as a library to call from golang to render tiles.
It's our base tool that does the actual rendering. We use it as a library to call from golang to render tiles. Postgis + Postgresql: We store the maps in Postgresql DB using the Postgis plugin. Mapnik requests data from that DB.
Postgresql: We store the maps in Postgresql DB using the Postgis plugin. Mapnik requests data from that DB. Gopnik:This is a frontend server that calls libmapnik to render tiles. This project is using a master-slave pattern and allows you to create cluster of renderers. Also, it's written with Golang 😉 – I couldn't miss that opportunity to hack with it a bit!
Map Style: A fork of the original OSM style project that I optimised for hi-res displays by supporting 2x size tiles and using different font sizes.
Best of all, everything is packaged up inside Docker so we'll be able to reuse it in any environment.
Building It
NOTE: For this to work on your machine, you should have ports 8888,8080,8090 open and free on your host machine.
The project is hosted on GitHub and contains a Docker Compose environment that will run the Database + Gopnik cluster + Web example. First of all let's clone the repo:
$ git clone https://github.com/dooman87/melbourne-map.git
We also need some static files to download because they will be required to render some basic stuff (e.g. continent shapes) on low zoom. The files are quite big (total is about 1 Gb) which is why we don't download them as part of the Docker image-building step. To download these static files, go to your repository clone and run:
$ ./download.sh
Now let's have a look at docker-compose.yml:
You can see that we have 3 services. Let's have a look at each a bit closer:
1. Postgis Service
This service runs a database that contains imported data for Melbourne city. This data has been extracted from OpenStreetMap by the guys at the mapzen project, and is also open source (you can find extracts for all big cities there). The Docker image itself is based on a postgis image that was created by mdillon. I added the osm2pgsql package because we depend on it to import map data into the database. The entire Dockerfile is quite small and simple:
We clone the openstreetmap-carto project because it defines what objects we will render, as osm2pgsql will need to know what objects should be imported into the DB. The project contains a file called openstreetmap-carto.style that defines objects and has simple structure of things that will be in DB. For example, here's a fragment of the file:
So, for example if we don't want to have labels on capitals, then we can simply remove the line with that type from the file.
Also, I had to customise the Docker entrypoint script to import map data on first start of the container, and create a flag-file to let the renderer know that the database has been successfully imported (last two lines):
2. Renderer Service
This is the renderer that generates tiles using Gopnik. The image below is showing how exactly rendering process is working. “Dispatcher” and “Render” are Gopnik's components. We are using normal filesystem as a cache. Mapnik is used as a library that “Render” component calls:
Image was created by gopnik team. Original address: http://sputnik-maps.github.io/gopnik/img/render.png
The Docker image for the renderer is based on an original gopnik image that I created and contributed back to the project. Here's the Docker file:
Some key points about this file:
It installs the Adobe Source Pro fonts that get used by map style
It clones the map style repo
It creates indexes from shape files that were downloaded in the first step
It defines a volume called ‘map_data'. That volume contains a ‘config.json' file that we pass to gopnik. Most importantly, config.json defines the scale factor (line 72) that we want to use to generate tiles:
"Cmd": ["/gopnik/bin/gopnikslave", "-stylesheet", "/openstreetmap-carto/stylesheet.xml", "-pluginsPath", "/usr/lib/mapnik/2.2/input", "-fontsPath", "/usr/share/fonts", "-scaleFactor", "2"]
It copies scripts to compile the style and run the Gopnik dispatcher and render slaves
The entrypoint script of the Docker container for the renderer service compiles the map style and waits until the DB becomes accessible. We kick off the renderer process once the DB is ready:
3. Web Service
This is a docker container that uses a ready-made nginx image to serve up a simple example web page. It uses the leaflet library to show a map and position at Melbourne:
Starting It To run things, you need to run the following command in your repository clone: $ docker-compose up That's really it. The first time it will take a while to build images and start up (up to 10 mins) because we need to import the database. You can find out when all containers are started and ready to go by looking for log messages that look like this: postgis_1 | LOG: autovacuum launcher started renderer_1 | Starting renderer renderer_1 | 2016/12/27 23:34:30 app.go:266: [INFO] Serving debug data (/debug/vars) on %s... :9080 renderer_1 | 2016/12/27 23:34:30 app.go:267: [INFO] Serving monitoring xml data on %s... :9080 renderer_1 | 2016/12/27 23:34:30 renderselector.go:209: [DEBUG] ping error %v dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8090: getsockopt: connection refused renderer_1 | 2016/12/27 23:34:30 renderselector.go:117: [DEBUG] '%v' is %v localhost:8090 Offline renderer_1 | 2016/12/27 23:34:30 main.go:118: [INFO] Starting on %s... :8080 renderer_1 | 2016/12/27 23:34:30 app.go:266: [INFO] Serving debug data (/debug/vars) on %s... :9090 renderer_1 | 2016/12/27 23:34:30 app.go:267: [INFO] Serving monitoring xml data on %s... :9090 renderer_1 | 2016/12/27 23:34:35 main.go:95: [INFO] Done in %v seconds 4.84147165 renderer_1 | 2016/12/27 23:34:35 main.go:103: [INFO] Starting on %s... :8090 Testing it Now you can open your favourite browser and go to: http://localhost:8888 The initial rendering may take 10-30 seconds, after which you will see a fabulous map of Melbourne city.
Shipping It
How you ship this solution is really up to you. I'm using this in a project that has about 300 hits per day (what a big boy!). I'm running all the containers on one EC2 instance. Also, if you cache all tiles that are already rendered, then you won't need huge CPU resources and – up to a point – may even have some resilience if the Gopnik renderers go down. You can even get the Gopnik renderers to prerender tiles if you want.
That said, strictly speaking this is not a production-ready solution. From gopnic's docs:
Code is unstable. Current status of Gopnik is something like developer preview. Everything may change. Everything may be broken.
Regardless, it's probably worth mentioning that uptime of my EC2 instance is currently 5412 hours (was launched on May 18, 2016) and it's still serving tiles.
Where is NEW YORK , PARIS , MOSCOW , MILAN?
It's quite easy to render other cities. Just update the Postgis Dockerfile to download a different pbf file and update its name in the entrypoint script.
Here's the line that you would change in the Dockerfile:
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/metro-extracts.mapzen.com/melbourne_australia.osm.pbf
and here's the line you would change in initdb-postgis.sh:
osm2pgsql --style /openstreetmap-carto/openstreetmap-carto.style -d gis -U postgres -k --slim /melbourne_australia.osm.pbf
After you've changed these, you then clean and rebuild everything:
$ ./clean.sh $ docker-compose build $ docker-compose up
What's Next?
So that's my solution for serving up Retina-quality map tiles, packaged up with Docker for easy distribution.
In the ideal world it would be nice to use vector format like svg to render tiles. That way you wouldn't have to worry about serving up particular resolutions. There are some things going on (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Vector_tiles) in that space, along with commercial solutions.
There is one project that I'd like to mention is osm2vectortiles. You can generate vector tiles from data extracts using it. So, the next step for my project would be to evaluate current solution to generate vector tiles instead of raster.
I'm probably too young to fully justify the phrase “back in my day,” but back in my day, downtown London, Ontario was so much more than a hasty coffee stop between buses.
Arcades, movie theatres, shopping centres, computer cafes and not one, but two laser tag arenas meant there were plenty of places for area teens and tweens to show off their new cargo pants and discmen.
As part of the millennial generation, I've seen a number of drastic changes occur in London. Some are positive, but some leave me wringing my hands, waxing nostalgic. I've compiled a short list of sites which have virtually been erased over the past 25 years.
I hope they conjure up fond memories for you, or at least attest to how quickly time flies.
1 – Smuggler's Alley
Then: Smuggler's Alley was the final incarnation of an ill-fated building on the corner of King St. and Clarence St.
Before it opened under that name in 1995, it had also been the London Mews and London Arcade. Featuring unattractive, dark brown, corrugated siding, the build boasted no windows and only one entrance. Its three-storey exterior with two underground levels looked more like an army barracks than a recreational destination.
The interior design was unique – multi-level hexagonal corridors connected by elevators, complete with artificial lighting. Full red carpeting covered every square inch of the floor.
I vaguely remember it for having one of the only six-screen movie theatres in the city. Others before me might recall the fully authentic Japanese restaurant hidden in the basement.
There were hardly any vacancies, which made every visit all the more surreal.
Now: The building was torn down in 1999 and the space now being used as a parking lot. Last year saw talks of using the corner to host swanky apartments, but whether or not that will happen remains to be seen.
2 – Ace Arcade
Then: Two doors down from Smugglers' Alley was Ace Arcade. Located directly across from Solid Gold strip club, this family-oriented venue was decorated with faux Egyptian art, and boasted more than 40 arcade video games and several pool tables.
Ace Arcade was the place to go for bored high-schoolers looking to waste quarters or cause trouble. My personal favourite games included Street Fighter and Dance Dance Revolution.
Now: Like Smuggler's Alley, Ace Arcade was also reduced to a pile of rubble scraped away to make room for a parking lot in the early 2000s.
3 – The Children's Festival
Then: The International Children's Festival in Victoria Park was an annual initiative to introduce kids to arts, music and science. The set-up comprised of tented stations where visitors could try their hand at science experiments and crafts designed to spark the imagination. This was always followed by a family picnic under a tree and dancing to live music with streamers (remember those?).
Now: Sadly, the economic crisis of the 2010's led to a decrease in ticket sales for the paid event. Its relevance with youth was called into question. Today's Kid's Expo is free, and carries on the tradition of holding activities under tents while also offering more in the way of family entertainment.
Editor's note: Victoria Park is still a beautiful place! There's just one less, awesome festival there each year.
4 – The Elsie Perrin Williams Memorial Library
Then: The Elsie Perrin Williams Memorial Library was a two-storey limestone building that served as the city's central library. This Queen's Ave building was constructed in 1939. It is one of only three downtown structures built in a Greek-inspired Art Deco style.
Youngsters booked it to the attached Club Room and children's library, while our parents enjoyed the auditorium, art gallery and reading garden. The extensive VHS collection was a great way to save on the cost of video rentals.
Now: London Public Library's central branch at Citi Plaza features a more convenient location and contains the Wolf Performance Hall.
However, I still miss walking up the ostentatious set of stairs to be greeted by Socrates' stone façade. The building still stands in quiet wait for a new owner, and is registered as one of Canada's Historic Places.
5 – The Embassy Hotel
Then: The Embassy Hotel was a dank, unsterilized pit that gave local adolescents a semi-supervised space to fulfill their rebellious desires. The Dundas east venue was the go-to place to see live performances of your friend's cousin's boyfriend's band.
My fondest Embassy memories include punk-rock meltdowns and cupcake fights at The Whippet Lounge, and trying to impress Manic Panic-haired boys by hacking my way through a cigarette on the small, littered patio.
Now: After burning down in 2009, the site has become the stuff of cult legend among Millennials. Some of whom are rumoured to collect small leftover pieces of its foundation.
The vacant lot where it once stood is now a hope-filled eyesore for East Village residents who cross their fingers for its possible redevelopment.
While these locales represent the days of yore in London, Ontario, it's important to take a look back every once in a while, so we can look forward with hope because of all the opportunities here.
The ever-changing face of a city is a natural course of events. However, from time to time, it's important to look back on what once was and how we can move forward with it. London has no shortage on beautiful structures and fascinating history. Sometimes it's right in front of you and you don't even know it. Now, hopefully, you know just a little bit more.

The battle between Android and Apple applications for tablet devices is yet in its infancy. But give it two months, said NJIT's Tim Kellers, an instructor who's teaching an on-line course at NJIT in Android apps, and you may see a very different landscape. “There are 300,000 Apple apps available and a device to run them on, the iPad,” said Kellers. “There are only 100,000 Android apps but no real device. That will change dramatically, however, within a few months as Android tablet devices start appearing on the market.”
Kellers, who is available for media interviews (for details call Sheryl Weinstein, 973-596-3436), recently offered the following insights.
Future is bright
Google owns the Android market. People can download Android apps for free since Android is an open source market. The program source code is also free with no licensing fees. Conversely, Apple's operating system is closed source and Windows operating system is closed source. But Android—based on a Linux kernel and JAVA (also an open source program) is free and will work on any hardware written to run it. Do the math and you'll see the future.
Here's an analogy
In Apple's early days it ruled the market. When Microsoft came along with a system that would run on anyone's hardware, Apple lost market share. Google's Android is poised to enter the same position Microsoft had then. The good news is that Android will run on all sorts of hardware: cell phones, GPS applications; word processing applications. It can display video and gaming platforms. It can control server computers by remote applications.
Honeycomb
Yes, there's been no new device since Apple's iPad last year. But coming soon is Android 3.0, a code name for a competitive tablet known as Honeycomb able to work on a large format tablet device. Large format tablet devices are seven- inch or larger diagonal screens. The technology is not yet there because Android was not designed to run on tablets; it was designed for smart phones. But smart developers have already adapted the Android operating system to run on a 2.2 system. The NJIT applications to be taught in the new course will use these smaller Android systems.
More Big News
A 3.0 Android operating system for tablets will be on the market Feb. 1. Once the system is released electrical engineers can fine-tune tablets that they've begun designing. Expect to see real Android competition to Apple's iPad on the market around April. Some 3.0 systems in beta are already being tested. Early adopters now can use Samsung's 2.2 Galaxy pad which runs on an Android system. Kellers advised saving your money, though, until the reviews are in. And, stay tuned for more!

Between recent word of a new turbo engine in the works and these latest spy shots , there is no doubt Subaru is working on a faster version of its sporty BRZ coupe. Our spy photographers snapped these images of an interesting-looking BRZ testing around the Nürburgring that, upon closer inspection, is proudly displaying the STI badges.Right away, we can tell something is special about this car from its aggressive body kit including a front chin spoiler and extended lower side sills. This car is also fitted with 15-spoke wheels that aren't hiding the red STI center caps and help show off the bigger brakes and STI-branded brake calipers. Of course, you can't miss that adjustable rear wing that replaces the BRZ's regular spoiler, but we're guessing this is more for aero testing rather than a production-ready piece. There are also fatter exhaust outlets on this prototype that should help give this car a deeper growl.It isn't clear where the turbo engine fits in with this potential BRZ STI model, but with auto show season upon us, we get the feeling we'll be finding out much more about a sportier version of the BRZ sooner rather than later.
Rogers Park Police District Cmdr. Thomas Waldera (white shirt) stands near evidence markers with other officers Thursday in the 6900 block of North Greenview Avenue. View Full Caption DNAinfo/Benjamin Woodard
ROGERS PARK — A 23-year-old man was shot Thursday afternoon in Rogers Park.
The shooting happened about noon when the man was standing in the 6900 block of North Greenview Avenue, said Officer Janel Sedevic, a Chicago Police spokeswoman.
An unknown man exited a silver sedan and began firing at the man, grazing him in the left hand. The shooter then returned to his car and fled the scene. The man suffered a very minor graze wound and refused treatment on the scene, Sedevic said.
No one is in custody for the shooting.
Several witnesses heard the gunshots and saw people running from the scene Thursday morning.
"It happened right in front of us," said Kalani Hargrove, 33, who was driving east on Farwell Avenue when they heard the shots.
She said she was looking at an apartment she was considering renting when two men on bicycles, who didn't appear to be involved with the shooting, dove to the ground, and then sought cover behind a parked car.
Then another man ran southbound on Greenview. A police officer on the scene said that person was in custody but couldn't say how he was involved with the incident.
Rogers Park Police District Cmdr. Thomas Waldera was on the scene about 1 p.m., standing among a dozen evidence markers on the sidewalk on the east side of Greenview. He also was talking with an unknown person in the back of a squad car parked in the alleyway between Farwell and Morse avenues.
A resident who was in her apartment near the scene said she heard one shot, a pause, and then several more.
A resident of the neighborhood for three decades, she said safety in the neighborhood has gotten "better and better" over the years — until now.
"This summer everything hit the fan," said the woman, who declined to give her name.
Some residents and business owners had complained about several high-profile shootings on Morse Avenue in the past few months.

Former Obama White House Counsel Bob Bauer delivered a warning to President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE on Friday that his tweets may be compromising his legal standing.
"Mr. Trump appears not to understand that he is drawing a certain picture of himself, which is neither pretty nor without consequence for his legal position," Bauer wrote in a post on "Lawfare."
"This self-portrait can be counted on to color unfavorably any assessment of his motives when more formal inquiries into his behavior are considered or take place," he added.

Bauer's commentary centered around Trump's Friday tweet threatening fired FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeyExpect little closure on collusion 'Dear Attorney General Barr': Advice from insiders Rosenstein: My time at DOJ is 'coming to an end' MORE with secret recordings of their conversations at the White House. In the tweet, Trump suggested that Comey may want to think twice about "leaking to the press."
"James Comey better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!" Trump wrote on Twitter.
By hinting at the existence such tapes, Bauer added in his post, Trump appears to be acting "as the principal witness against himself."
"What is most remarkable is that the President has willingly created this self-portrait," he wrote. "As scandals-in-the-making go, this one may become famous for featuring the President as the principal witness against himself: he seems committed to uncovering any cover-up."
A man mad at Arabs, "due to what they are doing in the Middle East," tried to set fire to a St. Lucie County convenience store that he mistakenly thought was owned by a Muslim, according to the sheriff's office.
The intended target was the Met Mart store at 100 Prima Vista Blvd. in Port St. Lucie.
Deputies were called to the business Friday morning.
“When the deputies arrived, they noticed the dumpster had been rolled in front of the doors and the contents were lit on fire,” Sheriff Ken J. Mascara said in a statement. “Upon seeing our deputies, the man put his hands behind his back and said ‘take me away.'”
The store was closed at the time.
“The man, identified as Richard Lloyd, was read his Miranda Rights and then told deputies that he pushed the dumpster to the front of the building, tore down signs posted to the outside of the store and lit the contents of the dumpster on fire to ‘run the Arabs out of our country,'” Mascara said. “It's unfortunate that Mr. Lloyd made the assumption that the store owners were Muslim when, in fact, they are of Indian descent,”
Deputies booked Lloyd, 64, into the St. Lucie County Jail on a charge of first degree arson.
Deputies said that he told them his plan was to get a big enough fire in the dumpster to catch the building on fire and once it was burning he thought the alcohol from the beer and wine inside would burn it to the ground.
Lloyd said he was "doing his part for America" and also admitted he has a long history of mental health issues, according to an arrest affidavit.
The sheriff said Lloyd will be given a mental health evaluation and it will be up to the State Attorney's office to determine if this was an intentional hate crime.
During a court appearance Saturday morning, Lloyd told a judge he wants to represent himself. The judge ordered he stays away from Met Mart and have no contact with employees.
I never thought I would find myself standing in an aisle at a grocery store, poised between various household items, pondering my identity. And yet there I was, 21 and frozen to the spot, thinking about what it meant to be coloured, and wrestling with why this seemed to matter in a post-apartheid and personal context. The luxury of having time and the means to think about this, and the hilarity of the setting did not escape me then, and still does not.
Around the same time, I came across a quote by Dabydeen in Pumla Gqola's book What is slavery to me that reads: "I have a multiple identity. There is no crisis. There is a kind of delight in jumping from one identity to the next." Back then, it astounded and confused me, and now makes much more sense. Yet, a few years later, I am still turning on similar questions of coloured identity. The only difference now is that I self-identify as both coloured and black, a personal rebellion and definition that I have explained before.
But having a 'multiple identity', being coloured, is often incredibly complex. In many ways we are still wrestling with the joined questions: "What does it mean to be coloured?" and "Who is coloured?". These questions yield no easy, single answers.
Gushwell Brooks's recent response to the widely-shared column ' Being coloured in a black and white South Africa' by Jamie Peterson raised many important points about the nature of coloured identity, its historical roots and lack of a homogeneous identity. However, his idea that the answer lies in 'national identity' sits less easily, as does the erasure of the particular experiences of the coloured community.
The idea that colouredness is a racial midpoint between blackness and whiteness still has social power - which is key to the motivation behind Peterson's piece. As Brooks notes: "we still have a strong attachment to the racial classifications Verwoerd and his ilk devised", and have inherited the acceptance of apartheid racial classifiers for varied reasons.
As a consequence, we find ourselves still trying to make sense of and deal with how race, intersected with class, determines and makes different our experiences of citizenship. We find ourselves, as Gqola phrases it, "both free and not entirely free of apartheid", trying to make sense of all that lingers.
While we know race is a myth and lacks scientific basis, it still has deep social and political effects and in many ways operates as a social fact. People have built their lives, experiences, intimate relationships, friendship circles and understandings of themselves around it. This is why we have to take particular experiences, and race itself, seriously.
For the coloured community, Paul Gilroy notes: "Everyone is mixed, but not everyone counts as mixed". We have to interrogate what does it mean to count as mixed, and what are its very real effects. We have to make sense of the particular experiences of the coloured community, uniquely affected by population registration, the Mixed Marriages Act, the Group Areas Act, the position as a political buffer between the black and white communities in apartheid - particularly its psychological effects and internalised race politics - and many other factors that impact the identity when thinking about what it means to be coloured in post-apartheid South Africa.
The entire project of race is built on ignoring, compressing and abandoning difference, to make neat categories of identification. To make everyone the same, even when they are not. Race requires simple boxes to house people's experiences, and does not easily accommodate the differences within communities that are only natural and inevitable - even when these are obvious.
Brooks is correct is noting that being coloured in South Africa is not a homogenous experience - it is incredibly complicated identity that is experienced and interpreted differently across provinces, districts, communities, families and people. On a surface level, coloured people do not look the same. But on a deeper level, they do not experience their identity in the same way.
However, that is not the way that it is perceived or plays out in popular understandings. Popular understandings matter, and have immense power. Crucially, popular understandings of coloured identity affect perceptions, representations and experiences of coloured people.
This is why the issue of defining what it means to be coloured and who is coloured is incredibly difficult, and near impossible if you are looking for a single, simple answer - but that does not mean the experience of this identity is not uncomplicated, or easily accepted for some.
Many people can easily describe what being coloured means to them - but this definition is particular, and will differ, or contradict others. For some it is embedded in Sunday roast lunches, doilies and old school R&B, for others it is attached to koeksusters, jazz-ing and Judy Boucher, for even more it is none of the above. These definitions differ, overlap and intersect across the community.
Across racial groups, or any other communities, we have particular experiences, which need to be taken seriously and viewed on their own terms. While the challenges that each community faces might not be unique to them, they manifest in different communities in unique ways.
For example, Brooks points out that many communities, including white Afrikaner and black people, are faced with stereotyping that seeks out the 'lowest common denominator' that Peterson identified as singularly affecting coloured people.
However, for some communities, stereotypes come to overly-define and represent the popular image of the group. The coloured community is often represented through a lack of front teeth or saying 'awe', locked in poverty and sexually promiscuity, through gang and drug imagery, and the grammar of violence - the kind of which were expressed in the now infamous Kuli Robert Sunday World article. In many ways these stereotypes have been given hyper-power in determining popular perceptions of coloured people - which is perhaps what Peterson was pointing to.
But further than this, because race was so uniquely attached to citizenship under apartheid, we are dealing with the fact that it in many ways still makes us particular citizens.
As Grant Farred argues "…in the early 1990s South Africans were taking up the task of all becoming citizens for the first time. A decade later, the rights and responsibilities of citizenship remain an ongoing project - enfranchisement, equality before the law, equal access to the state's resources and the civic institutions, are all pertinent issues..."
While similarities in issues we face echo across divisions of race, class and other dividers, it still demands that we pay attention to people's particular experiences that are coloured by the group they belong to. Brooks asserts that, "The concerns coloured folk have are akin to the problems of all communities in SA," however this does not mean that we should not interrogate the unique set of factors and circumstances that make these manifest in unique ways for each community.
Different experiences of citizenship require being addressed on their own terms and cannot be explained away or solved by nationalism, which requires us to forego our particular identities in favour of primary identification we the nation. We are not all simply South African, we are particular South Africans who cannot escape the differences that colour our experiences. Nationalism, in many ways, is built on this erasure.
What Brooks misses is that national identity, nationalism and patriotism are not simply positive. They have their dark sides, their own creation of insiders and outsiders that make possible xenophobic attacks, 'wars on terror' and jingoism. Nationalism is an ideological project that often requires that people disregard their particular experience to make a national identity possible. It is not simply benign. It renders invisible those who feel excluded, voiceless, marginalised by the nation, or perpetually outside its definition of citizenship. While the issues that we face in South Africa require national solutions, nationalism itself is not the sole solution.
Being coloured in South Africa has taken on specific meaning, attached to a unique experience that deserves being considered on its own terms. Many of the questions I had at 21, standing in that grocery aisle remain the same, and many have incomplete answers. When it comes to issues of coloured identity and what it has come to mean, there are often more questions than answers, and we should take the questions seriously. And unlike Brooks, I don't know exactly where the answer lies, only that a commitment to teasing out, and sincerely engaging with the questions, in trying to figure out what it would take to create a country where the society we live in reflects all the ideals of the Constitution, rather than a nation of particular citizens, living lives affected by the grammar of the past, is needed.

PARIS (AP) — A top Syrian general's defection is the first major crack in the upper echelons of President Bashar Assad's regime, buoying a 100-nation conference Friday meant to intensify pressure for his removal, as well as an opposition desperate to bring him down but frustrated by diplomatic efforts.
All hoped the defection of Brig. Gen. Manaf Tlass, an Assad confidant and son of a former defense minister who helped ease Assad into power, would have a snowball effect on his elite cohorts as Syrians count their dead — now more than 14,000.
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Syrian leaders “are starting to vote with their feet” by abandoning the four-decade-old Assad dynasty, which continues to defy international efforts for peace. “Those with the closest knowledge of Assad's actions and crimes are moving away,” she told reporters at the close of the conference.
French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius was more blunt. Tlass‘ defection means that even the inner circle of Syria's ruler is starting to realize “that you cannot support a butcher like Mr. Bashar Assad,” he declared.
The conference of the so-called “Friends of Syria” group brought together the U.S., its European and Arab partners, and the fractious Syrian opposition, all looking to turn up the heat to force Assad from power.
A series of commitments included providing means for the opposition on the ground to better communicate among themselves and with the outside world, and increasing humanitarian aid.
Participants vowed to find ways to ensure that sanctions are enforced and called on the U.N. Security Council to urgently adopt a resolution that would give force to a six-point plan by envoy Kofi Annan and endorse a transition plan adopted in Geneva — broad enough to get acceptance by Russia and China, which have blocked most action in the Security Council.
But the announcement of Tlass‘ defection upstaged the declarations. It was unclear where he was going. Fabius initially said he was headed to France, where his sister lives, then backtracked and said his destination was unknown. It was also not clear whether Tlass was actually joining the struggle against Assad — as was widely assumed.
The news bolstered hopes and helped allay frustrations among the varied opposition groups, many of whom want a concrete plan to oust Assad.
“The defection of Tlass, 16 months after the start of Syria's popular uprising, will encourage a lot of similar people to defect as well,” Hassem Hashimi, a member of the Syrian National Council, predicted in an interview with The Associated Press in Paris.
The hope that it will inspire others to leave and open cracks in Assad's power base was one element that put opposition members on the same wave length as diplomats.
Tlass was a close friend and contemporary of Assad and, as the son of longtime Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass, was a member of the Syrian Baath Party aristocracy, part of a privileged class that flourished under the Assad dynasty.
“I think it's a major blow to Assad to see somebody who's a close confidant defect at this point,” said Abdel Basset Sida, head of the Syrian National Council. “This shows us that the very heart of the regime is starting to crumble.”
Mustafa Tlass and Assad's father, Hafez Assad, had been close friends since their days in the Syrian military academy in Homs and became even closer after being posted to Cairo in the late 1950s. After Hafez Assad rose to power in the early 1970s, Mustafa Tlass became defense minister and the Syrian president's most trusted lieutenant as he created the repressive system that still controls the country.
When Hafez Assad died of a heart attack in 2000, the elder Tlass helped engineer Bashar Assad's succession to the presidency and guided the new leader, an inexperienced young doctor. Tlass was the leader of a coterie of old regime figures that critics blamed for reining in moves to liberalize the Syrian regime.
“These defections send a message to Assad, but perhaps more importantly they send a message to those still left, which I hope they hear and heed,” Clinton told reporters. “We have no doubt about the outcome here. We know that the Assad regime will fall. The question is how many more people will have to die before that happens. We want to see those on the inside hasten the day when a new transition can begin.”
The gathering in France's capital aimed to win wider support for a transition plan unveiled by Annan last week. Joined by America's allies, Clinton called for “real and immediate consequences for non-compliance, including sanctions,” against the Assad regime.
But with neither Moscow nor Beijing in attendance, much remained dependent on persuading the two U.N. veto-wielding powers to force Assad into abiding by a cease-fire and the transition strategy. Ministers urged governments around the world to direct their pressure toward Russia and China.
Russia and China have twice blocked U.N. condemnations of Syria's government and just last weekend worked to water down Annan's transition plan.
The Kremlin rejected the anti-Assad call on Friday, with Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that Clinton's comments contradicted Annan's plan, which Washington and Moscow agreed to.
“There is no way of sitting on the side lines on this,” British Foreign Secretary William Hague told the meeting. “If you don't impose sanctions and implement them thoroughly you are allowing … the Assad regime the means to go on killing the Syrian people and we see the tragic results every day.”
He urged nations to immediately stop buying Syrian oil and end cooperation with companies tied to its oil industry.
Fabius, France's foreign minister, maintained that events were bearing down on Assad. Besides the defection, he noted a resolution voted Friday by the United Nations' top human rights body condemning the violence in Syria and demanding authorities cooperate with a U.N. investigation into “widespread, systematic and gross violations of human rights.”
Approved by a 41-3 vote in the 47-nation Human Rights Council, the resolution also calls on Assad's regime to release all political prisoners and allow independent monitors to visit detention facilities.
At the Paris conference, Hashimi and other members of the Syrian opposition pressed for a no-fly zone, similar to that imposed on Libya last year, to prevent Assad's forces from “flying over defected soldiers and civilians and bombarding them.”
There was no letup in violence Friday. At least 25 people were killed by Syrian forces who torched more than 100 homes while seizing the northern city of Khan Sheikhoun from rebels.

For even the most mildly sentient among us, living in the modern world is like being crucified on an old rugged cross of perpetual annoyance.
Public discourse”if you can call it that”has devolved into a ghastly assembly line of vapidity, vanity, shaming, shamelessness, stunted thinking, and arrested emotional development. We are served up the same puke-worthy dish daily”a smarm casserole baked in snark, fricasseed in smugness, and sautÃ©ed in intellectual cowardice.
Sometimes I wish you all had one face so I could vomit on it.
I compiled a similar list last year, much of it comprised of the same sort of flickering nonentities that people this year's list. The main difference with my approach this year is that I”ve decided to go a little more “populist,” to lower my gaze and punch downward, to forgo listing anyone remotely famous”thus there will be no mention of perennial high-profile annoyances such as Barack Obama, Eric Holder, Chris Hayes, Bill de Blasio, or Lena Dunham. I”ve skewered them all this year, and except for that brief mention in that last sentence, they deserve no more of my attention, and to be frank, I”m getting a bit of a headache even thinking about them right now.
I originally compiled a list of over 30 names, gradually winnowing it down to these 14 losers, none of whom I could imagine spending three minutes alone with in a room without wanting to floss my gums with fist-sized glass shards. You may notice there are only six men and eight women on this list, but that is only because women are highly skilled at being annoying.
This is a countdown, from least annoying to most annoying, even though they are all tremendously annoying. Go thy way, all of ye, and annoy me no more!
“Sometimes I wish you all had one face so I could vomit on it.”

Unless half of your face was blown off in battle or you suffered such intensely scarring acne during adolescence that you could hide pocket change in your facial craters, no male face alive looks better with a beard. Yet to my extraordinary annoyance, beards have become the default fashion style for all modern male progressives, no matter how mincingly effeminate they are otherwise. Perhaps beards are only useful in that they allow the casual observer to distinguish between male and female progressives, because they all have boobs these days.
Indiana University's Filippo Menczer has a beard. That's strike one. As of a couple months ago, his personal webpage featured himself and his family depicted as characters from The Simpsons, an animated cartoon series that I”ve always found so supremely annoying that it makes me want to stab hamsters. That's strike two.
Where Menczer strikes out completely is that he's one of the go-to guys for a new database known as “Truthy,” which receives federal funding to monitor “hate speech” on Twitter. I suppose the very fact that I hate bearded government snitches who like The Simpsons may get me red-flagged on Truthy, but if I hid my annoyance with people such as him, it”d give me cancer faster than I could toast a Pop-Tart.
13. Ben Pitcher
Like Filippo Menczer and 99.874% of all modern male leftists, Ben Pitcher has a beard and glasses. And like the devil-hunting Orange County housewives who were always seeing hidden satanic messages on cereal boxes in the 1980s, Pitcher's delusional X-ray vision allows him to see “fascism” in the most benign cultural expressions. This year he did an interview with BBC Radio 4 in which he claimed that the BBC program Gardeners' Question Time “is layered with, saturated with, racial meanings.” No, I”m not kidding. Quite obviously his brain took root and blossomed in some decidedly fallow and shallow soil.
12. Tracy Van Slyke
Another British scribe who is paid to hallucinate racism where none exists, this whinging ginger minge-bucket penned a midsummer essay in The Guardian alleging that the harmless children's animated show Thomas the Tank Engine was a burbling furnace of racism, sexism, homophobia, and anti-worker sentiments. The only thing that I could imagine would make her slightly less annoying would be if Thomas the Tank Engine were to flatten her in a locomotive mishap.
11. Greg Dyke
Yet another impenitent British ethnomasochist, Dyke also proved to be an ungrateful employee, referring to the BBC as “hideously white” while on the company's payroll. While employed as chairman of the Football Association in July, this old, hideous white man referred to the FA as “overwhelmingly male [and] overwhelmingly white” and that it needed to start ethnically cleansing itself of “old white males.” Predictably, he did not offer himself as a sacrifice, because these types never do.
10. Sierra Mannie
Fat, nappy, and perpetually stank-faced, Miz Mannie has found herself writing for TIME magazine as a Professional Angry Black Woman. She scolds gay white males for allegedly stealing black culture, but my spider senses tell me she's more afraid of them stealing her barbecued ribs.
9. Mary Shomon
This is a woman with thyroid problems who appears to think that the “thyroid world“ has a problem with her because she's a woman. She consistently depicts the field of endocrinology as a male-dominated snake pit of misogyny: “I regularly hear the term ‘crazy' used in reference to thyroid patients, and myself.” The possibility that she's crazy seems to have deftly eluded her consciousness.
8. Toni Christina Jenkins
What does it say about America that so few white people are calling black people “niggers” anymore that black people have to make it up to gain attention, money, and sympathy? Jenkins, a Red Lobster waitress in Tennessee, appears to have forged a receipt in which a takeout patron called her a “nigger” instead of leaving her a tip. Jenkins blasted a pic of the forgery on her Facebook page and allegedly received over $10,000 in sympathy donations. Even after a handwriting analyst concluded that her customer, a white male named Devin Barnes, had not written the “nigger” part of the receipt, Jenkins defensively claimed that “I was not trying to get back at him or bring any attention to him at all. I have nothing against him. I can only imagine what he is going through. I was trying to bring attention to racism.” Ms. Jenkins, even the lobsters are laughing at you now.

Some Illinois conservatives fear their children are about to face an assault on their morals and religious beliefs. They worry that state lawmakers will muzzle students who hold unpopular opinions and force them into indoctrination sessions.
The cause of their worry? Legislation requiring Illinois schools to discourage bullying.
The Illinois Family Institute claims the measure's real goal is "to use public education to promote unproven, non-factual beliefs about the nature and morality of homosexuality and 'transgenderism'." It sees the bills as a beachhead for "homosexual activist organizations" that want to indoctrinate students and teachers.
Despite those broad concerns, the group's position is narrower in negotiations at the state Capitol. Lobbyist Ralph Rivera says the Family Institute will drop its opposition if the legislation makes clear that students can skip events and lessons they find objectionable.
A closer look reveals little in the legislation itself to justify the institute's fears. It would not tell local schools what to say about bullying, let alone anything specific about homosexuality. It would not require schools to hold assemblies or teach lessons about tolerance.
What the bill would do is spell out the steps that must be included in schools' anti-bullying policies. For instance, they would have to make the policy available to students through a website or school handbook. They would have to let students report bullying anonymously and spell out what steps could be taken with a student who has bullied classmates.
At the same time, the institute's request for a specific "opt out" provision is not unprecedented. Illinois laws already let students opt out of sex education and animal dissection if they have moral objections.
Groups supporting the legislation include the Illinois State Board of Education, American Civil Liberties Union, Illinois Safe Schools Alliance and the gay rights groups Equality Illinois and The Civil Rights Agenda.
Joining the Illinois Family Institute on the other side is the Concerned Christians of America.
Based on the recommendations of a state task force, the bill says a school's bullying policy must include a definition, a statement that bullying is against the law and procedures for accepting and investigating anonymous reports. The policy would have to explain what steps might be taken with a bully, such as counseling and community service, and it would have to be available to students and parents.
The only lessons in tolerance mentioned in the legislation are for students who have bullied others. Schools would be required to take steps that teach bullies "personal and interpersonal skills" and "build and restore relationships." How to do that is left up to each school and each community.
Rivera, the Family Institute's lobbyist, said the group opposes the bill but not its overall goal. "I want to always stress that the IFI wants a zero-tolerance policy on bullying," he said.
The group's main concerns, he said, are protecting students from being accused of bullying simply for stating their beliefs and from being forced to participate in lessons that contradict their religious beliefs. For instance, a student who does nothing more than share his opinion that homosexuality is immoral shouldn't be labeled a bully and put through counseling that says his religion is wrong.
To address those fears, the legislation's backers included language saying it is not meant to "infringe upon any right to exercise free expression or the free exercise of religion or religiously based views." At the IFI's request, they placed that statement in a prominent spot near the beginning of the legislation.
Then the IFI asked for a provision saying students and teachers can skip anti-bullying lessons and events that they feel are contrary to their beliefs. Supporters rejected that idea.
Khadine Bennett, legislative counsel for the Illinois branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that's partly because the measure only narrowly passed the House. Sending it back now with such a major change might kill it, she said.
What's more, she and others say, the change is unnecessary. Students can already opt out of lessons that conflict with their beliefs.
While state law specifically lets students opt out of dissection and sex education, the State Board of Education says there's no blanket rule letting students skip anything where they have moral objections. Still, spokesman Matt Vanover said it's common for schools to work with students and adapt lessons to accommodate such concerns.
Although the bill doesn't tell schools what to say about homosexuality, the IFI remains concerned that the "completely unnecessary" legislation is really about lecturing students on what to believe and contradicting the lessons of parents who have moral objections.

Not so, insisted one sponsor, Sen. Heather Steans, D-Chicago.
"This bill has nothing to do with that," she said. "The idea is to really stop bullying."

Britain is a longstanding US imperial partner, involved in virtually all its wars of aggression – four post-9/11. It's been covertly bombing Syrian targets jointly with US warplanes since last year, along with Israel, France, Canada and Australia – on the phoney pretext of combating ISIS.
Now it's official after parliament voted 397 to 223 for war (a nearly two-thirds majority), following nearly a half-day debate – dozens of Labour and Lib Dem MPs joining with hawkish Tories.
Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn's strong opposition didn't help. In response to the vote, he twittered: “I have argued, and will continue to do so, that we should re-double our efforts to secure a diplomatic and political end to the conflict in Syria.”
“British service men and women will now be in harm's way and the loss of innocent lives is sadly almost inevitable.”
Ironically, Corbyn's shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn supported Prime Minister David Cameron.
Ignoring Cameron's real objective, Benn said “(w)e must now confront this evil. It is now time for us to do our bit in Syria.”
Cameron knows full well Britain's involvement is naked aggression on sovereign Syria, its infrastructure, other government targets, perhaps military ones to follow, and its entire population, suffering hugely since Obama illegally declared war in March 2011, using ISIS as imperial foot soldiers, supplemented since last year by US air power and now growing numbers of special forces on the ground.
US, UK, French, Canadian, Israeli and Australian military operations (with Germany posed to join them) are llegal – conducted without Security Council authorization.
Cameron is now openly partnering with Obama's aggression, along with other coalition partners – on the phony pretext of combating terrorism.
Hypocrisy and endless wars of aggression define Obama's legacy. Since taking office in January 2009, he broke every major promise made, domestic and geopolitical – notably on US Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia policy, pledging hope, change, peace, democratic values, “a new era of openness,” and willingness to engage virtually all world heads of state diplomatically.
Instead he delivered confrontation with Moscow and Beijing.
The threat of another global war is greater than any time since the late 1930s – today's super-weapons making ones used in that era look like toys.
Hours after Britain's parliament approved war on Syria, four Cyprus-based Royal Air Force Tornadoes joined with US warplanes, launching lawless airstrikes, hitting no ISIS targets. Britain's Defense Ministry withheld information on sites struck.
Obama issued a statement, saying
“(w)e look forward to having British forces flying with the coalition over Syria, and will work to integrate them into our coalition air-tasking orders as quickly as possible.”
Britain's Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond issued an ominous statement, saying “(a)irstrikes alone will not finish ISIL,” suggesting a Western ground campaign to come.
Russia's effective intervention changed things dramatically for Syria, clashing with Washington's imperial objectives. Could Syria become a flashpoint for US-Moscow confrontation?

In the beginning, before there was light to brighten the earth, and before there were beasts to walk the land, and before there were birds to fly the sky there existed a single entity. The One had much wisdom and power. Emelbee was the One. Emelbee was a great serpent, which feasted on his own tail, gaining infinite knowledge and immense power. Emelbee foresaw that he was slowly dying, as the universe slowly separated. With the power of the stars to create a body, and the power of the sea to create longevity, and the power of the trees to create breath, and the power of the sun to give birth, Emelbee gave his creation onto the world and said, “My life will endure through the people I created, and all will be good in life.” Emelbee had created man in the first beginning. The Beginning of New Life. Emelbees power was slowly disappearing, but he led his children Mankind to have a new impact in the great world. All was great for many millennia, as The One led over the world. With peace and happiness mankind knew no evil, all that known in the world was peace and The One. As Emelbee slowly lost power, he realized he would not rule over Mankind forever, and one day his presence to them would become lost. With fear that his creation would forget of his existence, he began to expel his Mankind. Emelbee wanted to show his power of the earth, and created the great Disasters which would act a s a plague onto his first creation. Hurricanus, Tornadus, Volcanus, Tsunamus, and Quakus brought destruction onto Mankind. Mankind was fearful of the Disasters, and prayed greatly unto The One Emelbee so that he might see mercy and take the power of the Disasters away. After many years of no response from Emelbee, Mankind was tired of the Disasters, and wished to draw battle with The One. Mankind rose up against the oppression by Emelbee and led a revolution. To Mankind Emelbee had grown weak, and to Mankind there was no sense in living for a weak power. Mank ind saw that together they were strong, so the joined forces to fully become the New Life. One great man among the many rose up, to lead the revolution, his name was Kylus. Kylus had much wisdom and much knowledge of the created world and with the knowledge of the land a nd of the sky, Kylus was able to help Mankind avoid destruction from the Disasters. The Disasters power became weak as Kylus became strong and overcame the Disasters. With the power of the sea, Kylus flooded Volcanus. With the power of fire, Kylus burned Hurricanus. With the power of darkness, Kylus blacked out Tsunamus. With the power o f wind, Kylus settled Quakus. With the power of land, Kylus silenced Tornadus. Kylus finished the Disasters, and Mankind saw no oppression for much time. Emelbee had been slowly fading, and his final days were drawing near. With enough days to see the next blue moon, Emelbee began to take his remaining power and draw it into 30 New Powers to lead over Mankind. Emelbee would split himself into 30 equal pa rts, so that he may forever live alongside of man. Emelbee, The One, was no longer. The night of the blue moon signaled the fall of Emelbee, but the rise of the New Power.
A long list of Hollywood heavyweights have put their names to a letter slamming Hamas over the “devastating loss of life endured by Israelis and Palestinians in Gaza.”
The reported 187 signatories, who include Mayim Bialik, Minnie Driver, Kelsey Grammer, Seth Rogen, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sarah Silverman, and Sylvester Stallone, condemn the “ideologies of hatred and genocide which are reflected in Hamas' charter, Article 7 of which reads, ‘There is a Jew hiding behind me, come on and kill him!'”
In their letter, set to be published on Sunday in Billboard, Variety and Hollywood Reporter, and also in leading US newspapers, they write that “Hamas cannot be allowed to rain rockets on Israeli cities, nor can it be allowed to hold its own people hostage. Hospitals are for healing, not for hiding weapons. Schools are for learning, not for launching missiles. Children are our hope, not our human shields.”

Other signatories include director Ivan Reitman, writer Aaron Sorkin, producers Michael Rotenberg and Avi Lerner, chairman and CEO of PMK•BNC Michael Nyman, talent manager Danny Sussman and mogul Haim Saban, Ynet reported Saturday.
The full text of the letter reads:
“We, the undersigned, are saddened by the devastating loss of life endured by Israelis and Palestinians in Gaza. We are pained by the suffering on both sides of the conflict and hope for a solution that brings peace to the region.
“While we stand firm in our commitment to peace and justice, we must also stand firm against ideologies of hatred and genocide which are reflected in Hamas' charter, Article 7 of which reads, ‘There is a Jew hiding behind me, come on and kill him!' The son of a Hamas founder has also commented about the true nature of Hamas.
“Hamas cannot be allowed to rain rockets on Israeli cities, nor can it be allowed to hold its own people hostage. Hospitals are for healing, not for hiding weapons. Schools are for learning, not for launching missiles. Children are our hope, not our human shields.
“We join together in support of the democratic values we all cherish and in the hope that the healing and transformative power of the arts can be used to build bridges of peace.”
The initiative, which Ynet said was launched by an organization called Creative Community for Peace, culminates weeks of celebrity comment on the Israel-Hamas conflict.
On July 18, pop star Selena Gomez urged her Instagram followers to “Pray for Gaza,” then followed up a few hours later to add that she was “not picking any sides.” That was more than enough for Joan Rivers, who capped off a pro-Israel tirade by sarcastically mocking Gomez as “that college grad,” then added, “Let's see if she can spell Palestinian.”
Married celebrity Spanish actors Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz (along with filmmaker Pedro Almodovar) signed onto a letter accusing the Israeli army of “genocide” in Gaza.
Jon Voight, in reply, ripped Cruz and Bardem as “obviously ignorant of the whole story of Israel's birth” and accused them of inciting anti-Semitism.
Cruz released a statement noting that she was “not an expert on the situation” and that she only wished to promote peace. Bardem similarly announced, “My signature was solely meant as a plea for peace.”
In fact a number of the celebrities who have spoken out on the Gaza conflict have followed a pattern similar to that of Cruz and Bardem — a gesture in sympathy with the Palestinians (sometimes paired with harsh criticism of Israel) followed by criticism that leads to backtracking (possibly with the caveat that no bigotry was intended), finally capped off with a vague call for peace.
It was the path taken by Rihanna, who tweeted #Free Palestine, only to delete the tweet eight minutes later and subsequently post a picture of a Jewish and Arab boy walking arm in arm with the message, “Let's pray for peace and a swift end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict!”
Madonna followed a similar path, though more elaborate, posting a picture of flowers with the caption, “These flowers are like the innocent children of GAZA! Who has the right to destroy them? No One!!!” She then quickly turned defensive, tweeting, “I do not support Hamas!” adding “I support Peace!”
Jewish Voice for Peace posted a video of celebrities holding the names of Gazans who had been killed. The video included Eve Ensler, Mandy Patinkin, Roger Waters, Chuck D and Brian Eno. Eno also posted an editorial on David Byrne's website that was highly critical of Israel.
On the other end of the ideological spectrum, Jackie Mason and Howard Stern cut loose with diatribes aimed at critics of Israel.
“If you're anti-Israel then you're anti-America,” Stern announced on his radio show.
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said that composer Michael Nyman was a signatory to the letter, when in fact it was PMK•BNC chairman and CEO Michael Nyman.
A DUBLIN pub which sold the capital's first alcoholic drink in exchange for a virtual currency known as Bitcoin has suspended the service, citing "ongoing issues" with the legality of Bitcoin ATMs.
A DUBLIN pub which sold the capital's first alcoholic drink in exchange for a virtual currency known as Bitcoin has suspended the service, citing "ongoing issues" with the legality of Bitcoin ATMs.
The Baggot Inn in Dublin city centre claimed to have sold the country's first beverage, a bottle of Kopparberg cider, for 0.0093 Bitcoin last March.
In a statement, the pub's management said a Bitcoin ATM on the premises had been removed, adding: "We regret to announce (that) due to ongoing issues regarding the legality of Bitcoin ATMs in the Republic of Ireland, we can no longer accept Bitcoin payments."
A spokeswoman from the Central Bank of Ireland said it does not have regulations in place for Bitcoin as it does not consider it legal tender.
However, Healy's Lounge in Ballycastle, Co Mayo, which claimed to have completed the first such Bitcoin transaction as early as February, has sold up to 200 pints since introducing the service and has deemed it a big success in the area.
Local man Padraic Mitchell, who set up the service for the pub, said it sold the bulk of these pints during the August Bank Holiday weekend.
"We had a lot of people down for Healyfest, a music festival that's held every August Bank Holiday at the pub," he said. "But it's more of a novelty thing."
Meanwhile, GSM solutions, which installed one of the first Bitcoin ATMs in Ireland and also accepts the five-year-old currency, said it has remained a popular alternative to cash or credit cards.

Yang was up early. Unreasonably early. She took her face out of Jack's broad chest and glanced at the clock, which read 4:15. She grinned. Sliding out of bed again, she put a hand to her breasts under her shirt. Considering everything she owned had seemed to shrink, or otherwise stop fitting properly, she hadn't worn a bra, but wore a tight fitting black top rather than a white one, just so she could occasionally glance at the mirror and see those two slight, slight mounds that marked her nipples. She played with them through the top, running her fingers and twisting to elicit joy. Along with her shirt, she removed the covers on the bed, exposing Jack's large body that had previously been covered by them. He continued to sleep, unaware the blankets had been removed. Yang slid back onto the bed, inches away from him.
"Wanna have some fun?" Yang whispered to Jack's sleeping form. As expected, there was no response. She smiled anyway.
Yang cupped an exposed breast and lowered her other hand into her lilac and sufficiently naughty panties. Lying right next to Jack, Yang began masturbating, instantly causing herself to moan into his sleeping ear. He stirred, but only slightly. Yang continued pleasuring herself inches away from his sleeping body, running her fingers down her mound and massaging every inch as she held her considerable bust. Hastening herself, she doubled down as she felt close to finishing. She brought her mouth to Jack's ear and continued to moan and breath, getting louder as she thought about the previous day.
"Ah... Ahhhh... Ahhhhhh... Jackkk... JACKKK!" Yang nearly screamed into Jack's ear as she came, releasing and wetting her fingers. She kept going as she saw the large figure stir in the darkness, rousing ever so slightly. Grabbing his hand, Yang placed it on her bountiful bust and left it there, letting the unconscious man grope her. She placed her hand on his shoulder and shook as she writhed, finishing again in a loud and high motion fashion. She noticed his body moving and shook more.
"Hmm..." a mostly asleep Jack muttered. He heard more and more of his name as he drifted out of sleep. Yang's faint figure was in front of him, which he soon realized was both the source of the noise and the source of the pushing on his shoulder. He shot up, still mostly asleep. "What? What's wrong? Are you okay?"
Yang moaned Jack's name again in response. Jack suddenly realized the soft, warm object he held in his hand was far squishier than a pillow and somehow correlated to Yang's noises. Suddenly, he became significantly more awake as he felt a tug at his pajama bottoms. He squeezed his hand, confirming he held Yang's luscious breast in it before she shuffled way from his grip.
"Yang?" Jack, awake but not fully lucid, asked. "What's going on?"
Yang stifled her giggles as she slid silently off the bed and made her way to the end. She whispered, "Shh! They'll hear!" as she climbed up and positioned her face near Jack's crotch. She stopped any questions from being asked as she lowered his pajama bottoms and shorts in an instant, exposing his manhood. Jack felt more than saw his exposure due to the lack of light, along with the moist warmth he could only assume was Yang's breath. He got his scroll from the bedside table and used the screen light to confirm that Yang was drooling over his dick. She looked up, cheerfully smiling.
"Are you gonna record?"
Jack blinked, still trying to come to terms with his state of consciousness. Yang continued to look at him, face unchanging.
"Uhh... Am now." Jack messed with his screen, half expecting to wake up in the morning without a hot topless blonde licking her lips at the foot of the bed as one usually expects. He accepted his dream/dream come true and said, "Okay..."
Jack realized the good way that he was awake as Yang grabbed his shaft, pointing it straight up as she lowered her mouth over it. Her warmth met his as he shuddered, her tongue forcing him to cover his mouth in an attempt not to wake Ross and Nichol. In the faint light of his scroll, he watched Yang bob up and down, her face looking across at his as he lay prostrated on the bed.
Jack allowed himself to receive a blowjob from Yang, never questioning why or for what reason. His mind was blank, only focused on capturing the image of a topless Yang suck him off as he shuddered in pleasure. Yang paused to take a breath.
"Do you want me to...?"
Yang stared at Jack, saying nothing. The giant reached down and gripped her hair with his free hand, pulling tightly as she returned to her mission. She stifled multiple screams as he yanked downward and forced her to accept his entire throbbing length, sending it down her throat.
"How did I do this before!?" Yang thought, crying partly from her lack of air but mainly from another orgasm. "It just feels so gooddd..." she mused as she felt herself weaken. Jack's erection stuffed her face as she was forced downward, eventually earning a temporary relief as he raised her head to allow air. He waited until she stopped gasping to shove her back down, causing her to cum as she felt the shaft blow past her mouth again. Yang let Jack know this fact with a tearful, "MMPHHH!" as she looked up, bliss painted on her face.
Jack began thrusting upward, not giving Yang a chance to recover as she came again, the erection filling her. The blonde struggled as she fought herself; every single last part of her was perfectly fine being used as a toy like she was, but she did need to breathe. Jack gave her few precious seconds as she sputtered through his shaft, letting her take in just enough air to finish the job. She wrapped her lips around his erection once more, taking in the tip as her soft hands stroked the considerable rest.
Jack grunted a low, "It's time," barely scraping a whisper as he moved his hand to the top of Yang's head and dragged her forcefully down as she offered zero resistance. Yang felt the man's entire length reach down her throat and choke her as both came. She felt seed shoot down her throat, but she wanted the taste. She wanted her cheeks to fill. She wanted to swallow every last drop of Jack's cum. She lifted her head up, leading the shaft tip towards the entrance of her mouth as she released the rest to outside. Jack continued to flowing into her, fulfilling her want of being stuffed and letting her swallow over and over again to keep herself filled. After what felt like forever, she lapped up the last drop, everything now resting inside her stomach, temporarily satisfying her constant burning. She breathed deep, still not completely oxygenated as she felt exhaust and precious weakness.
"Ahh," Yang said as she opened her mouth and pointed for the camera, letting it know she accepted everything she was given. "You're so big and–" Yang's compliments were cut short as she felt herself get dragged like she weighed nothing. "Huh?" Before she knew it, the blonde was pinned under Jack's massive frame. "What are you–
"My turn." Jack's eyes pierced through the darkness, filled with a burning ambition as he sat below Yang's knees, providing her just enough freedom to writhe. He readjusted his pants, covering his expended shaft, and forced his arm over Yang's mouth. "Shh. They'll hear you."
"Mh?" Yang managed before being made to understand.
Jack roughly gripped her breast, squeezing tight before lowering his arm. Yang shook her head as much as she could in protest as he snuck his hand under her panties and edged her sex. Her eyes widened in a mix of fear and excitement and she struggled to say anything through Jack's titanic wrist.
"Oh my god yes yes YES YESYESYESYESYESSS!" Yang's thoughts grew dark as she sat back and felt her fire fuel. Jack stared at her, unflinchingly working his fingers around her mound, forcing Yang to reach her boiling point. She was absolutely powerless to stop him, his weight, grip, and ministrations ensuring that Yang was caught in a state of being in uncontrolled divinity. Her life became nothing but pleasure as Jack slid his fingers in, roughly thrusting forward as he muted her screams through his massive arm. Yang wriggled endlessly as she was penetrated by a giant's rough fingers over and over and over and over again and came over and over and over and over again, the stimulation rocking her body like a tornado running through her core. She felt nothing but endless elation until she lost track of everything and couldn't even attempt to scream in vain anymore. Her panties were absolutely drenched with her lust, her facing matching due to tears.
Jack watched Yang's eyes roll and removed his forearm from her mouth, letting her breathe unhindered as she continued to shudder. Her tongue lolled out as she became mindless, content to dwell in her seemingly infinite climaxes for as long as she could. After potentially eons, she returned to the world, still gasping for air and eking out silent joy.
"Y-You'll always be my favorite," Yang said, stumbling off to her side of the bed and retrieving her top after spending a significant amount of time recovering. She slid it on and changed panties, removing the ones completely ruined by her lust and Jack's lack of mercy. She climbed back into bed and put her face back into the man's chest as he pulled up the covers. She nodded off after nuzzling into his chest, exhausted after the events that had just transpired.
"Today's going to be fun."
This is a good article and a good start in recognizing one of the elements needed to build a nation. It is the human factor. However, Does Brain Regain mean simply "hired help" where experts and talented professionals are moving to where the opportunity is, getting highly compensated for their perceived value, building wealth and then moving back to home base (US, UK..)? - This is a fundamental question here. If that is the case then - I believe the trend can and will be reversed with time (most of these professionals would send their children back to home base for higher education and none return).
Allow me to propose another question: Why did the doctor leave his home country and moved to the West? The answers are many and multifold. It is the opportunity to success, be respected as a professional, and have an equal opportunity to live (eat) – not only for him but for generations that follow. They will be part of building the new home and be happy while doing it. Isn't that a powerful concept? It is so powerful it is beautiful.
Here is what – I suspect- the doctor and other professionals like him/me and their families where offered, they were offered a home, a country they can call their own as they become citizens of that country. It is nation building. It is a sense of purpose.
This magnet can be a more powerful one if the above is considered.
Retired U.S. Army Gen. Geoffrey Miller, former commander of the prison at Guantánamo Bay, did not appear for questioning before a French court on Tuesday, after being subpoenaed last month.
Miller was summoned to answer questions about his role in the detention and torture of two former Guantánamo detainees, French citizens Mourad Benchellali and Nizar Sassi. After being transferred to French custody, both were acquitted of terrorism-related charges in 2009.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs predicted Gen. Miller would not appear. In an interview with France 24, William Bourdon, Benchellali's lawyer, said, “Top U.S. civilian and military officials refuse to be held to account by [foreign] judges.”
Bourdon confirmed to The Intercept that the plaintiffs will request an arrest warrant for Miller. It could only be enforced if he enters the country.
President Obama banned torture in the first week of his presidency. Citing his desire to “look forward, not backward,” however, he has declined to prosecute the senior officials responsible, and has used the state secrets privilege to block lawsuits from torture victims.
With Obama shielding U.S. officials from criminal and civil liability, former detainees are turning to international courts for justice — but the Obama administration is not cooperating. In 2012, the judge in Benchellali and Sassi's case requested U.S. government documents related to the plaintiffs' detentions, but got no response.
Similar probes of Bush administration officials are underway in Spain and Germany. Last year, the European Court of Human Rights ordered Poland to pay damages to detainees held in a U.S.-operated black site in the country.
Miller's failure to show up was criticized by human rights groups.
“Miller's absence speaks volumes about the Obama administration's continued unwillingness to confront America's torture legacy,” said Katherine Gallagher, senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, in a statement emailed to The Intercept. “The administration not only refuses to investigate U.S. officials like Miller for torture, it apparently remains unwilling to cooperate when other countries seek to uphold their international obligations to prosecute torturers.”
Defense Department and Justice Department officials did not respond to repeated requests to comment.
Benchellali and Sassi traveled to Afghanistan in the summer of 2001, together with Benchellali's older brother, Menad. According to Benchellali, Menad convinced them it would be a fun vacation — but he had other ideas. Benchellali and Sassi ended up at an al Qaeda training camp against their will, and Benchellali claims that they tried to escape.
After the September 11 terror attacks, Benchellali and Sassi were captured by the Pakistani army and handed over to U.S. officials. Menad was later arrested in connection to a 2002 plot to bomb the Russian Embassy in Paris.
When Miller took command of Guantánamo in November 2002, he oversaw a rapid expansion in the use of torture. Despite having no prior experience with interrogations, he pushed to expand the list of authorized techniques, calling sensory deprivation, isolation, and sleep deprivation “essential.”
In 2004 and 2005, respectively, Benchellali and Sassi were transferred to French custody. A French appeals court acquitted both in 2009. Miller left Guantánamo in 2004 to oversee military detention in Iraq, where he reportedly said he wanted to “Gitmo-ize” U.S.-run prisons. Months later, Miller would emerge as a central figure in the Abu Ghraib scandal. During the courts-martial of lower-level officers, he repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment rights.
Miller retired in 2006 and was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for “exceptionally commendable service.”
The all-female Portland comedy festival “All Jane No Dick” is being threatened with protests by a men's rights activist who believes the event discriminates against men, LA Weekly‘s Jennifer Swann reports.
The “All Jane No Dick” festival is meant as a reminder that only 15 percent of touring comedians, and only 5 percent of the most successful, are female. The title of the event is a pun on the Read With Dick and Jane series of children's books. But according to Matt “The Lone Woof” — as he asked to be called — the man who posted the Craiglist ad announcing the protest, “there's an ulterior motive” to the pun, “which is the anti-male connotation.”
“The fact that it's all female is sexist,” he told Willamette Week‘s Amy Miller. “Why does it have to be all female? Are there any all-men festivals? If you called it ‘All Dick and No Jane,' the feminists would be up in arms.”
According to the posters Matt stapled on top of fliers for the event, “all men will have their dicks severed on-site” at the “All Dick Envy but No Dick Man-Bash Festival.” When Miller confronted him, “The Lone Woof” turned out to be “a very standard-looking Portland dude, complete with a knit beanie and an accidental beard thing,” and though he insisted he was not affiliated with the Men's Rights Movement (MRM), his list of complaints — as well as the language in which he couched them — was consistent with theirs.
“This is my first time ‘growing a pair' and stepping out to the limelight and expressing what I feel is a growing problem based on somewhat misrepresented facts put out by the feminist propaganda machine,” he said, before complaining about a women's meditation tent at a recent state fair. When Miller informed him that it was most likely “based on the real and present physical threat that men pose to women on a regular basis,” he replied, “well, there were probably also some men there that got smacked around by their girlfriends. And some drunk guys whose girlfriends had sex with them while they were unconscious, which is still raped.”
Claiming that violence and sexual assault against men is un- or under-reported is one of the MRM's most common complaints.
In the Craigslist ad, “The Lone Woof” insists that “[t]his is not a MRA event. I represent no organization or political party. I am simply one human. Standing bravely against a growing sexist paradigm.” However, in his interview with Miller, he tells her “[w]hat I really am is I guess you could call me a Men's Rights Activist,” and that he's proud to be “the first outspoken one in Portland, which makes me kind of brave if you think about it.”
According to L.A. comedy promoter Samantha Varela, however, “this guy's definitely a confused asshole.”
Hurricane Irma is gathering strength over the Atlantic Ocean as it heads towards the Caribbean. Already rated Category 5, it is expected to make landfall in Florida by the end of the week, with many worried about a repeat of the havoc caused in Texas and Louisiana by Hurricane Harvey.
None of that seems to worry Rush Limbaugh.
On Monday, the right-wing radio personality delivered a customarily freewheeling monologue in which he seemed to suggest that hurricanes were a liberal conspiracy intended to convince the public that climate change is real.
Trending: Donald Trump Twitter: Who Writes the President's Tweets?
Limbaugh is not a meteorologist, as he acknowledges at the opening of the monologue, before proceeding to muse on meteorology. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Limbaugh is a resident of Palm Beach, Florida, and the hurricane-themed monologue appeared to be driven by his observation that bottled water had already been sold out in local stores, in preparation for Irma's imminent landfall.
“The reason that I am leery of forecasts this far out, folks, is because I see how the system works,” Limbaugh said, alluding to alleged conspiracies against President Donald J. Trump. “Hurricane Harvey and the TV pictures that accompany that go a long way to helping further and create the panic.”

Hurricane Harvey flooded 50 counties, killed 63 people and displaced more than a million. Limbaugh did not offer evidence of how any of this was a conspiracy by the "Deep State," environmentalists or other groups that might presumably want to exaggerate the storm's devastation.
The crux of Limbaugh's argument was that “in the official meteorological circles, you have an abundance of people who believe that man-made climate change is real. And they believe that Al Gore is correct when he has written—and he couldn't be more wrong—that climate change is creating more hurricanes and stronger hurricanes.”
It is not clear what Limbaugh meant by “official meteorological circles.” Perhaps this is a reference to people who have studied meteorology and are experts in the field. Recently, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory published an extensive review that said it was “premature” to declare a causal link between human activity and hurricane strength. However, that same review said that “it is likely that climate warming will cause hurricanes in the coming century to be more intense globally and to have higher rainfall rates than present-day hurricanes.”

The journalist John K. Wilson has called Limbaugh “the country's leading denier of global climate change.” That mantle has been proudly claimed by President Trump, who does not appear to believe that global warming is real. Nor do most national Republican politicians. A recent Gallup poll found that only 18 percent of Republicans “worry a great deal” about climate change; conversely, 66 percent of Democrats evinced a heightened level of concern about it.
Capt. Ashley Collette still struggles with the complex emotions of losing her close friend in an explosion in Afghanistan while he was under her command.
In spite of her anguish, Collette is telling her story to encourage other soldiers to share the truth of their experience and embolden members of the public to ask questions even when it's hard.
“It's challenging as a human being, it's challenging both in the experience but more importantly on the return back home. I wish we could begin a dialogue between the Canadian Forces and the population to know that it's OK to talk about it, it's OK to ask questions,” Collette, based at CFB Edmonton, said in an interview Thursday. “I think it's important, as part of the warrior ethos, to tell people what your experience has been.”
Collette is one of five soldiers who are sharing their stories of fighting with the Canadian Forces in Afghanistan in a new TV documentary, I Am War — airing on the History Channel on Nov. 10 — looking to share the human experience of war.
Collette now works as a social work officer at CFB Edmonton. But in 2010, she was a platoon commander with 1st Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment, based at Petawawa, Ont. She earned the Medal of Military Valour for her service.
Between May and December 2010, Collette commanded a platoon of anywhere between 40 and 70 soldiers on a security operation in Nakhonay, a small town in Afghanistan, dodging bullets, explosives and suicide attacks.
“We encountered many IEDs (improvised explosive devices) in our time there,” said Collette. “Every time we went out on patrol at the beginning of our time in Afghanistan, we would find anywhere between three and five improvised explosive devices. On several occasions, they would go off. We lost a few people from our platoon and a few people attached to our platoon during our time there.”
On June 21, 2010, Collette said a patrol group was returning to the platoon house when soldiers discovered another IED not far from their base. Among them was Sgt. Jimmy MacNeil, Collette's close friend and a well-liked member of her platoon.
“Jimmy was not only important to me … he was really important to the rest of the group. He was a big morale boost for everybody. Everybody who knows Jimmy knows he was the shining light of every group,” said Collette.
Before a planned detonation, something went wrong and the IED exploded, killing MacNeil.
“The time between when we heard that detonate and when we heard something over the radio seemed like 20 minutes; I'm sure it was 10 seconds, but it seemed like a lifetime,” Collette said.
With five months left in Afghanistan and a platoon in need of leadership, Collette didn't have time to mourn the death of her friend. Instead, Collette focused on her duties.
“Each and every person under my command was so important to me. There is the experience of that split second of loss, but truly the body and mind goes to the level of training that you have,” Collette said.
The hard part came when she returned home.
“I remember having a hard time understanding how to have a conversation with people who hadn't been there,” said Collette.
In sharing her story, Collette hopes to remove the fear of asking questions and hearing the truth about the real human experience of military conflict.
“I wish … that it would give people a little spark into what they might ask another soldier, or even just permission to ask the tough questions, to ask whatever they want to ask, and that it would give the soldier that wants to share the permission to share their experiences and to not be scared of hurting another person by telling them the truth about their experience,” Collette said. “I think it's important that we collectively share our experience of what we've gone through.”

In the stagnant country of his little bedroom, on the island of his gigantic bed, with two curtains sewn together to clothe his body, Paul Mason decided that he didn't want to die. Three years had seeped in and out of the room, with his head at the same angles, the mass of him pooling outward, the banal sensation of the air-conditioning breathing onto his urine sores. By then Mason had been dubbed the world's fattest man, perhaps the most ridiculed person in the United Kingdom, trapped on a 10-foot mattress, everything he'd ever collected on shelves within arm's reach. He was also weary of his appetites; he no longer wanted to consume his daily intake of nearly 20,000 calories. He was exhausted of wondering what it might be like outside his house.
He wanted out of his skin, and skin was all that he'd become. He had given up on losing weight naturally. His breakfast was the meal of ten people—a pack of bacon and a pack of sausages and countless eggs, and his snacks were 40 bags of potato chips and 20 chocolate bars a day. An intercom system on his front door allowed restaurants to deliver food to his bedside, entering his little flat through the doors and hallways specially widened by England's National Health Service. He wore a little white towel draped over his privates. At his heaviest he'd weighed 20 pounds shy of 1,000.
He knew that bariatric surgery had a good chance of killing him, just as it could save him. The procedure, he understood, would shrink his stomach from the size of a melon to the size of an egg, bypass much of his small intestine, and give him a 50 percent chance at a new life. The other 50 percent meant a possible heart attack or blood clot, a burst vessel, catastrophic organ failure—a complication that would snuff him out before he even awoke from the operation. But without the surgery he was dead anyway.
And so on a freezing day in the winter of 2010, five paramedics in yellow suits wheeled Mason out of his home on the bed where he lived. Using a motorized winch, they hoisted his extra-wide reinforced stretcher into the back of the supersized ambulance that the Suffolk branch of the NHS had scoured all Great Britain to find. (A helicopter, which had been considered, didn't have a door wide enough.)
The ambulance drove south, followed by photographers trying to snap pictures of the human being the tabloids had dubbed "Man Mountain." He watched the traffic out the back windows. How bizarre, he thought—he hadn't remembered that cars could go so fast.

The logistics of getting him into surgery were unprecedented. Engineers had realized before he arrived that the operating room probably wouldn't be sturdy enough to hold him. After consulting blueprints, they ultimately installed metal supports beneath the floor. Then doctors had to make a scary guess about how much anesthetic to pump into their patient. He needed much more than a normal person; the customary amount would merely dissolve in his body. But too much could mean death.
He was all too familiar with that precarious balance. In 2008, he had tried to commit suicide by taking enough codeine to kill two people, but he'd woken up the next morning with only a headache—his body had absorbed it all. Now he'd had a change of heart.His surgeon, Shaw Somers, was something of a celebrity in Britain. He had appeared on a TV show called Fat Doctor, and had operated on thousands of obese patients. When he first visited Mason to assess whether he could withstand the surgery, Somers stood over his bed. With his bare hands, he pushed around on the mound of Mason's torso, lifting the folds that caregivers had spent hours rubbing with medicinal cream, revealing buried, luminescent skin. When he was done, Somers asked Mason if he would be willing to die in order to lose weight. Mason began to bellow and sob. Yes, he told Somers. He was willing.
On the day of his surgery—after first spending two weeks on a milk diet in order to lose as much weight as possible beforehand—Mason lay on a new surgical bed, the largest available, though his skin still dangled off the side. Somers and his team set about performing a keyhole gastric bypass, which required sticking five ports into small incisions patterned out on Mason's abdomen. Blood trickled down his stomach from each hole where the ports went. Somers manipulated his surgical instruments through the ports, using shears and stitching instruments to cut around Mason's stomach fat. Mason was asleep, a breathing mask covering his face. Though most of his internal organs were blanketed in a thick yellow layer of fat, his heart looked amazingly healthy.
If you're looking for a way to gauge how the 3D printing market will evolve, look no further than the dawn of two other revolutionizing technologies – the desktop printing market and the VHS standard. And be prepared for a decidedly off-color story.
While many of us have fond memories of watching a favorite movie when it first came out on VHS, or admiring the first three-color party invitation we printed on a laser printer, the fact remains that innocent pursuits were not the sole reason either of these technologies took off. And we shouldn't expect 3D printing to be any different.
The reality is that in both cases, the illegal, illicit, and otherwise unwholesome played a major role in the growth of both the VHS and desktop printing markets. While it's clear that most applications of these technologies were G-rated, there were plenty that weren't. And when it comes to 3D printing, that unwholesome and downright illegal activity called counterfeiting is likely to become one of the major reasons why 3D printing will be a major growth industry in the coming years.
To be sure, as with all technologies, from the Paleolithic stone ax to 20th century nuclear fission, there are applications for good that hopefully outweigh the not-so-good. And 3D printing will have its fair share: from the manufacture of prosthetics and spare parts to on-demand organs, foods, and your child's next toy, the 3D printing revolution will by and large have a positive impact on society as a whole.
But the threat of a major surge in counterfeiting based on the availability of relatively cheap 3D printers, increasingly sophisticated printing materials, and a never-ending supply of CAD designs available on the Internet will fuel an enormous black market in counterfeit parts. And the potential impact of 3D printers for counterfeiting just keeps on growing: A recent report by Gartner Group speculates that intellectual property loss due to 3D printer counterfeiting could total $100 billion by 2018.
What is it about 3D printing that will make it, in the words of Scientific American, “the counterfeiter's best friend”? Just like the desktop printing industry of the 1980s, it's that perfect storm of three important factors: the availability of a breakthrough device at a consumer price, the availability of the raw materials needed to copy something valuable, and the right software for turning the new technology into a counterfeiter's “best friend.”
1985 was the year the perfect storm hit the desktop publishing market. The first widely available laser printer, the HP Laserjet, hit the market priced at the high end of the consumer market at about $3,000. This printer could handle pretty much any kind of paper, and print rapidly and accurately. At the same time, Aldus Pagemaker, the first widely available desktop publishing package, also hit the market, similarly priced at the high-end of the consumer market at under $700. Hello, forged credentials, certificates, permits, bills of lading, and eventually, money. Voila, another friend of the counterfeiter was born.
The illicit side of the VHS market had a slightly different trajectory. In the mid-1970s, the Betamax video standard arrived, taking advantage of the ready availability of VCRs priced in the $1,200 range. In 1977, Sony's Betamax was challenged by upstart JVC's VHS standard, with a couple of twists. Twist number one was the VHS could record a full-length movie, while Betamax maxed out at an hour. Twist number two was that while Sony resisted licensing Betamax for use by the pornography industry, JVC had no such qualms. Within 10 years, VHS ruled the market, and the world of entertainment has never been the same.
2014 was the years 1977 or 1985 in the world of 3D printing. Hobbyist 3D printers started showing up priced at less than $600, though a printer capable of handling the demands of the counterfeiter was still priced in the $2,500 range. And while the printers weren't exactly free, a wide range of freeware, too numerous to mention here, showed up to allow would-be makers and counterfeiters an incredible pallet of designs, drivers, and controllers.
It's true that the materials needed to do the most sophisticated counterfeits are not as widely available as the market will eventually require, but a wide range of thermoplastics, advanced polymers, and other materials are now available to assist the counterfeiter. And it's a given that, as the printers become more sophisticated, and the consumers become more demanding, that list will only grow over time.
Where does it all end? There's little doubt that a cat-and-mouse game of counterfeiting and counter-measures will soon ensue. The insertion of easily-detectable nanomaterials into a legitimate copy could be used to distinguish it from a counterfeit, much like watermarks are used to detect fraudulently printed documents. Certain high-value raw materials that can be used for reproducing highly specialized, dangerous, or restricted objects could have their sales and distribution tightly regulated. Preventing counterfeiting also promises to be a growth market.
Even more important, many experts agree, will be the need for a revolution in how intellectual property protections, such as patent, copyright, and trademark are applied to the new world of 3D printing. IP protection has always lagged technological advances, and 3D printing isn't any different: while it is clearly illegal to print a patented object, merely possessing the plans for printing that object does not violate patent law. So the onus will be on the patent-holder to prove that the object has been printed. But if the print run is in single digits, finding and proving that the counterfeited objects were illegally printed, and by whom, will be an enforcement nightmare.
The best we can do as a society is try to ensure that the benefits outweigh the problems, and in that regard, 3D printing is also following the trajectory of previous innovations. It's certainly clear that as this new technology evolves, and the rate of counterfeiting grows with it, there will be innovations in the use of 3D printing that will advance the art of counterfeiting in ways that were never anticipated.
But it's also clear, as it was for the VHS format and desktop publishing, that the push provided by counterfeiting, albeit one that also advances the causes of criminality and illegality, will have a positive effect on expanding the use, and most likely lowering the cost, of 3D printing, while increasing the availability of new materials and software. The trick will be to be able to distinguish between “good” 3D printing, and “bad” 3D printing, and ensure that the barriers to the latter don't inhibit the former. We've done this with VHS, desktop publishing, and for better and worse, we'll be able to do it for 3D printing as well. The more things change, the more they remain the same…
For further exploration of these and other 3D printing issues, I'll be speaking at the IEEE Computer Society's Rock Stars of 3D Printing conference on March 17 in San Jose, Calif.

Hindsight is 20/20, which is why it's easy to say now that the Golden State Warriors—one win away from winning it all—were smart to not go through with an off-season trade of Klay Thompson for Kevin Love.
But what if I told you that the NBA Finals would likely already be over if the Cleveland Cavaliers hadn't traded Andrew Wiggins for Love? And no, it has nothing to do with the fact that Love's arm is currently in a sling but everything to do with the fact that his presence on the Cavs' roster ties their hands moving forward.
The Warriors' decision seems obvious now that they are the No. 1 seed in the NBA finals, in part thanks to Thompson's first all-star season. But what truly illuminates the fact that it's better to stand pat than pull the trigger is the team on the other side of the NBA Finals floor. The Cavaliers did trade for Kevin Love, which on its own isn't a bad transaction, except that they caved and included No. 1 overall draft pick Wiggins in the deal instead of Dion Waiters, whom they initially proposed as trade bait.
But the Cavs were in “win now” mode. LeBron returned home not to rebuild but to reload. James turned 30 this season and only signed a two-year contract with a player opt-out option after the first, which put the onus on GM David Griffin to act fast.
With no intent to re-sign in Minnesota, Kevin Love was the big free agent catch on the trading block last off-season. Love is a California guy. He was born in Santa Monica and attended UCLA. His actress girlfriend, Cody Horn, lives and works in California. It made sense that he'd head back there. Luckily the former NBA players among the Warriors brass weren't swayed.
That's because Jerry West and Steve Kerr know that chemistry and fit are as important to winning as talent is. When you have arguably the best shooting backcourt of all-time in Steph Curry and Thompson, and they are close off-court as well, you don't break that up. Instead the Warriors offered Thompson a four-year, $70-million dollar contract on the eve of the season, which he signed and immediately justified, scoring 41 points in the Warriors home opener win.
In Cleveland, on the other hand, the chemistry was questionable. By February, LeBron, once Love's biggest champion, was sending subliminal messages via social media.
The issue is not just the on-court fit but how it affects the Cavaliers' cap management plans. This off-season Cleveland may have to attempt to re-sign James (if he opts out of his two-year deal), Tristan Thompson (who will be a restricted free agent), and Kevin Love (who can opt out of the last year of his deal). All would be in the market for fiscal increases with plenty of teams with cap room. The problem is they all play their best basketball at the power forward position. Yes, even LeBron has been devastating as a small-ball four. He's been good playing any position, but this post-season the Cavs have put a greater emphasis on him playing out of the post. When he plays the four, the Cavs can go small and get shooters like Kyrie Irving, J.R. Smith, James Jones, and Iman Shumpert in the game to space the floor and punish the opposition for doubling the King.
This presents some difficult questions. Can you pay three players who can't play together? Can you use the majority of your salary cap on one position?
Both Thompson and Love should almost exclusively play power forward. But either one at centre for any extent of time doesn't provide the rim protection that a championship contender needs, which is why Love, when he was healthy, had been on the bench for many fourth quarters in favour of the defensively superior Thompson and Timofey Mozgov.
In building their roster this season, Griffin and the Cavs have accumulated talent first to see if it fits later. That's fantasy basketball at its best but it's a pipe dream to think it's sustainable in the long term.
You know who would be a great fit on the Cavs, especially in this series? Andrew Wiggins.
He's an elite defender—long, active and can switch on everything, which would have lessened the burden on LeBron to clean up all defensive messes all the time.
Wiggins would also have provided a secondary scoring threat that could facilitate his own offence so the Cavs and James weren't stuck playing iso ball almost exclusively. Wiggins on the roster would also have meant the Cavs wouldn't have had to make the mid-season New York Knicks trade. The Canadian rookie possesses the best of Shumpert and J.R. Smith in one body.
Klay Thompson could be described in a similar manner. The volume scorer has amassed 37 points in a quarter but has also done yeoman's work this post-season, guarding, at times, both LeBron and James Harden, two of the game's most prolific scorers. The multi-purpose Thompson is the way the game is going, velociraptors of athleticism wreaking havoc on their opponents and providing their coaches with options.
This is why the Warriors are such a juggernaut, playing chess not checkers, because their pieces can do so much and they have the flexibility to answer the questions any team asks of them.
But first they answered “no” to the question of whether or not they wanted to break up a sure thing for the uncertainty of a possibly great thing.
The Cavs do have a good thing going but don't have the flexibility to make it great in the long term. Trading a rookie for an all-star because you're in win-now mode actually might mean you can't win now. As one Canadian, Thompson, is helping to keep the Cavs alive in the series, another—Andrew Wiggins—is already haunting Cleveland as the one that got away.
The Dallas Cowboys have the best under-25 talent in the NFL.
ESPN's Football Outsiders released their ranking of the top young guns around the league and the 'Boys came in at No. 1. The rankings were based off the number of games started in 2014, number of snaps in 2014, how the young player became a starter, number of first-team All-Pro and Pro Bowl selections, positional value, value added in the 2015 NFL Draft with a focus on premium picks, expected number of key contributors in 2015, and how a team develops and retains young talent.
Here's the breakdown for the Cowboys:
"Of the six first-team All-Pro players in the study, the Cowboys have two: left tackle Tyron Smith and right guard Zack Martin. Center Travis Frederick makes for a third Pro Bowl selection on the offensive line, and Dallas even snagged guard La'el Collins, considered by many to have first-round talent, after he went undrafted following unusual circumstances. Last season the Cowboys' offensive line ranked first in adjusted line yards and Joseph Randle could be the next running back to take advantage of one of the league's most stacked units. There are reasons for optimism on defense as well. DeMarcus Lawrence, who missed the first eight games last year with a broken foot, should be a Week 1 starter after notching a sack in both playoff games, including a huge forced fumble to clinch the win against Detroit. First-round pick Byron Jones should be the team's nickel corner, which is basically a starter in today's game. The Cowboys took a risk on Randy Gregory this offseason, but he's a very talented pass-rusher who should see the field on third downs. Linebacker Anthony Hitchens is also a likely starter after he showed as a rookie he was capable of playing each position in Rod Marinelli's defense."

Adding on, when you take away quarterback Tony Romo, tight end Jason Witten, and long snapper J.P. LaDouceur, the Cowboys have an extremely young roster. In fact, only eight players are 30 years or older.
If the Cowboys can have another successful season this year, they could be on their way to the start of a dynasty.

(Optional Musical Accompaniment To This Post)
WASHINGTON, D.C.—It was the very bizarre translation of the Beatitudes that threw me off for good. In the two-hole of the Inauguration Preachers batting order, a fellow named the Reverend Dr. Samuel Rodriguez went to the familiar and iconic fifth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, but the text he read sounded like an Aramaic-English Google Translation read by Yoda.
For example, here's the majesty of the King James version:
Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
And here's the Reverend Doctor Rodriguez's version:
God blesses those who are poor and realize their need for him for the kingdom of heaven is theirs. God blesses those who mourn for they will be comforted. God blesses those who are humble for they will inherit the earth. God blesses those who hunger and thirst for justice for they will be satisfied. God blesses those who are merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
To borrow a phrase from Mark Twain, the difference between the two renditions is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug. The former is poetry, the latter is prose—and clumsy prose at that. The first resounds like a prayer; the second is something you'd see on a poster in somebody's cubicle under the picture of a sunset, or a kitten hanging by its forepaws.
Getty Images
What was lacking from the second is what has brought the first version down through the years: majesty. And on the west front of the Capitol on Friday morning, during what we were relentlessly sold as the miracle of the Peaceful Transfer of Power—as though anyone really expected a storming of the barricades—there was no room for majesty. And while the Mormon Tabernacle Choir still has game, and the Marine Band can seriously play, majesty surrendered rather meekly to salesmanship, and branding, and the gilt-edged palaver of the midnight infomercial.
This was a sales gimmick, not an inauguration.
In theory, there's something admirably American in taking the piss out of the system's pretensions. When Jimmy Carter walked in his inauguration parade, it represented for the moment the final collapse of the imperial executive within which Richard Nixon had hidden his crimes for so long. Barack Obama's embrace of popular culture let some of the stuffing out of the office as well. But this was different.
This was somebody selling something precious and important at a reduced rate of sloganeering. A pitchman's ceremony, the inauguration of President* Donald Trump was a device for selling American democracy a hair-restoral nostrum, a cure for erectile dysfunction, and a full scholarship to his Potemkin University. This was an event in which even Scripture itself was sent through the gang down in marketing so as not to sound too "elitist" for its intended audience of marks and suckers.
This was somebody selling something precious and important at a reduced rate of sloganeering
The speech itself was as dark and forbidding. It was Huey Long translated by Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller. (And, as Gizmodo's Gabrielle Bluestone pointed out, a famous Batman villain.) This is to say, it was Huey Long drained of his classical references, his summons to Scripture, and whatever was left of his authentic American economic populism. In 1934, for example, Long delivered his most famous speech. In it, he said:
It is necessary to save the government of the country, but is much more necessary to save the people of America. We love this country. We love this Government. It is a religion, I say. It is a kind of religion people have read of when women, in the name of religion, would take their infant babes and throw them into the burning flame, where they would be instantly devoured by the all-consuming fire, in days gone by; and there probably are some people of the world even today, who, in the name of religion, throw their own babes to destruction; but in the name of our good government, people today are seeing their own children hungry, tired, half-naked, lifting their tear-dimmed eyes into the sad faces of their fathers and mothers, who cannot give them food and clothing they both need, and which is necessary to sustain them, and that goes on day after day, and night after night, when day gets into darkness and blackness, knowing those children would arise in the morning without being fed, and probably go to bed at night without being fed.
If you take that passage and run it through the Trump Rosetta Stone program, you get:
But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.
There was a terrifying solipsism to Trump's address, as there likely will be to his presidency. For all his protestations that he is merely the instrument of a great movement, he holds himself above that movement in the way he imagines all great leaders do. In every real sense, from his podium at the Capitol, he talked down to his audience sprawled over a good portion of the National Mall.
He talked to them about the blighted hellscape of a country that he inherited, the blighted hellscape that already existed in their own truncated imaginations. He coined their actual anxieties and displacement into one of the hoariest demagogue's tropes: America First. And despite its dingy antecedents, Trump's use of America First doesn't necessarily mean what the anti-Semites of the 1930s meant when they said it. It's more like one of those foam rubber fingers that fans wear at football games with "AMERICA" written in red across it.
For too long, a small group in our nation's Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished—but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered—but the jobs left, and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. That all changes—starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watches all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country.
That is what had them buzzing on the way out of the event Friday. He really told them, did our Donald Trump. He's got balls, doesn't he? "You see 'em up there? They had to listen to him," said the guy in front of me, waiting to cross Constitution Avenue. "Yeah, there's a new sheriff in town."
Getty Images
As he said it, we were passing a big tree under which I had sat in January of 1981 to listen to Ronald Reagan's first inaugural address. It was a barrel of banality, too. ("Government isn't the solution. Government is the problem." Thirty-five years of political mischief have flowed from that one line.) But there was a brightness to what Reagan said, and he seemed at least to have some sense of the moment, which proves that there is a great distance between even a mediocre actor and a great con-man.
On the eve of our struggle for independence a man who might have been one of the greatest among the Founding Fathers, Dr. Joseph Warren, president of the Massachusetts Congress, said to his fellow Americans, "Our country is in danger, but not to be despaired of . . . . On you depend on the fortunes of America. You are to decide the important questions upon which rests the happiness and the liberty of millions yet unborn. Act worthy of yourselves." Well, I believe we, the Americans of today, are ready to act worthy of ourselves, ready to do what must be done to ensure happiness and liberty for ourselves, our children, and our children's children. And as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will be seen as having greater strength throughout the world. We will again be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who do not now have freedom.
Act worthy of me, Trump's speech said. Act worthy of what you bought from me.
In his speech, and in draining the event of his inauguration of its majesty, the president* managed to turn the west front of the Capitol into a college auditorium in Iowa, or an airplane hangar in New Hampshire, or a stage in Cleveland, Ohio. Already, this is being praised by the dim and the craven as admirable—that Trump deserves credit for declaring that he will be the same person as president as he was in the campaign. I would remind those people, and the new president*, of Henry Gondorff warning to Johnny Hooker: "You gotta keep his con even after you take his money. He can't know you took him."
There is a reckoning out there in the distant wind for everything and everybody who brought us to this day, when not even the Marine Corps Band and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir could neither elevate the inauguration of a president out of the language of mere commerce nor make of the event anything more than a banal transaction—a day on which even Jesus Christ on the Mount was warned to keep it simple, stupid.

Despite the tremendous improvements already made in driverless technologies, researchers continue to seek smarter cars. For instance, I wrote last year about a study to try and enable the car to predict the actions of other road users, such as cyclists and pedestrians.
Of course, this kind of sensual awareness is often quite expensive. I wrote recently about an approach by researchers at Cambridge University. The open source project, called Segnet, aims to make it more cost effective to scan an environment.
Whilst early signs are positive, the project is not yet strong enough to support driverless technology. A team from Stanford believe they may have an approach that is however.
Crowdsourcing awareness
The researchers wanted to build a huge database of fully annotated references that could be used to train machines to perform some of the more complex tasks that human drivers perhaps take for granted.
The approach, which is documented in a recent paper, sees participants play a driving game. The game runs off of a database of road conditions that was obtained by driving a real car around California to collect things like GPS data, laser scanning data and visual data.
This data is then fed into the virtual 3D environment. Players then help the AI behind the game, called Driverseat, to evaluate and understand this environment in a range of driving conditions.
The first forays down this path involved the relatively simple task of lane identification. This is something that we find quite straight forward, but it remains challenging for machines, especially in different light and weather conditions.
Gaming improvements
The players are presented with the same 3D environment the machine will ‘see'. This depiction also includes the first attempt made by the machine to identify the lanes.
The players are then tasked with correcting any errors encountered, with this then fed back into the AI to improve its knowledge.
The initial results are certainly interesting. The system was put through its paces on a part of the database that had thus far not been seen. It proved to be effective at identifying lanes in difficult circumstances, such as when the road curved, and even when vision was obstructed by other vehicles.
It proved less effective however at spotting off and on ramps, and was poor when visibility dropped as a result of shadow or road color changes.
Equally, it emerged that the system performed poorly when the sun was close to the horizon, with the authors believing this was largely due to the fact that Californian highways run north to south rather than east to west, thus giving the system less data about driving into a sunset or sunrise.
Next steps
Suffice to say, these issues are all things the team hope to work on in future, so it's important at this stage to know what the system can't do as much as what it can do.
The crowdteaching method however is certainly an interesting one, and one that has been used before to help improve artificial intelligence.
“We have shown how we can integrate people's knowledge and experience on the roads to ‘teach' machines to drive,” the team say.
It's possible, therefore, that humans will play a role in the next generation of cars as our own knowledge begins to blend with that of the computers powering the cars.
It's also likely that the crowdteaching method will be used to help machines learn a wide range of tasks that humans often take for granted.
It's a project that's well worth keeping an eye on.
Iran Focus
London, 21 Sep - America's first Homeland Security Secretary has written an op-ed for The Hill denouncing the appearance of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York.
Tom Ridge, the former governor of Pennsylvania, said that Rouhani's presence at the UNGA is an opportunity to challenge him on the ‘moderateness' of his regime and the 1988 massacre, which killed 30,000 political prisoners.
Ridge cites the tape that was released last month, which featured former heir to the supreme leader, Hossein-Ali Montazeri, addressing the ‘Death Commission'. Montazeri can be heard criticizing the commission for the “worst crime of the Islamic Republic” and confirming long suspected horrors of that summer; that even teenagers and pregnant women were not spared the noose.
Many of those executed were members of the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI or MEK) who had already been sentenced to prison terms for political activism, finished serving prison terms for their political beliefs, or even just expressed sympathy for the political prisoners being held in Iran.
One of those who was criticised by Montazeri is current justice minister Mostafa Pourmohammadi. Pourmohammadi, who then worked for the Intelligence Ministry, can be heard on tape defending the massacre; a stance which has not weakened with time as he described the massacre as “God's commandment” and said he was “proud” of his role.
Ridge wrote: “His unrepentant attitude about responsibility for a crime against humanity underscores the irony of his role as justice minister. Moreover, the fact that Pourmohammadi was Rouhani's personal choice for the position casts profound doubt on the assumption, by President Obama and other Western policymakers, that the Rouhani administration is a moderate alternative to the hardliners associated with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.”
He also notes that Iran continues to defy Security Council resolutions banning ballistic missile tests and continues to support terrorist groups all over the world.
Under Rouhani's rule, nearly 3,000 people have been executed and Iran holds the highest per capita execution rate in the world; many victims charged with vague crimes like “enmity against God”.
Ridge said: “It is difficult to understand how the Obama administration failed to notice or elected to ignore recent human rights abuses. Whatever the case, the growing knowledge of Tehran's past abuses cannot be so easily ignored, especially since the Rouhani administration's complicity in the 1988 massacre is by no means limited to the justice minister.”
Last week, the MEK released a list of 60 important figures within Iran who are connected to the 1988 massacre.
Ridge said: “These revelations make it abundantly clear that the current Iranian government has in no fashion moved away from its past crimes against humanity – crimes for which no one has been held accountable. Indeed, those who participated willingly, even proudly like Mostafa Pourmohammadi, have been rewarded.”
He argued that the international community could no longer afford to be complacent towards Iran's crimes.
Dieting. Personally, I suck at it, as do many people throughout the world. But it doesn't mean we don't try. Of course, some of us try to eat less and exercise more and some people jump on the bandwagon of any fad diets, always hoping to find a miracle that leads to quick weight loss with little effort. As a result, there's been quite a few crazy diet ideas in the last few centuries, here are the top ten weirdest diet methods we've ever heard of.

The Chewing Diet
The Tapeworm Diet
The Sleeping Beauty Diet
The Vision Diet
Washing Away The Pounds
Ear Stapling
The Cotton Ball Diet
The Blood Type Diet
The Hallelujah Diet
The chewing diet was popularized in the Edwardian Era by Horace Fletcher. He believed that chewing allowed food to be properly absorbed into the body. Insufficient chewing would lead to constipation and clog up the digestive tract, said Fletcher. He lost 40 pounds in just four months using the diet he created. Dr. Kellogg was a friend and fan of Fletcher and he required patients at his sanatorium to participate in the chewing diet as well as a variety of other weight loss methods.To properly implement the chewing diet, a person must chew each bite over 32 times, which takes approximately 30 seconds. After chewing is done, the person then tilts his or her head back and allows the food to trickle down their throat. Anything that is still too big to swallow must be spit out. The desire to eat things likely diminishes after a period on this diet, so it does work as you begin to eat less food.A sore jaw. Much longer meal times. Annoyed and disgusted friends.Source If you eat for two and aren't pregnant, maybe it's time to get a second mouth in your belly. A tapeworm can sure help eat all of that excess food. Around the turn of the century, these little parasites were sold in a simple pill form claiming to help you shed inches from your waist. It's uncertain whether these pills actually had live tapeworms or if they were just another “snake oil” product, but what is certain is that people have intentionally used tapeworms as a weight loss method. Jockeys are amongst the many people purported to have used tapeworms as a diet.Well for one, having a worm inside your stomach, which might cause nausea, headaches, infections and diarrhea. Some people's organs are blocked by the eggs and this can result in death. There is no evidence that tapeworms actually help people lose much of weight, so the whole experience may be for nothing.You can't eat while you sleep. So naturally, if you sedate yourself for days and neglect to eat as a result, this starvation diet may actually work for you. Elvis was a proponent of this weight loss method around the end of his life and the dieting method was also made popular in Valley of the Dolls.A severe pill hangover can leave you with a headache, nausea and fatigue. Additionally, improper sedation might actually kill you and so might starvation.If your food looks disgusting, you're less likely to eat it. While this is certainly true, it's not enough to make the vision-dieter glasses any less silly. From the testimonials I've read, the glasses make you feel relaxed while going on your day-to-day routine, but they don't help you lose much weight. Johnny Depp is a big fan of blue glasses, although it's hard to say if he just likes their look or if he actually feels the effects from the lens color.Looking like a geek in big blue glasses. Possible vision problems after prolonged exposure to the glasses.If you're showering everyday, you might as well lose weight while doing it, right? That's the theory behind Aoqili diet soaps. These soaps contain seaweed that will penetrate skin and breakdown fat. There seems to be no evidence that this product works though, not even faked testimonials.Some people have had allergic reactions to the soap's ingredients.Source Ear stapling is exactly what its name implies, you pierce the cartilage of your inner ear and it supposedly suppresses your appetite. You can only leave it in for six weeks to three months because once your body gets used to the staple it will lose its effectiveness. While many people claim this weight loss method is highly effective, even its proponents can't agree why. The most common explanation involves the piercing's similarity to acupuncture.Ear stapling is illegal in Florida and other states have regulated the practice to help decrease the number of infections it has caused.Well, for one, you will have a staple in your ear, which may be a little painful. Secondly, you could get an infection, which could make you severely sick. Also, it is possible to receive nerve damage when the procedure is preformed improperly.The cotton ball diet is exactly what it sounds like, you eat cotton balls. Some people eat them dry and others soak them in gelatin first. Obviously the idea is that cotton balls are low in calories but very filling, so you won't want to eat anything that is fattening. The cotton balls are also high in fiber, which is thought to be good for you –until you realize it's not the kind of fiber you need in your diet.Exceptionally boring, dry and disgusting meals. A lack of needed vitamins and other nutrients. Major digestive problems.The theory of the blood type diet is that every blood type has a set of foods best suited to it and if you eat according to your blood type, you will lose weight. Supposedly, a person with type A blood should be vegetarian and meditate, while those with type O blood should eliminate grains from their diet and do aerobics.This diet may seem harmless, but depending on which blood type you have, your recommended diet may center around food that is bad for you. For example, many people are lactose intolerant, but anyone with type B blood is recommended to intake a lot of dairy –this could cause a lot of problems. Additionally, people with type A blood are told to eat a lot of wheat, but if someone has gluten intolerance, this could be dangerous.

The Caveman Diet
The Hallelujah diet requires eating foods specifically mentioned in Genesis Chapter 1, Verse 29. These foods are all-natural, vegan, raw foods. Of course, in Genesis Chapter 9, Verse 3, God lifts these restrictions, but the hallelujah diet overlooks this.In the diet, only 15% of a person's daily intake of food is allowed to be cooked. Aside from the basic diet, the plan recommends exercise, rest, sunshine and elimination of stress. It seems pretty natural that anyone exercising, relaxing and eating vegan will be losing weight, regardless of whether God dictated it or not.Like all vegan diets, a person must be very careful to get their daily intake of protein, vitamins and minerals. Other than that, this diet is mostly healthy, although it may annoy your friends.SourceThis diet is also called the Paleolithic diet because the focus is based on food available to cavemen during the Paleolithic Era, around 10,000 years ago. This time period was prior to the development of agriculture, so the plants available to these dieters are mostly ones available to gatherers and hunters. Food can be cooked though because it was common practice in that era. Most participants will be limited to lean meat, fish, veggies, fruit, roots and nuts. Grains, dairy, salt, refined sugar, oils and legumes are all strictly prohibited.Dieters may have a hard time getting their daily calcium intake, but other than that, it is not dangerous. Most restaurants do offer food that would fit into this dietary plan –steaks, salads, etc.
After deliberating for several weeks, Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs has recommended that a police officer who stomped once on a detained suspect in April be suspended for 24 work hours.
In a memo dated June 14 to Officer Zachary Rosen, 32, Jacobs said she is recommending the suspension to Public Safety Director Ned Pettus, who will hold his own inquiry and ultimately decide the punishment. Jacobs' memo was released Wednesday.
About the memo, Mayor Andrew J. Ginther said: “I have every expectation the Public Safety Director will discipline Officer Rosen in a manner that holds him accountable for his actions, and I expect the final decision to be made as quickly as possible.”
The case gained attention and drew protests after a witness posted a video of the April 8 incident on YouTube. Ginther has expressed disappointment and said the incident eroded public trust.
“Twenty-four hours is an absolute joke,” said Amber Evans, organizer for the People's Justice Project, which has protested Rosen at the city council. "I think it's a major slap in the face for the black community, and for the mothers that have lost their family members to police violence, and for the young man who was kicked in his head by Rosen.”
On the video, 26-year-old Demarko Anderson is seen lying on his chest on a concrete driveway, restrained by Officer Darren Stephens with his hands behind his back. Rosen is seen darting into the frame and striking Anderson once in the head with his left foot. Anderson's head was raised, then seen smashed into the pavement as Rosen struck him.
Anderson is heard on the video saying, “Are you serious? I've got cuffs on, sir.”

In his interview with investigators, Rosen said he stomped down on Anderson's left shoulder. He said he attempted to pin Anderson to prevent him from being able to buck Stephens off or escape.
Officers had responded to a report of a man with a gun near a residence in Linden. Anderson was walking away from a Maize Road residence when Stephens tried to handcuff him, according to a police report. Anderson pulled away, elbowed Stephens in the face and fled. Stephens caught Anderson and placed him in handcuffs.
Anderson faces charges in Franklin County Common Pleas Court, including improperly discharging a gun into a residence, carrying a concealed weapon, obstructing official business and aggravated menacing.
The Columbus Branch of the NAACP, in a prepared statement, said its members are "stunned, horrified and dismayed" by Jacobs' recommendation and that they are "demanding that Safety Director Ned Pettus remove Officer Rosen from the Columbus police force."
In his report to Jacobs, Deputy Chief Thomas Quinlan said: “Officer Rosen's intent notwithstanding, he did actually strike Mr. Anderson in the face while handcuffed. I do not find Officer Rosen's use of force reasonable, meaning it was not proper, appropriate, rational and ordinary or usual in the circumstances."
Quinlan, the highest ranking of Rosen's direct chain of command, was the only one of his supervisors to rule the stomp as out of policy before the report landed on Jacobs' desk.
The stomping incident was not the first time Rosen used kicking or striking motions with suspects, according to records obtained by The Dispatch.
In an October 2015 incident, Rosen drew his gun on an unarmed man on East 26th Avenue, then kicked him in the midsection, making him fall backward.
“I did not have time to transition to another weapon, as (the suspect) quickly advanced on me,” Rosen told investigators.
Rosen is one of two officers who shot and killed 23-year-old Henry Green while working undercover in June 2016. Rosen fired 15 shots in that incident. A grand jury cleared officers of any wrongdoing. The department is still reviewing the incident through the firearms review board.
Per union-contract rules, Jacobs had to consider the punishment in other cases of sustained use-of-force investigations in order to consider discipline for Rosen in the Anderson arrest.
Rosen was taken off his normal patrol assignment in April and reassigned as the matter was investigated.
On April 12, Jacobs attended a news conference with Ginther, who said he was troubled by the video.
"What I saw was troubling, upsetting — it's disturbing," Ginther said. "It's not consistent with the values and training (of the) Columbus Division of Police. ... It erodes the public trust."
Rosen emailed his chain of command on April 13, saying, "I have been concerned for my safety since my name was released and comments were made by the Mayor convicting me of wrongdoing, despite any due process or the opportunity for an investigation to run its course as our protocol dictates. The Mayor's actions have now jeopardized the safety of my mother and my family.”
A day later, investigators found the threats posted on social media were not credible. Still, Rosen asked for additional cruiser attention at his home.
Rosen has worked for the division as an officer since December 2010. Columbus police spokesman Sgt. Rich Weiner said Rosen would not be able to use leave time to serve any suspension.

I've been working in startups for the last few years, using a lot of the latest tech that startups often use (Rails, Node, Mongo, Angular etc.). Now I'm back in my home town (failed and can't afford to be out in London doing this any more), and seeking any job for a developer. But all I see is PHP, .NET, VB, Java and everything that HN seems to hate. I actually haven't touched this stuff since school, and everything I've learned and used over these last few years seems to be useless in the corporate world here. I'm renting alone and therefore need a job quickly. My options are finding a quick job (e.g. waiter, shop assistant) while brushing up on PHP (or maybe something else has better career opportunities?) in the evenings, or just doing something completely different. Truth is I want a stable career now and care little about whether we're coding in Erlang or Java.
Today, sewing relies on the low-tech power of human hands, but soon that may not be the case. Human workers are still needed for the final steps of making clothes, in order to align fabrics and correctly feed them into sewing machines. If robots could do that instead, shock waves of change would surely ripple through global supply chains and disrupt the lives of millions of low-wage earners in the developing world.
For better or worse, plenty of technologists, researchers, and companies are working on the challenge—but so far, getting robots to navigate the imprecisions of flimsy textile materials that easily bend has proven elusive.
One promising solution, though, has come from an unlikely place: the sleepless brain of Jonathan Zornow, a young freelance web developer with no previous background in robotics, manufacturing, or the apparel business. His project, Sewbo, recently demonstrated the world's first robotically sewn garment, and the inspiration came while watching a late-night Science Channel show called How It's Made.
“I would watch How It's Made to help me fall asleep at night, because I found it meditative and soothing to see the machines performing constant repetitive tasks,” Zornow told me. “In one episode they did blue jeans. In this case there were no machines doing serene repetitive motions. There were people involved every step along the way, and rather than help me fall asleep, it kept me up.”
It's true that in almost every scene of the blue jeans episode, there's the distinctive presence of human fingertips. Zornow got stuck asking why there weren't robots there to perform the stitching, and what clicked for him while watching the show was the realization that getting robots to handle the complexities of a material that bends is difficult.
“The standard approach to robotic sewing has been to counter the complexity of working with fabrics, with equally complex machines.”
Robots are good at tasks that are precisely the same each time, but with clothing, the flimsiness adds a layer of complexity robots can't yet handle.
The solution Zornow then came up with is almost laughably simple. Instead of pouring millions of dollars into fancier robots, he decided to find a way to stiffen the clothes in order to make them suitable for robotic machines.
“When I looked into it, it seemed that the standard approach to robotic sewing has been to counter the complexity of working with fabrics, with equally complex machines,” he told me. Instead, Zornow removed the complexity by making the fabrics stiff.
He decided to use a water-soluble polymer that washes out in warm water and can temporarily stiffen fabric, meaning the robot is handling a precisely-defined object when stitching the garment. The inspiration for that came to him while reading an article in Make Magazine that explored the water-soluble support structures for 3D printers.
To prove out the concept, Zornow rented an off-the-shelf robotic arm, which he used to demonstrate the approach. Then, last year, he formally announced the project as the first time a robot has been able to sew a garment. And he's now pursuing the project full time to turn it into a business and was even invited to a robotics manufacturing consortium sponsored by the US Department of Defense.
The eye-catching part of Zornow's breakthrough isn't so much the technology used or the specific idea. Other promising high-tech solutions are being pursued and some have even tried, unsuccessfully, to automate sewing by stiffening clothes with starch.
What's stunning is that since the 1980s, hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent trying to automate garment sewing, yet a single curious kid empowered by random ideas from the internet was able to address the challenge with a different (and relatively low-tech) approach. And beyond simply having the idea, Zornow had access to the robotic tools to actually pursue the concept, which due to cost would have been the stuff of dreams just a few years ago.
On display is a phenomenon entirely new in recent history, where big idea breakthroughs can come as much from individuals with access to the internet as from a heavily-funded research lab inside a government or corporation. It's also an age where experts are being upended by radical outsiders, where leading biotechnology startups are being founded by aerospace engineers, and novice amateurs can routinely outperform experts in data science tasks.
In the age of the internet, we're seeing the accelerating forces of ideas spread, and one where a single kid in Seattle can try to reshape a $1 trillion dollar global industry.
Whether Zornow's solution will actually make meaningful headway into the apparel industry is uncertain, but ultimately his triumph is in showing that good ideas come from strange places.

In the days after Donald Trump's inauguration, the folks behind “Bad Lip Reading” revealed what was really said between the new president and Barack Obama as they left the White House together. Nearly a year later, they have uncovered the secret messages embedded within the first family's first Christmas message.
The musical parody video, which finds President Trump singing an oddly catchy carol called “Christmas Is Here,” is most notable for its translation of Melania Trump.
“At this time of year, we see the best of America and the soul of the American people,” the first lady said in her actual Christmas address this week. But in this new version, she looks directly into the camera and pleads, “Please help me.”
As Trump joyfully sings about his many accomplishments, Melania adds, “I will live in silence” and warns, “He'll freeze the diamond money.”
The piece ends with an appearance by the terrifying Disney World robot version of the 45th president, who tells us, “Christmas isn't fun. At least when you're not a real human,” before asking, “Oh, why can I not know love?”

The world is becoming smaller, travel is becoming easier and globalization is making cities more homogenous. As a result, tourists have begun to look more often for unique stories and authentic, local experiences in non-traditional destinations.
The irony of this transition is that the very things that have for so long served as fodder for "Winterpeg" ridicule, are now being celebrated as unique attractions. Eating dinner on the frozen river, skating among artistic warming huts or wandering through a largely intact century-old warehouse district are hailed as must-see, uniquely Winnipeg experiences.
Something appears to be happening lately that is altering this perception. Winnipeg has begun to make regular appearances in international travel blogs and periodicals, including Vogue, Elle and Reader's Digest, all celebrating the unique Winnipeg experience. Somehow, the city's rough-around-the-edges character has become cool. To outsiders, our frozen city in the middle of nowhere seems oddly exotic, exemplified by its place alongside Seychelles, Bhutan and the Hawaiian volcanoes in a National Geographic list of the Best Trips of 2016.
For many years, Winnipeg has had an image problem. The popular depiction has been one of a city frozen in a never-ending winter with a downtown filled with nothing but dusty old buildings. Most tourists only recognize Winnipeg from the route map on the screen in the airplane seat in front of them as they pass by at 30,000 feet.

The world is becoming smaller, travel is becoming easier and globalization is making cities more homogenous. As a result, tourists have begun to look more often for unique stories and authentic, local experiences in non-traditional destinations.
In recognition of this changing trend, last Friday a new initiative was launched to further attract this evolving tourist market as well as provide Winnipeggers with a new experience in their own city.
Design Quarter Winnipeg is an organically organized, grassroots initiative hoping to position downtown Winnipeg's artistic community as a design and cultural tourism destination.
The idea hopes to bring together local, independent, design-focused events, shops, services and organizations under a single marketing umbrella, empowering them by establishing a broader collaborative network. It's modelled after existing programs in similarly isolated winter cities Reykjavik, Iceland and Helsinki, Finland, where the design district concept has strengthened their civic image as design centres and tapped into new opportunities in the growing trend of cultural tourism.
The name Design Quarter Winnipeg suggests a rebranding of a physical neighbourhood in downtown, but it would be more accurate to describe the initiative as creating a Winnipeg design experience. A walkable one-kilometre radius has been identified across several downtown neighbourhoods, and a curated walking tour has been developed. Visitors can navigate the area with digital or printed maps, social media and a website, guiding them through a series of destinations featuring local products and services, tailored to appeal to a design-conscious visitor.
With coordinated marketing and promotion, through partnerships with the Exchange District Biz, Travel Manitoba and Tourism Winnipeg, the intent of the Design Quarter is to build on the existing creative industries in downtown and attract new independent developments. The hope is a new energy is brought to downtown, putting more pedestrians on the sidewalks and establishing the area as a true destination for a unique local experience.
Design Quarter Winnipeg will operate as a non-profit organization funded through membership fees. To become part of the network, businesses and organizations must meet certain criteria, including such things as a sidewalk presence, a commitment to the local community and to quality design. The goal is to create a level of expectation that visitors can trust, becoming the go-to destination to learn about new design-focused events, shops and services in downtown Winnipeg.
The Design Quarter begins with 46 members and has set a goal of having 60 members after the first year and 100 in three to five years. Members currently include shops, hotels, fashion designers, restaurants, galleries and cultural events.
Helsinki's Design District has been very successful because it reinforced the creative culture that already existed in that city. Nurturing this authenticity will be critical if Design Quarter Winnipeg is to find similar traction. Branding initiatives can unify and provide a strength in numbers for independent businesses, but they must look to build on what already exists without trying to create something that is not organically there.
In support of this concept, Winnipeg has established a long history as a creative and artistic community. With only two per cent of Canada's population, the city has 12 per cent of its musicians. Winnipeg has the country's oldest civic art gallery, French-language theatre, English regional theatre, and dance company. It is home to a renowned symphony and iconic ballet company and holds more than 200 festivals each year. Winnipeg's arts and creative industries represent six per cent of the city's labour force and four per cent of its GDP.
Adding to this artistic undercurrent, the Exchange District and other areas of downtown have experienced momentum in the growth of local design-focused retailers, restaurants, studios and galleries over the last number of years. If the Design Quarter can successfully build on these existing creative networks, reinforcing, and celebrating a new, authentically Winnipeg experience, we might one day see "design" listed along with "winter" and "old buildings" in a magazine list of must-see reasons to come to Winnipeg.

EXCLUSIVE: Rob Zombie is ready to expand beyond the horror genre. Zombie and Miranda Bailey have acquired the rights to Steve Stoliar's memoir Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House. Love & Mercy co-writer Oren Moverman will write the screenplay and Zombie is attached to direct. Cold Iron Pictures' Miranda Bailey and Amanda Marshall are producing along with Zombie and Andy Gould.
The book tells the bizarre story of the last years in the life of Groucho Marx, told by a young Marx Brothers fan who spent those years as his personal secretary and archivist. In addition to getting to know his hero, the author found himself in the orbit of Groucho's brothers Zeppo and Gummo, Mae West, George Burns, Bob Hope, Jack Lemmon, S.J. Perelman, Steve Allen, and scores of other luminaries of stage, screen, TV and literature. The downside of this dream-come-true was getting close to his idol as the curtain was coming down, and dealing with Erin Fleming – the mercurial woman in charge of Groucho's personal and professional life.
There have been proposed projects about the life of Groucho and his Marx Brothers, the most recent from Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, the Big Eyes scribes who were going to direct a Marx Brothers movie but just could not get the budget down. This is a different way to tell the story and the choice of director is certainly unexpected.
Zombie, the multi-platinum recording artist-turned film director, made his mark directing small budget profitable genre films like House Of 1000 Corpses, two Halloween films, Lords Of Salem and the currently shooting 31, about five people kidnapped on the eve of Halloween and placed in a lethal funhouse called Murder World. But I've seen how meticulous Zombie is in the preparation and design of these fright films, and he could well make the kind of transition that Saw helmer James Wan and others have made from genre to more mainstream fare. He is separately writing to direct Broad Street Bullies, a film about the Philadelphia Flyers hockey teams that brawled their way to prominence. So while he would not be the obvious choice to make a touching film about the last days of iconic Groucho Marx based on his resume, turns out Zombie is a huge fan of the comic and is steeped in Marx Brothers lore.
“I have been a huge Groucho Marx fan ever since I was a child and have read countless book on the comic legend, but after reading the book Raised Eyebrows, a totally new perspective on Groucho's life emerged,” says Zombie. “I immediately saw this project as Groucho's Sunset Boulevard and knew I had to bring it to the big screen. It is a sad, funny and very dark tale of a one of Hollywood's greatest stars final years.”
Bailey's Cold Iron Pictures produced the upcoming Sony Pictures Classics film The Diary Of A Teenage Girl, which Marielle Heller directed with Kristen Wiig, Alexander Skarsgard, Christopher Meloni and Bel Powley starring. Bailey twice worked with Morverman on Time Out Of Mind and Oppenheimer Strategies, both of which star Richard Gere.
“Steve's story detailing his experience with one of the most iconic comedians of our time was so poignantly crafted, and such a compelling read, that I immediately knew it was a project I wanted to be involved with. Rob is the perfect visionary to direct Oren's script to the screen.” ICM Partners is handling sales for the film. Moverman is repped by WME and Zombie is repped by UTA, Spectacle Entertainment and attorney David Fox.
The idea is to get more of the passionate fans, the people who are really involved with soccer, whether it's because their kids play or because they're just expats in the United States who are dying for a team they can really get behind. The Union - it's MLS, it's a good product, it's a nice stadium, but there's not much to do in Chester besides the game and the [Harrah's] casino and racetrack.
[...]
[Talen Energy Stadium] is a great stadium itself, as a stadium. But the location's horrendous. People go there, you look at Union games, people are going there, it's people from the Main Line. They bring their kids. It's like a curiosity thing. It's not passionate fans that are living and dying like with the Eagles.
[...]
You go across the river, because look at the demographics at Rowan [and] the demographics of that soccer base. There are what, 40,000 kids around Washington Township, in that system? You've got a built-in audience right there. I think it's ideal.
If you're within half an hour of an international airport, you're always okay. Granted, it's not inside Philadelphia, but it's a good location. It's really about 22 minutes from the airport. I did it during the day, a few weeks back. I drove over there. It's very close.
It's a beautiful backdrop. You look at everything there, they've got 700 acres there. There's so much development that can go on. And the university campus, it will be beautiful.
[...]
I think it [Rowan] will be a better location [than Chester] because there will be more around it. You look at all the development they've done at Rowan already in the town, in Glassboro. It's a nice little college town. You go spend a day there. If you're taking the kids, or you're on that side, it's a good population on the New Jersey side of things.
[...]
It's not far from Philly. You go from Lincoln Financial Field to Rowan, how far is that? 15 minutes?
I'm not saying we're married to Rowan. Public transportation is difficult, I agree with that. So you don't totally rule out an urban scenario. But an urban scenario, you've got to have something that's year-round.
[...]
Philadelphia is an area amongst a few other cities that really looks like it could be a perfect fit for the NASL. Inside the city limits would probably not be the best solution, unless there was a great stadium solution that just popped up. I think something just outside the city, more suburban, with all the local youth soccer, would be key.
And it's a big enough market to have two teams. I don't think we take away any Union fans. I don't think the Union's attendance goes down, even if we're wildly successful. I think there's room for both. I think it just grows the sport. I think it would probably help the Union.
[...]
The minority community in the U.S. is growing. You look at the Spanish [speaking] community, you look at any of the foreign communities. They care about soccer. They support the other teams, but I think the idea is you really target them and speak to them.
You look at the interest in downtown Philly - go to Fado or Cavanaugh's or any of them on a Saturday morning in the fall, look at the Premier League, look at all the expats there, everybody's got a jersey on. It's a silent community, because most of them are professionals. They're not out going crazy in the streets and tearing things down. They're people that are here, they're educated, but they're extremely passionate about their teams.
Look how many people are, I'm sure, going to be out watching the [UEFA] Champions League final. So it's become a bigger and bigger global game. Now, the Union, I've got a lot of problems with the Union and the ways they do their things. So it's hard to say how great the Union is. But I think MLS and soccer, it's moving forward, and I think it's representative of the growing Hispanic expat community, minority community. It's just going to get bigger. It's not getting smaller.

Gainesville city officials probably did not envision the way a high-dive board in a city park would be used early Thursday when they approved the motto “It Starts in Parks.”
GAINESVILLE – City officials probably did not envision the way a high-dive board in a city park would be used early Thursday when they approved the motto “It Starts in Parks.”
According to the Gainesville Police Department, an officer spotted a couple having sex on the more than 30-foot-high diving board at the H. Spurgeon Cherry/Westside Pool.
Officer Michael Henavan said he was on an increased patrol around the pool at 1001 N.W. 31st Dr. around 12:10 a.m. when he heard noises coming from inside the pool area, which is surrounded by a locked, chain-link fence. Police said the couple ceased their activities when Henavan's flashlight beam found them.
After being ordered to return to the ground, the 21-year-old woman and 24-year-old man were each issued a notice to appear in court on a trespassing charge, police said.
Police said it is not illegal to have sex in a public place. However, they said, state laws and city ordinances prohibit public exhibition of sex organs and use of public facilities after hours.
The city's pool supervisor, Jeff Moffitt, said the high dive was cleaned with bleach before the pool reopened Thursday morning.
The problem we are facing with the youth justice system hasn't developed overnight. The present government has inherited a problem that has been some years in the making. So how did we get here?
One view is that successive governments have taken their eye off the ball with regard to youth justice; another is that our present crisis is not, or not only, due to negligence but more because of governments actively pursuing the wrong approach.
Illustration: Andrew Dyson
It is clear that over a number of years the youth justice system has not received the attention it deserves – and the cost of that neglect is now apparent. The youth justice system sits between two much larger systems – the child protection system and adult corrections. It is a sad fact that the child protection system is a feeder for youth justice – with about two-thirds of children in the youth justice system having a child protection history (and yes, children is the correct term given their age – they have the brains of children, immature and developing, regardless of their sometimes adult appearance), and that the youth justice system is a feeder for adult corrections – with many people in jail having been transported along the conveyor belt from child protection to youth justice and then to adult corrections.
Right now the broader system is, at best, under severe pressure; and, at worst, badly broken. This is evidenced by the fact about 80 per cent of young people in custody at Parkville are on remand, meaning they have not been convicted of an offence. There are a number of unfortunate consequences associated with filling up youth detention centres with unsentenced people, creating a vicious circle. Primarily, there is the direct negative effects on these young people themselves – and let's remember that when the cases go to court, most young people either do not receive a sentence, or get a community sentence. Further, having so many young people on remand means that the system gets blocked up, causing under-servicing and delays in processes such as appearance at court and resolution of cases. This in turn leads to further overcrowding of youth detention centres.

Most of the players there are settled into teams and most likely wouldn't leave to join an academy. An academy's purpose is to find up and coming talent and groom it, not to seek already established players.

This.
Do note that there will likely be several challenger league players in the qualifiers. But the opportunity an 'open' (or semi-open since only accepting High masters/GM) gives to newer/less established players is critical to any team that has an academy's mission This.Do note that there will likely be several challenger league players in the qualifiers.

While I somewhat agree with you, at this point in time a tournament is really the only fair/efficient way for us to recruit new players. And yes, while a player can get high on ladder with cheeses/all ins, I don't think that player has a very good chance of doing well in a 64-man tournament. A ladder player is very different from a tournament player. While I somewhat agree with you, at this point in time a tournament is really the only fair/efficient way for us to recruit new players.

cannonball, N.D. (Reuters) - Two weeks after a victory in their fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline, most protesters have cleared out of the main protest camp in North Dakota - but about 1,000 are still there, and plan to remain through the winter.

These folks say they are dug in at the Oceti Sakowin Camp in cannonball, North Dakota, despite the cold, for a few reasons. Most are Native Americans, and want to support the tribal sovereignty effort forcefully argued by the Standing Rock Sioux, whose land is adjacent to the pipeline being built.
Others say they worry that Energy Transfer Partners LP ETP.N, the company building the $3.8 billion project, will resume construction without people on the ground, even though the tribes and the company are currently locked in a court battle.
Future decisions on the 1,172-mile (1,885-km) pipeline are likely to come through discussions with the incoming administration of Donald Trump, or in courtrooms.
“I've seen some of my friends leave but I will be here until the end and will stand up to Trump if he decides to approve the permit,” said Victor Herrald, of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota, who has been at the camp since August.
At one point the camp had about 10,000 people, including about 4,000 veterans who showed up in early December - just before the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied a key easement needed to allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River.
After the Corps decision, Standing Rock chairman Dave Archambault asked protesters to go home. The camp's population now runs from 700 to 1,000, depending on the day, and many come from the nearby Standing Rock reservation where they live.
Those left say they are there to “show our strengths,” as Bucky Harjo, 63, of the Paiute tribe, from Reno, Nevada, put it, while the tribe deals with the legal battle.
Logistics are key for those still at the camp, located on federal land. Theron Begay, a Navajo journeyman who is a certified construction worker and heavy machine operator, has been put in charge of winterizing the camp. He is training volunteers to build structures that can withstand sub-zero temperatures and bitter winds, as well as compost toilets.
Some people at the camp have gotten pneumonia, and they and others went to an emergency shelter that was built three miles away to escape the cold.
Because the Oceti Sakowin camp is located on a flood plain, waste from the camp poses risks to the nearby Cannonball River. Tribal leaders have said the camp may need to move if it wants to remain active. Begay said the structures can be “disassembled like a puzzle in two hours” and re-established on drier ground.
North Dakota's Governor Jack Dalrymple said in a Tuesday statement that he and Archambault recently met to discuss reducing tensions between the tribe and law enforcement. They are discussing reopening the nearby Backwater Bridge on state highway 1806, which has been blockaded since Oct. 27, when activists set vehicles on fire.
Harjo said he will leave “when I see the drill pad removed and DAPL out of here, and when they reopen 1806 and when we are free to go at our own will and not be targeted on the highway.”
NEXT STEPS
Tom Goldtooth, executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network, and a constant presence in the camp, said the protest is transitioning “to the next level of our campaign” to stop the pipeline.
Some still at the camp worry that if they leave, Energy Transfer Partners will restart construction. ETP asked a federal judge on Dec. 9 to overrule the government's decision and grant the easement. The judge declined that request; the parties are due back in court in February. The Army Corps is considering alternatives, which could take months.

Trump, who owned ETP stock through at least mid-2016, according to financial disclosure forms, could order the Army Corps to grant the permit. His choice for U.S. Energy Secretary, former Texas Governor Rick Perry, is on ETP's board. Standing Rock Sioux representatives met with members of Trump's transition team this week to urge the incoming president to deny the easement.
Protesters who remain at the camp are still receiving donations of money and supplies from people across the United States. On a recent visit to the camp's emergency shelter it was filled with boxes delivered via Amazon.com.
Goldtooth said tribal leaders are talking about an exit plan for the camp. “We will continue to provide infrastructure support to those who stay here,” he said. “We'll make sure they're safe and warm.”
Scientists have developed a ceramic pump that can operate at 1,400 ˚C, several hundred degrees hotter than existing heat transfer systems, opening up significant new possibilities for energy storage.
Specifically, the authors of the new study, published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, believe it could be used to develop an efficient grid storage system that could eventually help make renewable sources like wind and solar as cheap and reliable as natural-gas plants (see “Serial Battery Entrepreneur's New Venture Tackles Clean Energy's Biggest Problem”).
The thermal storage system in question would use liquid metals like molten silicon, which would enable the storage and transfer of heat energy at far higher temperatures than materials typically used, such as molten salts. Higher temperatures mean that more thermal energy can be converted to mechanical or electrical energy, improving overall efficiency.

“This is enabling us to now move heat around at extremely high temperatures,” says Asegun Henry, an assistant professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology. “It's a step change in terms of what you can do.”
Interest in using liquid metals as a heat storage medium has been growing, but the challenge has been developing pumps and pipes that don't deteriorate under such conditions. Ceramics can withstand incredibly high temperatures, but they're also brittle, which makes them difficult materials for creating machine components.
The researchers at Georgia Tech, along with collaborators at Stanford and Purdue, got around this limitation by taking advantage of new composite materials, along with diamond tooling and precision machining. They also employed seals made from graphite, another material that stands up to very high temperatures.
Molten tin flows at 1,400 ˚C in a Georgia Tech laboratory.
The prototype mechanical pump successfully operated for 72 hours straight using molten tin, at average temperatures of around 1,200 ˚C and a peak temperature of 1,400 ˚C. The pump did show signs of wear after the tests. But as a next research step, the scientists are developing a pump made from silicon carbide, a harder ceramic material that should be able to last much longer.
The research was backed by $3.6 million in funding from ARPA-E, the U.S. Department of Energy's moonshot energy research division.
The proposed grid storage system would use electricity from solar, wind, or nuclear power to heat liquid silicon to very high temperatures, creating thermal energy. At times of high demand and low energy production, such as evenings after the sun has gone down, the system would return that energy back to the grid using thermophotovoltaics, a type of cell that can convert heat in the form of infrared light into electricity (see “Hot Solar Cells”).
The so-called thermal energy grid storage (TEGS) system would work just as well with coal or natural gas. But the promise here is that the technology could offer a form of cheap baseload storage for renewables, storing up enough energy when the sun is shining and wind is blowing to continue producing electricity even when they're not.
To date, the contribution that clean energy sources can make has been limited by the high cost of battery systems and the restricted geography of storage systems like pumped hydroelectric.
The liquid metals that the high-temperature pump makes usable have other potential applications as well. They might replace molten salts in concentrated solar power systems, and they could enable new kinds of metal-cooled nuclear reactors (see “Making Sense of Trump's Surprising Investment in Solar”).
CLOSE Bill Ackman, head of Pershing Square Capital Management said on Monday he would deliver a "death blow" to Herbalife (HLF). But, it looks like his threat fell on deaf ears. Newslook

If hedge fund manager Bill Ackman expected to deliver a "death blow" knockout to nutritional supplements marketer Herbalife, Wall Street wasn't in his corner Tuesday.
Shares surged 25% to $67.77, despite a protracted livestream Internet presentation at which Ackman again attacked Herbalife for its business practices and charged that the company is essentially a pyramid scheme with "phantom, fictitious customers."
Ackman, head of Pershing Square Capital Management, disclosed details of his latest investigation into more than 240 Herbalife clubs during a webcast at the AXA Equitable Center in New York. He said the company is targeting Latinos and other lower-income socioeconomic groups looking to become entrepreneurs.
Ackman's presentation — viewed by more than 10,000 online — is the latest salvo in his $1 billion bet he made against Herbalife in December 2012. But after Ackman told CNBC on Monday that Tuesday's presentation would deliver a "death blow" to Herbalife, investors reacted to the ongoing high drama as if he had pulled his punches.
Several well-known investors, including George Soros and Carl Icahn, who holds a 17% Herbalife stake, have bet against Ackman. And by mid-day Tuesday, Herbalife had recouped Monday's 11% loss, and more. Among medium-cap stocks, Herbalife was the biggest gainer on the New York Stock Exchange, with 28.9 million shares traded, nearly 20 times normal volume.
The first hour of Ackman's presentation focused on Herbalife's use of nutritional clubs to lure customers and acquire free labor.
"Herbalife has phantom or fictitious customers," Ackman said during the webcast, adding that many are uneducated trainees working without pay in the hopes of landing jobs as club distributors. "It's a tragedy. They don't realize they're being defrauded," he said.
To explain how it works, he turned to Christine Richard, a former Bloomberg News reporter who's now working for Ackman's group.
"What they're selling is smoke and mirrors," she said, adding that trainees expect they're investing in an education that will reap a good income. She said the trainees, before distributing the products to others, have to pay for classes and shakes and many ends up spending at least $3,000.
"It's the beginning of a treadmill" that keeps people at the clubs, Richard said.
Ackman said the practice "creates this tendency to want to stay, because you're almost going to make it."
In a series of statements, Herbalife pounded Ackman.
"Once again, Bill Ackman has over-promised and under-delivered on his $1 billion bet against our company. After spending $50 million, two years and tens of thousands of man-hours, Bill Ackman further demonstrated today that the facts are on our side."
"We will continue to focus on our mission of bringing good nutrition and economic opportunities to communities across the globe. We recognize that he is running out of time to make good on his bad bet against Herbalife, with the equivalent of 25.7 million shares in put options that expire on January 17, 2015. Today is evidence that Bill Ackman will not succeed."
Earlier, Herbalife debunked Ackman's claims about the company's nutrition clubs as "completely false and fabricated."
"According to a recent study commissioned by the company, 87.5% of nutrition club operators feel good about the money they earn and 92% want to continue with their club,'' Herbalife said. "We are confident that the facts are on our side and look forward to fighting back."
Herbalife was founded in 1980 and specializes in protein shakes, vitamins and dietary supplements intended to aid weight loss and improve health.
"Herbalife is a company about great products and great company," said CFO John DeSimone. "We are proud of the tireless efforts of our millions of members around the world and know that their passion is what makes Herbalife the incredible company it is today."

Erik Voorhees Defends Coinbase at Texas Bitcoin Conference
Rate this post
Decentralized Applicatoins Fund Managing Director David Johnston conducted a fireside chat with Shapeshift.io CEO Erik Voorhees at the Texas Bitcoin Conference in late March, and an interesting exchange between the two long-time Bitcoin proponents took place when the topic of Coinbase came up. While many in the Bitcoin community have been critical of Coinbase for shutting down user accounts and going the extra mile on regulatory compliance, it appears that both Johnston and Voorhees understand where the Bitcoin exchange and wallet provider are coming from. Johnston initially made some comments on Coinbase before Voorhees added his two cents:
“Some people have been critical of Coinbase . . . But in truth, I agree, it's a very convenient service. If you're willing to risk having them hold your keys — I wouldn't personally do that — you have that option. And if they break that trust, you have that option to leave.”
Coinbase More Intrusive Than Banks?
When Voorhees began to share his thoughts on Coinbase as a major player in the Bitcoin space, he first pointed out why the company receives so much criticism from certain members of the community:
“With Coinbase, they get a lot of flack from the community. And certainly, they're more intrusive than many banks if you've ever dealt with them, especially as a merchant. They will ask you what you're actually doing with the money. Banks don't really do that.”
Coinbase Has a Target on Their Back
Of course, the reason that Coinbase goes above and beyond on regulatory compliance is that they're one of the most prominent companies in the space. Regulators undoubtedly have a bullseye on Coinbase because that is where so much Bitcoin-related activity takes place. Voorhees explained this point during the discussion:
“It's easy to hate on them, but you have to understand that they are like the biggest target from the regulator's perspective. They are the company after which the banks are going to attack with every piece of regulation that they can. So, they have to be extremely paranoid, and they have to do more than compliance.”
Bitcoin Needs Coinbase
Although many like to claim that Bitcoin does not need any of the companies that are built on top of the base protocol, the reality is the various exchanges, banks, payment processors, and other businesses built on top of the platform are extremely helpful in fostering more adoption of bitcoin as a currency. Voorhees noted the importance of Coinbase to the ecosystem in his comments:
“They're a very important piece of the ecosystem. They're one of the bridges that allow people to easily move from the fiat structure into the decentralized cryptocurrency structure. In the future that I think we're all envisioning, there may not be many needs for what Coinbase does now, which is interface with the banks because the banks may not be there to interface with. And that would be great, but for now, we need companies like that. And they need to do whatever they need to do to stay in operation and to stay out of jail. If they're being too onerous for you, which is understandable, just don't use them.”
As David Johnston noted in his initial remarks on Coinbase, the great thing about the exchange and wallet provider is that they're there if you need them. The great thing about Bitcoin is that you can always exit centralized hubs, such as Coinbase or Circle, and move your coins back to the blockchain. Many Bitcoin users like to take care of their own private keys, but it's going to be quite a long time before the general public is ready to take care of their own security.

It was early in the 2015-16 season when the Sharks hosted the Nashville Predators, a team they were destined to meet several months later in the playoffs on their way to the Stanley Cup Final.
Trailing 1-0 early in the third period, Joe Pavelski went to the area of the ice that he's made a living in, setting up between the circles and in front of goaltender Pekka Rinne. He had company in the form of bruising defenseman Shea Weber.
Weber didn't want company. He promptly let Pavelski know it, too, in the form of a vicious cross-check to the lower back. Pavelski crumpled to the ice, taking a moment to get back on his skates — a moment that was interrupted when Eric Nystrom gave him yet another shove from behind.
No matter. Pavelski eventually did get upright, just in time to hammer in a rebound to tie the score.
The Sharks went on to lose that October game, 2-1, but the sequence was representative of how Pavelski has established himself as one...

Agency says outlook remains negative, despite Hollande's pledge that his reforms will reduce public deficit to 3% by 2013
Moody's credit rating agency has stripped France of its coveted AAA rating and declared that the country's economic outlook remains "negative".
In what will be a severe blow to Socialist president François Hollande, the agency said it was reducing the country's rating from AAA to AA1, claiming France's ability for economic growth was being hampered by "structural challenges" including its lack of competitiveness, high unemployment, public debt and market rigidity.
It said it was not confident Hollande's government could – or would – introduce the necessary structural reforms and spending cuts to improved its rating in the medium term and expressed concern over France's exposure to risks from other ailing eurozone countries.
Moody's decision follows Standard & Poor's downgrading of France's rating a notch in January.
It came as France was reeling from a damning Economist article entitled "The time-bomb at the heart of Europe". The special report warned that the parlous state of the French economy, its rising unemployment, lack of competitiveness, dwindling industry and high public spending, could overshadow the problems of Greece or Spain, and sparked angry reactions from French ministers.
Defending the downgrade, Moody's stated: "France's long-term economic growth outlook is negatively affected by multiple structural challenges, including its gradual, sustained loss of competitiveness and the long-standing rigidities of its labour, goods and the service markets.
"France's fiscal outlook is uncertain as a result of its deteriorating economic prospects, both in the short term, due to subdued domestic and external demand, and in the longer term due to the structural rigidities noted above."
The agency expressed concern over France's exposure to other beleaguered eurozone economies through its trade and banking links.
Moody's said it was unlikely to upgrade France's rating in the medium term, but would consider changing the outlook from negative to stable if the government implemented economic reforms and tax measures that "effectively strengthen the growth prospects of the French economy and the government's balance sheet" and reverse the "upward trajectory in public debt".
It recognised that Hollande has pledged structural reforms including reducing France's public deficit to 3% by 2013, but stated the proposed measures were "unlikely to be sufficiently far-reaching to restore competitiveness".
"Moody's notes that the track record of successive French governments in effecting such measures over the past two decades has been poor," it said.
The Socialist government's economic strategy rests on forecasts that growth will reach 0.8% next year and in bringing unemployment, currently at a 13-year high, down.
France's finance minister Pierre Moscovici said the downgrade was a "sanction for past management" of the country, intended to incite the government, elected in May, to carry out reforms rapidly.
He said reducing the public debt was a priority. "The debt is an enemy."

The NFL Has A Major Underclassmen Problem: S.I. - MMQB
A record 98 underclassmen declared for the NFL draft this year. Why the rush to enter the NFL? The 2011 CBA.
"If people say there are a lot of juniors this year, that means there might not be a lot of seniors next year and teams will say, ‘Let's maybe use future picks for this year,'" said Rams general manager Les Snead. "You never know how that's going to work. But I do think when it's deep, that it does affect strategy. It just depends on how creative people get." "I'm ecstatic about where we're sitting now with the 2 and 13," Snead said. "The deeper this (draft) gets, all of a sudden you may have more quality. You may have a second and a third that you might feel good about trading to get lower and with more picks. Should be fun."

MTD offers up its first two round mock drafts of the year. The Rams trade down to #6 (Atlanta), and select WR Sammy Watkins. S Calvin Pryor is the selection at #13.

A couple of thoughts: if that's all the Rams end up getting for the #2 overall draft pick, I would be very disappointed in the front office. With the likely abundance of quality guards in the second round (and the obvious need), I'd like the Rams to address that position sooner than later in the draft.

An Arizona Democratic lawmaker who once voted against welfare fraud protections in her state has been indicted on felony charges of defrauding the food stamp program.
According to the indictment unsealed earlier this week, state Rep. Cecilia Velasquez was charged with three felony counts: unlawful use of food stamps, fraudulent schemes and practices, and theft.
The Arizona Department of Economic Security began investigating Velasquez in 2014. According to the Arizona DES, Velasquez fraudulently used $1,726 worth of food stamps between 2013 and 2015.
This past February, Velasquez had voted against a bill aimed at giving the same state agency stronger anti-fraud tools – a program that could have quickly detected her alleged fraudulent activity.
Arizona state Rep. Anthony Kern, who sponsored the House bill, called the indictment “sad.”
“It is appalling that an elected official representing the people of Arizona would steal from the poor, while consistently saying she is trying to help the poor,” Kern told Fox News.
Josh Archambault, senior fellow with the Foundation for Government Accountability, pointed to the failed legislation as the kind of measures the country needs to tackle fraud.
“There is so much low-hanging fruit to catch in this country when it comes to welfare fraud, and sadly, every day that goes by without reform allows for abuse and steals resources from the truly needy,” Archambault told Fox News.
Velasquez's indictment was announced this week after an investigation by several state agencies.
According to Arizona Inspector General Juan J. Arcellana, the investigation began with a tip in November 2014.
“The indictment of State Representative Velasquez is the culmination of an extensive multi-year investigation,” Arcellana said in a statement. “The forthcoming judicial proceedings will ensure due process for the involved parties.”
Velasquez's office has not responded to Fox News' request for comment.
The initial hearing is set for July 5 in Maricopa County Superior Court.
Donald Trump said he doesn't plan to woo delegates with his luxury clubs and jets in order to ensure additional support at the Republican National Convention.
'Look, nobody has better toys than I do,' he told reporters at a stop on Staten Island yesterday, according to the New York Times.
'You're basically buying these people,' Trump continued. 'You're basically saying 'Delegate, listen, we're going to send you to Mar-a-Lago on a Boeing 757, you're going to use the spa, you're going to this, you're going to that, we want your vote.'
'That's a corrupt system,' Trump added.
It may be 'corrupt' in Trump's mind, but the Washington Post looked into how many delegates could be bought and some legal experts suggested that a campaign could cover an all-expenses-paid trip to meet campaign staff at a luxury resort like Trump's Mar-a-Lago.
Scroll down for video
Donald Trump, talking to reporters on Staten Island yesterday, said that while he has the best 'toys,' he won't spoil Republican National Convention delegates because the system is 'corrupt'
Donald Trump could shower Republican delegates with travel and lodging at his exclusive Mar-a-Lago resort - but he said he won't do it
Donald Trump has used his Palm Beach property, Mar-a-Lago, as the backdrop of campaign events, but won't use the property to woo Republican National Convention delegates
While Donald Trump has arrived on his personal plane to talk to supporters, he won't use the 757 to get additional support from convention delegates
Donald Trump could legally shuttle around delegates in his own private 757, but he told reporters yesterday on Staten Island that he wouldn't do it
The Post reported that under regulations established in the 1980s, delegates aren't allowed to take money from corporations, labor unions, federal contractor or foreign nationals, but an individual donor can bankroll their elections to get selected to go to the conventions.
This includes money that would go toward travel and leisure.
While a contribution from an individual to a delegate doesn't have to be disclosed, it can't have been made in coordination with a campaign or as an effort by that individual to bolster the chances of an individual candidate.
'It's almost like we need a campaign finance system for delegates,' Gregory Carlson, a 27-year-old who wasn't successful in becoming a Colorado delegate, told the Post. 'This is why we need to put serious thought into this and who are immune to being paid off with below-board messages.'
Trump, who's won the most primaries thus far, but as of late keeps getting routed by Cruz in getting supporters selected as delegates told reporters that he hopes the frustration with this system doesn't turn violent at the convention.
'And I don't think it will,' he said. 'But I will say this: It's a rigged system. It's a crooked system. It's 100 percent crooked,' Trump said.
In a separate interview with the Washington Post, Trump noted how he wanted to see more pizzazz at the July confab, blasting the 2012 event as 'the single most boring convention I've ever seen.
'It's very important to put some showbiz into a convention, otherwise people are going to fall asleep,' Trump told the Post last week.
He recalled that 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney had made the last convention even duller by failing to air a convention video that starred Trump delivering his trademark Apprentice line to an actor portraying President Barack Obama.
In 2012, the most Hollywood moment came courtesy of actor Clint Eastwood who spent nearly 12 minutes talking to an empty chair that was supposed to represent President Barack Obama
Other GOP convention mainstays include actor Jon Voight (left), pictured at the GOP 2012 convention, and actor Stephen Baldwin (right), pictured at the 2008 convention though he attended the 2012 convention too
'I said, 'Barack Hussein Obama, you're fired!'' Trump recalled. 'But [the Romney campaign] never played it. They thought it was too controversial. Stupid people. The cinematographer said it was one of the best things he ever did.'
Four years ago in Tampa, the Republican National Convention followed tradition and filled time with GOP standard-bearers in the majority of speaking slots.
The one bit of Hollywood spice was a nearly 12-minute-long meandering speech delivered by actor Clint Eastwood, who spent a good chunk of his time talking to an empty chair and pretending that it was President Obama.
The entire first day of convention programming was canceled due to a storm, which was when Trump's video was supposed to be played, according to an NBC News report from the time.
As far as other celebrity guests, actor Jon Voight showed up to the Florida confab.
Stephen Baldwin, the least-famous, most-conservative of the acting brothers was also on hand.
While outside the security gates more raucous events – headlined by Kid Rock, Journey and the super group Camp Freddy – occurred.
'We don't have the people who know how to put showbiz into the convention,' Trump complained to the Post
Kid Rock, shown here performing at a rally for Mitt Romney, was tapped during the 2012 Republican National Convention to play a show outside the official venues
So what would Trump bring to the table?
Likely some more interesting guests.
He told the Post he'd like to see other business people and other notables in speaking slots rather than the typical crowd of Republicans.
When asked by the Post journalists if he would include, say, rising Republican star Nikki Haley, the governor of South Carolina who put her weight behind Florida Sen. Marco Rubio days before her state's pivotal primary and then later backed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump gave a not-so-much.
'Nikki Haley would not be my first choice,' the billionaire noted.
But the veteran of both pageants and reality TV won't be able to make these decisions himself, even if he earns the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination before the convention, as plans are left up to chairman Reince Priebus and the Republican National Committee.
And because of Trump's precarious position as the longtime frontrunner who may not quite have enough delegates to be the outright nominee, those associated with other campaigns suggested restraint.
Rep. Steve King, the national co-chairman of Cruz's campaign told the Post that 'the [convention] program should be set by a balanced mix of the candidates and the RNC ... You don't wan tto give Trump a blank check to run the convention.'
Ohio Gov. John Kasich's chief strategist John Weaver said Trump shouldn't be able to decide anything because he's not the nominee.
THE MIND BOGGLES: Potential buyers of Sunshine Castle at Bli Bli have considered a range of different themes, including an 'adult entertainment venue'.
THE MIND BOGGLES: Potential buyers of Sunshine Castle at Bli Bli have considered a range of different themes, including an 'adult entertainment venue'. Marion Jonkers
A PLAN to transform the Sunshine Castle at Bli Bli into an "adult entertainment venue" with scenes from an erotic book in the dungeons, has ended up under the guillotine.
Ray White Commercial agent, Michael Shadforth, who has had the popular children's venue on the market for a year said there had been interest for "50 Shades of Grey in the dungeon".
"There has been a lot of interest from people considering making it an adult theme park," Mr Shadforth said.
"Not a swingers club, think 50 Shades of Grey.
"We get more enquiries about using the dungeons as a venue for adult entertainment, 50 Shades of Grey style, rather than kids running around thinking they are Rapunzel."
But couples tying-the-knot and a bumper Christmas season have saved the Castle from taking ideas from the 2011 erotic book.
50 Shades of Grey book cover
Castle owner, Birte Benecke-Uhrig has had such a bumper Christmas season and was doing so well with weddings and conferences, she was planning on take the castle off the market.
"If the right buyer comes along, we will think about selling," Ms Benecke-Uhrig said.
"But we have exciting plans for the new year.
'We are building the business and making it better and better and concentrating on the castle as new project rather than a sale
"We have cool new projects planned for the year."
Top Shots theme park at Maroochydore announced yesterday, January 17, it would be closing at the end of the month with the site to be transformed into multiple-dwelling units.
Reader poll Would you like to see Sunshine Castle turned into an adult theme park? This poll ended on 26 January 2017. Current Results Yes. 52% No. 35% Depends on how adult. 12% This is not a scientific poll. The results reflect only the opinions of those who chose to participate.
The castle has had "many quirky people look at it", including a Hollywood locations scout.
"We had various people flying in from the States, but it is doing really well as a corporate venue," Ms Benecke-Uhrig said.
"The location scout was on site but we were never allowed to find out anything about it.
"The details were hush-hush, there were major waivers we needed to sign.
"There was talk about it being for a pirate movie, or Harry Potter, some kind of big Hollywood blockbuster,
"But they must have gone with something else as we did everything we could."
Ms Benecke-Uhrig had no plans to develop the 50 Shades of Grey theme herself.
"No, I think it clashes too much with other products," she said.
"We are one of the oldest (theme parks on the Coast) still standing and we are still going and growing."

New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the top Democrat in the state Legislature, was handcuffed and hauled to court Thursday on charges that he used his office to extort millions of dollars in kickbacks and bribes.
Manhattan U.S. Magistrate Judge Frank Maas released Silver, 70, on $200,000 bail Thursday afternoon following his arrest on five counts, including conspiracy and bribery charges. He was forced to surrender his passport.
If convicted, Silver could face a sentence of up to 100 years in prison.
“Over his decades in office, Speaker Silver has amassed titanic political power,” U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. “But, as alleged, during that same time, Silver also amassed a tremendous personal fortune – through the abuse of that political power.”
Bharara said Silver “corruptly collected some $4 million in bribes and kickbacks disguised as ‘referral fees'” and said it accounted for “approximately two-thirds of all of Silver's outside income since 2002.”
“As today's charges make clear, the show-me-the-money culture of Albany has been perpetuated and promoted at the very top of the political food chain,” Bharara said. “And as the charges also show, the greedy art of secret self-reward was practiced with particular cleverness and cynicism by the Speaker himself.”
In addition, Bharara said a judge has issued warrants allowing authorities to seize $3.8 million in alleged fraud proceeds that he said Silver had dispersed among eight different bank accounts at six different banks.
As CBS2 Political Reporter Marcia Kramer reported, Silver spoke publicly Thursday afternoon among a pushing and shouting crowd of reporters.
“I'm happy the issue is coming to be aired in the legal process,” Silver said. “I am confident that when all the issues are aired I will be vindicated.”
Silver said he will not step aside to let someone else take over the legislative chamber, or resign his seat. He will continue to collect his approximately $121,000 salary as speaker.
When asked by CBS2's Dick Brennan if he would be able to function under the cloud of allegations, Silver said, “I believe so.”
Meanwhile, Silver's attorney, Joel Cohen, called the charges “meritless.”
“Mr. Silver looks forward to responding to them, in court, and ultimately his full exoneration,” Cohen said in a statement.

Oil giant Shell last week overcame the last major legal obstacle to its plans in the Arctic Ocean this summer. On Wednesday, the US Department of the Interior (DoI) approved the firm's oil spill response plan, effectively granting permission for exploratory drilling in the Beaufort Sea, north of Alaska.
Shell intends to drill from the start of July and must stop by the end of October, before the dark, cold and ice set in for winter. They received permission to drill in the nearby Chukchi Sea in February, and are now awaiting permits from environmental agencies.
The DoI upped the ante in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon leak in the Gulf of Mexico. It required Shell to prepare for a blowout three times larger. Shell's response was that they would first deploy a cap similar to the one that eventually sealed the Deepwater well, and if that failed, employ extensive backup measures.
These are the strictest offshore measures the DoI has ever required, but is Shell really prepared for the nightmare scenario: a blowout at the end of the drilling season that extends into the Arctic winter? New Scientist asked some experts to assess the plans.
Advertisement
Prevention please
The best cure is prevention, and Kulluk, Shell's rig, contains numerous sensors and automatic shut-off systems to detect early problems and deploy the cap. The technology is far more advanced than what the Deepwater rig had, says Arne Jernelöv at the Institute for Futures Studies in Stockholm, Sweden. “The DoI has done a good job by requiring that,” he says. “I think it's likely to work.”
If oil did enter the water, Shell and the DoI agree that containing it with booms would be ineffective as floating sea ice would obstruct them. Shell says it has several backups, including dropping dispersants from helicopters, burning the oil, and skimming it off the surface.
Those plans have problems. Jernelöv points out that dispersants can leave fish more exposed to oil's harmful effects. And it's not clear how well they would work in the Arctic: even in mid-summer, low-angle sunlight and cold water could fail to activate the chemicals. The flammable materials that are added to oil spills for burn-offs would also be less efficient there, Jernelöv says.
Ice-breaker issue
Shell will have ice-breaker ships on hand to create a path for skimmers, but broken ice may create more problems. “On a good day, we can recover 15 per cent of the oil from a fixed release in open water,” says Richard Charter of the Ocean Foundation.
“If you get tar oil mixed with broken sea ice, you're not going to recover it at all.”
And if oil gets under the ice, he says, it could stay there indefinitely since it won't be degraded by sunlight or bacteria. Shell says they can track the oil under seasonal ice using radar and other sensors, and recover it in the spring. But recovering oil that's carried out to sea would be too dangerous for skimmer ships.
Last resort
The last resort would be to drill a relief well – the only solution that has been consistently and permanently effective, says Jernelöv. Shell is required to be able to do this, but it takes three to six months – precious time they would not have if the blowout were late in the season. Ideally, they would drill two wells in parallel in order to have one ready, says Jernelöv. This would add hugely to Shell's drilling costs, and they're not required to take this precaution.
In the Gulf, the best cleaners were the natural ones: microbes that consumed both the oil and the methane gas that leaked with it. No one has done an extensive survey of the Beaufort Sea, says David Valentine of the University of California, Santa Barbara.
He guesses that many of the bacteria there will be similar to those in the Gulf, but at Arctic temperatures the bugs would be moving slowly and the ice might be a physical hindrance to them, curbing their ability to degrade oil and methane.
MORE than 5,000 people have signed a petition calling for the north of England to ‘secede from the UK and join Scotland'.
A total of 5,396 people have signed a petition on Change.org in support of the north of England joining Scotland and ‘regaining control over its own destiny'.
A version of the map, with the new Border outlined in red. Picture: Contributed
Despite being created a year ago, during the throes of the Scottish independence campaign, the petition attracted a number of signatures following the Conservative Party's win in last week's general election.
The petition states: “The deliberations in Westminster are becoming increasingly irrelevant to the north of England.
“The northern cities feel far greater affinity with their Scottish counterparts such as Glasgow and Edinburgh than with the ideologies of the London-centric south.
“The needs and challenges of the north cannot be understood by the endless parade of old Etonians lining the front benches of the House of Commons.
We, the people of the north, demand that in the event that Scotland becomes independent the border between England and the New Scotland be drawn along a line that runs between the River Dee and the mouth of The Humber.”
The Border between a ‘new Scotland' and England would see the cities of Sheffield, Hull, Liverpool, Leeds and Preston all join the newly-created country.
One signatory, from Macclesfield, wrote: “Increasingly Westminster appears to be asking the ordinary people of this country to bail the country out of the mess that they and their rich buddies in the financial quarter of the city created.
“I want out and want to join a more sensible equal country government - if I can't be European I'll be Scottish.”
Another supporter added: “I have more in common with the Scots, than the Etonian-led Southerners who do not care what happens in the North.”
One person pointed out that the petition could bring up the topic of increased Northern representation.
Despite being closed, the petition is still gathering signatures since last Thursday's vote, partly thanks to the #TakeUsWithYouScotland hashtag on Twitter.
Happy Wednesday friends! Thank you all for listening to me gripe and moan about my first world problems yesterday. I completely understand how petty I was for complaining about lack of electricity. Sometimes, a girl just needs to vent though, am I right? But now, thankfully, after a night of decent sleep, I'm back with a big ol' grin on my face.
Things aren't perfect but I'm learning to deal with the imperfections. Plus, I have some REALLY exciting things in the works that will be announced soon and, let's just say, they will help my financial situation greatly as well. Mo' money = Fewer problems for me, sorry Biggy.
Now, onto one of my favorite parts of the week, What I Ate Wednesday! These eats are from Monday where, thanks to my job, there was a full days worth of delicious eats to be had.
Breakfast:
Oatmeal with a tablespoon of peanut butter and 1/2 chopped banana. Simple, easy, healthy and delicious. Paired with coffee it was the perfect breakfast to fill me up until lunchtime.
Lunch:
A cup of whole wheat baked spaghetti. So good, so delicious and so freakin' awesome. I eat spaghetti at least twice a month and I've never tried it baked. Guys, it's the best thing in the world. Do it.
Snack:
A delicious pickle.
Dinner:
Had to make Philly cheesesteaks for an article on Groundhog Day (it relates), so we enjoyed these delicious sandwiches for dinner. I could only eat half though, these things are HUGE. And really filling. I paired mine with a glass of beer, because, duh, that's what you do.
Dessert:
Homemade strawberry chip ice cream. Guys, this is the most heavenly thing I've ever made. Plus, since it was made with skim milk and light cream, it's less fattening than most versions. The flavor was out of this world and the texture was ULTRA creamy. I'm seriously never buying store bought ice cream again, this stuff is IT.
So guys! Share your eats. What's the best thing you ate this week?
The Bears can continue to use five-man zone pressure on third-down situations against the Cowboys, but they need to win one-on-one matchups on the edge and take away the intermediate throwing lanes to limit quarterback Tony Romo and receiver Dez Bryant.
As shown here, the Cowboys have their Posse/11 personnel on the field (three wide receivers, one tight end, one back) in a 2-by-2 Doubles Gun Far formation with running back DeMarco Murray offset to the open side. The Bears counter with their base nickel sub-package (five defensive backs), align in an overload front and blitz linebacker Shea McClellin off the closed side edge. Romo will work the two-level read to the open side of the formation to target Bryant on the deep dig route (square-in) or come back to tight end Jason Witten on the quick stick route to move the chains.
The blitz
This is a five-man pressure scheme with the Bears showing an overload look at the line of scrimmage as Stephen Paea (NT) aligns to the open side of the formation. This allows the Bears to occupy the center while using the "TE" stunt (tackle and end) to create a rush lane for Jared Allen (RE) to the open side A gap off the twist look. To the closed side of the formation, Mike linebacker Jon Bostic (M) walks down into the front (forces the offense to count him in protection) with defensive end Willie Young (LE) attacking the B gap and McClellin (S) rushing off the edge.
Winning matchup off edge
If the Cowboys scan the protection with running back Murray (R), McClellin will have to win a one-on-one matchup to get home to Romo. The Bears linebacker has to set up Murray at the point of attack and force him back on his heels. That will allow McClellin to take an edge and create a positive angle to Romo. Speed isn't enough as Murray simply can wash McClellin up the field. And if McClellin attacks Murray down the middle, he will get a helmet under the chin. Think counter moves here to win on the edge.
Three-deep, three-under
The three-deep, three-under shell is the classic zone pressure look in the Bears defensive playbook with the three underneath defenders playing the seam-flat and middle hook drops. Bostic drops at the snap to the middle hook (match to No. 3) with nickel back Demontre Hurst (N) and strong safety Ryan Mundy (SS) playing the seam-flat technique (match to No. 2) to the open and closed side of the formation. This puts the Bears in a position to take away the inside smash route to slot receiver Cole Beasley (H) and the stick concept to Witten (Y).
Fuller vs. Bryant
Kyle Fuller (RC) struggled versus Calvin Johnson on Thanksgiving as the rookie failed to stay in-phase (on the hip) from an off-man position versus the Lions wide receiver at the top of the route. This allowed Johnson to separate consistently on inside breaking routes. And it won't get any easier versus Bryant (X). The Cowboys wide receiver is the top player at the position in my opinion. Bryant has vertical speed, lateral movement and strength, and he is an explosive playmaker after the catch. If Tucker continues to play his cornerbacks off the ball, it's on Fuller to stay square in his pedal and drive to the upfield shoulder as he funnels Bryant to the middle of the field on the dig route. It's another tough matchup for the first-round pick.
Early downs
If the Bears want to send pressure on third downs, they must limit Murray and the Cowboys zone run game in early down-and-distance situations. The Cowboys feature one of the best offensive lines in the league and they run the zone scheme as well as anyone I've watched on tape. The Bears have to seal the edge, flow to the football at linebacker and close Murray's cutback lanes to force Romo and the Cowboys into third-down passing situations.

A Fresno homeless advocate has been sent a letter from Homeland Security, informing him that his attempts to help the homeless have been "brought to the attention of the Police Department's Terrorism Liaison Officers." The unwanted attention of the Homeland Security anti-terrorism group followed a City of Fresno "clean up" of a homeless encampment on the Mariposa Mall in downtown Fresno.Several homeless advocates monitored the "clean up" and removal of homeless people's property on the morning of April 22, 2009 by City Sanitation Workers. "Clean ups" at the Mariposa Mall site, just west of Fresno City Hall, are conducted about once a month. City Sanitation puts up signs announcing the date of the clean up, most of the homeless people move out shortly before they arrive, and move back later in the day.Phil Connelly, one of the homeless advocates, left the Mariposa Mall “clean up” and went to the City of Fresno Corporate Yard (2101 G street) in an attempt to see where the confiscated property was taken. It has been city policy to store property at that location for 90 days, or until it is reclaimed. A few days after his visit to the City of Fresno Corporate Yard, Connelly was contacted by Sgt. Ronald Grimm, Homeland Security Coordinator for the Fresno Police Department.
These days, it takes care­ful pars­ing to pin­point what Re­pub­lic­an can­did­ates be­lieve about cli­mate change.
The GOP's Sen­ate can­did­ate in Michigan, Terri Lynn Land, is­sued a press re­lease last month that de­clared glob­al warm­ing was “ab­so­lutely” a real­ity. Such an ac­know­ledg­ment, on its face, would once have amoun­ted prac­tic­ally to heresy for a party hos­tile to the sci­ence of cli­mate change. But lest any­one be­gin to con­fuse her with Bill Nye the Sci­ence Guy, her cam­paign's spokes­wo­man quickly emailed a fol­low-up state­ment: Al­though Land thinks the Earth's cli­mate is chan­ging partly as a con­sequence of hu­man be­ha­vi­or, she's du­bi­ous about the de­gree to which hu­man­kind is re­spons­ible.
To a cli­mate sci­ent­ist, that's a bit like watch­ing a golfer line up a per­fect putt, only to see the ball un­ex­pec­tedly lip out of the hole at the last mo­ment. But as the dust settles on Pres­id­ent Obama's pro­pos­al to cut car­bon emis­sions, her al­most-but-not-quite em­brace of cli­mate-change sci­ence is in­dic­at­ive of a broad­er shift with­in the Re­pub­lic­an Party — one that has shucked the de­fi­ant skep­ti­cism of its re­cent past for a nu­anced view on the sub­ject.
Cer­tainly, base-wary Re­pub­lic­ans haven't gone all-in yet. Their ad­just­ment, however, is no ac­ci­dent: While the sci­ence it­self is largely the same, the polit­ics of its le­git­im­acy has turned against Re­pub­lic­ans in all but the red­dest of states. It's a sep­ar­ate de­bate from the eco­nom­ic-fo­cused one about the po­ten­tial loss of jobs from the reg­u­la­tions — one Re­pub­lic­ans are con­vinced they'll win — but it's non­ethe­less an is­sue rear­ing its head in the midterm elec­tions.
“I don't think it would be wise for a Re­pub­lic­an to shut the door on a dis­cus­sion of cli­mate change,” said Dick Wadhams, a Col­or­ado-based GOP strategist. “But I do think it's sens­ible for a Re­pub­lic­an can­did­ate to ex­press skep­ti­cism about this head­long rush … a lot of Demo­crats seem to be hav­ing to kill the coal in­dustry.”
Wit­ness Marco Ru­bio, who like Land sim­il­arly ar­gued that the cli­mate is chan­ging but doubted wheth­er hu­mans are the main cul­prit. Thom Tillis and Joni Ernst, two Re­pub­lic­an Sen­ate can­did­ates in purple-hued North Car­o­lina and Iowa, re­spect­ively, have also ex­pressed views in shades of gray. Rick Scott, the Re­pub­lic­an gov­ernor of Flor­ida, has star­ted say­ing that he's “not a sci­ent­ist.”
And that's when Re­pub­lic­ans talk about the sci­ence at all: Many, such as Ed Gillespie in Vir­gin­ia or Cory Gard­ner in Col­or­ado, opt against say­ing any­thing all, in­stead keep­ing their fo­cus trained squarely on the ef­fect reg­u­la­tions will have on jobs and elec­tri­city bills.
It wasn't al­ways this way. As re­cently as 2009, Re­pub­lic­an lead­ers such as then-House Minor­ity Lead­er John Boehner were pub­licly mock­ing cli­mate-change sci­ence. Ap­pear­ing on ABC News's This Week, Boehner said the no­tion that car­bon di­ox­ide was a car­ci­no­gen was “al­most com­ic­al.”
“Every time we ex­hale, we ex­hale car­bon di­ox­ide,” he said. “Every cow in the world, you know, when they do what they do, you've got more car­bon di­ox­ide.”
In many in­stances, Re­pub­lic­ans avoided talk­ing about the is­sue at all (some­times go­ing to great lengths to avoid do­ing so). It's not that Re­pub­lic­ans have al­ways out­right re­jec­ted cli­mate-change sci­ence; be­fore the tea-party wave of 2010, the GOP had largely em­braced not only the sci­ence but some meas­ure of poli­cy­mak­ing to com­bat it. But with the rise of the ul­tracon­ser­vat­ive base, the fail­ure of the Demo­crats' cap-and-trade le­gis­la­tion, and sub­sequent deep un­pop­ular­ity of that pro­pos­al, Re­pub­lic­an at­ti­tudes changed.
“In the af­ter­math of that, no one had to be care­ful,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a prom­in­ent Re­pub­lic­an eco­nom­ist and out­spoken ad­voc­ate about the threat posed by cli­mate change (who op­poses the pres­id­ent's EPA rules). “You could just lam­baste everything as­so­ci­ated with it.”
Now they do. Nearly six in 10 Amer­ic­ans think hu­man activ­it­ies are mainly to blame for the rise in glob­al tem­per­at­ures, ac­cord­ing to a Gal­lup Poll from March. And des­pite the party's long­stand­ing skep­ti­cism about cli­mate change, 41 per­cent of Re­pub­lic­ans say the same.
But more im­port­ant than how many voters it reaches is which voters it reaches. The re­jec­tion of cli­mate-change sci­ence — and the po­ten­tial to con­sequently be labeled as anti-all sci­ence — risks ali­en­at­ing the crit­ic­al bloc of mod­er­ate and even GOP-lean­ing voters. “There's a slice of mod­er­ate and lib­er­al Re­pub­lic­ans, part col­lege-edu­cated, part wo­men, part un­der-50, where there is an op­por­tun­ity for Demo­crats to get a lot more of those voters than they nor­mally would,” said An­drew Bau­mann, a Demo­crat­ic poll­ster who works with en­vir­on­ment­al groups.
Cli­mate change won't single-handedly change minds, not by a long shot. Few in­di­vidu­al is­sues do. But it's one of a mélange of top­ics — among them im­mig­ra­tion re­form, gun con­trol, and abor­tion rights — that Demo­crats can use to win over the bloc of af­flu­ent sub­urb­an mod­er­ates, a kind of death-by-a-thou­sand-cuts strategy. It's the same group of voters who also pop­u­late a lot of crit­ic­al 2014 swing areas, such as the North­ern Vir­gin­ia or the Den­ver sub­urbs.
Des­pite the com­pel­ling polling on the is­sue, Re­pub­lic­an strategists say it's one that's eas­ily nav­ig­able by tal­en­ted can­did­ates. A de­bate about sci­ence isn't good for the party, but it doesn't have to be, they say, ar­guing that the fo­cus on EPA's car­bon reg­u­la­tions and the po­ten­tial job losses that res­ult steers the de­bate to­ward far firmer ground for the GOP.
Be­sides, voters still rank com­bat­ing cli­mate change near the bot­tom of their list of pri­or­it­ies.
“The ques­tion is, is cli­mate change go­ing to be on the menu of what's driv­ing voters in North Car­o­lina?” said Paul Shu­maker, a North Car­o­lina-based GOP strategist who works for Tillis, the party's Sen­ate nom­in­ee. “How many people in North Car­o­lina are be­ing dir­ectly im­pacted by it now?”
Ac­cord­ing to sci­ence, all of them.
The new union between Joest Racing and Mazda Motorsports, which was formally announced this morning, will see Joest re-establishing a US base, near Atlanta, Ga., and testing the Mazda Prototypes on both sides of the Atlantic.
Ralf Juttner, managing director of Joest, said: “We want to bring all the experience that we have gathered in endurance racing into this project, and therefore I expect a really, really close relationship with Multimatic on the development of the car and the improvement on the car.
“We all know Multimatic knows how to build race cars. That is not a question. But we will put all our input together and try to come up with the best we can.
“We expect to be starting with the testing as soon as August – without going into detail on the test program – but in the next month we expect to have the car rolling.”
Director of motorsports for Mazda North American Operations, John Doonan, added: “Larry Holt and his team at Multimatic are dedicated in an all-hands-on-deck fashion to help us further develop that car. Our engines partner at AER are all-in, giving Mazda Team Joest the opportunity to get out and test with [current drivers] Jonathan Bomarito, Tristan Nuñez, Joe Miller, Tom Long to put miles on that package [and] prepare for every potential scenario that we could face heading into the 2018 season.
“We are going to the racetrack to do one thing, and that's to win races and win championships for the Mazda brand and for all the Mazda fans.”
Great potential
Juttner admitted that homologation issues would make modifying the RT24-P difficult, he said he believed it had great potential.
“Of course there are restrictions with the homologation of the cars,” he said. “There are areas that can be touched and areas that are more difficult to be touched.
“We are going, together with Multimatic, the IMSA organization, the technical guys there, to make sure that we don't leave anything out where we can put hands on. It's not that you have a clean sheet of paper and you can start from scratch, that's clear. But I still think there's a lot of potential that can be unlocked.
“The testing will be done with a car that does already have some modifications in it. We expect more to come throughout the remainder of this year until then we have a version that we think is the right one to start the season in 2018.
“The other thing is that we need to work on reliability, because that's the first thing that you have to have in order to finish on top. That's clear.”
Doonan said the emphasis needed to be on upping the performance of the cars which have lagged behind Cadillac and Nissan in terms of pace this year, and which are expecting stern opposition from the new-for-2018 Acura-Penske DPi program.
“Within the regulations we're going to do what we can," he added. "More so than reliability, I think it's more raceability and competitiveness. That's our focus.
“Clearly, from an engine standpoint, we've found a sweet spot right now. But Larry Holt, and his Multimatic team, Peter Gibbons, Stephen Charsley, Julian Robertson. Everyone there is laser-focused on doing what we can to make the Mazda RT24-P the best package it can be going forward as we take on all those at the top level of the championship.
“So, again, can't share too many details, but definitely interested in our raceability and our ability to compete up front versus reliability and durability. Those things I know Ralf and his team are focused on… elements of durability and reliability. I think my keen interest is on how we're going to be able to race this package against the best that's out there.”
2018 driver lineup to be revealed in the fall
Although testing will begin with Bomarito, Nunez, Miller and Long, Doonan stated that any changes would likely be made by the time of the IMSA season finale at Petit Le Mans in October.
“We believe in the group of drivers that have represented us in the prototype program to date,” he said. “As Ralf shared, we hope to be on track testing within the next 30 or 40 days. Our current driver lineup will be part of that testing program.
“Hopefully sometime prior to the end of the 2017 championship we'll be able to make an announcement around our driver lineup that will carry us into 2018.”
Juttner commented: “Mazda has their drivers which they have raced up to now… They have grown them through their own famous and very good system, which they are very proud about and rightly so.
“We have not worked with any of these drivers up to now. I'm looking forward to doing that. I'm very open to start working with those guys. The rest we will see. As John said, he hopes to have a final driver lineup by the end of the season. Whether there is a change or not, we can't tell yet.
“It's not that we are coming with a whole wagon of drivers in our bag trying to bring those in. That's not the case. We respect that it's Mazda's responsibility to contract the drivers.
“We will discuss together, as we have done in the past, because it is important, because the driver and the team relationship is a very important one. But I'm sure that we will find a good solution there.”

President Donald Trump told reporters Wednesday he feels “somewhat” vindicated after House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes' revelation that he has seen reports from the U.S. intelligence community showing communication from members of the transition team — and possibly from the president himself — were "incidentally collected" as part of a broader surveillance effort.
Nunes said he was “alarmed” by the findings and trekked to the White House Wednesday afternoon to personally brief President Trump.
"What I've read bothers me,” Nunes told reporters outside the White House after sharing his findings with the president. “And I think it should bother the president himself and his team because I think some of it seems to be inappropriate."
"I appreciate him coming over," Trump said when asked by reporters about the visit.
Spicer called Nunes' claims a "startling revelation" and lambasted what he saw as the media's "presumptive" tone of negativity toward the administration on the issue.
Nunes did not share the information with the ranking Democratic member of the intelligence committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, before telling reporters or updating the White House. He said the intelligence agencies will have to provide the reports to the intelligence committee in order for any Democrats to see them.
Schiff told reporters in an impromptu press conference later Wednesday that his Republican counterpart's actions jeopardized the credibility of the committee's ongoing investigation.

"The chairman will need to decide whether he is the chairman of an independent investigation into conduct, which includes allegations of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, or he's going to act as a surrogate of the White House. Because he cannot do both," Schiff said.
Schiff has not seen the reports that Nunes briefed reporters, the House Speaker, and the president on Wednesday and said he could not verify their contents.
Schiff also told NBC News' Chuck Todd that there is "more than circumstantial" evidence of collusion between Trump campaign associates and the Russians.
Wednesday's back-and-forth centered, in part, on "incidental collection" of information which occurs when a foreigner under surveillance calls an American, and that conversation is picked up. The American side of the conversation is usually blacked out in any intelligence report that is generated.
However, the American's name and what he or she said can be “unmasked” if there is evidence of a crime, or if the information is needed to understand the foreign intelligence.
Admiral Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, testified to Congress this week that 20 people at the agency, including him, have the authority to unmask the American side of an intercepted conversation.
Earlier in the week, Nunes said evidence was so far lacking for the president's claims that former President Barack Obama illegally ordered a wiretap of Trump Tower before the November election. On Monday, FBI Director James Comey, in testimony before Congress Monday, refuted Trump's claim that Obama wiretapped his communications.

The FBI, the NSA, the Department of Justice, the top Republican and Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper have all said they've seen no evidence to support Trump's claims.
Nunes, did not explain the change in tone during a press conference at the White House on Wednesday.
He told reporters he saw “some level of surveillance activity, perhaps legal, but I don't know if it's right.”
The collections were not related to investigations into Russia and its alleged connections to the Trump campaign, Nunes said.

Nunes told reporters the collection appeared to be “normal” and “all legally collected foreign intelligence under” the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA.
"I believe it was all done legally. I think it was all obtained legally. The question is it masked," Nunes told reporters earlier in the day.
He would not identify the source of this material and implied he had seen it independently. He said he briefed House Speaker Paul Ryan about the documents Wednesday morning.
Legal experts say the incidental collection of U.S. government officials' communications in intelligence surveillance is routine, and on its own, does not indicate anything about who is the target of such surveillance.
Generally, it is illegal for U.S. officials to publicly disclose the targets of FISA warrants, unless pre-approved by a court or if declassified through the executive branch process.
Robert Deitz, a former top lawyer for the CIA and the NSA, told NBC News that the fact that an American was picked up in surveillance of foreigners “in and of itself, doesn't mean a thing. All it means that a person on watch is talking to a U.S. person. The general rule is that the U.S. person identity is minimized, so all you have is the one side, unless a crime has been committed or the identity of the American is necessary to understand the intelligence.”
Deitz said he thought it was “rather interesting,” that more than one person on Trump's transition team were picked up, because it's not that common for Americans to be talking to foreign surveillance targets.

TEHRAN - All 28 Chinese crew members aboard a China-linked cargo ship hijacked by Somali pirates were rescued on Friday, the Chinese embassy in Tehran said.
The cargo ship, Xianghuamen, was hijacked by Somali pirates at about 8:40 am local time (0410 GMT) on Friday in the Sea of Oman near Iran's southern port of Chabahar.
The Sea of Oman is connected to the Gulf in the west by the Strait of Hormuz, one of the crucial waterways in the world for shipping crude oil.
The vessel, registered in Panama, belongs to Nanjing Ocean Shipping company in eastern China.
The cargo ship, setting off from Shanghai, made a stopover in Singapore to unload some goods and then headed for Imam Khomeini port in southwestern Iran when it was hijacked.
Nine Somali pirates climbed onto the cargo ship by their own ladders, fired shots on the ship and seized the Chinese crew members on board.
Two Iranian naval warships participating in the rescue operation followed the vessel and ordered the pirates to surrender. The pirates later threw their weapons into the sea and surrendered to the Iranian navy.
The hijacked cargo ship's engine was damaged and is in repair. Later the ship will head for the Iranian port of Gask, 70 miles (about 112 km) away from where the hijacking occurred and 200 miles (about 322 km) away from the vessel's destination.
After the hijacking, the Chinese embassy in Tehran started emergency procedures and contacted related Iranian governmental departments, urging the Iranian side to take all necessary measures and spare no efforts to rescue the crew members and ensure their safety.
Yu Hongyang, the Chinese ambassador, requested Iran to put the safety of the hijacked crew members as the first priority, adding that the Chinese government, State Council and Foreign Ministry all expressed grave concerns about the incident.
On Friday afternoon, the Denver Nuggets announced that rookie shooting guard, Malik Beasley will be heading to the D-League to join the Sioux Falls SkyForce. Beasley was buried on the bench behind Will Barton and Jamal Murray but with the return of Gary Harris looming on the horizon, Beasley was likley headed for several DNP-CD's.
Beasley, who has only played 54 minutes total this season and missed all summer league due to a leg injury, will almost certainly benefit from getting on the court for actual basketball minutes. He has a lot of upside but, of the three players taken by the Nuggets in the first round of the 2016 NBA draft, Malik is probably the furthest from earning serious minutes. Getting time on the court where he can focus on his individual game and getting reps against other professional athletes should help his development a lot.
We wanted to know more about this move so Denver Stiffs reached out to Chris Reichert, associate editor of The Step Back at Fansided and a passionate fan and expert of the NBADL. Chris shares his thoughts on the move, the SkyForce team, coaching staff, and more. You can also check out SkyForce games live on Facebook if you are interested in following Malik's play.
Who are the Sioux Falls Skyforce and how are they doing this year?
Reichert: The Skyforce are the Miami Heat's D-League affiliate and the defending champs after notching a record-setting 40-10 season last year. This season they picked up right where they left off as they were 8-2 heading into Friday night's game against the Raptors 905.
How much time do you expect Beasley to get each game? Do they need a shooting guard / scorer?
Reichert: Honestly, every team needs a dynamic player like Malik Beasley, however this team is currently hitting on all cylinders so it will be interesting to see how much he is utilized. Ultimately, Denver gets to decide on where Beasley goes (after teams volunteer to take him as a flex assignee) so one would have to assume SXF agreed to give him at least 20 minutes per night.
What is the team's style of play? What makes them unique?
Reichert: Coach Nevada Smith is known for his run-and-gun days with the RGV Vipers playing Moreyball, and while Sioux Falls doesn't play to that extreme, they still get up and down. They are top-10 in PPG, RPG, APG and play defense too allowing the fourth fewest PPG to opponents. Briante Weber runs the team and they play through him and Keith Benson a lot. Beasley should get open looks on the perimeter as they run a free-flowing offense.
Who is currently on the roster of note? Have they had any recent call-ups under the current coach?
Reichert: They have not had any call ups this season (there have only been five throughout the league so far), but they have some known names. Briante Weber is the point guard, Keith Benson is their center and they also have Luis Montero and Marcus Posley.
Any loose thoughts about this assignment?
Reichert: I like it. Beasley is 20-years-old and has only played what amounts to one full game's worth of minutes for the Nuggets, so it's good for him to get real live-game action. The Skyforce are a top notch organization and they will use him to the best of his ability while he's on the court. The downside here is he won't be running any of Denver's sets, using their lingo or getting comfortable with their schemes on the floor.
Want to know more about Malik Beasley? Check out our 20-minute exclusive interview with him on the Locked on Nuggets podcast where he talks about his family, the draft, and what ways the vets are playfully hazing him and the other rookies.

You know how it is: first you get an assignment for Fortune magazine, and the next thing you know, you're taking pictures of people smoking pot. At least, that's how it worked for photographer Robyn Twomey. The Fortune story focused on the business of medical marijuana, and mostly entailed shooting pictures at pot dispensaries; but in the process Twomey got to know and photograph Jordan, a 19-year old who has a rare form of leukemia. This led to a series of over 30 portraits of medical marijuana clients as they administered their medication.
In these images, the smoke becomes part of the portrait: it's a gesture, it's a visualization of the subjects' breath, it's their environment. The smoke competes with the subject for our attention, and the strength of these pictures comes from the tension between the two.
The following images are a sampling from that project. Twomey will also be exhibiting large-format archival pigment prints from the project in an exhibit called Medicine, opening on March 3rd at the Patricia Sweetow Gallery in San Francisco. —Tim J Luddy
Princeton University mathematician Manjul Bhargava was awarded today the 2014 Fields Medal, one of the most prestigious awards in mathematics, in recognition of his work in the geometry of numbers. The International Mathematical Union (IMU) presents the medal every four years to researchers under the age of 40 based on the influence of their existing work and on their "promise of future achievement."
The honor, often referred to as the "Nobel Prize of mathematics," was awarded to four young researchers at the 2014 IMU International Congress of Mathematicians held in Seoul, South Korea. Bhargava is the eighth Fields Medal recipient from Princeton since 1954 and the third consecutive awardee from the University, following recipients in 2006 and 2010.
The prize committee commended Bhargava, the Brandon Fradd, Class of 1983, Professor of Mathematics at Princeton, "for developing powerful new methods in the geometry of numbers, which he applied to count rings of small rank and to bound the average rank of elliptic curves." The IMU further wrote that his "work in number theory has had a profound influence on the field. A mathematician of extraordinary creativity, he has a taste for simple problems of timeless beauty, which he has solved by developing elegant and powerful new methods that offer deep insight…. He surely will bring more delights and surprises to mathematics in the years to come."
Bhargava, who joined the Princeton faculty in 2003 after receiving his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University in 2001, said that the honor extends beyond himself to include those who have worked alongside him during his career. "I am of course very honored to be receiving the Fields Medal," Bhargava said. "Beyond that, it is a great source of encouragement and inspiration, not just for me, but I hope also for my students, collaborators and colleagues who work with me. Needless to say, this is their prize, too!"
David Gabai, the Hughes-Rogers Professor of Mathematics and department chair, said: "This is really great for both the department and the University. The Fields Medal is probably the most prestigious recognition in pure mathematics." Gabai added, "beyond being a great researcher and adviser to graduate students, Manjul is an extraordinary teacher." He is particularly known for his popular freshman seminar, "The Mathematics of Magic Tricks and Games," wherein students explore the mathematical principles behind games and magic tricks.
Bhargava has received numerous awards for his work, including the 2012 Infosys Prize; the 2011 Fermat Prize presented by the Toulouse Mathematics Institute in France; the 2005 SASTRA Ramanujan Prize from the Shanmugha Arts, Science, Technology and Research Academy in India; the AMS Blumenthal Award for the Advancement of Pure Mathematics in 2005; and the Packard Foundation Fellowship in Science and Engineering in 2004. He was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 2013. He also was named one of Popular Science magazine's "Brilliant 10" in 2002. As a graduate student, Bhargava studied under renowned mathematician Andrew Wiles, the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Mathematics, Emeritus.
Princeton mathematicians have received several of the field's most esteemed awards this year. In March, Professor of Mathematics Yakov Sinai was awarded the Abel Prize by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters for his influential 50-year career in mathematics. In June, Peter Sarnak, the Eugene Higgins Professor of Mathematics, received the Wolf Prize in Mathematics, which is awarded by the Israel-based Wolf Foundation and presented by the president of Israel.
"We should be proud of the fact that so many of our faculty won major prizes and recognitions this year," Gabai said.
The IMU today also recognized the first female recipient of a Fields Medal, Maryam Mirzakhani, who was a Princeton mathematics professor from 2004 to 2010 and is now at Stanford University.
The union also presented Princeton alumnus Subhash Khot, a New York University professor of computer science who received his Ph.D. in computer science from Princeton in 2003, with the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize, which honors "outstanding contributions in mathematical aspects of information sciences." In addition, Phillip Griffiths, who received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton in 1962 and served as a professor of mathematics from 1968 to 1972, received the Chern Medal Award, which is presented to those "whose accomplishments warrant the highest level of recognition for outstanding achievements in the field of mathematics."
Alternatively we could start with a certain amount of time and keep doubling that amount of time. We start for example with just five minutes waiting on the first day and double it to ten minutes on the second day and then double that to twenty minutes on the third day and so on. The time limit will grow exponentially and it will not take longer than a month before we find ourselves smoke free most of our waking hours. This method works for those of us who are closer to non-smoking on the addiction to smoking scale. We can switch things up and replace days with weeks, so we extend the time we wait before we smoke for 15 minutes every day of a week and then add 15 more minutes for the next week making it 30 minutes, so we can build up our non-smoking habit with a slower pace, giving it deeper roots in our subconscious mind. Over time, we can make more mistakes and slip ups because of our natural mood fluctuation. We will have more opportunities for learning and growth. In fact, the only time we need to worry is when things are going too well. We need to slip up and make mistakes, we need those reminders of our humanity in order for us to properly grow. When we do everything right all the time, we don't grow, and when we don't grow we wither and die. We don't want to intentionally slip up, we want to allow ourselves the chance to slip up, to be humans. We are not building the habit of hyper vigilance and constant alertness, we want to cultivate the habit of relaxed freedom from smoking. It is possible and the only obstacle is time and our willingness to put in the effort required.
Along the way on our journey towards freedom, we will reach the first major milestone; a measurable result that can give us an accurate estimate of our progress. All the five minutes here and ten minutes there have finally added up to something noticeable. As we were getting the feeling that we were wasting our time and getting nothing in return for our effort, just before everything started to feel hopeless. We reach an amount of time that splits the day into two halves. We spend the first half of the day as non-smokers and the second half of that same day as smokers. This is important so we need to pay attention. We can now observe and compare life as smokers and as a non-smoker. We can observe life from both a subjective point of view and an objective point of view, simultaneously. We are smokers and we are non-smokers, we can look at ourselves in both roles and observe the transformation between the two distinctly different states of mind within the timeframe of a single day, within the time it takes to light up and inhale. The difference between the states of mind of smoker and non-smoker is comparable to difference between the richest and poorest persons in the world. The difference between the richest person and the poorest person in the world is infinitely smaller than the difference between a diseased person and a healthy person. We experience life as a healthy person and we experience it as a diseased person within the duration of a single day. It is beneficial to do the half day routine for a few consecutive days, or even weeks, just to get a real lasting feel for both perspectives, smoker and non-smoker, before we choose to go on expanding the non-smoker part of our days or expanding the smoking part of our days. Choice! We can choose to progress into the new habit or regress into the old habit, we neither fail nor did we really succeed, we only choose freely and that is the greatest victory of all.
There is no amount of words that can come close to describing the experience as actually experiencing it. This can be easily proven with a lengthy conversation with someone who has not parachuted out of an airplane the night before his first jump and a short conversation after the jump. The differences will be literally worlds apart. There aren't enough many words or combination of words that can describe the sensations of switching between being a smoker and and being a non-smoker. One can only understand it when one has experienced it. When we repeat the half day routine for a few days, we gain deeper understanding of our differing states of mind of smoking and non-smoking. We are on the very edge of now, experiencing life from two very different and highly subjective points of view. We can taste the freedom of choice and the accompanying tingly sensation. we can at the same time feel the “comfort” of the familiar habit of smoking. We gradually expose ourselves to the fear of change over time and finally conquer it, we conquer fear of change. The old self is finally dead and the new self can rise from the ashes. This is how a wrongfully convicted person feels once he is free again. We have been wrongfully convicting ourselves and condemning ourselves to the prison of the smoking habit, and we can finally reverse the verdict and free ourselves. We are parachuting into the wild world of freedom and the cigarette used to be our parachute. When the time is right we realize that we did not need the parachute, we have overcome our fear of jumping into that scary sky that we call life, we take off the parachute and spread our wings, knowing that we will make it and only fear was holding us back. The monkey is losing control and the soul is taking charge, the monkey will be tamed and will trust the spirit to guide the body in the right direction. Finally we can lean back and gaze with amazement at the wonder that is life. We are truly free.

Epically scaled neon signs and letters loomed over us, competing for our attention like giant, candy-colored shrines to a city built on dreams and bent on continual reinvention. I was so excited, I had to contain myself so I'd have a steady hand with which to compose my shots. The absence of a crowd made the experience even more surreal. There were five of us — me, the tour guide, and three other visitors — and we felt like survivors of an apocalypse, wandering through the remnants of a lost civilization. The guide explained the history of each monument at length, but I barely heard him; my camera was jammed to my face as I fired off shot after shot for the entire hour. As a photographer, signage is one of my favorite subjects. So visiting The Neon Museum in Las Vegas— the only institution in the world dedicated to salvaging iconic examples of the genre—was like stepping into heaven. The tour began inside the crown jewel of the museum's collection: the lobby of the La Concha Motel, a 1960s building known for its then-futuristic, mid-century modern architecture.
Shark! The lobby of La Concha Motel features winged overhangs.
La Concha shut down in 2003, and by 2006, the concrete shell of the lobby was the only remaining piece of the motel. Recognizing its significance, the building's owners donated it to the museum, sparing it from certain demolition. It was carefully chopped up into eight pieces, transported by truck to the museum, and put back together again like an inside-out Humpty Dumpty at a cost of $8M USD. Our guide, a bubbly, rotund man in hot pink sunglasses, materialized and we started off by passing through a narrow outdoor corridor underneath a section of the Binion's Horseshoe sign — still in excellent condition, its metallic curves glistening in the Vegas sun.
Binion's Horseshoe sign
I stood in awe, craning my neck to take in the entire thing. The other guests could tell I meant serious business and got out of my way as I centered myself perfectly with the sign, laid down on the dirt path, and started shooting. Meanwhile, the guide explained the rules, the most important of which was not to wander from the group. Damn.
Signs from the Silver Slipper, Caesar's Palace, Stardust, and others lay on the ground against a pure blue sky.
Then, he led us into a vast open space called the “boneyard”: A six-acre maze of wide, winding paths lined with over 150 unrestored artifacts. A literally overwhelming amount of beautiful signage stood in every direction.
After years in the sun, the signs have kept their color.
After decades open to the elements, the pieces still sparkled with color (I can't imagine what they must've been like in their heyday). I barely knew where to point my camera, so I just snapped away, covering everything in sight.
The restored Silver Slipper glitters with lights as it once did. Shiny metal objects
Astonishingly, almost all of this was created by one corporation: the Young Electric Sign Company, also known as YESCO. These are the same people responsible for the iconic “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” sign.
Nostalgic sparkles from the Stardust Hotel and Casino
Then, almost as soon as the tour had begun, it was over. I wanted to spend the rest of the day (or my life) here, doing whatever: playing hide and seek, drinking, getting some sun — but my begging and pleading fell on deaf ears, and we were promptly escorted back to the lobby.
The Sahara shows signs of weathering, giving it even more character.
Cloudera chief Tom Reilly on the evolution of big data
‘Hadoop has become a core part of every single large enterprise for data management. I've never seen an industry mature that fast, and that's incredible'
Last time we spoke to you it was in 2014, when Cloudera had just announced a monster $740 million investment from Intel, along with a strategic partnership. Where has that investment gone, and how is the relationship going?
Hadoop has become a core part of every single large enterprise for data management. Ive never seen an industry mature that fast, and thats incredible
Yes, it was the two-year anniversary of the partnership in May, and it continues to be a game-changing relationship. I'm very impressed with the things we've done. There's some pretty exciting work happening now with Intel around designing chips optimised for analytic workloads. Some work has been done to make sure analytic workloads on Apache Hadoop are the first workloads deployed in that chip, working on transactional memory, and other next-generation technologies with Intel.
It's a five-year roadmap, and we've had many deliverables in the past two years. We have been working on them in terms of additional planning on how they see the data centre of the future, and how it's going to be architected and designed. It's a long-term view of innovation that's coming. We need to be able to prepare for it and make sure Apache Hadoop takes advantage of these architectures.
Just from a business perspective, we don't anticipate ever needing to raise any funding again, which obviously gives us a lot of flexibility in how we build our business, and when to time our IPO.
Being partnered with Intel has allowed us to invest significantly in our roadmap, which allows us to mature the platform and advance the capabilities much faster than we could without that funding.
>See also: What are the numbers, facts and figures behind big data?
Cloudera has also been busy with acquisitions over the past few years. Can you talk us through them?
The first acquisition we did after the Intel investment was Gazzang, an encryption and big data company. One of the first projects we had with Intel was how to take advantage of the x86 chipset and do encryption on the hardware, so when we saw they were doing that we had a value proposition for our customers where we say that any data landing in our enterprise data hub should be encrypted. Now Gazzang do all of our security development and manage our platform for cybersecurity use cases.
We recently acquired San Francisco-based company Sense.io. The data scientist workbench allows data scientists to use their favourite program language framework, share libraries and algorithms and roll those into production a lot more efficiently, making the data scientists much more efficient, helping them collaborate, and allowing non-data scientists to benefit from those libraries.
We also acquired Xplain.io, focused on helping customers analyse and optimise where they do their SQL workloads. After we introduced Impala, we wanted to help customers look at analytic workloads and determine which run best on Hadoop and optimise them for Hadoop, so it's really helping customers bring the right analytic workloads to the platforms. Financing from Intel allows us to do this, and we certainly intend to continue these kinds of great acquisitions.
How do you think the big data market has evolved since 2014?
The industry and market has evolved significantly since 2014. In 2014, we spent a lot of time talking about what I called the ‘zoo animals' – all the open source Apache projects, Pig, Scoop, Hive, with a lot of talk around tech. In 2015, Cloudera helped lead the discussion to a much higher-level value proposition.
We introduced the Cloudera data hub, which combined those assets, and we could talk to customers about here's where all those assets fit into your IT landscape. That was a conversation that CIOs got very interested in.
In 2016, it's remarkable how this industry is maturing. The industry fully understands now the notion of data lakes and hubs; now we want to understand what use cases are most impactful for industry. Everyone's talking about high-value business use cases; in fact, I like to talk about what I call boardroom use cases. What is the boardroom use case this platform is addressing, and should it be discussed in the boardroom?
Two years ago, everyone was wondering what Hadoop was good for, and there were varying opinions on how it would be used and whether or not it would go mainstream.
Just a few months ago, Forrester Research published a paper predicting that in two years 100% of large enterprises are going to adopt Apache Hadoop as part of their IT infrastructure. In just two years Hadoop has become a core part of every single large enterprise for data management. I've never seen
an industry mature that fast, and that's incredible.
Is it the same story in Europe?
The European market is our fastest-growing market – I'm amazed at how quick the adoption is here; while it may have happened slightly behind where the US was, it's been incredibly fast. The reason is that a lot of the European customers have been experimenting with the software
and working with it for many years.
Whether in Southern Europe or the Middle East or Central Europe, all across we are seeing great adoption.
With your growing customer base in Europe, do you find they have a lot more concerns over the privacy and security of their sensitive data in the cloud thanks to the upcoming EU GDPR, and if so how are you helping to reassure them?
The use cases are going to be the same, but there's heightened concern around privacy in Europe and data across borders. Our product was designed with core strength of data security, data governance and auditing of data in mind. Those capabilities are much more appreciated and valued in Europe, and of course we are a big data company, capturing data about customers or purchase behaviours, a lot of which is very sensitive – that is why we have a data security platform that goes right down to encryption.
When the first databases were developed in the late 80s and early 90s, Oracle or DB2, there was no such thing as the internet; at best there were wide area networks. So databases were not vulnerable to attack. It was only ten or 15 years later, when the internet emerged, that suddenly databases became vulnerable to attack.
>See also: How big data is changing business innovation
A third-party products cottage industry emerged to protect databases, with third-party role-based access control systems, third-party auditing and third-party encryption. But after this hodgepodge of products, why do we still see databases that are vulnerable to attack? What we've done with Hadoop is developed a modern data store for a connecting world – designing in all the data security features that are needed in a modern database.
Our platform has native authentication, native authorisation, native auditing, native data encryption. Because we are building them natively, customers realised that Hadoop is more secure than databases that had been around for 30 years.
As it's more secure, that's a reason to put data in the platform. In the US, we did a project with MasterCard, requiring us to be PCI certified.
When their auditors inspected the security of our platform they called it the secure data vault – the safest place for data inside MasterCard.
Now their consulting arm is taking the platform to every merchant and institution that handles credit card data and they're recommending that credit card data is stored in our enterprise data hub because of those security features.
If you have sensitive data, you need tight controls over who's allowed access to it and what they're allowed to see, and then you want to audit it and make sure you have full audit trails of who looked at what and where data went. Again, we design those capabilities into our platform. In this modern world, where privacy is concerned we are all leaving tremendous data exhaust, so we want to make sure that it's for positive purposes and not bad purposes.
The killer app for Apache Hadoop is cybersecurity intelligence. Across every industry, but mostly in large government organisations and financial services firms, our platform is being used by cybersecurity teams, in protecting financial accounts, anti-money laundering and counterterrorism. So we are becoming that cybersecurity intelligence platform.
Months after it was rumored to be in the works, Frank Miller has finally broken his silence and officially announced The Dark Knight III: The Master Race, the third and presumably final installment of his Dark Knight series.

I hope that by now my silence is deafening pic.twitter.com/4E0xi4LHju — Frank Miller (@FrankMillerInk) April 24, 2015
Little is known about the new miniseries, which follows the legendary 1986 story The Dark Knight Returns and 2002's controversial The Dark Knight Strikes Again, but Miller will be joined by Brian Azzarello and not Scott Snyder as initially speculated. Azzarello is best known for his runs on Wonder Woman and 100 Bullets, and he also wrote the 2008 graphic novel Joker. No artists have been announced as of yet, but we'll update as we learn more about the project.
The long-awaited 8-issue miniseries will ship bimonthly later this fall, which will come just months before the 30th anniversary of The Dark Knight Returns.
Check out the full press release below:
DC Entertainment announced today that bestselling, iconic Batman writer and artist Frank Miller will write the epic conclusion of the celebrated THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS saga. The “THE DARK KNIGHT III: THE MASTER RACE” is the sequel to Miller's 1986 classic THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS – heralded by TIME Magazine as one of the 10 greatest graphic novels of all time – and its 2001-2002 follow-up series BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN. Miller will be joined by acclaimed writer Brian Azzarello (100 BULLETS, JOKER, and WONDER WOMAN) on the eight-issue comic book periodical, to be published twice a month under the DC Comics imprint. Marking the 30th anniversary of THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS original series, this periodical is slated for publication beginning in late Fall 2015. “Batman remains my favorite comic book hero and a sequel to Dark Knight is going to be daunting,” said Miller, “but we'll do our best.” “We are thrilled to have Frank back home at DC writing Batman,” according to Dan DiDio and Jim Lee, Co-Publishers for DC Entertainment. “The story he and Brian have crafted is an astounding and triumphant conclusion to this seminal body of work which influenced and shaped generations of readers and creators alike.” According to Azzarello, “It's been an amazing experience collaborating with Frank these past six months. I think we have an epic story that these characters truly deserve.” Artists for the project have yet to be announced.
UPDATE: Based on the Twitter Q&A Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo participated in, it seems that Snyder may be involved in some capacity as originally reported:
@DCComics @Ssnyder1835 Rumours said you were going to be involved with upcoming Miller DK sequel, was that ever true #BatmanChat — PortlandsBatman (@PortlandsBatman) May 1, 2015
Nothing thing else was revealed beyond that, but it's definitely interesting. As always, we'll keep you posted as new information arises.

BOSTON — Lawyers for Bill Cosby said Friday they will fight an attempt to require his wife to give a sworn deposition in a defamation lawsuit filed by seven women who accuse the comedian of sexually assaulting them decades ago.
A lawyer for the women has subpoenaed Camille Cosby to be deposed on Jan. 6. at a hotel in Springfield, Massachusetts.
But Cosby's lawyers filed a motion Friday to quash the subpoena, saying she has no firsthand, non-repetitive knowledge of issues in the lawsuit. They also argue that any confidential communications between Cosby and his wife are protected by the Massachusetts spousal disqualification rule.
The women's lawyer, Joseph Cammarata, had argued that he should be able to question Camille Cosby because she was her husband's business manager.
"I think she has information that's relevant to the litigation in this matter," Cammarata said Friday.
Cosby's lawyers said Camille Cosby does not have any information about the accuracy of the women's allegations. They also allege that the attempt to subject her to a deposition is "nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to pressure defendant in the face of subjecting his wife to the shame and embarrassment of responding to questions about his alleged infidelities and sexual misconduct."
The seven women suing Cosby for defamation in federal court in Springfield are among approximately 50 women who have come forward over the last year alleging that he sexually assaulted or had unwanted sexual contact with them decades ago. They claim in their suit that Cosby allowed his representatives to portray them as liars after they went public with their allegations.
Cosby, 78, filed a countersuit against the women earlier this week, accusing them of making false allegations of sexual misconduct for financial gain. He said the women have "engaged in a campaign to assassinate" his reputation and character.
Both men have faced criticism from those who call them zealots. The F.D.A. is about to examine data suggesting that Avandia might not be so dangerous after all. Some critics say Dr. Butler overstates his conclusions and that his findings have not been replicated by others.
“Basically, no one in the entire world over the last 10 years, with thousands of animals,” has found what Dr. Butler found, said Dr. Daniel J. Drucker, a professor of medicine at the University of Toronto and a consultant to many drug companies.
Still, Dr. Butler is not easy to write off. He is a former editor of Diabetes, the flagship journal of the American Diabetes Association. And he has some defenders.
“He should be an American hero, actually, a rugged individualist who is not going to be browbeaten,” said Dr. Edwin Gale, professor emeritus at the University of Bristol in Britain, who recently wrote a commentary with Dr. Butler on the drugs.
Dr. Butler was born in Kenya to British parents, though he has worked in the United States since 1987 and is an American citizen. His wife, Dr. Alexandra E. Butler, a pathologist who occupies the office next to his, has also worked on some of the studies.
In the last month, lawyers defending drug companies against a lawsuit claiming that Byetta had caused a patient's pancreatitis, subpoenaed virtually all of Dr. Butler's records.
“I think the message here is they want him out of business,” said Brian Depew, a lawyer representing the plaintiff, Ross Hubert of New Hampshire, who claims that Byetta caused him to get pancreatitis. Dr. Butler said U.C.L.A. told him not to comment on the subpoena.
There are many problems in the Catholic Church that might be thought to be the ‘smoke of Satan' entering the church, but for my money one thing, above all others, has been the successful work of Satan, which has undermined the church, emasculated her ministry, sabotaged the aims of the Holy Spirit and captured a multitude of souls.
It is the modernist re-interpretation of the Catholic faith. The reductionist results of modern Biblical scholarship and the infiltration of a modernist, rationalistic and materialistic mindset meant that the supernatural was assumed to be impossible, and therefore the Bible stories (and also any supernatural elements of the faith) had to be ‘de-mythologized.' Everything supernatural within the Biblical account and within the lives of the saints and within the teaching of the church were assumed to be impossible and had to be ‘re-interpreted' so they would make sense to modern, scientifically minded people.
So the feeding of the five thousand wasn't a miracle. Instead the ‘real miracle' was that everyone shared their lunch. Everything had to be questioned and ‘re-interpreted' in such a way that it could be accepted and understood by modern people. So when we call Jesus Christ “God Incarnate” what we really mean was that he was so fully human, and that as he reached his potential as a man that he shows us what divinity looks like. When we speak of the Blessed Virgin we mean she was ‘a very good and holy Jewish young woman.' When we speak of the ‘Real Presence' we mean that we see the ‘Christ that is within each one of us.”
I hate this crap.
It's the smoke of Satan, and it's virtually triumphant within the mainstream Protestant churches, and sadly, the modern Catholic Church in the USA is riddled through with the same noxious heresy. The reason it is so obnoxious and disgusting is because priests and clergy of all sorts still use all the traditional language of the liturgy, the Scriptures and the creeds, but they have changed the meaning of it altogether. They never actually stand up and say that they have changed the meaning, and that they no longer believe the faith once delivered to the saints. They don't discuss the fact that they have not only changed the meaning, but robbed it of meaning altogether. Instead they still stand up week by week and recite the creed as if they think it is true, but what they mean by ‘true' is totally different from what their people mean.
So Father Flannel stands up on Easter Day and says, “Alleluia! Today we rejoice in the glorious resurrection of Our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead.” His people think he really believes that Jesus' dead body came back to life by the power of God and that he went on to live forever. In fact what Father Flannel really means is that “in some way the beautiful teachings of Jesus were remembered and continued by his followers long after his tragic death.” The people don't know why Father Flannel's Catholic life is so lightweight and limp and they don't know why his style is so lacking in substance, and they go on in their muddled way thinking that he really does believe the Catholic faith when, in fact, he doesn't at all.
Consequently, Fr Flannel doesn't really have much of a message at all. He doesn't believe any of the gospel except as some sort of beautiful story which inspires people to be nicer to each other. All that is left of his priesthood, therefore, is to be a nice guy to entertain people with inspirational thoughts and get everyone to be nicer to one another and try to save the planet.
The poor faithful have swallowed this stuff for two or three generations now, and they don't even know what poison they're swallowing because the lies are all dressed up in the same traditional language the church has always used. It's like someone has put battery acid into a milk bottle and given it to a baby, and never imagined that there was anything wrong with doing so–indeed thought it was the best thing for baby.
The faithful don't know why their church has become like a cross between a Joan Baez concert and a political activism meeting. They don't understand why they never hear the need for confession or repentance or hear about old fashioned terms like ‘the precious blood' or ‘ the body, blood, soul and divinity of Our Lord and Savior” The fact of the matter is Father Flannel doesn't really think that sort of thing is ‘helpful'.
This is why evangelization of the American Catholics in the pew is probably the most difficult task of all. They don't know what they don't know. For three generations now they have been given watered down milk and been told it was wine. They actually think that Catholic lite is what it's all about, and are astounded to think that there are some of us who think that they have actually been fed a version of Christianity that is scarcely Christianity at all.

Silver Shortage Pre Panic Trend Line, 21st Century Bull Market Junctures
For years we have heard of the coming silver shortage but somehow price was always contained and was a wild swinging commodity. But that changed last spring when allegations of silver manipulation made it to mainstream internet sites and became a focal point of testimony by Bill Murphy of GATA to the CFTC in early spring.
Since last August the silver market has been on a tear to the upside and the physical market is now again facing reported shortages. The demand for coin is at its highest levels in 25 years as reported by coin dealers.
Once silver broke above $20 dollars there was a triple demand factor that came into play.The first is the industry that uses silver. It's made a mad dash to the buy line to secure supplies. No user in his right mind is going to stick around and wait for the shortage to become acute and hold up production. That is a showstopper and industrial use is the largest demand factor in the fabrication of silver. I was informed by a person who was building a database for a company in late October that the company she was doing business for was in panic mode buying up to a year's worth of silver so as to hedge for future price increases. She did not even work there and was providing a service for the business. She said that the talk was rampant among the executives.Consider what Ted Butler, http://www.butlerresearch.com/ who was way ahead of the curve wrote in 2006World silver inventories are at the lowest point in 200 years. Industry requires over 900 million ounces each year. Silver is the best conductor of electricity. Every computer, server, monitor, cell phone and switch must have silver. Lasers, satellites, high-tech weaponry and robotics, all require silver. Digital technology and telecommunications need silver. Around the house there's silver in every TV, washing machine, wall switch and refrigerator. Conductors, switches, contracts and fuses use silver because it does not corrode or cause overheating and fires. Silver is used heavily in photography and in prints. Meanwhile, new and exotic uses for silver are expanding.A new double layer of silver on glass is sweeping the window market, as it reflects away almost 95% of the hot rays of the sun. A new electronic application for "smart tags" that are replacing bar codes could use significant quantities of silver.Silver achieves the most brilliant polish of any metal and is the best reflector of light, allowing it to be used in mirrors and in coatings for glass, cellophane or metals. Chemical reactions can be significantly increased by adding silver. Approximately 700 tons of silver are in continuous use in the world's chemical industry for the production of plastics.Batteries are now manufactured with silver alloys. Lead-free silver solder is used heavily for joining materials and producing leak-tight joints. Silver is also widely used in silk-screened circuit paths, membrane switches, electrically heated automobile windows, and adhesives. Silver has a variety of uses in pharmaceuticals. Silver sulfadiazine is the most powerful compound for burn treatment. Catheters impregnated with silver eliminate bacteria. Silver is increasingly being tapped for its bactericidal properties and water purification. In the face of all these industrial uses there is less silver available.Here we have a vital material, known to all men for all time, literally disappearing before our eyes, both above and below ground. It is a material upon which modern life and rising standards of living are dependent. It is beyond indispensable, it is a miracle metal.The second factor that is coming into play is the loss of confidence in paper money and the realization by many that silver is not only an industrial metal but was a monetary metal.Silver has been around for just as long -- if not longer --- than gold. It was currency in the past --- and who is to say it will not be currency in the future? Indeed -- gold bugs who favor a return to the gold standard -- would stand a better chance if they were pushing a bimetallic system of both gold and silver. At least there would be more "currency" to go around. As nations that look to establish the former glory -- it might not be beyond the realm of China to go that route.Silver Sycee in one form or another was a means of exchange in China for over 1000 years. In fact -- a quick history of money is simply -- barter -- livestock/Crops -- cowry shells (tools) -- silver -- leather banknotes (deer skin) -- paper currency (first introduced by China 9th to 15th Century) -- potlatch -& wampum (north American Indians)--- gold standard -- paper currency. So if we exit paper currency --- there are only two choices on the above list --- silver and gold. And silver has been used more times and more places than gold has.Silver certificates we're re-issued by the Kennedy Administration in the USA and were in fact redeemable in silver until June of 1968. So the thinking that silver can't come back as a monetary instrument is not impossible. In fact -- what will be the alternative to gold and silver? Nothing. Black market or not -- gold and silver will always have their place.The second factor influencing silver is the loss of confidence in paper currency and the public awareness that is fast becoming a major factor in PHYSICAL DEMAND. Consider the following from http://news.coinupdate.com/us-mint-bullion-sales-silver-eagles-achieve-new-record-0557/
Finally the third factor that comes into play is the massive amount of short positions that have been sold forward by the manipulators of silver. According to the latest statistics there are 154 days of silver production that is currently sold short. As prices rise the shorts have only two choices. Sell more contracts short – or cover the positions. Each drop in silver since the summer has not been met with new short positions. It has been met with short covering. This triple whammy is turning the supply side equation and demand into a runaway freight train.
Silver price points
The chart below uses the silver ETF (SLV) and currently trades about 60 cents below the price of spot silver. The current price point in silver is reaching the major resistance line that was touched during the first week of November. After a $4 dollar correction to $25, silver has rebounded once again to the $29 dollar area. This line is certainly important resistance on the price charts and from a technical perspective certainly should be respected. But the short positions remain very high and the demand is increasing. If investor demand for physical continues and price moves above the 30-31 dollar area it could produce another bout of panic buying. If that were to occur the next target for silver will be the pre shortage panic line in the $35 dollar range.
There are many technical indicators that can be employed in analysis. The use of channel lines is perhaps the least arbitrary for the simple reason that the markets outer symmetry of price action dictates where the channel lines get employed. Granted humans still draw the channel lines but when done correctly, they provide a great tool for where price resistance comes in. Notice how well the lines have established price points of resistance during this bull market.
What next?
Why do I call the line of resistance on the above chart the Pre-shortage panic line?
Let's take a look at another silver chart. In this view using the world silver index we can see that the resistance line that was hit in November is by far the most important resistance line for the simple fact that it has contained all silver spikes during this bull market. The 2004, 2006, 2008 and now the 2010 high have one thing in common, the blue resistance line.
This slope represents the markets own maximum growth pattern. Each past high was curtailed by this slope. If there is a shortage then there is a possible buy panic that will exceed this long term resistance line and suppliers will have to bid price up to the silver to deliver what they have committed to and the short positions will have to eventually buy back in to cover their short position.
There is no doubt that this area certainly could provide the area where a price peak could once again come into play. However, the difference this time is that suppression schemes have been brought to the open and if the shorts can't stop the demand coming in – they will have no choice but to try and cover their positions. It is this potential that could propel price higher. Just as there was a mad rush into silver when the breakout line on the chart was exceeded, a move above this blue line could provoke even more buying by those who follow technical price patterns.
Channel lines can be used on all time frames. The Rally from August is displayed below on a daily chart.
It seems the long term fundamental factors have finally combined to produce a dramatic rally in silver. If these trends continue the price channels will be an excellent guide as to the standard deviation that occurs in price parameters and where important price turns might occur. Many have stated that technical indicators don't work in a bull market. I can't disagree. But I still think that price channels do for the simple reason that they are the markets own symmetry of price parameters.
We are now at the next juncture in the 21st Century Silver Bull market. Do you know where your trend line and potential price turn points are?
At our website, we monitor the silver price pattern on an hourly, daily, weekly and monthly chart basis. And we offer commentary on what we think it all means for price, along with support and resistance levels for each day. We also follow the gold market extensively and are just as passionate about it.

Tomorrow, American Muslims for Palestine is launching a new nationwide outdoor advertising campaign (see above) that will begin in 25 stations on the Metro North train line near New York City. The ad will run for four weeks before moving to other cities around the country.
The organization explains in a press release:
“We timed the release of our ads with President Obama's visit to the Middle East to underscore his administration's failure to address the true cause of conflict: Israel's occupation of Palestinian lands and its racist apartheid policies, which subject Palestinians on a daily basis to humiliation, deprivation and a loss of their basic rights, including the freedom of movement,” said Dr. Hatem Bazian, AMP chairman. . .
Each year, the US gives Israel more than $3 billion in unconditional military aid. Even with this year's sequestration cut, Israel will receive that amount and more, when all grants, loan guarantees and other aid are taken into account. AMP asserts that our financial support, as well as our unconditional political and diplomatic support of Israel, in light of its continued and flagrant violations of international law, weaken America's position throughout the international community and hurts our national interests.
Apartheid runs counter to every principle Americans hold dear. Israel's military occupation violates the values of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness enshrined in our own Declaration of Independence.
Therefore, AMP is calling on President Obama and Congress to end US aid to Israel, which only enables and supports Israel's occupation and apartheid policies against oppressed Palestinians.
Copy and paste, data tethering , and now Flash -- it looks like the Pre's going to fill in a lot of unchecked iPhone feature boxes, doesn't it? Yep, Palm's just joined Adobe's Open Screen Project, and there's no two bones about what that means: the press release flat out says "the Open Screen Project will help deliver Adobe Flash Player for smartphones on the new Palm webOS platform." That's especially interesting since the webOS SDK is so heavily based on web technologies and native player support potentially opens the door for Flash-based apps, which would instantly bring a ton of new devs to the Pre. That's not a bad thing. We'll find out more at the end of the year, when the mobile Flash player is due to arrive.
Michigan Sees 10 Percent Increase in Traffic Fatalities in 2015
Melody Kindraka, Michigan Office of Highway Safety Planning, kindrakam@michigan.gov, 517-284-3071
May 9, 2016
Michigan traffic deaths, which had been trending downward, jumped 10 percent last year, up from 876 in 2014 to 963 in 2015, according to just-released information from the Michigan State Police Criminal Justice Information Center. Alcohol-involved, bicyclist, teen, and motorcyclist traffic deaths were all up more than 20 percent.
“Now that the crash data for 2015 is finalized, the next step is to work with our partners at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute to identify factors that may have played a role in these increases,” said Michael L. Prince, Michigan Office of Highway Safety Planning director. “There are a lot of socio/economic and environmental variables that can affect these numbers, including the economy, gas prices, changes in travel habits, weather, as well as driver behavior.”
Michigan Traffic Crashes 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 Total Crashes 297,023 298,699 289,061 273,891 284,049 Total Injuries 74,157 71,378 71,031 70,519 71,796 Total Fatalities 963 876 951 936 889
The largest increase was among bicyclist fatalities, up 57 percent from 21 in 2014 to 33 in 2015.
Other significant increases were noted among motorcyclists and alcohol-involved traffic deaths. Motorcyclist fatalities were up 29 percent, from 107 in 2014 to138 in 2015. Alcohol-involved fatalities were up 28 percent, from 236 in 2014 to 303 in 2015. Drug-involved fatal crashes spiked 19 percent, up from 150 in 2014 to 179 in 2015. And teen traffic deaths (ages 13-19) were up 23 percent, from 80 in 2014 to 98 in 2015.
Despite increase in nearly all areas, commercial motor vehicle-involved fatalities dropped 19 percent, down from 105 in 2014 to 85 in 2015.
In other areas:
Pedestrian fatalities increased 15 percent, from 148 in 2014 to 170 in 2015.

Many of the sites were still down 20 hours after the Portuguese branch of the group claimed the cyber-attack in a post on its Facebook page.
Prominent rapper Luaty Beirao and 16 others were convicted on Monday of planning a rebellion against Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.

The activists say they are peaceful campaigners and have called on the veteran leader to step down.
They received jail sentences of between two and eight years.
They were arrested in June after discussing a book about non-violent resistance at their book club.
Beirao, also known by his stage name Ikonoklasta, has been an outspoken critic of the government, calling for a fairer distribution of the former Portuguese colony's oil wealth.

UPDATE…read here: populartechnology.net/skeptics-smeared-as-holocaust-deniers.html
—————————————————-
Many of us were shocked at hearing the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) had sharply criticized University of Alabama climate scientist Dr. Roy Spencer because he finally decided to defend himself against the constant stream of Holocaust-laced slurs and abuse that had been thrown his way by rabid global warming activists over years. The reason for the continuous string of slurs and insults? The leading climatologist disagreed with alarmist climate science. His scientific opinions were different.
So why is the ADL focusing only on Spencer's harsh choice of words and totally ignoring the years of Holocaust-laden “denier” slurs and analogies that have been fired regularly at skeptic scientists and journalists? We can only speculate that they have been sleeping on the job.
What follows are just a few examples of the hate and defamation that skeptics (people with a different opinion) have been the target of.
In 2006 Grist Magazine's David Roberts called for Nuremberg-style trials for the “bastards” of the global warming “denial industry.” Professor Roger Pielke Jr. responded on October 9, 2006: “Let's be blunt. This allusion is an affront to those who suffered and died in the Holocaust. This allusion has no place in the discourse on climate change.” He's right and surely the ADL agrees.
How can anyone equate disagreement on climate science to denying the Holocaust? Roberts thinks that denying the Holocaust is equal to denying his climate science? To me this is a diminishment of the Holocaust of the nastiest sort.
Former NASA GISS director and global warming activist James Hansen accused skeptics of global warming scientists of committing “a crime against humanity”, a label used to describe atrocities like genocide or the Nazi Holocaust. Hansen even equated coal wagons to rail cars that transported Jews to concentration camps. How sickening can you get? Why was there not a peep from the ADL?
Yet another extremely deplorable example of intolerance and intellectual arrogance occurred just 15 months ago when University of Graz music professor Robert Parncutt openly called for the death penalty for climate skeptics, a clear defamation of people who simply have a different view of climate science. Parncutt portrayed skeptics as criminals so heinous that they deserved to die. Where was the ADL?
Yesterday Marc Morano at his Climate Depot reminded us of the disturbingly twisted final-solution-type fantasies greenshirt zealots have for climate science skeptics. NYU bioethicist S. Matthew Liao, who thinks skepticism in climate science is a mental illness. ‘If you can give something like oxytocin to people, then maybe they'll be more willing to cooperate, to care more about the environment'. This reminds of how Alan Turing‘s homosexuality was viewed in a similarly appalling way. For his “deviance”, Turing was chemically castrated by the British government and became so depressed that he was driven to suicide. At the time 97% of experts said homosexuality was deviant.
Morano offers other examples of systematic defamation and criminalization of alternative scientific thought.
Far worse and disturbing, however, is that global warming zealots openly express their violent fantasies of dehumanizing, criminalizing and blowing skeptics into bloody bits and pieces. Where is the ADL? From which regimes have we seen such a level of arrogance and intolerance in the past?
Image cropped from 10:10 – No Pressure clip.
Last spring, the German government even went so far as to issue a 123-page brochure that singled out and named US and German skeptic scientists and journalists, and warned the German public not to listen to them. German journalist Henryk Broder, who himself is Jewish, found the German policy so shocking that it reminded him of the Reichskulturkammer, a Nazi agency charged with making sure German art remained “pure”. Even Jewish intellectuals like Broder are ringing the alarm bells. Where's the ADL?
So precisely what ingredients are needed to cook up an atrocity, like those fantasized in the 10:10 No Pressure video? In the 1973 Ascent of Man series scientist Jacob Bronowski provides the answer: arrogance and dogma.
That deliberate deafness to suffering has become the monster in the war machine. […] The assertion of dogma that closes the mind and turns a nation, a civilization into a regiment of ghosts, of obedient ghosts, or of tortured ghosts. […] This is where people were turned into numbers. Into this pond were flushed the ashes of some 4 million people. And that was not done by gas. It was done by arrogance. It was done by dogma. It was done by ignorance. When people believe that they have absolute knowledge with no test in reality, this is how they behave. This is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods […] Every judgement in science stands on the edge of error, and is personal.”
It is the belief of having absolute knowledge and being the keeper of the truth that turns one into a dangerous menace. Bronowski aptly quotes Oliver Cromwell:
I beseech you from the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.”
This is what skeptics are pleading – and for this they are being criminalized and defamed.
Ironically many of the skeptics being attacked and labeled deniers are Jews themselves: Fred Singer (who actually fled the Nazis), Richard Lindzen, Nir Shaviv, Benny Peiser, to name four off the top of my head. I wonder what they think of the ADL's one-sided attack on Dr Spencer. My guess is that they are appalled by the ADL's blindness and poorly judged move.
Bronowski ends with the moving images of him scooping the remains from a pond, where he pleads:
We have to touch people.”
Touch people…and not blow them up to bits and pieces.
Ted Cruz notched another delegate landslide Saturday, stretching his advantage in a competition that might never occur: the second ballot of a contested Republican National Convention in July.
Cruz won at least 65 of the 94 delegates up for grabs Saturday (he may have won more than 65, but Kentucky's 25 delegates haven't revealed their leanings). The Texas senator has so thoroughly dominated the fight to send loyalists to the national convention that if front-runner Donald Trump fails to clinch the nomination on the first ballot, Cruz is well-positioned to surpass him — and perhaps even snag the nomination for himself — when delegates are free in subsequent convention rounds to vote for whomever they want.
Story Continued Below
On Saturday, he nearly won 19 of 20 seats available in Maine, losing just one to a Trump backer: Gov. Paul LePage. He also won all nine delegates on the ballot in three Minnesota congressional districts, picking up support in the lone state won by Marco Rubio. Cruz also grabbed one of three delegates in South Carolina's 6th Congressional District, while the other two went to an uncommitted delegate and a supporter of Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
Cruz's biggest windfall, though, came from Utah, where at least 36 of 37 national delegates will be aligned with Cruz, who crushed Trump in the state's caucuses on March 22. Included in the Utah delegation: Sen. Mike Lee, Gov. Gary Herbert and Reps. Mike Bishop and Mia Love. Only Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, the 37th delegate, is a wild card — he hasn't revealed who he supports.
But Cruz's dominance may be for nothing. Trump's dominant victory in New York last week, along with expected victories across the Northeast on Tuesday, put him on the cusp of earning the nomination without any convention drama in Cleveland. On the first ballot, most delegates are required to vote according to the results of state primaries and caucuses, and that's where Trump has a wide edge — 845 to Cruz's 559.
If Trump can dominate the remaining 15 primaries and acquire mandatory support from 1,237 delegates, he'll secure the nomination automatically. And polls show he has an edge in Indiana's crucial May 3 primary, where 57 delegates will be apportioned, and that he's pulling away in California — the biggest prize of the entire primary season — where 172 delegates will be assigned in a June 7 primary.
In the meantime, Cruz has owned the secondary battle to elect loyalists to the convention and can only work to limit Trump's gains over the next six weeks of primaries. Republican activists who tend to run to become delegates and vote in those obscure contests are typically more aligned with Cruz.
Kentucky, where Trump narrowly edged Cruz in a March 5 caucus, was the only delegate wild card on the day. Party insiders who control the delegate process there unveiled a slate of 25 delegates headlined by newly elected Gov. Matt Bevin, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Rand Paul. At the Kentucky state GOP convention Saturday, the slate was approved overwhelmingly by the nearly 500 attendees.
McConnell and Paul have been critical of Trump, but the remainder of the delegation, according to sources familiar with the list, wasn't vetted based on candidate support. Instead, it featured a long list of party veterans picked based on their work for the Kentucky GOP over the years. It's unclear which way the delegation will lean if the convention becomes a floor fight.
“Our process for delegates is not candidate-focused. It never has been,” said Steve Robertson, former chairman of the Kentucky GOP and one of the 25 delegates selected.
A coal mine in Grande Cache is bankrupt, delivering another setback to the town northwest of Edmonton that once relied heavily on the steelmaking coal producer as its economic engine.
Grande Cache Coal has attempted to calm fears at the municipality — which is dealing with shrinking tax revenues as residents leave and businesses shutter — with assurances the mine will reopen this summer.
“Grande Cache's legacy is the coal mine; it will always be the coal mine,” said Yvonne Rempel, a town councillor. “Is our community still struggling? Absolutely, but it's also the downturn in the economy…
“As council, we're doing our best to stabilize what we already have and continue to work with industry and see what we can do to move things forward.”
Grande Cache Coal declined to comment, but the company sent a letter to the town warning it was heading into receivership, which would allow it to restructure, and that the mine would reopen in July.
According to court documents, financial lenders forced the company into bankruptcy last week. The mine is owned by Chinese coal producer Up Energy Development Group Ltd., which defaulted on debt payments in 2016, having owed hundreds of millions of dollars.
“At a time when Up Energy was paying huge interest costs (on its debt), they were getting very little return on the coal sales,” due to slumping prices, said Gary Taje, spokesman for United Mine Workers of America which represents Grande Cache miners.
Related
Taje said a court-appointed receiver will put the Alberta mining assets up for sale. He believes the company will be cheaper to buy because some of its debt will be written down during the bankruptcy.
“There is a very good opportunity for this mine to be open by summer,” he said.
The mine has been shuttered since 2015, when the company dealt with a collapsed global market for steelmaking coal. It had been the town's biggest employer, with 500 union members working a year before the closure.
The shutdown, combined with a broader economic downturn, delivered a major blow to the town, which now relies on Grande Cache Institution, a medium-security prison, as its top employer.
“We've seen some people move out of the community; housing prices have declined,” Rempel said, adding she expects the total value of real estate is sliding, putting a major dent in the town's budget. “We also have some businesses closing.”
Facing a dwindling tax base, the town asked the provincial government last year to assess its viability and explore whether it should be absorbed into the Municipal District of Greenview.
The town had earlier asked Greenview for $11.5 million annually, which would have meant the municipal district would contribute 80 per cent of the town's budget, raising concerns it is not viable on its own.
The review is expected to begin this spring as a team of municipal and provincial government officials “develop recommendations for Grande Cache's future,” according to Alberta Municipal Affairs.
In the meantime, town residents have been dealing with disappointments surrounding the coal mine. Grande Cache Coal announced in November it had planned to resume mining operations in the first three months of 2017, pending shareholder approval and negotiation of important contracts.
Bankruptcy proceedings have crippled those plans, at least for now.
“As council, we'll do our best to help Grande Cache Coal in any way possible to get the mine up and running,” Rempel said.
“At the same time, as a town we're always looking at our alternatives, at what else we can do to maintain our economy to get us through this rough patch.”

Senior Indonesian officials have taken part in an unprecedented meeting to discuss the killing of 500,000 communists and their supporters during an insurgency 50 years ago.
Security Minister Luhut Panjaitan said the country must make peace with its past, but ruled out an official apology.
The meeting brought together victims and members of the security forces.
The massacre began in 1965 after an apparent coup blamed on the communists.
Conference organiser Agus Widjojo, a retired general, said at the meeting that the killings had "torn apart" Indonesia and called for the government to establish a commission for truth and reconciliation.
Indonesia's darkest hour
Mass killing commemorations cancelled

"Let's open this history together so we can all find out what has been wrong in our national system, why this nation could have the ability to commit mass killings," he said.
Mr Widjojo's father was among six right-wing generals whose assassinations during the abortive coup were blamed on Indonesia's Communist Party.
In the bloodshed that followed, researchers say the military and religious groups killed half a million people as the former dictator Suharto rose to power.
Suspected Communist Party members and sympathisers were hunted down, tortured and killed in one of the worst massacres of the 20th Century.

In 1966, President Sukarno was forced to hand emergency powers to Gen Suharto, who took over as president the following year, ruling Indonesia for 31 years
More from the BBC's Witness programme
About 100,000 more suffered years of imprisonment without trial or exile in remote corners of Indonesia because of a tenuous connection to the Communist Party.
During his 32-year rule, Suharto depicted the communists as a threat to bolster his own authoritarian hold on power.
Descendants of Communist Party members are still discriminated against and are banned from holding government jobs, despite calls from rights groups to end the practice.

There were scuffles between police and protesters outside the Jakarta Hotel where the conference is taking place. The protesters fear it could help revive communism in the country.
However, the conference is being supported by government figures and was attended by Indonesia's attorney general, police chief and justice minister.
After his election in 2014, Indonesian President Joko Widodo promised a state-sponsored inquiry into the killings.
A US role
Rights groups have also called on the US to release its secret files on the killings.
At the time, the US saw Indonesia as an important part of efforts to counter the influence of the Soviet Union and China in South-East Asia.
Documents held in the National Security Archive of George Washington University show the US embassy in Jakarta was aware of some of the killings, AP news agency reported.
The embassy also passed lists of communists it had compiled to Indonesia's military, supplied Indonesia's military with radios and secretly gave money to a military-linked group involved in the repression, AP added.
A Toyota Fuel Cell Concept Vehicle Is Displayed During Press Event At The Mandalay Bay Convention Center For The 2014 International CES On January 6, 2014 In Las Vegas, Nevada. Agence France Presse Toyota said Monday it plans to launch a fuel-cell car in the United States next year, declaring the hydrogen vehicle with zero emissions "the car of the future."
Toyota Motor Sales vice president Bob Carter said the initial market will be California, together with an initiative to establish hydrogen refueling stations in key regions of the state.
"In 2015, we will bring this car to market," Carter said in the announcement at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
The vehicle, yet to be named, would be a "zero-emission, electric-drive, mid-size, four-door sedan."
"Functionally, this is a regular car," he added.
The streamlined design is to maximize oxygen intake for the fuel-cell process. It will be able to travel 300 miles (480 kilometers) on a single fueling, which would take three to five minutes.
While carmakers have long touted the advantages of fuel cells, high production costs and a lack of fuel stations have held back the technology.
Carter said however that Toyota had been getting results from its major investments and added that "we believe we can bring it in at a very reasonable price for a lot of people."
Government initiatives in California were making progress in getting hydrogen fueling stations in needed areas, he added.
"The issue of infrastructure is not so much about how many, but rather location, location, location," he said.
"Fuel cells will be in our future sooner than many people believe... and in much greater numbers than anyone expected."
Toyota unveiled a prototype last year at the Tokyo auto show, but on Monday offered more details for its plans for the US market.
Honda is also expected to roll out a fuel-cell car in the US market in 2015, and other automakers are working on the technology, which emits only water vapor as exhaust.
Honda already has a fuel-cell car, the FCX Clarity, available on a small scale in a limited number of markets.
Carter said that Toyota and California officials plan to add 20 new fuel stations by 2015 to the 10 existing ones. The goal is to have about 100 in the state, and to have a station within a six-minute drive of an owner's home or business.
"This infrastructure thing is going to happen," he said.
"I believe this vehicle will be the car of the future."
It is expected to launch in Japan at about the same time.
Literate API Testing with Dredd
I've just started my latest project at MIT, and I'm quite excited about a new piece of technology that the team uses: apiary.io.
With Apiary, we generate a simple blueprint file (source, output) which is a full description of your API. This shows off requests and responses with a bit of prose. It's all in markdown file and is very simple to get started. There is a tool called Protagonist which will parse this into a big JSON blob.
One consumer of this giant JSON blob is a tool called Dredd, which has bindings for multiple languages (including Python). This will issue the request in your apiary file to the endpoint described, and validate the the result is similar in structure to the one you described in your documentation. There are also facilities for setting up fixture data before each of the things run. You can see an example of those here.
The result of this bit of work, is you have a tool that can run on your continuous integration server which validates that your API documentation maps up to the actual implementation. Neat!
As a teaser for what I hope is to come, there's no real reason that you shouldn't also be able to build full API clients based on the output from Protagonist. The lead developer indicated they're working on something here. Stay tuned!
Doktor Sewage, Digestor, Kristina S., and Avinash Mittur play the Ghoul “Dungeon Bastards” boardgame.
Photo by Jehn Mikalacki-Sublett
…
When bands take the time to build a mythology around their music, the results can be fun. Take Ghoul and their fictional world Creepsylvania. They're a monstrously fun band to watch, and a genuinely banging act to listen to as well. Soon, however, they're expanding their band mythology into gaming.
When I heard Ghoul was including an original board game with their first full-length in five years, Dungeon Bastards, I knew I had to play a round as soon as I could. The premise for the game, also called Dungeon Bastards, sounded simple on paper: Players take turns advancing through a Creepsylvanian map via six-sided dice rolls, and the first one to get to end of the map and jump the Wall of Death wins.
I contacted guitarist/vocalist Digestor to see if we could get together to play a round and he not only obliged my request, he even put me in touch with the game's co-designer Doktor Ross Sewage (Impaled, Exhumed). Digestor and the good Doktor were kind enough to chat about the game and the current state of Creepsylvania, and where the underground cannibals in Ghoul seem to fit in it all.

Digestor, where did the idea to have a board game included with the new album come from?
Digestor: I think we wanted to have something connected to the album that would make people pay less attention to the music. So you open the album, put in on your record player or whatever and there's a board game there for you to distract from the mistakes and shittiness.
So how did you come to hire Doktor Sewage for the game design?
D: We found him wandering around in a graveyard, looking at a map. He looked like he was lost. He was wearing a backpack, a goofy jacket and looked like a tourist. We just grabbed him and pulled him down to the catacombs. He had a backpack full of art supplies, a French curve and a compass.
Ross, when you start off with absolutely nothing as you did here, what is the first step in designing a board game?
Ross: Well, I had to first clean my shorts after being kidnapped by Ghoul and being dragged down into their dungeon lair. After cleaning my shorts, they sat me down on a rudimentary desk made of bones and plywood. It's one of those situations in art where you get down to the deadline but unlike normal deadlines, this time I'd actually be dead if I didn't finish.
D: Definitely would be dead.
R: So I had to kind of piece together what I knew, and I figured Candyland would be a good start. “Hey, I know that game works for three- to four-year-olds and these guys have the mental capacity of three- to four year-olds,” so it seemed like a good place to go.
In what ways did you try to incorporate Ghoul's real-life adventures into the game?
R: They had a bunch of Creepsylvanian newspapers that they threw in front of me, so there was a bit of studying. They said, “Look, Creepsylvania's pretty fucked up, we're pretty fucked up, so just read about this shit.” They spun some wild tales I could hardly believe about killer robots, proto-human monkey men, voodoo priests and I thought it was a load of bullshit until a voodoo priest came in and walked through the room naked after getting out of a shower. His huge dong was hanging out, that was the most frightening thing I saw while I was down there.
D: A huge, rotten dong.
R: It was enormous. He flopped it down on the table. So he actually laid out the path of the board game with his dick.
D: Some of that is just because the internal structure of his dong has rotted away so much that it's just hanging. It's all skinny and stretched out, but it's really big. Like halfway down to his knees.
R: I just threw the French curve away and I traced the dong.
D: Who needs a French curve at that point?
Well, for a game based on Candyland, there seem to be quite a few more rules than I'd expect.
R: We had to come up with some rules because these guys would keep jumping to the end. “Guys, you have to actually roll dice for this to be a game,” and it would be, “No, I win,” and they'd punch me in the face. “Okay, you won the fight but if you want this to be fun for a bunch of heavy metal kids, we're going to have to put some rules in place.” Heavy metal kids love to follow rules like, only wear band logos of bands that aren't playing that night and you have to wear camo shorts cut off, not hemmed. I figured they'd love having more rules like that!
D: In Creepsylvania we have a game like this called “Ivan Must Evade the Pederast,” you definitely want to get to the end of that one. You don't want to deal with all that mess, you just want to get it over with.
How many revisions did it take for you to get to the final game?
R: Other than just revising on my own just thinking about things, we had some members of Ghoul play it, I played it along with some numbskulls that were hanging around the catacombs…There were probably three or four major revisions, everything else were just small changes for things like wording. There were probably four major revisions to the rules. These guys are cannibals that have lived underground their whole lives, it was really hard to communicate to them in a clear manner. I still don't even understand the basic rudiments of Creepsylvanian.
D: None of us do.
R: It seems like it's just English with a really thick accent you can't understand.
Digestor, where did we leave off with Ghoul's adventures at the end of Hang Ten?
D: At the end of Hang Ten, the Cannibals MC have been defeated and banished from Creepsylvania by Commandant Dobronkum, who has taken over the city. He is about to institute martial law and turn it into a police state. He's built a giant wall around the city, the Wall of Death if you will, and he treats everyone like garbage. You know I voted for him actually, he seems like a pretty good ruler. He gets shit done.
R: He speaks his mind.
Wait, so is Creepsylvania a democratic nation then? Are there elections?
D: No, there was no real voting.
R: From what I understand, there was only a single check box.
D: I wrote his name on a piece of paper, put an “X” next to it and flushed it down the toilet.
R: It's a weird place Creepsylvania, it was so easy to get in but I just couldn't find an exit. I was just stuck there.
D: No one ever escapes this place, it's great!

After a short briefing on the rules, we decided to play the game. I was in luck; we had the opportunity of playing an expanded-size version of the game—the production edition is the size of an LP gatefold. Since the game was designed for two-to-four players, the participants ended up being myself, Digestor, Doktor Sewage, and a poor hostage. We chose avatar miniatures for ourselves, and we kicked off the first rule of the game: the least attractive player goes first. After a heated argument between the Doktor and myself on who was uglier, the former capitulated and opted to roll first.
The four of us took turns advancing through the map, and frequently found ourselves in situations where we could fight monsters, bikers, and even black metal musicians for shortcuts. Should one lose a fight, the punishment would result in injury or even a temporary death, after which the player would be revived at the start of the map. Many spaces were emblazoned with images of beer or shot glasses, and some spaces even offered the opportunity to knock other players backward through the map or lose turns entirely. In addition players could rapidly hop all over the map by landing on spaces representing catacombs, where dice rolls would decide the final destination. Certain rolls on catacomb spaces could advance players from one end of the map to the other, which could potentially end the game early or conversely, prolong it for much longer.
Though our round of the game was fairly short, about 20 minutes or so, the number of possibilities for both choice and luck-based shenanigans was impressive. I spent most of the game in last place, being knocked backward on the map on at least one occasion and losing the occasional fight along the way. However, I eventually won the game thanks to a lucky dice roll when I finally reached the Wall of Death. Digestor was not amused.
…
…
Now that we've played a round, let's talk a little bit about the story being told here in Dungeon Bastards.
D: Commandant Dobronkum has an ultimate weapon, the Omicron Bomb, that he's threatening the entire place with, including us. Baron Samedi beckoned us so he could use the weapon to destroy himself and everyone else because he wants everyone to go back into oblivion, so the game is the story of us trying to get to the weapon in Svatoplunk Square.
R: From what I could gather, Dobronkum wants to kill everybody, Samedi wants to kill everybody and himself, and Ghoul kind of don't care as long as people die. From what Digestor has told me, this game is about killing people and eating people.
D: And drinking. Copious drinking.
I was going to mention, I noticed many shot glasses and beer mugs littered about the game map.
D: I told this guy to throw in some lines of coke in there too, but he would not do it.
R: The agreement was that I had to get lines of coke but they just kept me awake with loud music.
D: Well that's just bad communication.
We have an issue, however. Many young Ghoul fans are well under the drinking age. Don't you think you're endorsing underage drinking from the way you designed this game?
R: There is nothing in the rules stating that people must drink. There are simply some pictures of beer, and that's legally protected as art.
There was an awful lot of choice involved in this game: Choices to get into fights, choices to screw over other players, etc. The game seems to be far nicer to the players than I'd expect you guys to be.
D: Life is all about choices Avinash. If nothing else, this game represents life accurately.
R: No, you're thinking of the game of Life. That's a good game. If people had babies in this game, they'd probably get eaten.
We got into fights with dog soldiers, swamp hags, and even black metal bands…
D: Well, we [in Ghoul] don't have to fight them. We just kill them. They don't put up much of a fight.
R: Have you seen black metal dudes? They're barely fit. The American ones, they're all vegan!
D: They're pale, weak, and easy to kill.
R: Many founding, visionary members have been killed in Creepsylvania.
In this game, everyone dies at the end.
R: Well, this game fudges with reality a bit for the sake of fun. I mean, everyone dying is fun to Ghoul.
D: So it's realistic.
This Omicron Bomb, does it blow up the entire world or just Creepsylvania?
D: Yes.
R: What happens in the record and in real life is very different. You'd probably have to buy the record and read the lyrics to find out.
D: The board game represents a dumbed-down version of our reality. Reality is on the record, in the lyrics.
R: Ghoul is like NWA, they're just telling stories from their lives.
D: We're just throwing reality back in your face, seeing if you can handle it.
R: That's what I really respect about Ghoul after working with them. They keep it real.
Sure, but is Creepsylvania even around after this bomb goes off?
D: You'll have to buy the album and find out.
R: It's under a lot of duress, but that's kind of the normal state of being for Creepsylvania.
So what does this game indicate for Ghoul's future in the entertainment industry?
D: Apps. Oh and we're actually going to have miniatures that you can buy for this game, so you can be your favorite Ghoul character while you play. That's something that will be available soon before the album's out.
R: They're miniature figures, but the penises are full-size.
…
…
D: Yes, they weigh about 14 pounds each. They're really hard to move.
R: My skills have been tapped out and fortunately they let me live, but I think those guys might have some other games in mind.
D: Yeah, the only reason Doktor Sewage is alive is because we have some other games we might want him to work on. He did a great job on this thing, but there might be something more complicated coming his way. Maybe a full RPG with a 50-page rulebook that's incomprehensible.
R: What they told me is that they're just trying to angle for a tour with Bolt Thrower.
D: And Gygax. Bolt Thrower, Gygax, and Ghoul. The table-top game tour.

The Israeli army says it has continued to intensify its offensive on the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, striking key Hamas sites in the second day of an operation aimed at quelling rocket fire against Israel.
Army spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner says warplanes early Wednesday attacked more than 130 sites including Hamas command centers and rocket launchers.
Lerner says at least four rockets were fired at Israel overnight, a decline from the large barrage the evening before. Air raid sirens wailed in Tel Aviv and southern Israel early Wednesday.
Gaza health official Ashraf Al-Kedra says overnight airstrikes killed one militant in south Gaza and an Islamic Jihad operative and five relatives in northern Gaza.
Israel's attacks on the Gaza Strip increased on Tuesday, with its military saying it launched more than a hundred airstrikes in 24 hours and mooting that the operation could become a longer-term military engagement with a possible ground component.
After the launch of airstrikes overnight on Tuesday, the Israeli government approved the call-up of up to 40,000 additional reservists, adding to the 1,500 already mobilized, the Israeli news outlet Haaretz reported.
The operation marks the worst outbreak of violence between Israel and Gaza since an eight-day war in 2012, and there was no indication that a lull in Israeli strikes would be forthcoming. At least 27 Palestinians have been killed in the latest round of bombardments with 130 more injured, according to Palestinian officials.
At least seven people were reportedly killed in an airstrike on a house in Khan Younis in Gaza, which injured 25 others. Local residents said the house belonged to the family of a Hamas member. After an initial strike on the house, dozens of people, including civilians, gathered on the roof, at which point, Reuters reported, the home was hit by another strike. The Israeli military had no comment on the attack.
Israel's offensive, dubbed Operation Protective Edge, was said to be a response to a marked uptick in rocket attacks from Gaza, which on Monday reached their highest level in years. A representative for the Israeli military tweeted that Hamas has fired more than 130 rockets at Israel in the past 24 hours.
Fighters from Gaza managed to enter Israel from the sea and attacked several military sites simultaneously.
The Israeli army shot and killed four other Palestinians who were reportedly trying to infiltrate Zikim Kibbutz, an Israeli community near Gaza, Haaretz reported. Meanwhile clashes were also reported at a military base near Kerem Shalom as well as Yad Mordechai, according to Al Quds.
Sirens rang out over central Israel after rockets fired from Gaza traveled as far north as Haifa. Rockets were intercepted over Tel Aviv by Israel's Iron Dome, and at least one rocket exploded in Jerusalem, Haaretz reported.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that the military operation against Hamas would be expanded — with the option of a ground invasion of Gaza.
A source in Netanyahu's office quoted him as saying, “The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] must be ready to go all the way. All options are on the table, including a ground invasion.”
“We are preparing for a battle against Hamas, which will not end within a few days,” Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon said in a release.

Abstract
Bacoside-A, a family of compounds extracted from the Bacopa monniera plant, is a folk-medicinal substance believed to exhibit therapeutic properties, particularly enhancing cognitive functions and improving memory. We show that bacoside-A exerted significant inhibitory effects upon cytotoxicity, fibrillation, and particularly membrane interactions of amyloid-beta (1-42) (Aβ42), the peptide playing a prominent role in Alzeheimer's disease progression and toxicity. Specifically, preincubation of bacoside-A with Aβ42 significantly reduced cell toxicity and inhibited fibril formation both in buffer solution and, more significantly, in the presence of membrane vesicles. In parallel, spectroscopic and microscopic analyses reveal that bacoside-A blocked membrane interactions of Aβ42, while formation of Aβ42 oligomers was not disrupted. These interesting phenomena suggest that inhibition of Aβ42 oligomer assembly into mature fibrils, and blocking membrane interactions of the oligomers are likely the underlying factors for ameliorating amyloid toxicity by bacoside-A and its putative physiological benefits.
About 29,000 properties zoned single house and mixed housing suburban were in the areas considered by the appeals.
Homeowners in some of Auckland's leafiest suburbs have been left "in tears" after finding their streets re-zoned to allow for densification.
The High Court has ruled the panel that considered Auckland's controversial Unitary Plan acted lawfully in reaching its decision allowing increased density in residential housing in certain areas of the city.
The court on Monday released its finding on 51 appeals and judicial review applications concerning the plan.
About 29,000 properties zoned single house and mixed housing suburban were in the areas considered by the appeals, including properties in Mt Albert, Glendowie, Blockhouse Bay, Judges Bay, Grey Lynn, Takanini, Howick and Parnell.

* Government may step in if Auckland doesn't put a new city plan in place
A central issue for many of the appeals was whether the recommendations made by the Independent Hearings Panel (IHP) on the Unitary Plan were within scope of the submissions.
If they were not in scope, then affected parties would have the right to appeal any council decisions based on the recommendations.
In its 143-page decision, the court found the panel's approach to scope for residential zoning in the key test case areas was lawful.
The court ruled that the IHP had approached the matter correctly, with the exception of two test cases – one in Parnell and one in Takanini.
In his decision, Justice Christian Whata said: "The purpose of resolving the test cases was to provide affected appellants with guidance on the issue of scope. It will be for them to decide whether and to what extent they wish to pursue their appeals in light of my decision."
Character Coalition chairwoman Sally Hughes was disappointed in the decision.
The coalition is an umbrella organisation representing 67 different groups committed to protecting Auckland's heritage.
But they did not represent all the 29,000 property owners affected, many of whom had contacted them "in tears" after learning of the rezoning, she said.
"Many people didn't even know this was taking place.
"We had distraught calls from people saying we had no idea, we live in a street of 100-year-old villas and now we could get apartment blocks across the street."
The coalition was not against intensification and believed many parts were in desperate need, but were opposed to destroying Auckland's most beautiful streets.
Homeowners were given little change to voice their opinion after the provisions were introduced towards the end of the process.
Hughes said the appeal process had been fair, but the coalition would continue to campaign to raise awareness about protecting the city's heritage.
Youth group Generation Zero campaigned for intensification, claiming it was needed to help fix the city's broken housing market.
Auckland spokesman Leroy Beckett said the court decision was great news.
"It's really good, they had their day in court, now we can get on with the other aspects of fixing the problem."
These included training more builders and addressing social housing needs.
The group was not opposed to protecting heritage, but believed there were adequate measures in the Unitary Plan to protect worthy buildings, he said.
Some "tough decisions" would have to be made, but blanket protection for all houses that would protect poorly built, cold 1940s buildings was unnecessary.
Auckland Council's Director Legal and Risk, Katherine Anderson said: "As the decision has implications for appeals that are still before the courts, the council will not be making any further comment at this stage."
A private plane that authorities said was hauling about a half-million dollars worth of marijuana from Tuscon, Ariz. to Harrisburg is owned by a Scranton-area man.
Michael Murphy, 48, of Dickson City, said he was trying to sell the 1977 model 310 Cessna through a broker in Hilton Head, S.C. The broker, Murphy said, let two men test drive the plane and they stole it. Murphy said he reported the plane stolen on July 23 to the FBI and the Lackawanna County District Attorney's Office.
Murphy would not divulge the name of the broker and said he did not know the names of the two men he believes stole the aircraft.
The plane stopped to refuel in Walnut Ridge, Ark. on July 20, which is when authorities -- acting on a tip from Homeland Security -- confronted the pilot, Heath M. Gephart, of Lower Paxton Township, and passenger, Mark Sweigart, of Susquehanna Township. After getting consent to search, officers found nearly 420 pounds of marijuana in duffel bags inside the plane, Walnut Ridge Detective David Burnside said.
Burnside said he interviewed the men, who each said the drugs didn't belong to them. Gephart and Sweigart were charged with possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver and possession of drug paraphernalia.
Murphy, who owns a towing company in Dickson City, said he bought the plane about 10 years ago but wanted to sell it and buy a jet. He said he didn't know anything about it being used to haul drugs.
Murphy is not the same Michael Murphy who co-owns Arooga's sports bar, a question that was posed by several PennLive posters in the earlier story.
We have the Moral Argument all wrong. Universal morality isn't evidence of God's existence, it's the reason we need God. Human morality is flawed from its foundation, a fiend from whom we need salvation.
Yaniak's new book is philosophy made interesting, from a Christian perspective. Besides presenting an unusual take on the dilemma of the origins of human morality, he has a style of writing that draws you in and keeps you interested. I thoroughly enjoyed it, though I confess occasional bewilderment. Like any good philosopher, Yaniak spins his web in circles. For example, he rails against the illogic of determinism, then relies heavily on causation from the beginning of the world. In a discussion about Problem of Evil, Yaniak seems to prove that God exists but could not be the God of the Bible. So it takes a bit of concentration to pick out his fine brush strokes, and I'm likely to misrepresent him somewhere in the paragraphs ahead!
In seeking to elucidate God, free will, moralism, and good and evil, Yaniak flirts with both pantheism and materialism, while staying an arm's length from both. God, for example, is not the apple, nor in the apple, nor encompassing the apple, but is the state of the apple. God is its existence, and a tenuous existence it is indeed, once you follow the logic.
Yaniak's flirtation with materialism is equally intriguing, especially when he discusses Original Sin. We are not merely born of Adam, we are Adam. This he argues by tracing backward: At what point did I become me? At birth? Conception? Why do we choose these arbitrary benchmarks? I am me while yet I am my father, though in an earlier state. While yet I am my father's father. I am Adam. I ate the apple in the Garden of Eden.
By ignoring the duality of mind and body, or soul and body, effectively discarding any moment of incarnating “life,” we are all Adam. It doesn't matter whether we read the story of Adam and Eve literally or figuratively. We are all one, and the implications are astounding. Judgment becomes swift and righteous. When I murder my brother, I am immediately suffering for my wrong, for I am he. Salvation also carries new meaning. Good and evil take on a different light. My relation to my neighbor, and to the fly on the wall, is merely a matter of degree … the ancestry simply traces further back through evolution. Who is to say it is wrong for Hitler to murder Jews while we happily step on cockroaches? We tend to sympathize with one and not the other, letting our sympathies drive our morality, but this is to misunderstand both God and who we are.
Yaniak returns often to the topic of gay rights, probably because it is such a hot topic in Christianity today. His eventual conclusion boils down to a definition of love which seems beneath us, but I confess the topic made for a fascinating moral playground.
In the end, I must rate this as one of the most fun philosophical journeys I've taken in many years. You won't think about life the same after this one.
"If you can not measure it, you can not improve it." -- Lord Kelvin
To get your HTML5 games to run faster, you have to first pinpoint the performance bottlenecks, but this can be difficult. Evaluating frames per second (FPS) data is a start, but to see the full picture, you have to grasp the nuances in the Chrome activities.
The about:tracing tool provides the insight that helps you avoid hasty workarounds aimed at performance improvement, but which are essentially well-intentioned guesswork. You'll save a lot of time and energy, get a clearer picture of what Chrome is doing with each frame, and use this information to optimize your game.
Hello about:tracing!
Chrome's about:tracing tool gives you a window into all of Chrome's activities over a period of time with so much granularity that you might find it overwhelming at first. Many of the functions in Chrome are instrumented for tracing out of the box, so without doing any manual instrumentation you can still use about:tracing to track your performance. (See a later section on manually instrumenting your JS)
Tip: you can also capture tracing information from Chrome for Android. Future articles will cover mobile debugging, but in the meanwhile you can refer to this document.
To see the tracing view simply type "about:tracing" into Chrome's omnibox (address bar).
Type "about:tracing" into Chrome's omnibox
From the tracing tool, you can start recording, run your game for a few seconds, and then view the trace data. This is an example of what the data might look like:
Simple tracing result
Yep, that's confusing all right. Let's talk about how to read it.
Each row represents a process being profiled, the left-right axis indicates time, and each colored box is an instrumented function call. There are rows for a number of different kinds of resources. The ones that are most interesting for game profiling are CrGpuMain, which shows what the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is doing, and CrRendererMain. Each trace contains CrRendererMain lines for each open tab during the trace period (including the about:tracing tab itself).
When reading trace data your first task is to determine which CrRendererMain row corresponds to your game.
Simple tracing result highlighted
In this example the two candidates are: 2216 and 6516. Unfortunately there currently isn't a polished way to pick out your application except to look for the line that's doing a lot of periodic updating (or if you've manually instrumented your code with trace points, to look for the line that contains your trace data). In this example, it looks like 6516 is running a main loop from the frequency of updates. If you close all other tabs before starting trace, finding out the correct CrRendererMain will be easier. But there still may be CrRendererMain rows for processes other than your game.
Finding your frame
Once you've located the correct row in the tracing tool for your game, the next step is to find the main loop. The main loop looks like a repeating pattern in the tracing data. You can navigate the tracing data by using the W, A, S, D keys: A and D to move left or right (back and forth in time) and W and S to zoom in and out on the data. You would expect your main loop to be a pattern that repeats every 16 milliseconds if your game is running at 60Hz.
Looks like three execution frames
Once you've located your game's heartbeat, you can dig into what exactly your code is doing at each frame. Use W, A, S, D to zoom in until you can read the text in the function boxes.
Deep into an execution frame
This collection of boxes shows a series of function calls, with each call represented by a colored box. Each function was called by the box above it, so in this case, you can see that MessageLoop::RunTask called RenderWidget::OnSwapBuffersComplete, which in turn called RenderWidget::DoDeferredUpdate, and so on. Reading this data, you can get a full view of what called what and how long each execution took.
But here's where it gets a little sticky. The information exposed by about:tracing is the raw function calls from the Chrome source code. You can make educated guesses about what each function is doing from the name, but the information is not exactly user friendly. It's useful to see the overall flow of your frame, but you need something a little more human readable to actually figure out what's going on.
Fortunately there's a friendly way to add manual instrumentation to your code to create trace data: console.time and console.timeEnd .
console.time("update"); update(); console.timeEnd("update"); console.time("render"); update(); console.timeEnd("render");
The above code creates new boxes in the tracing view name with the tags specified, so if you re-run the app you'll see "update" and "render" boxes that show the time elapsed between the start and end calls for each tag.
Tags added manually
Using this, you can create human readable tracing data to track hotspots in your code.
GPU or CPU?
With hardware accelerated graphics, one of the most important questions you can ask during profiling is: Is this code GPU bound or CPU bound? With each frame you'll be doing some rendering work on the GPU and some logic on the CPU; in order to understand what's making your game slow you'll need to see how the work is balanced across the two resources.
First, find the line on the tracing view named CrGPUMain, which indicates whether the GPU is busy at a particular time.
You can see that every frame of your game causes CPU work in the CrRendererMain as well as on the GPU. The above trace shows a very simple use case where both the CPU and GPU are idle for most of each 16ms frame.
The tracing view really becomes helpful when you've got a game that's running slowly and you're not sure which resource you're maxing out. Looking at how the GPU and CPU lines relate is the key to debugging. Take the same example as before, but add a little extra work in the update loop.
console.time("update"); doExtraWork(); update(Math.min(50, now - time)); console.timeEnd("update"); console.time("render"); render(); console.timeEnd("render");
Now you'll see a trace that looks like this:
What does this trace tell us? We can see that the frame pictured goes from about 2270ms to 2320ms, meaning that each frame is taking about 50ms (a frame rate of 20Hz). You can see slivers of colored boxes representing the render function next to the update box, but the frame is entirely dominated by update itself.
In contrast to what's going on on the CPU, you can see that the GPU is still sitting around idle for most of every frame. To optimize this code, you could look for operations that can be done in shader code and move them to the GPU to make the best use of resources.
What about when the shader code itself is slow and the GPU is overworked? What if we remove the unnecessary work from the CPU and instead add some work in the fragment shader code. Here's a needlessly expensive fragment shader:
#ifdef GL_ES precision highp float; #endif void main(void) { for(int i=0; i<9999; i++) { gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0, 0, 1.0); } }
What does a trace of code using that shader look like?
GPU and CPU traces when using slow GPU code
Again, note the duration of a frame. Here the repeating pattern goes from about 2750ms to 2950ms, a duration of 200ms (frame rate of about 5Hz). The CrRendererMain line is almost completely empty meaning that the CPU is idle most of the time, while the GPU is overloaded. This is a sure sign that your shaders are too heavy.
If you didn't have visibility into exactly what was causing the low framerate, you could observe the 5 Hz update and be tempted to go into the game code and start trying to optimize or remove game logic. In this case, that would do absolutely no good, because logic in the game loop isn't what is eating uptime. In fact, what this trace indicates is that doing more CPU work each frame would be essentially "free" in that the CPU is hanging around idle, so giving it more work will not effect how long the frame takes.
Real Examples
Now let's check out what tracing data from a real game looks like. One of the cool things about games built with open web technologies is that you can see what's going on in your favorite products. If you want to test out profiling tools you can pick your favorite WebGL title from the Chrome Web Store and profile it with about:tracing. This is an example trace taken from the excellent WebGL game Skid Racer.
Tracing a real game
Looks like each frame takes about 20ms, which means that the frame rate is about 50 FPS. You can see that the work is balanced between the CPU and GPU, but the GPU is the resource that's most in demand.

If you want your game to run at 60Hz, then for every frame all your operations have to fit into 16ms of CPU and 16ms of GPU time. You have two resources that can be utilized in parallel, and you can shift work between them to maximize performance.

Things are so frosty between Russia and the United States these days that the slightest sign of warmth catches the eye – even a gift of spring vegetables.
Pictures from Sochi, on Russia's Black Sea coast, on Tuesday showed Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, presenting John Kerry with two baskets of potatoes and tomatoes.
Mr Kerry, the US secretary of state, was in town to meet his counterpart and Vladimir Putin, Russia's president.

The unusual gift suggested a softening of mood amid prickly talks over the violence in Ukraine, Syria and Yemen. But why the spuds?
While we're waiting for the presser here's a closer look at the gift Russian FM Lavrov gave to @JohnKerry in #Sochi pic.twitter.com/EIE30PHvad — Emma Wells (@Emmawells1) May 12, 2015
Mr Lavrov's present harked back to January 2014, when Mr Kerry gave Mr Lavrov two large Idaho potatoes as the pair met in Paris to discuss the Syria crisis.
The American said then that he and Mr Lavrov had spoken by phone when he was on holiday in Idaho, and the Russian recalled the region's famously giant tubers.
“He told me he's not going to make vodka. He's going to eat them,” Mr Kerry explained after the Paris summit, adding: “I really want to clarify: There's no hidden meaning. There's no metaphor. There's no symbolic anything. … He recalled the Idaho potatoes as being something that he knew of, so I thought I would surprise him and bring him some good Idaho potatoes.”
Mr Lavrov clearly wanted to repay the favour.

But had Mr Kerry's gift in Paris been reverse-engineered?
After meeting in France, Mr Lavrov admitted he'd sent the Idaho crop to farmers in Krasnodar region (where Sochi is located) who “would experiment on them a little”.
Tantalisingly, Maria Zakharova, the Russian official who posted the Sochi pictures on Facebook on Tuesday, said the foreign minister's potatoes for Mr Kerry were indeed from Krasnodar. They were, she said, “distant relatives of those that his US counterpart once brought him".

On Friday, the Wall Street Journal revealed details of a cover up by the nation's largest banks that have been engaged in potentially-criminal accounting activities to conceal the amount of debt on their balance sheets. The SEC has been notified of the allegations and has launched a probe to determine whether further action is needed. Among the banks implicated, are Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of America, and Citigroup. According to the WSJ:
"Major banks have masked their risk levels in the past five quarters by temporarily lowering their debt just before reporting it to the public, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A group of 18 banks....understated the debt levels used to fund securities trades by lowering them an average of 42 per cent at the end of each of the past five quarterly periods, the data show. The banks, which publicly release debt data each quarter, then boosted the debt levels in the middle of successive quarters." ("Big Banks Mask Risk Levels", Kate Kelly, Tom McGinty, Dan Fitzpatrick, Wall Street Journal)
The article has set off alarm bells on Wall Street because of the similarity between Lehman Bros. "repo 105" transactions and these new signs of obfuscation by other large banks. "Repo 105" is an accounting device that Lehman used to hide $50 billion in debt off its balance sheet in an attempt to mislead investors about the true state of its financial health. The WSJ story suggests that the practice may be more widespread than originally thought. The "repo 105" scandal is further complicated by suspicions that Lehman was assisted in its effort by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York which, at the time, was headed by the present Secretary of the Treasury, Timothy Geithner. Here is a short recap of what transpired between the Geithner's NY Fed and Lehman according to ex-regulator William Black and former NY governor Eliot Spitzer from an article on Huffington Post:
"The FRBNY [i.e., New York Fed] knew that Lehman was engaged in smoke and mirrors designed to overstate its liquidity and, therefore, was unwilling to lend as much money to Lehman. The FRBNY did not, however, inform the SEC, the public, or the Office of Thrift Supervision (which regulated an S&L that Lehman owned) of what should have been viewed by all as ongoing misrepresentations. The Fed's behavior made it clear that officials didn't believe they needed to do more with this information. The FRBNY remained willing to lend to an institution with misleading accounting and neither remedied the accounting nor notified other regulators who may have had the opportunity to do so...... We now know from Valukas and from former Treasury Secretary Paulson that the Treasury and the Fed knew that Lehman was massively overstating its on-book asset values." (Time for the Truth" William Black and Eliot Spitzer, Huffington Post)
So the question is whether the NY Fed helped other banks conceal important financial information from investors, too. And--if that's the case--then how can the public be confident that the biggest banks in the country are truly solvent?
According to the WSJ: "An official at the Federal Reserve Board noted that the Fed continuously monitors asset levels at the large bank-holding companies, but the financing activities captured in the New York Fed's data fall under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates brokerage firms."
The Fed's explanation is a tacit denial of its responsibility to regulate or report suspicious accounting practices to the appropriate agencies. The response is not just "buck passing", but also suggests collusion. So far, there's no clear link between the Fed and the shady bookeeping at the banks. But many now believe that -- in the case of Lehman -- the Fed acted as an "enabler", either by serving as a counterparty in repo 105 deals or by looking the other way while the transactions were executed. Either way, the situation demands an independent investigation.
To put the WSJ article in context, it helps to review the details of the Lehman case. Here's an excerpt from an article by Eric Dash in the NY Times:
"Newly released report on the collapse of Lehman Brothers ... sheds surprising new light on Lehman's dealings with the New York Fed. Lehman engaged in a series of transactions with the New York Fed that were similar to the ones that drew criticism from the bankruptcy court examiner who investigated its collapse.... “The report by Mr. Valukas nonetheless raises fresh questions about the role of the New York Fed in supporting Lehman during the frantic months leading up to its collapse. It suggests that Lehman executives believed the Fed would be able to help the bank avert disaster and provide it with a business opportunity... “Lehman, desperate for financing, seized its chance. It packaged billions of dollars of troubled corporate loans into an investment called Freedom CLO. Then, in a series of transactions, it shifted Freedom back and forth to the New York Fed, in exchange for cash. Those moves helped make Lehman look healthier. “Essentially, Lehman was able to temporarily warehouse illiquid investments that were worrying its investors at the New York Fed in return for cash. The Fed created this facility immediately after the near collapse of Bear Stearns. Some suspect that other banks engaged in similar maneuvers.” ("Fed Helped Bank Raise Cash Quickly", Eric Dash, New York Times)
So why did "Lehman executives believe the Fed would be able to help the bank avert disaster and provide it with a business opportunity"? Most likely, because that had been standard operating procedure. The Fed was merely acting as it had before. Lehman used the repo market to amplify leverage to maximize profits, (the same as the other banks) and when they couldn't find a counterparty to accept their garbage collateral, the Fed would step in and provide short-term loans and "warehouse" their toxic assets. In essence, the Fed was helping to defraud investors who believed the banks reports were accurate. Here's Yves Smith at Naked Capitalism who sums it up perfectly:
"The NY Fed, and thus Timothy Geithner, were at a minimum massively derelict in the performance of their duties, and may well be culpable in aiding and abetting Lehman in accounting fraud and Sarbox violations...…at a minimum, the NY Fed helped perpetuate a fraud on investors and counterparties. This pattern further suggests the Fed, which by its charter is tasked to promote the safety and soundness of the banking system, instead, via its collusion with Lehman management, operated to protect particular actors to the detriment of the public at large. And most important, it says that the NY Fed, and likely Geithner himself, undermined, perhaps even violated, laws designed to protect investors and markets."
So if the NY Fed had no moral qualms about its "repo 105" dealings with Lehman, than why would hesitate to do the same thing for the other banks? Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge answers the question like this:
"We contend that Repo 105 type book-cooking and quarter end balance sheet window dressing was a prevalent phenomenon among all the banks. The fact that over the past two and a half years this resulted in a differential from the peak quarterly assets of over $65 billion is unbelievable, and the fact that this had slipped through the regulators' fingers is inexcusable..... “We are confident that armed with this data, the SEC will be able to provide a prompt and logical response to why the primary dealers have such a peculiar pattern in downshifting their assets toward quarter end, and much more relevantly, who the counterparties are that would consistently take the other side of these quarter end window-dressing trades." ("Evidence That Primary Dealers Have Collectively Engaged In Repo 105 And Qtr-End Book Cooking Type Schemes For Years" zero hedge, 4-9-10)
Durden's logic looks good. If Lehman was being aided in its "book cooking" by the NY Fed, then the other banks were probably being helped, as well. It looks like Geithner left his fingerprints everywhere.
If we add these new developments to the fact that the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) "mark to market" rule has been suspended (allowing banks to arbitrarily assign whatever value they choose to the own illiquid assets) and, the fact that the Federal Reserve still refuses to allow an independent audit of the dodgy collateral it accepted from the banks in exchange for Treasuries and other loans; then it still looks like the banking system is either teetering or insolvent.
And don't expect the Securities and Exchange Commission to get to the bottom of this either. SEC chairman Mary Schapiro is a proven financial industry loyalist who has no intention of upsetting her Wall Street overlords by digging too deep or issuing subpoenas. If she pursues the investigation at all, it will only be to placate the public and to apply liberal amounts of whitewash to the whole matter.

A full three years have passed since 40 Indian construction workers, most of them from Punjab, were abducted by the Islamic State (IS) terror organisation from their job site in Mosul, Iraq.
Advertising
As much as the Ministry of External Affairs has helped Indians in distress around the world under the leadership of Sushma Swaraj, its handling of the crisis of the 39 missing men – one of them escaped, and what he had to say, and how he has been treated by the government, is key to the story – raises troubling questions.
Rewind to 2014: the Modi government had barely been sworn in when the news erupted of a group of 46 nurses from Kerala, trapped in a Tikrit hospital as IS militants and Iraqi forces fought around it. Days later, as all hell broke loose, the IS bussed out the nurses and took them to Mosul. By then, the government has rushed in a special envoy who managed to have the nurses freed and returned.
But by then it emerged that another group of Indians, all construction workers, had been abducted by the IS.
Advertising
In Punjab, the state government was at the receiving end of unfavourable comparisons. People saw the Kerala chief minister at the time, Oommen Chandy, camping in Delhi from where he “personally supervised” the rescue of the nurses, liaising with Sushma, keeping in touch with the families in Kerala through their 23-day ordeal. He was there to receive them when they returned.
Meanwhile, pressure grew on then Punjab chief minister Prakash Singh Badal and his son Sukhbir as well as the Shiromani Akali Dal, a partner of the BJP at the centre and State. On June 19, a delegation of the Punjab families, headed by Chief Minister travelled to Delhi to meet Sushma.
There would be many more such meetings, sometimes with Union Minister and Badal bahu Harsimrat Kaur heading the Punjab delegation of families, or some other notable, usually from the Delhi SGPC.
Each time, the External Affairs Minister would assure the families that she had heard from “four” sources or “multiple” sources that the men had been spotted alive, along with some random detail. For instance, that they had been seen working at a construction site.
The return of the nurses in July spurred hope for a similar rescue of the construction workers. But that did not happen.
Meanwhile, a man who claimed he escaped when the militants shot and killed the rest of the group, made contact with Indian diplomats in Iraq, and was sent back home. In Delhi, Harjit Masih is taken to a “safe house” and not allowed to go back to his village in Gurdaspur.
When his family complained that he called them to say he was safe and has since disappeared, Sushma told Parliament that he needed to be protected because of the threat to his life from IS. When he was finally released and returned home, the relatives of the other men around on him – he was linked to the ‘agent' who got the men their jobs in Iraq – filed a case against him for trafficking. Masih spent months in jail.
Each time the families requested meetings with Sushma, she obliged, and sent them back with the same motherly reassurance.
A year passed, then two, and now three. Last year, around this time, a team of Indian Express reporters, including myself tracked down each of those families scattered across Punjab, Himachal, Bihar and West Bengal. Their stories were heart-rending.
In Punjab especially, the wives, most of them in their twenties, said they did not know what to believe. Almost everyone said they wanted the government to “tell us the truth”. Some wives continued to live with their in-laws, while others had gone back to their parents' homes.
All were dealing with the social pressures of being a single mother for all practical purposes, and the economic difficulties that had sent their husbands to Iraq in the first place.
At one home, the brother of one of the missing men complained that his sister-in-law's parents wanted him to marry her; at another, the wife complained that her in-laws did not want her back anymore. In many homes, there had been squabbles between the wife and in-laws over who got to keep the monthly “pension” of Rs 20,000 that the Punjab government was giving them.
At another village, a mother was up to date on all the developments in the region, including how Iraqi forces were planning to retake Mosul, because she was following every bit of news coming out of Iraq, in the hope that she would be reunited with her son.
Sadly, if it was not clear a few months after their abduction, it should be abundantly so by now that the chances of these men being found alive are remote.
But the government continues to be dilatory by handing out reassurances – the latest was as recently as June 8, when the families met Sushma once again.They wanted to know what the government was doing to trace the men now that Mosul was almost liberated.
Pat came the assurance: another purported “sighting” of a group of 20-25 Indian men, apparently in a church in the tiny patch of territory still under IS control; and as no other Indians had approached the ministry, the possibility was high this was part of the missing group of 39.
The Minister and officials in the MEA evidently believe information that the IS, in its last stand against the Iraqi forces, and now confined to a few sq kms of Mosul, is dragging its hostages with it from place to place.
The families of the missing men came out of last week's meeting not knowing what to think, especially as the so-called sighting held out hope only for 25 men, with no information on which ones.
Three years ago, it may have been politically risky, but certainly more honest to make it plain that while the government would do everything in its power to trace the men, the families should not keep their hopes high.

In a few weeks if not days, when all of Mosul is finally liberated from the IS, Sushma Swaraj is bound to find herself facing the families once again. What will she say now?
Image caption HSBC more than doubled its profits in the first half of 2010
Banking giant HSBC has said it is in exclusive discussions to buy a controlling stake in South Africa's fourth-biggest bank, Nedbank.
HSBC and Anglo-South African insurer Old Mutual, which currently owns the stake, confirmed in separate statements that talks were taking place.
If the bid succeeds, HSBC will acquire up to 70% of Nedbank in a deal worth as much as 49.9bn rand ($6.8bn; £4.4bn).
Nedbank said HSBC was "an attractive international banking partner".
The deal would build on HSBC's existing presence in South Africa and fuel its ambitions to expand its reach in emerging markets.
But in the wake of other recent acquisitions by foreign banks, there are concerns that the South African authorities might see it as a deal too far.
Earlier this month, HSBC reported pre-tax profits of $11.1bn for the first six months of 2010 - more than double its profits for the same time last year.
The bank said it was profitable in every region except for North America, where it saw losses of $80m.

At the end of what looked like a blog post simply celebrating Intel's 40-year anniversary of the launch of the first x86 processor, the Intel 8086, is a potential warning from the chipmaker for those looking to emulate x86 on various processors.
Credit: Microsoft
see also Microsoft to PC makers: Let's make some Windows 10 ARM-based PCs Microsoft will bring a natively compiled version of Windows 10 to Qualcomm's ARM processors next year, plus an x86 emulation layer, designed to run on a new class of Windows 10 mobile PCs. Read More
The timing of the June 8 blog post is interesting, given Microsoft and Qualcomm have stated their intent to provide x86 emulation on coming Windows 10 on ARM-based PCs. Microsoft has yet to start testing publicly its Windows 10 on ARM release, but officials said recently that the first Windows 10 on ARM PCs are expected from OEMs like HP, ASUS, and Lenovo sometime soon.
Intel didn't name Microsoft, Qualcomm or any specific PC makers in its June 8 post entitled "X86: Approaching 40 and Still Going Strong." But there's definitely a hint of some possible intellectual property (IP) wranglings ahead.
From Intel's post:
"There have been reports that some companies may try to emulate Intel's proprietary x86 ISA without Intel's authorization. Emulation is not a new technology, and Transmeta was notably the last company to claim to have produced a compatible x86 processor using emulation ('code morphing') techniques. Intel enforced patents relating to SIMD instruction set enhancements against Transmeta's x86 implementation even though it used emulation. In any event, Transmeta was not commercially successful, and it exited the microprocessor business 10 years ago. Only time will tell if new attempts to emulate Intel's x86 ISA will meet a different fate. Intel welcomes lawful competition, and we are confident that Intel's microprocessors, which have been specifically optimized to implement Intel's x86 ISA for almost four decades, will deliver amazing experiences, consistency across applications, and a full breadth of consumer offerings, full manageability and IT integration for the enterprise. However, we do not welcome unlawful infringement of our patents, and we fully expect other companies to continue to respect Intel's intellectual property rights. Strong intellectual property protections make it possible for Intel to continue to invest the enormous resources required to advance Intel's dynamic x86 ISA, and Intel will maintain its vigilance to protect its innovations and investments."
I asked Intel if its post was intended to be a warning shot across the Microsoft/Qualcomm bow. A spokesperson's only response, was an emailed statement from Steve Rodgers, Intel executive vice president and general counsel:
"Intel respects intellectual property rights and we expect others to do the same. x86 technology is both proprietary and central to our business, and we're concerned any time it appears that others may be copying it inappropriately. We will thoroughly evaluate any products that claim to emulate x86 technology, and vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights if we believe they are infringed."
I also asked for comment from Microsoft and Qualcomm officials. As of the time I posted this, there was no word back from either.
Update (June 9): A Qualcomm spokesperson sent the following statement via email:
"Given our recent announcement with ASUS, HP and Lenovo, we found the blog that one of our competitors published on June 8 very interesting. We look forward to the launch of the always connected Windows 10 PC powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC Platform later this year. As showcased at Computex 2017 in conjunction with Microsoft, the Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC Platform brings a true always connected PC experience with support for up to Gigabit LTE connectivity and all-day battery life for sleek, thin and fanless designs. This will change the future of personal computing."
That statement does not address Intel's seeming claim that its patents may be infringed by unnamed vendors doing x86 emulation. When I asked Qualcomm for more on that particular piece, the spokesperson referred me to Microsoft. Microsoft has yet to provide comment (as of 1 pm ET).
Update No. 2 (June 9 8:30 p.m. ET): A Microsoft spokesperson also provided a statement that does not directly address anything about IP/patents:
"Customers have told us they want Always Connected PCs, which will deliver great productivity at a great price, and we are confident in our ability to bring these compelling devices to market working with a wide range of partners."
The spokesperson said Microsoft had nothing to share beyond that.
Several years ago, Microsoft built a version of Windows 8 that ran on ARM processors. But that product, Windows RT, did not provide x86 emulation. Intel x86 emulation makes any Windows on ARM release more potentially marketable, as it will allow users who need particular Win32 apps that have not been ported to ARM to be able to run those apps.
So far, Microsoft has not released to testers its promised Windows 10 on ARM variant, though it recently posted a video highlighting Windows 10 on ARM's performance. That video details exactly how the coming x86 emulation on Windows 10 on ARM is designed to work. (The slide embedded in this post above is from that video.)
At Computex earlier this month, Microsoft and its hardware partners touted the coming Windows 10 "Always Connected" PCs -- running both Intel and ARM processors -- that will include support for the built-in LTE/eSIM technology Microsoft is adding to Windows 10. Acer, Dell, Huawei, HP, Lenovo, and MSI also are building Always Connected Windows 10 PCs that will be Intel-based.
At the same time, the European Space Agency is preparing to put the launcher into operation. A review called "Exploitation Readiness Key Point" (ERKP) analyzes in detail all the aspects associated with the commercialization and mass production of Ariane 6 launchers. The conclusions are expected in March 2018.
As the industrial lead contractor for development and operation of the Ariane 5 and Ariane 6 launchers, ArianeGroup coordinates an industrial network of more than 600 companies in 13 European countries, including more than 350 Small and Medium Enterprises. The ArianeGroup subsidiary Arianespace is responsible for the commercialization of Ariane 6. At the same time, the European Space Agency is preparing to put the launcher into operation.

With the successful conclusion of Maturity Gate 6.2, ArianeGroup and its industrial partners are moving into an important new phase in the development of Ariane 6, a flagship European Space Agency (ESA) program. This review confirmed that the industrial process of Ariane 6 is mature enough to start construction of the first launcher, in line with the program's objectives. Ariane 6 is specifically designed to be able to respond to evolving market demands. It will be a versatile, modular, competitive launcher, available in two versions, Ariane 62 and Ariane 64, in order to guarantee the continuity of European access to space. "Starting the production of the first launcher just three years after the decision of ESA Member States to launch the Ariane 6 program in December 2014 is a major step forward," said Alain Charmeau, CEO of ArianeGroup. "This once again demonstrates the efficiency of the industrial process put in place for the development, production and operation of Ariane 6. The industry is thus meeting its commitments to serve all future Ariane 6 customers, in ESA-coordinated national and European institutions, which are currently preparing the operational launch phase with our subsidiary, Arianespace".This milestone follows on from Maturity Gate 6.1 last April, which validated the technical, industrial and programming characteristics of Ariane 6, enabling launcher development to continue at the anticipated rate. The positive conclusion of this milestone thus made it possible to launch the production of the Ariane 6 ground qualification models.
President-elect Donald Trump may be trying to downplay his relationship with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, but in an October 2015 interview, he openly admitted to having met the despot.
During the radio interview in question with conservative talk show host Michael Savage, Trump said that he had met Putin "one time … a long time ago" and claimed that he "got along with him great."

Trump also praised Putin's atrocities-filled military campaign in Syria, describing it as "wonderful" because the Russians were "really hitting ISIS hard."
When Savage asked if Trump felt he could "do business with Vladimir" if he was elected president, Trump replied, "Yes, I do. I think I would get along very well. I had the Miss Universe pageant, believe it or not, in Moscow two years ago. I got many of the Russian leaders, the top people in Russia, honestly . . . These are people, they are looking to do things."
This isn't the first time that Trump has admitted to having met Putin. His previous occasions included a November 2013 interview with MSNBC's Thomas Roberts, in which Trump said, "I do have a relationship [with Putin], and I can tell you that he's very interested in what we're doing here today."
In an address at the CPAC conference in March 2014, when he bragged that "Putin even sent me a present" after the Miss Universe contest; at an address at the National Press Club in May 2014, he said, "I spoke, indirectly and directly, with President Putin" during his stay in Moscow for the pageant. During a debate on Fox Business News in November 2015, Trump claimed (inaccurately) that he had gotten to know Putin "very well because we were both on 60 Minutes" (which would have been impossible since their footage was shot on different continents).
Once Trump's alleged relationship with Putin became a controversy, however, he changed his tune. In July he told George Stephanopoulos of ABC News that "I have no relationship to — with him. I have no relationship with him." He has repeated these claims ever since, most recently on Twitter.

Twitter may be the story of the day, but Tweeter is threatening to push the social-media company off its perch.
Tweeter Home Entertainment Group Inc. stock is up 523% Friday, trading at the whopping price of 5 cents. It hit as high as 13 cents in morning trade.
Update: Finra halted the Tweeter stock at 12:42 p.m. Eastern, according to the OTC Bulletin Board.
Why did this penny stock jump so much? We don\'t have a precise answer for you except to say that its ticker bears a striking resemblance to a social-media company that recently started chirping about its long-awaited initial public offering.
Twitter , which released its IPO plans on Thursday, will trade under the ticker \”TWTR\” while Tweeter trades with the ticker \”TWTRQ.\”
Investors aren't\'t the only ones confused. As of 12:45 p.m. Eastern Google\'s ticker page for Tweeter showed the company\'s name as TWTR Inc. The page pulled news stories related to Twitter.
Tweeter was a Boston-based consumer electronics chain that went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2007; its operating company eventually liquidated in 2008. But its memory lives on through those raised in the Boston area with cherished memories of going to concerts at the Tweeter Center (now renamed the Comcast Center).
And now its immortality is cemented in what has become a high-profile ticker.
This kind of blooper unsurprisingly caused some grumbles on Twitter itself:

Parking-structure costs have climbed to $100,000 a stall, but that hasn't dissuaded Sound Transit from adding a Kent garage that voters were promised in 2008.
Sound Transit's financial odometer will soon roll past $100,000 per stall to provide parking garages for its growing clientele of park-and-ride customers.
The agency says cost estimates have soared to $65 million, compared with the previous $35 million, to add as many as 550 spaces by 2023 at the Sounder train station in Kent, which already has one big garage.
The project will keep a promise made to voters during the Sound Transit 2 campaign in 2008, then deferred during the Great Recession, to boost park-and-ride capacity next to Sounder commuter trains.
Sounder South's park-and-ride promises Four projects that voters approved in 2008 are heading toward construction. Kent Station: A site will be chosen in November for a $65 million garage adding a net 470 to 550 stalls, to open in 2023, with sidewalk and bicycling improvements. Transit staff will display options and answer questions from 4-7 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 21, at the station, 301 Railroad Ave. N. Auburn Station: Planning is underway for a garage to be added by 2023. Staff will present options and answer questions from 4-7 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 19, at the station, 23 A St. S.W. Sumner Station: Sound Transit will build a garage, sidewalks and lighting, adding a net 505 stalls by 2021, for $52 million. Puyallup Station: Parking capacity will increase by 503 spaces in 2021, in a $60 million project to include car and bike access within a half-mile. Sound Transit filed a condemnation lawsuit in July to compel Puyallup Eagles to sell their lodge. Source: Sound Transit
The new figures average out to $118,000 a space, though the project includes $3 million for improvements unrelated to parking, such as passenger drop-off areas, new bus shelters, walk and bike paths, and illumination.
High land prices and a contractor's market are taking their toll, and the agency aims to surpass the 450 stalls promised in 2008. Transit staff say new Kent figures are based on Sumner and Puyallup parking expansions that will be built sooner. Four sites for the second Kent Station garage are still being studied.
Similar issues are expected to drive up the cost for a second garage at Auburn Station, and contributed to a potential $500 million increase to build a Lynnwood light-rail extension.
The voter-approved Sound Transit 3 plan, featuring eight light-rail extensions, bus-rapid transit and Sounder service, calls for 8,560 more parking stalls across three counties.
The estimated cost of the Kent garage raises questions about whether last year's average estimate in ST3 — $69,000 a space in current dollars — will soar and make the capacity harder to deliver.
Agency spokesman Geoff Patrick said the projection should hold up, since there will also be economic slowdowns during the long, 25-year ST3 program.
Locations matter too, in guessing cost. Using open land in Fife should be cheaper than mixing garages with apartments or retail as envisioned for downtown Everett. Last year's Angle Lake Station garage, on vacant land and bid during a slower economy, was built for $35,000 per stall.
In many regions, the strategy of building station garages triggers second-guessing by pro-transit urbanists.
How high of a subsidy to park at a train station is too high? Should users pay, or does that penalize lower-wage workers? Are parking garages that support driving a wise use of land in the face of high housing costs and climate change?
The answer in Kent: full speed ahead.
“The project, it has to happen,” said Kent Mayor Suzette Cooke. “The cars are now filling up our East Hill neighborhoods. There's no place to put them, besides a parking garage.”
Kent's existing 996 garage and surface stalls fill early, usually around 7 a.m. After that, people park legally and illegally in vast off-site lots, or on side streets. “Hide and ride” parking has occurred near Sounder stations for at least a decade.
But the old downtown is also growing around the station, where new restaurants, a movie theater and shops bring activity. Apartments named “Kent Station,” “Dwell at Kent Station” and “The Platform” promote trackside lifestyles.
Suburbs should supply more of that density, plus bicycling and walking routes, and affordable housing, environmental thinkers say.
“We don't believe that spending $100,000 per parking space in large structured garages is a very good use of transit funding,” said Tim Gould, transportation and land-use chair at Sierra Club Washington.
These new parking garages being built with ST2 and ST3 money should collect fees from users, he said.
Gould said that while locations vary, “cities like Kent may find it difficult to both promote a people-oriented downtown and provide lots of parking by the Sounder station.” More traffic going to bigger parking facilities would make walking nearby less desirable and more dangerous, he said.
Added pressure is coming.
Four more Sounder trips each weekday, two northbound and two southbound, will be added Sept. 25. A faster direct trackway through south Tacoma opens late this year.
Sounder's south-line ridership is projected to grow from 19,000 per weekday last year, to 30,000 boardings in 2025. Beyond that, ST3 will fund longer boarding platforms to match 10-car trains, a 40 percent capacity boost compared with seven-car maximums today.
We already know the parking garages are too small; they do not accommodate the demand,” Cooke said. “That's only going to be exacerbated with time and population.”
Critics have objected that free parking promotes long drives to reach the stations, along a BNSF Railway route that was built decades ago to move freight.
Some 18 percent of Kent Station users live so far out — in exurbs like Covington — that they don't pay Sound Transit taxes.
Another problem is subsidy — to collect $100,000 a space, transit agencies would need to charge $8 per day over a half-century for parking.
“Most vehicles are worth less than these parking spaces,” said Todd Litman, a Victoria, B.C., analyst who publishes as the Victoria Transport Policy Institute. “It would actually be cheaper to give people cars.”
Meanwhile, commuters vote with their wheels and fare cards.
Even on a less-busy Monday, the garage filled by 7:40 a.m., before the last two trains of the morning rush.
Ed Collins, of Ravensdale, and his daughter, Kandiss Reed, drove a half-hour to reach Kent Station, arriving 20 minutes early Monday to find a top-deck space. They spent the time checking messages in the car. Collins says that 50 percent of mornings, he drops her off and drives alone into Seattle.
Another garage, he said, “would solidify my ability to take the Sounder into downtown, and not a hit-and-miss.”
Maya Vengadasalam found a space well before 7 a.m. but said more garage capacity would reduce the stress of uncertainty. She confesses that a handful of times, she parked in the shopping center around the corner, at risk of being fined or towed.
This fall's added service will bring more early trains, and earlier demand for stalls, she said. “I'm assuming more people will start riding.”
Sound Transit says 51 percent of riders drive to Kent Station, but the 12 percent “walk” share includes many who park off-site.
Actually, downtown Kent already offers an additional 713 spaces at an old park-and-ride site off James Street — but it's a half-mile away to the west. And it's two-thirds empty, on average.
Slinging her backpack on, Elizabeth Daniel locked her car there and set out in athletic shoes. Daniel said she enjoys the walk, except on cold, wet days.
“It's pretty much the same amount of time coming here and walking as it takes looking for parking” in a crowded garage, she said.
Litman notes that despite their cost, parking spaces for Sounder are cheaper and more realistic than creating similar capacity by widening Interstate 5.
Sound Transit board member Pete von Reichbauer, a Metropolitan King County Council member from Federal Way, shrugs off objections.
“I regard our parking garages as essential linchpins to the success of our rail program. If people cannot get to the stations and park their cars, they will not use our system,” he said.
The geography around Kent's valley station — where four-lane James and Smith streets climb a long hill to reach where most riders live — makes it especially tough to create bicycle trails and rapid-bus corridors to replace driving.
“The $65 million would be gone in a snap,” Cooke figures. And in Kent, there's no appetite to follow Seattle and create bus-only lanes from general traffic lanes.
Mo. Trans Student's Bathroom Struggle Is History Repeating Itself
Lila Perry's fight for her right to use the girls' bathroom at her Missouri high school echoes similar battles for equal access that marked the broader American civil rights movement.
Nearly 150 students at Hillsboro High School in Missouri staged a walkout on Monday to protest a 17-year-old senior's desire to use the girls' bathroom at school. After coming out as transgender during the last school year, Lila Perry decided she would no longer accept using a segregated, gender-neutral restroom.
Despite the condemnations of many of her peers and their parents, who rallied on school grounds to denounce Perry as some sort of danger to her fellow female students, the teenager has spoken eloquently about the unfolding human rights violation at her school, offering important historical context.
Surrounded by almost 40 supporters gathered Monday to counter the transphobic rally, Perry drew parallels to well-known anti-segregationist, Jim Crow-era battles in the American civil rights movement.
"It wasn't too long ago that white people were saying that they don't feel comfortable sharing a bathroom with a black person, and history repeats itself," Perry told Roche Madden of St. Louis TV station KTVI.
Indeed, the struggle for safe, inclusive access to basic facilities has long been a hallmark of American battles for human rights. While administrators at Hillsboro appear to be making a genuine effort to accomodate Perry, she fairly concluded that being relegated to using only separate, gender-neutral restrooms was an unworkable solution.
"I wasn't hurting anyone and I didn't want to feel segregated out... in the gender-neutral bathroom," Perry told St. Louis TV station KMOV. "I am a girl."
Tall, incisive, and possessed of the determination of an individual who gazes steadily into the eyes of interlocutors, Perry embraced her girlhood at the age of 13, according to Heavy.com. For more than a year, she has presented as her true self, in the feminine clothes that make her happy, with long straight brown hair.
She has already dropped out of the physical education class she began this semester, out of concern for her own safety following escalating protests against her using the girls' locker room.
Nevertheless, protesters against Perry contend that she is not who she says she is. “Boys need to have their own locker room," adult named Jeff Childs told KMOV. "Girls need to have their own locker room and if somebody has mixed feelings where they are, they need to have their own also."
Several local media reports refer to Perry as "still physically a male." Such problematic characterizations expose persistent myths about transgender people — primarily that a person only becomes their true gender upon receiving specific gender-confirming surgeries. In reality, only 33 percent of transgender people have reported undergoing some form of gender-confirming surgery, with 14 percent of transgender women and 21 percent of transgender men telling the Human Rights Campaign last year they are not interested in ever having such surgery.
On a broader scale, Perry's right to use the girls' bathroom comports with Title IX of the federal Education Amendments of 1972. In June, the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice issued a letter on behalf of a transgender boy named Gavin Grimm, declaring that "prohibiting a student from accessing the restrooms that match [the student's] gender identity is prohibited sex discrimination under Title IX." The American Civil Liberties Union is suing Grimm's Virginia high school on the grounds that prohibiting him from using boys' bathrooms segregates, stigmatizes, and disenfranchises him based on his gender.
Indeed, trans advocates nationwide have pointed out that separate facilities stigmatize trans youth, while failing to accomplish the commonly stated purpose of protecting student safety and privacy. In fact, as Perry's case demonstrates, trans students can easily find their own privacy violated, while research has shown that it is trans people who are far more likely to face physical or verbal violence in a restroom, as compared to their cisgender (nontrans) peers.
Perry's struggle also exposes the health dangers that can arise from such misguided policies. After refusing to be segregated to a gender-neutral bathroom — on the grounds that she is not gender-neutral, but rather a girl — Perry suggested to Missouri TV news reporters that she would simply try not to use the bathroom at school altogether.
But when transgender people forgo such relief for lack of inclusive access and fear of discrimination, they may put their health in jeopardy.
Avoiding using the bathroom can lead to urinary tract infections and chronic constipation, and if the problem persists, even more perilous conditions like early-onset diabetes, hypothyroidism, Hirschsprung's Disease, and inflammatory bowel disease may arise. These realities are so serious that when the Department of Labor issued instructions for businesses seeking to integrate transgender individuals into the workplace in June, the federal agency specifically cited bathroom access for transgender people as a matter of "health and safety.”
Calls to Dr. Aaron Cornman, the Superintendent of Hillsboro Schools in Missouri, for comment regarding the officials' rationale for segregating Perry into a gender-neutral restroom, were not returned by press time.
Perry's linking of transgender struggles for access with the broader American civil rights movement complements the views of notable leaders in the African-American civil rights leaders like the late Julian Bond, a strong advocate for LGBT rights. Bond was the former chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the first president of the Southern Poverty Law Center.
"Sometimes it is the simplest of ordinary acts that can change the way we act and the way we think," Bond presciently noted in his classic speech on October 11, 2009, at the National Equality March for LGBT rights in Washington, D.C. "Civil rights are positive legal prerogatives, the right to equal treatment under the law. These are rights shared by everyone. There is no one in the United States who does not share or enjoy these rights."
Formula 1 enters a brave new world in 2014, embracing energy efficiency through a new engine design, changes to the cars and a fuel limit.
But the new rules, which aim to reduce fuel consumption by 35%, have so far had a bumpy ride.
A plan to switch from the current 2.4-litre V8s to 1.6-litre turbo-charged V6s is going ahead despite the vocal opposition of F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone - but not before the original plans for four-cylinder engines were revised to soothe Ferrari's objections.
The biggest visible change will be at the front - the high noses that have become de rigueur in recent years will be outlawed
Likewise, a proposal to alter fundamentally the philosophy by which cars are designed was abandoned after teams said they could achieve the same efficiency gains with tweaks to the current rules, reducing both costs and the risk of the new rules being a mistake.
So, straight fours became V6s and a major change to car aerodynamics was abandoned - that was already two big changes to the original plans for a new 'green' F1.
Then, on Wednesday, F1's governing body the FIA put out a statement saying: "Changes made to bodywork design, originally aimed at reducing drag and downforce for increased efficiency, have reverted to 2012 specification."
Was this another change of tack? Was the much-vaunted 'green' F1 being abandoned? Had Ecclestone quietly won another political battle with FIA president Jean Todt?
Well, no, as it turns out.
The choice of wording was perhaps a touch misleading, but it refers to ongoing attempts to ensure the new rules meet their original targets - which were to ensure the new cars in 2014 are no more than five seconds slower than they were in 2010 as well as being much more efficient.
As the teams began work on the new designs, simulating the car layouts and projected engine performance, it began to become apparent that lap times might well be slower than had been intended.

So teams were tasked with looking independently at what elements of current car design could be maintained without losing sight of the intent of the new rules to produce aerodynamic downforce with as little trade-off in drag as possible.
The FIA's initial intention had been to strip the cars of all the extraneous bits of curved bodywork that have begun to sprout in various parts of the car, on the assumption that these must be inefficient. But as the effect of these parts was investigated, it turned out they were not as pernicious as at first thought.
So, for example, 'turning vanes' - the curved bits of bodywork that sprout behind the front wheels or under the raised noses - are very efficient. That is, they produce downforce but very little drag.
Likewise, the wide front wings that were introduced as part of the last major rule change in 2009 will stay, albeit they will be a little narrower than they are now.
By contrast, some teams were campaigning to keep what is known as the lower rear beam wing - a downforce-producing device at the bottom of the rear wing where it is attached to the back of the car. But this turned out to be very 'draggy', so it will be dropped as planned.
But the key point is this - the main visual and philosophical changes that were planned for the cars in 2014 have been retained.
So how will they look?
The biggest visible change will be at the front - the high noses that have become de rigueur in recent years will be outlawed.
Fast fact Of 20 races in 2012, 10 were won from pole
This is fundamentally for safety reasons - high noses are considered more dangerous when they hit another car because of the increased likelihood of driver injury, and also make it more likely that a car will be launched in an impact. But it will also restrict downforce and make the cars slower.
How much lower will the noses be? In 2012, F1 cars had a maximum front nose height of 550mm above the floor of the car. In 2014, that is being reduced to 185mm - a reduction in height of 365mm.
Likewise, although the wide front wings will stay, they will be reduced in overall width from 1800mm (the same as the maximum width of the car) to 1650mm.
This will almost certainly fundamentally alter the overall aerodynamics of the cars.
Airflow over the car stems from the front wing, as the first part to hit the air. Designers are currently focused on using the ends of the wings to turn air around the outside of the front wheels. But in 2014 there will be 7cm of front wheel outside the wing, so getting the air to go around it will be that much more difficult.
This challenge will be made even harder because of new rules restricting what can be done with the front wing end-plates, the vertical bits at the outside edge of the wing.

Less obviously, but also important in the context of the last couple of years, will be a new rule governing exhaust exits.
Using exhaust gases for aerodynamic effect has become a central feature of F1 car design since 2010.
In 2011, so-called exhaust-blown diffusers, where the exhausts pipes were situated on the rear floor of the car and the engine programmed to blow gases out of them at all times, gained the top teams at least a second a lap.
For 2012, these were banned, engine mapping restricted and exhaust outlets moved forwards on the car and higher up. But teams still managed to use the gases to enhance aerodynamics by directing them at the gap between the floor and the rear wheels using what is known as the 'Coanda' effect.
Red Bull's progress in this area in late September was decisive in Sebastian Vettel beating Ferrari's Fernando Alonso to the drivers' championship.
But for 2014 there will be no more 'Coanda' effect - exhausts will have to exit between 3-5cm forward of the centre line of the rear wheels and no more than 25cm from the centre line of the car. From there, it will be impossible to blow them at the edges of the floor.
Equally, the overall efficiency targets will remain the same - whereas now use of fuel is free, it will be metered from 2014. Currently, cars use about 150kg of fuel (about 195 litres) in a Grand Prix; in 2014, they will be allowed to consume no more than 100kg (130l).
In summary then, the revolution is still very much underway; it's just the fine print that has changed.
When Romanian hacker “Guccifer” breached Hillary Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal's email account in 2013, it set off an explosive chain of events among a tight circle of Clinton family aides – including one “confidential assistant” whose extensive role in managing some of the former secretary's mobile devices and computer security requests is only now becoming clear.
The details were contained in the latest document dump of FBI files on Clinton's personal email use. The FBI chose late Friday afternoon to release nearly 200 highly redacted pages of so-called “302” files from the bureau's investigation, a release that quickly became overshadowed by the impending presidential debate Monday.
NEW TONIGHT: 2nd FBI-Clinton document dump on a Friday this month--Continues pattern of holiday/weekend releases:https://t.co/VHtYLHAh13 pic.twitter.com/tGmsCfE44a — Fox News Research (@FoxNewsResearch) September 24, 2016
But the files included new details of the tech intervention by Clinton aide Huma Abedin and Clinton Foundation official Justin Cooper – and a third individual, a Hillary Clinton aide named Monica Hanley.
Hanley was interviewed twice by the FBI, on Jan. 11 and June 23. Working for Hillary Clinton as a “confidential assistant,” Hanley joined the State Department in 2009 as Hillary Clinton began her job as secretary of state. Previously, the 35-year-old worked as an intern for Clinton while she served as a U.S. senator for New York.
In the released documents, Hanley emerged as the go-to staffer often tasked with finding replacements to satisfy Clinton's chosen use of non-secure BlackBerries. Hanley stated she tried to find BlackBerries for sale on eBay and admitted that she made a trip to a mall in Virginia to try to find devices for sale.
Hanley noted a “coffee incident” ruined one of the Clinton's devices.
In her interviews, Hanley told the FBI that during her time at the State Department, she learned “specifically how to handle and transport classified information/paper but could not recall who provided the training.”
Two emails from Hanley were marked classified with a c for “confidential,” the lowest level of classification. Fox News first reported some of the emails contained classified markings despite Clinton's public claims.
The FBI document said “Hanley received a Top Secret/SCI clearance at DoS.” Despite the training, during one trip to Russia, Hanley was specifically criticized for leaving a classified document in a hotel suite she shared with Clinton during the trip. “Hanley was informed by DS (Department of State) that the briefing book and document should have never been in the suite,” the document said.
She was also involved in the response to the hack by Guccifer, whose real name is Marcel Lehel Lazar.
It was during her second interview with the FBI on June 23 that Hanley finally revealed details of a conference call she had with Abedin and top Clinton Foundation fundraiser Cooper as they scrambled “over concerns related to a reported hack by Sidney Blumenthal's email account” in the spring of 2013, first reported by The Smoking Gun.
In the latest documents, the FBI redacted another individual's name who apparently was on that conference call.
Cooper, who recently testified before the House oversight committee, was responsible for running the clintonemail.com networks. In addition to his work for the Clinton Foundation, Cooper is listed as a senior adviser to Teneo Holdings, a private investment banking firm worth billions and founded by former President Bill Clinton and longtime adviser Doug Band.
The FBI file says Hanley told the FBI that after the conference call, “Cooper provided Hanley an Apple Mac laptop from the Clinton Foundation, which Hanley took home to her apartment (redacted.) It was noted that “Hanley created an archive of Hillary R. Clinton's hdr22@clintonemail.com as a result of concerns about the reported hack of Blumenthal's account.
Hanley stated that Abedin selected the new name of the email account, hrod17@clintonemail.com.
In her Jan. 11 statement to the FBI, Hanley initially said the computer given to her by Cooper was a MacAir and that it “took several days” for the transfer of emails to the laptop to be performed in her apartment. Hanley also testified in January that she “recalled transferring the emails to a thumb-drive but could not recall what happened to the thumb-drive.”
However, in her June 23 interview, Hanley changed her statement to say the computer was “likely a Pro (MacPro) because it had an ethernet port and a thumb drive portal.”
In addition, Hanley added that “she thought she might have given the thumb drive to Abedin” when she transitioned to (Redacted) as she provided Abedin with several items.
And in that second interview, Hanley suddenly remembered that the Clinton Foundation laptop given to her by Cooper to archive the secretary's emails was still in her possession in 2014 “after she was not working for Clinton.”
Hanley stated that she contacted Platte River Networks (PRN) on her own accord and spoke with (redacted.) That computer was never recovered by the FBI.
Unlike Cooper at the recent House hearing, Paul Combetta of Platte River Networks took the Fifth in refusing to answer questions regarding his use of “Bleachbit” to scrub Clinton's email headers in March 2015 despite a congressional order to preserve the records.
The FBI formally concluded that Lazar did not get into Clinton's private servers but assessed that other bad actors including Russia and Ukraine used “brute” force to launch cyberattacks again her networks immediately after Lazar's breach of Blumenthal's AOL account.
We all knew this was coming.
The New England Patriots won a Super Bowl last year, and what should have been an offseason of celebration and good feelings became one embroiled in litigation and controversy. The Deflategate mess, followed by the four-game suspension of team leader and New England prince/demigod Tom Brady, meant that the Patriots spent their offseason reading headlines calling them cheaters and bums.
Tom Brady's suspension being overturned was the final straw — in the eyes of the Patriots and their fans, Judge Richard M. Berman showed the whole NFL investigation to be tainted.
They're angry. And on Sunday, they took that anger out on the Jacksonville Jaguars.
The Jaguars kept it reasonable until the second quarter, and then the Patriots went for the jugular. The final score was 51-17. Tom Brady completed 33 of 42 passes for 358 yards and two touchdowns, including his 400th career touchdown. LeGarrette Blount rushed in another three touchdowns. It was a destruction. A message game. Not for poor Jacksonville, a team that didn't sign up for this, but for the rest of the league.
This has happened before. The Patriots spent the start of the 2007 season answering questions about Spygate, reading comments and headlines calling them cheaters.
They promptly went undefeated in the regular season, destroying every opponent right up to the Super Bowl, when Eli Manning and the Giants shocked them and ruined their perfect year.
The 2015 Patriots had that look on Sunday. They beat you in different ways now. Eight years ago, the Randy Moss deep ball was unguardable, and Wes Welker in the slot gave the Patriots a pass attack that was impossible to defend. This year, the Patriots are much more precise, with tons of short routes and side-to-side movement. They also have Rob Gronkowski now, a human Jolt Cola with a 6'6″ frame.
The two things that remain the same are Bill Belichick and Tom Brady, two men who know better than anyone in the league how to take a negative headline and use it to their advantage. The Patriots aren't cheaters to Belichick and Brady, no. To them, they're victims of the league's jealousy. (Or at least that's how their selling it to their team.)
However they're doing it, it's working. The Patriots are clicking. We're only at Week 3, but right now, they look like the best team in the NFL.
And you can call them cheaters and say they all deserve to be thrown out of the league, but remember: Your words only appear to make them stronger.

Inside the abandoned asylums of America: Haunting images of the rusting gurneys and operating tables used for terrifying Nazi-style experiments

From rusting gurneys to haunting 'operating' chairs, these crude and terrifying medical apparatus have been left to decay inside some of the world's abandoned asylums.
They shed new light on one of the darkest eras of medical history when patients were subjected to Nazi-style experiments in the misguided aim of finding a cure.
From the UK to the U.S., t hese once-grand, but often mysterious institutions have been brought to life once more in a new collection of photographs that serve as reminder of the dark goings-on inside.

Author Eric Vernor has compiled the collection for a new book called Haunted Asylums which offers a chilling glimpse of the world behind the closed doors of these sanatoriums.
Mr Vernor, 40, from Fort Wayne, Indiana, has published many works on the darker side of humanity and was inspired to explore these often taboo buildings on the inside.
Now he has compiled this fascinating collection of photographs taken by those brave enough to venture inside the buildings which in their heyday most wanted to stay away from.
Eric said: 'My inspiration was from watching the movie Session 9. It is a horror movie, but based on a real case and filmed at Danvers State Hospital, which is in Haunted Asylums.
'Danvers is the subject of many short stories H.P. Lovecraft's noir horror fiction from the 1920s. I am not only fascinated by the tales of ghosts in these places, but also the beautiful architecture of these enormous structures.
'I love the Gothic influence from past used in the late 1800s, and the woodwork you can still see in some of these places. It is a real shame they are in such a state of disrepair.'

Unimaginable: Patients were confined in restraining devices, sent to solitary confinement, beaten by brutal wardens and violent inmates, given electroshock therapy and subjected to untested drug experimentation
Eric said in his quest to show the state and atmosphere of the sanatoriums today he hoped to be both bizarre and educational.
He said: 'This particular book is to not only share the terror of the real history of these places that claimed to exist to help people, yet did far more permanent trauma then people could possibly imagine.
'It is sad, but true that almost all the great many famous horror films all came from true events in the past.
'When one considers, for example, these decaying hospitals' former use of less than moral practices, it becomes clear that truth is more unsettling than fiction.
'In the early years of psychiatric institutionalisation, mentally ill patients were subjected to unorthodox cruel treatment and restraints that were said to function as 'cures,' but were really nothing more than Nazi-styled medical experimentation.
'For example, U.S. state institutions in 1923 saw the birth of the Board of Eugenics, which allowed for the 'sterilisation of all feeble-minded, insane, epileptics, habitual criminals, moral degenerates, and sexual perverts who are a menace to society.
'The board reasoned that the gene pool would be stronger if what they termed defective patients were not allowed to breed.
'As such, sterilisation was used as a condition of release from state institutions or as punishment. A total of 65,000 forced sterilisations were performed in the country from 1917 to when the board was finally abolished in 1983.'

Spooky: Mr Vernor says the atmosphere of these places enough to justify the reports of the apparitions and strange tales of ghostly encounters
As the photographs in 'Haunted Asylums' show, much of the equipment seems to have been left in the buildings and can still be found there offering echoes of perhaps a sinister past.
Eric said: 'Other barbaric treatments, including patients being confined in restraining devices, solitary confinement, beatings by both brutal wardens and violent inmates, electroshock therapy, untested drug experimentation, and lobotomies, were performed until the 1970s.
'Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a procedure in which electric currents are passed through the brain, deliberately triggering a brief seizure to cause changes in brain chemistry that can immediately reverse symptoms of certain mental illnesses.
'Sadly, my research shows that even today, in the U.S. alone, more than 100,000 people are electro-shocked every year, the majority of them elderly.'
Based on the events that happened in these buildings and because of the nature of the people there, Eric said he remained an open-minded sceptic as to whether there was any 'paranormal' presence.
He said: 'The residual impressions of the past would certainly be strong in a building where mentally ill people were housed and where, if provable, such psychic disturbances would be common.
'Hospitals have long been places where the spirits of the dead are said to linger. Are there actually lost and anguished souls trapped within these abandoned buildings?
'Are they truly the personalities of those who once lived in agony and despair? Or are these feelings simply those of the visitors, projected by the idea of spooky places due to films and campfire tales?
'The atmosphere of these places alone is more than enough to justify the reports of the apparitions and strange tales of ghostly encounters. I leave it up to you, my reader, to decide for themselves.'

Top Democratic politicians and bundlers have harsh reviews for the job performance of Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez, calling him unexciting and in need of drastic improvement.
Under Perez, the Democrats have not won any special House elections, and the DNC has struggled in fundraising despite the historic unpopularity of President Donald Trump.
The press slammed Perez for a series of vulgar comments in the spring about the Republican Party, and the Nebraska Democratic Party chair blamed him for losing the Omaha mayoral race because of his pro-choice litmus test for candidates.
Democratic Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (Ill.) told the Hill that "there's a lot of room for improvement" by Perez.
"Part of the problem is that when you're a parachutist into the party [and] you didn't work yourself up the party chain and in the trenches, I think you're going to have problems, especially with [what] is still a very divisive and contested match," Gutiérrez said Wednesday.
Perez was the favorite of establishment figures like Barack Obama to take over the DNC after a rocky 2016 for the party, winning out over Rep. Keith Ellison (D., Minn.), who became vice chair. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D., Fla.) was forced out as chair last year after evidence surfaced of party higher-ups showing favoritism toward Hillary Clinton over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) in the Democratic presidential primary.
Perez has also taken shots for underwhelming fundraising results. In July, the DNC raised only $3.8 million compared to the Republican National Committee's $10.2 million that same month. In August, the DNC raised only $4.4 million to the RNC's $7.3 million, and the DNC's debt increased to $4.1 million.
"A lot of us feel like there's nothing exciting, nothing invigorating coming from that building and particularly from Tom Perez," said one top Democratic bundler, who told the Hill that Perez did not coordinate the first meeting with fundraisers until "several weeks ago."
"I've never heard from him. Not once," the bundler said. "If you want to show strength, you personally reach out to all the big fundraisers."
Perez took criticism for taking a side position teaching at Brown University as a senior fellow, despite calling the DNC chairmanship a "full-time job."
"Being DNC chair is a full-time job," one strategist said. "There isn't time for side gigs."
An Australian politician is under investigation after allegedly travelling to Syria to join Kurdish forces in the fight against Islamic extremists.
Matthew Gardiner, 43, the head of the Labor party in the Northern Territory and a former army soldier, is believed to have made contact with Kurdish fighters via social media and travelled 7,000 miles to join them.
The government said Mr Gardiner, who served in Somalia in the 1990s, faces prison for his actions, even though the Kurdish forces and the Australian military are both engaged in the fight against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil).
Tony Abbott, the Australian prime minister, has been a staunch advocate of the international fight against Isil and was the first leader to commit troops to the US-led coalition .
Peter Dutton, the federal immigration minister, said he did not want to see Australians killed "regardless of whether they are well intentioned".
"We don't want to see cowboys running off whether or not they have been trained or whether they were part of the Australian defence force," he told Sky News.
"These people who run off on their own cause believing that they are doing some good when potentially they are getting in harm's way. If we have to divert resources to support them or if they become captive themselves, it is just not helpful."
Labor, which is in opposition in the Northern Territory, said it had sacked Mr Gardiner as president of the territory branch of the party and had suspended his membership.
The government this week said about 90 Australians are believed to have travelled to Iraq and Syria to join militant groups, though the vast majority are Muslim radicals who have joined Isil.
Mr Gardiner, a former army engineer, recently resigned his job has a union leader in the Northern Territory, which has a population of about 250,000.
The Australian federal police confirmed that Mr Gardiner was under investigation.
"The AFP is aware of this matter," a spokesperson said. "As this matter is part of an ongoing investigation it is not appropriate to comment further."
George Brandis, the federal attorney-general, said it was illegal for Australian citizens to support any armed group in Syria and those that go to fight "face up to life in prison upon your return to Australia".
"We know there are some Australians who think they've made the right choice in becoming involved in overseas conflicts, but that choice only adds to the suffering in Syria and Iraq and it's putting those Australians and others in mortal danger," a spokesman said.
"There are safer, legal ways of helping the people affected by these conflicts than travelling overseas to fight."
WISCONSIN -- If you've downloaded Pokémon GO on your smartphone in recent days and are beginning your foray into community-based "augmented reality" games, Scott Anderson, your Milwaukee Regional Editor from Patch.com has a few tips for you.
Scott doesn't play Pokémon GO, but he's played Ingress - another GPS-enabled game that requires players to get out into the community to explore landmarks, public places and area neighborhoods.
Scott wants you to be safe. Here are 10 tips - some of which he's learned the hard way !
Here are his 10 tips to stay safe while playing.
1. Avoid traveling with your eyes fixated on your mobile device. If you're moving in your car during gameplay, you put yourself and others at risk.
2. If you're traveling in an unfamiliar area, let someone know where you will be.
3. People may think you're a suspicious person. There have been notable stories where players had the police called on them because they were in a public place at odd hours.
4. If the police stop you on a report of being suspicious, understand that community concerns are greater than your gameplay concerns. Calmly explain that you're just playing a video game and show police you're willing to listen to them when they stop you.
5. Know park hours. You can get cited by local authorities, and most communities have park hours posted near the entrance.
6. It's just a game. Remember, you may have opponents during gameplay, but they are not your 'enemies.'
7. If gameplay requires car travel, download an intel map of the area you're going to play, and plan your route. Pull off the road into a parking lot or parking space and commit to walking to your destination a short distance away if gameplay requires you to do so.
8. Walk! Most GPS-enabled games require you to get out into the community. They're designed to get your body up and moving - and in better shape.
9. Bring a friend. Pokémon GO is designed as a social game, and you'll end up being safer and having more fun in the long run when you play with friends.
10. Manage your battery life. Your phone is your primary communication device in the community. Be sure to have a phone charger/charging cord with you or stored in your vehicle. Invest in a portable battery charger and make sure to periodically charge it and have it handy during times of extended gameplay.
Threats to police and public officials started within hours of the Jan. 26 death of armed militant Robert "LaVoy" Finicum and they haven't stopped, officials said.
"We're going to shoot to kill," one anonymous caller said in a message left for Gov. Kate Brown the morning after Finicum died.
"You killed an unarmed rancher so now one of you must die," said another caller to her office.
The message referred to Finicum, 54, who was shot by state troopers as he tried to evade arrest. Finicum and other leaders of the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge were on their way from the bird sanctuary to a community meeting that Tuesday afternoon when troopers and FBI agents stopped them. All but Finicum surrendered. Two troopers shot three times as he reached for what investigators later said was a concealed loaded pistol.
Reports of Finicum's death started the cascade of threats and they surged again when investigators earlier this month announced the details of how Finicum died.
State troopers, FBI agents and federal officials "will be murdered in retaliation," a Tillamook County man wrote on his Facebook days after the shooting. The man raged against police and urged more of them be killed.
"If they live in your neighborhood, burn their houses down, with their wives and kids, after their lights go out," the man wrote.
The Deschutes County Sheriff's Office, which investigated Finicum's death, this week released a sampling of threats collected by investigators. The threats contain sometimes vile language. Police redacted the names and other identifying information from the records.
Authorities said at a news conference in Bend earlier this month that they had documented up to 80 threats against police officers and others. As a result, investigators haven't identified the officers or FBI agents involved in the traffic stop that led to Finicum's death.
"Those officers have very real threats again them," Deschutes County Sheriff Shane Nelson said at the time.
Oregon State Police are investigating the threats. The governor's office reported Friday that threats related to the refuge takeover and Finicum shooting continue to come in against Brown. They all get turned over to police.
One email to Brown demanded the release of refuge occupiers jailed on federal charges and that the officers involved in Finicum's death be indicted. Otherwise, the writer said, "I am going to begin returning fire."
A week after the Finicum shooting, one writer asked in an email to police whether troopers and FBI agents had used an illegal roadblock to trap the Arizona rancher.
"If this is so, let me know so we can set up road blocks and kill OSP and FBI because they stand against what we believe in," the messenger wrote.
In a Facebook post, another person offered $1,000 for the identities of the officers involved in the shooting.
Authorities learned this week that some people are aggressively hunting the identities of the troopers who fired the fatal shots at Finicum. An online radio broadcaster publicly identified a trooper, whose name and home address soon found their way onto militant Facebook postings. State police wouldn't comment, but law enforcement sources confirmed the trooper had no role in Finicum's death.
Malheur County District Attorney Dan Norris, who oversaw the Finicum investigation, said such acts underscore the need to continue to keep the officers' names confidential. A bill to protect the troopers' names faltered in the Legislature and the governor has said she expects their names to be released "in due course" but offered no timetable.
The records also revealed that the Crook County Sheriff's Office four days after the Finicum shooting took a call from a trooper's wife.
"Sometime between late night and early morning, someone spray painted the words OSP, Cop, with arrows pointing to their residence," an agency official reported in an email.
One person said in an email to the Deschutes County Sheriff's Office that the officers involved in the Finicum shooting were lying.
"All of you will pay on earth or when God judges you. That, sir, you can count on," the email said.
Another email questioned how well Americans understand the law, concluding, "If they even taste of it, the law says war is levied on the people's portion of civil government, and they must face death."

The advisory board is a response to the recent DNC hack and subsequent email leak. | AP Photo DNC creates cybersecurity advisory board following hack
The Democratic National Committee is creating a four-member cybersecurity advisory board, according to a memo obtained by POLITICO on Thursday.
The advisory board is a response to the recent DNC hack and subsequent email leak that led to the resignation of former Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other top DNC officials.
Story Continued Below
“To prevent future attacks and ensure that the DNC's cybersecurity capabilities are best-in-class, I am creating a Cybersecurity Advisory Board composed of distinguished experts in the field,” interim DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile wrote in a memo. “The Advisory Board will work closely with me and the entire DNC to ensure that the party is prepared for the grave threats it faces—today and in the future.”
Members include Rand Beers, former Department of Homeland Security acting secretary; Nicole Wong, former deputy chief technology officer of the U.S. and a former technology lawyer for Google and Twitter; Aneesh Copra, co-founder of Hunch Analytics and former chief technology officer of the U.S.; and Michael Sussmann, a partner in privacy and data security at the law firm Perkins Coie and a former Justice Department cybercrime prosecutor.
In the memo, Brazile detailed that committee's response to WikiLeak's email dump on the eve of the Democratic National Convention last month. Some emails contained personally identifiable information for supporters and others, she noted, adding that the release was intended to inflict maximum damage against the Democrats and presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
Brazile said the committee's legal counsel has reviewed the information to determine who was impacted and how, and maintained that the DNC will inform the individuals who were affected next week.
“Those individuals receiving the data breach notice also will receive offers of assistance to help mitigate any threats to their financial security. Details concerning the breach and other pertinent information for victims will soon be available,” she said. “We understand that this incident is alarming to all who may be affected, and I share your anger at those who committed and abetted this act. Our focus now is preventing future attacks, strengthening our capabilities, and helping protect those whose data was stolen.”
Supported by BMC and MEF expedition grants, Sam Fansworth and George Ullrich joined Mason Earle (USA) and Siebe Vanhee (Belgium) in putting up a new route on Venezuela's Amuri Tepui.
A major feature on the south face of Amuri, three days jungle trek from the Indian village of Pemon, is the Salto Tuyuren, a waterfall dropping free from the rim of the summit plateau.
Behind it the 500m wall is estimated to overhang around 100m.
Dedicated Venezuelan activists, Anne and John Arran, who climbed the first route on this Tepui, did not have time to try a line directly behind the fall, but felt it had the potential to be the hardest and most overhanging big wall free climb on earth.
Earle, Farnsworth, Ullrich and Vanhee chose a line starting just left of the waterfall, accessing it via a convenient catwalk, avoiding initial vegetated pitches for which the tepuis are well known.
The team then spent 15 days establishing Kids with Guns (5.13a or E6 6c, and A3).
The route was completed in 21 pitches, nearly all on immaculate and wildly steep quartz-arenite, a type of old hard sandstone.
Technical face climbing and short sections of loose rock made route finding difficult and after 12 days they'd only reached half-height.
However, crossing the major roof system boosted moral and, above, they made faster progress, traversing right across the upper face, behind the waterfall, to an exit on the rim.
Portaledges were used, and every pitch required an impressively exposed abseil and a bracing start each morning, swinging out 20m before beginning the jumar to regain the previous day's high point.
Lack of time, food and water meant that the initial project, a totally free ascent, had to be shelved, though the climbers feel the entire route would go free. The team had plenty of talent for their ideal: Ullrich leads E9, Earle 5.13+, and Vanhee 8c.
As mentioned above, the Arrans made the first ascent on the tepui in 2008, climbing a steep line well left of the waterfall, which they named Amurita (E7 6b).
Last year another route was added closer to the waterfall. Wacupuro Amuri was put up over 13 days by two Venezuelans at A4 and 5.12+.
Both routes are so steep they stay dry until reaching the summit.

Bonafide TV genius and Lord of the Geeks Dan Harmon is a man of many talents. Namely, being a whip smart cheeky bugger who's got a lot of opinions and ain't afraid to voice them.
The showrunner was famously fired in 2012 from ‘Community‘, the cult show he created, after rumoured tensions between himself and NBC over his management style and failure to attract bulk ratings.
After a tepid fourth season, he was rehired for the fifth, and later guided the show into its final and (imo) triumphant sixth season over at the show's new home Yahoo!.
While fans degenerated the Harmon-less fourth season, it gave birth to something that'll perhaps better stand the test of time: Harmontown.
If you're not familiar with it, Harmontown is an insanely popular podcast starring Dan and ‘Whose Line is it Anyway‘ veteran Jeff Davis. Beyond that, it gets hard to define. Mostly they just talk a lot of shit. It's like an unscripted live comedy show, where a collection of nerds gather to hear Harmon mouth off about stuff and play Dungeons & Dragons with Spencer Crittenden, a former audience member who was plucked out of the crowd one night and is now a bonafide celebrity, albeit a cult one.
“I think it's a cricket lighthouse for people who didn't excel at gym,” Harmon tells PEDESTRIAN.TV over the phone from LA. “Do they call it gym in Australia?”
I reply we call it P.E. – physical education.
“Well, it's people more of the P.U. than the P.E. demographic,” he says. “Honestly though, that puts too fine a point on it. There's probably people out there that are like, ‘I'm so clean and athletic that I always feel out of place', and I would never want that person to feel bad about being there. Harmontown is a church for the alienated.”
Harmon and Davis performing at a Harmontown show.
In 2013, Harmontown hit the road across America with a tour that was later the subject of a 2014 documentary of the same name. Three years later and the show is still going strong, coming to Australia later this year as part of the Sydney Opera Houses‘ hot content festival, BINGEFEST.
Over those years the podcast evolved from a platform for Harmon to vent his anger at being fired by NBC, to creating a space where people from all walks of life are accepted, for exactly who they are.
“I think it began as some very, very narcissistic kind of therapy session,” Harmon says. “All of the providing was my anxiety, and I was very angry and selling how I didn't really like the world. And the world didn't deserve me and that kind of stuff.
“It definitely progressed into having a lot of guests and talking to other people, because for one thing, even if I had stayed that angry and that alienated I would have gotten bored with that. But also, I think doing the show was therapeutic in that sense, because once you have enough people come up on that stage and say ‘I feel the same way you do', you start to take on this different role where you go, ‘Okay, we're going to use this time while I'm on stage not just defending myself but reaching out'. So over time it definitely evolved from defending to reaching out.”
He tells the story of one particularly memorable guest who came on the show to talk about her roommate Adam Erkelberg – who confusingly played a sometimes villain, sometimes hero character on the Harmontown called Adam Goldberg – but ended up talking about her encasement fetish.
“She just came there to talk about being his roommate, but then we started to get to know her, and then all of a sudden she was revealing that she belonged to this really specific category of fetish that had to do with total encasement in nylon or spandex, that kind of stuff.
“I just loved the fact that she was totally unassuming and wasn't trying to prove anything or defend anything. It spoke to that religion that we all like to worship, which is that I think every single one of us is worthwhile. And the more she talked about it, the more supported she got from the audience. And I thought, I'm very proud of this, because I don't know how often this is possible for everybody.”
The running theme in everything Harmon's done – from ‘Community' to Harmontown to acclaimed cartoon series ‘Rick & Morty‘ – is the creation of an unlikely family of misfits.
Rick & Morty.
That remains true to his upcoming and yet-to-be-named show about eSports for YouTube. All I can find out about it online is that it's a half-hour comedy series following a newly formed team of eSports players trying to make it in the cutthroat world of competitive gaming.
I ask Harmon if it's going to be a second ‘Community', in that you've got a bunch of misfits in a situation that can lend itself to outlandish experiences.
“Oh yeah,” he replies. “If I have it my way, [with] the stuff I bring to the table. Definitely when we're talking about the characters I find myself saying, ‘Oh, she's sort of an Annie in this regard, but then she also presents herself as more of a Britta when she's interacting with this person', and I do find myself getting really excited by assembling another unlikely family. But at the same time, I'm aware that I'm part of an unlikely family.”
He's referring to the team that's putting this show together, which includes “the girls” from Rick & Morty “who're huge eSports enthusiasts” and eSportscaster (yes, those exist) Michele Morrow.
“[Morrow is] the one who actually pitched the show with her friend [and uber popular gamer] Jesse [Cox], and they've had all this inside information and insights into that world,” says Harmon.
He thinks. “Yes, between you and me, I would love for it to be new ‘Community' on YouTube. But I feel that way about everything.”
Troy (Donald Glover) and Abed (Danny Pudi) in ‘Community'.
It wouldn't be an interview with Dan Harmon without asking about a potential ‘Community' movie, which would complete the show's warrior cry of “six seasons and a movie” and satisfy the fans who've invested so much energy into keeping this show going.
The will it / won't it happen has been consuming conversations for years. If my memory is correct, the last we heard about the Community movie was Joel McHale (Jeff) saying in August 2015 that Harmon just needs to write a script and *most* of the cast would be on board (more of that below).
I ask Harmon to give it to me in percentage terms. How likely is it a movie will actually happen?
“I live in a world where it's 100% likely, because why wouldn't that movie eventually happen,” he says. “It's just a question if by the time it happens, will it be the right time. But I feel like, all other things being equal, it will definitely happen. But absolutely not, I do not have a concept about what the movie would be, because I don't know if it would end up getting written in the year 2040, in which case it probably shouldn't be about them studying for finals.”
Two days after this interview, Harmon does a Reddit AMA which paints a slightly different picture.
So once again, who the bloody hell knows. McHale made it sound like *if* the notoriously deadline-phobic Dan were to write a script worthy of the movie, then everyone else would jump to it, but that doesn't take into account the former cast members' substantially larger fees and busier schedules.
“I couldn't imagine doing a proper version of the movie without Donald Glover, he's one of many pieces that'd have to come together,” says Harmon.
“It would only be worth doing if the family could get back together and just really knock it out of the park.”
But Glover – who's spoken frequently about being done with his character, Troy – is pretty tied up these days with his new show ‘Atlanta‘, not to mention being cast as young Lando in the new Star Wars film.
Then you've got John Oliver (Dr Ian Duncan), who's busier these days skewering American politics and policy on HBO‘s ‘Last Week Tonight‘; Allison Brie (Annie) lending her voice to Netflix‘s darkly comic ‘BoJack Horseman‘; and Ken Jeong (Chang) starring in a sitcom about himself that's literally called ‘Dr. Ken‘.
On the other hand, when I asked Oliver last year if he'd be down to do a ‘Community' movie, he said absolutely and then accused me of being his agent.
As a final question, to please my giant inner ‘Community' geek, I ask Harmon is Donald Trump winning the US election will mean America is officially operating in the darkest timeline.
He laughs. “I won't know, because I'll be down there with you. We're just gonna go into the bush and never look back.”
Tbh with you, that's the bloody dream.

Microsoft's new Kinect sensor continues to walk the path of Nintendo's Wii with Civil-War-reenactment precision. 1) Sports mini-game compilation released. 2) Talk show hosts made giddy. Now: 3) Accidental swattings and injuries immortalized on YouTube and elsewhere.
Review: Kinect Sports The Xbox 360 finally has its motion-based sports game. Packed with six sports, ten if you include… Read more Read
Up top is one unintended swat of one Kinect gamer by another. Here is a second, though the diaper-wearing injured party appears ready for revenge:
This is what happens, in some homes, when Microsoft releases an add-on called Kinect to the Xbox 360 that lets you control video games with movements of your body, no controller required. (Full Kinect coverage here.) It's the Wii all over again, minus anything to hold in your hand.

And here, in mere photo form, is the busted hand of one Bill Linn, gaming public relations man, who tells Kotaku: "Have exposed beams in my house at 9 ft. Went to spike the ball in deca sports volley ball. Ended up with a flap of skin and a lot of blood. EEEKKK!" [UPDATE: Bill misremembered which game he was playing. The offending party game was actually Kinect Sports.]

What was that Kinect tag line again? "You are the controller!" Microsoft, I believe the one of the next things Nintendo did was 4) encase the controller in a rubbery shell, for everyone's safety.
For the record, I've had Kinect for over a week and neither injured myself, anyone I played next to, nor my TV (unlike this person).
Last week, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 10 to 7 to approve the use of military force in Syria. A Maplight analysis reveals that senators voting 'yes' received, on average, 83 percent more campaign money from defense contractors than senators voting 'no.'
These numbers are unnerving to a war-weary American public still licking its wounds from a $2 trillion, 10-year quagmire in Iraq justified by lies about alleged weapons of mass destruction. That public is profoundly distrustful of its leaders who have achieved power in a system of, by, and for whichever interests have the most money.
The mere idea that politicians voting on matters of war and peace -- life and death -- could be influenced by contributions is the most perverted money in politics nightmare. You can be sure that senators voting 'yes' on Syria emphatically deny a quid pro quo with military industrial donors, saying that defense lobbyists give them money because they happen to agree on military matters, and because everyone on the Foreign Relations Committee gets more money from those industries. That's just how the status quo is.
But the status quo is the problem. Politicians should not be allowed to receive money from interests they regulate. Period. As soon as Foreign Relations Committee members take money from the very companies that stand to make millions from military action, we the people can no longer be unequivocally sure that they are making decisions purely on the merits of what's best for our nation.
Even if quid pro quo politics had no role in last week's Syria vote, the glaring problem is that 93 percent of the time, the political candidate with the most money wins. Deep-pocketed interests know the game, so they spend millions on lobbying expenditures, contributions and PAC donations to support their favored candidates -- in this case military hawks who are more likely to support intervention. Can you blame them? They're playing by the rules we give them, and they are playing the system like a Stradivarius while raking in breathtaking profits.
This special interest capture of government and policymaking is the same dysfunction that led to the financial meltdown of 2008; the failure to curb exorbitant profiteering in the health care industry; the failure to enact policies that actually help the middle class and create jobs, rather than just talk about it... the list goes on.
But in 2013, rather than hear about real solutions to this profound political dysfunction, we await the October 8th opening arguments of the "McCutcheon v. FEC" Supreme Court case that would make things even worse. It would remove the "aggregate" contribution limits that prevent wealthy donors from giving more than $123,000 to federal candidates and political parties each election cycle. Yep, our highest court is actually considering a radical "Citizens United 2" that would yet again slash our already-shredded campaign finance laws.
A recent New York Times piece on middle-class incomes confirms what Stephen Gordonhas been telling us, that the 2000-2010 period was a strong one for after-tax incomes of the Canadian middle class. This is fantastic news—though I am always hesitant to draw strong conclusions from a single data set. In order to intepret this data, there are two important questions we need to ask:
What caused the growth in middle-class incomes to rise between 2000-10? Will these trends continue in the future? Are these drivers of growth sustainable?
To start to answer these questions, we need to dig deeper into the data. What follows are eight important trends of the 2000-10 period that contributed to the strength of Canada's middle class.
1. Oil Prices
The price of a barrel of oil, using the WTI benchmark, rose from $29.70 to $76.32 from mid-2000 to mid-2010, an increase of 157% in only 10 years. Other commodities that Canada exports saw price increases as well, partly due to increased demand from emerging markets. (I chose WTI as the benchmark, as WCS was only introduced half-way through the decade.) Given the country's status as an oil exporter, the worldwide rise in oil prices was a windfall for Canada.
2. The Exchange Rate
The Canadian dollar appreciated by nearly 42% relative to the greenback, mostly due to the increase in the value of Canada's oil exports. This was a fantastic increase in purchasing power, which allowed Canadians to buy imported goods and services at much lower prices. It did, however, put competitive pressures on many Canadian exporters.
3. Full-Time Employment Rates
The percentage of women between the ages of 25 and 54 with full-time jobs rose from 58% in 2000 to 63% in 2007, as women entered the labour force as never before, causing family incomes to rise. This number fell during the recession, but slowly climbed back to 62% by mid-2010.
The proportion of men with full-time jobs stayed relatively steady until the recession, when it declined significantly. It has yet to fully recover.
4. Housing Prices
The above series is Statistics Canada's New Housing Price Index (NHPI), which “measures changes over time in the contractors' selling prices of new residential houses, where detailed specifications pertaining to each house remain the same between two consecutive periods.” Unlike in the United States, housing prices continued to rise after the recession. The index rose over 50% during the 2000-10 period.
5. Mortgage Rates
Outside of a few years in the middle of the decade, mortgage rates declined steadily over the decade, reducing mortgage costs for homebuyers. Average 5-year mortgage rates fell from 8.12% in mid-2000 to 5.02% in mid-2010, a reduction of nearly 40%.
6. Household Debt
For Canadian households debt loads rose faster than incomes, which may be a reaction to lower interest rates. In 2000, Canadian households debts were equivalent to 13 months worth of income. By 2010, that level increased by four, to 17 months worth of income, a rise of 44%.
7. Government Debt
Unlike for household debts, government debts steadily declined before the recession. Since then, debt loads escalated quickly, with a combined debt-to-GDP ratio of 84.2% in 2010, up from 82.1% in 2000.
8. Demographics
The percentage of seniors in Canada rose from 12.5% in 2000 to 14.1% in 2010 and will continue to rise in the future. After-tax household incomes managed to rise dispute a graying workforce in the previous decade, giving hope for the decade to come.
We've been following the 3D printed gun for a while now. In internet time, it's been generations. In real time, it's been less than a year or so. What is legally defined as a gun has already been printed, but technically that's not the entire object, just some of the parts that make it work. Now, Defense Distributed, the company leading the way into the future of 3D-printed weaponry, has finally 3D-printed an entire gun — in both the sense that it is legally considered a gun, and that every single piece is 3D-printed.
Defense Distributed has been slowly building the gun piece-by-pice, making sure each and every 3D-printed component can work on its own when integrated with standard metal bits. Back in December of last year, DD 3D-printed the lower receiver of the gun, which is the bare minimum of parts that legally constitutes a gun. Then, DD managed to 3D-print 30-round automatic rifle magazines, testing them until failure. They found that the magazines could easily last for over 100 rounds of fire, but would eventually wear down and cease function after frequent use. From there, DD needed to make the gun stock and the barrel, with the barrel most likely posing the greatest challenge, as that's the part of the gun that the bullets actually hit while traveling.
While DD was making progress with its 3D-printed gun experiment, the company managed to get a license to become a legal manufacturer and vendor of guns, somewhat muddling the legal status of the 3D-printed gun, a weapon anyone with a 3D-printer could make at home. Toward the end of April, DD said it was around two weeks away from 3D printing an entire handgun, made from standard 3D printing material, ABS plastic. Now, the company has delivered on its promise, and showed Forbes a fully 3D-printed gun.
The gun is called “the Liberator” (Defense Distributed is located in Texas, after all), and every single part is 3D-printed. The Liberator still has some more testing to go through, but once that has been completed, DD will release the CAD files into the wilds of the internet, onto its blueprints archive, Defcad.org. Using Stratasys' Dimension SST 3D printer, DD printed all 16 parts of the Liberator. The gun uses interchangeable barrels in order to allow the wielder to choose different caliber bullets.
As impressive as a fully 3D-printed gun is, ABS plastic purists will be sad to know that the Liberator has two parts that weren't 3D-printed: a nail used as the firing pin, and a 6-ounce piece of metal so the gun can be recognized by a metal detector. Considering the gun works and wouldn't be taken seriously at a glance because it looks like something a kid would make in elementary school art class, having a bit of metal inside it is certainly a good decision. However, since the plans will be made available on the blueprints archive, nothing is going to stop some ne'er-do-wells out there from printing the Liberator without the detectable metal bits. Those ne'er-do-wells will still need real bullets, at least, but the lack of requiring a license — and the gun's lack of a serial number — are unsettling thoughts.
Only time will tell how the public and world's legal systems will receive 3D-printed weaponry, but thanks to Defense Distributed, it looks like that time is right around the corner. While you're waiting for the world to turn that corner, check out this documentary focusing on Defense Distributed and the 3D-printed gun, below.

More than 260,000 people in Austria have signed a petition urging the Austrian government to leave the European Union (EU).
According to reports on Thursday, as many as 261,159 Austrians signed the petition. The number in total represents 4.12 percent of the country's electorate.
Since under the country's regulations the threshold for calling a debate on a potential referendum is 100,000 people, the Austrian parliament must discuss a referendum on leaving the EU.
The call for leaving the EU was most popular in the regions of Lower Austria and in Carinthia where 5.18 percent and 4.85 percent of potential voters, respectively, signed the petition.
The organizer of the petition was a 66-year-old retired translator named Inge Rauscher. He called the petition “a great result” and linked its success partially to the Greek crisis.
Rauscher composed a similar petition in 2000 when 3.35 percent of the electorate signed it.
Greece missed a June 30 deadline to repay €1.6 billion (USD 1.79 billion) it owes to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), becoming the first developed country to officially default on a loan to the IMF after a breakdown in talks with the so-called troika of international lenders – the IMF, the European Central Bank, and the European Commission.
Athens has been struggling to borrow on international markets over the past few years. It has presented a list of reforms needed to restart bailout loan payments, but the creditors have described Greece's proposals as insufficient and called for tougher austerity measures.
On June 27, the Greek parliament passed a bill approving Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' motion to hold the referendum on whether the government should agree to the lenders' demands in return for bailout funds to the debt-ridden country.
Tsipras has called for a 'no' vote in the country's referendum on July 5 on the terms of a bailout deal with Athens' international creditors.
In 2010 and 2012, Greece received two bailout packages worth a total of €240 billion (USD 272 billion) from its creditors following the 2009 economic crisis.

TORONTO – One of the concerns for “Team Europe” in the 2016 World Cup of Hockey is identity. So I tried to help give them one.
“Can you have a pirate flag as the logo on the World Cup European team jerseys?” I asked Anze Kopitar, the Slovenian-born star center for the Los Angeles Kings. “A skull and crossbones? Kings colors, of course. But the logo is a pirate flag.”
The roster is a potpourri of hockey nations that aren't Sweden, Finland, Russia or the Czech Republic. They don't have tradition. They don't have an anthem. But as I suggested, they should have a flag. A pirate flags.

“Because you're, like, a team without a nation. You're invading this tournament and trying to topple the establishment as this rogue element.”
“OK," said Kopitar, nodding.
“So can you make that happen?”
Said Kopitar: “Why would you ask me that? What control do I have over the jerseys?”
“Well,” I said, “we've been calling it Team Kopitar since it was announced. If you have any sway …”
“OK,” he said, smiling. “I'll do my best.”
***
Truthfully, the Kings star has been over that “Team Kopitar” stuff for months.
When the 2016 World Cup of Hockey format was announced, with a “Young Stars” team and a “Team Europe” filling out the eight-team field, Kopitar became the focus as a player who wouldn't be in the tournament were it not for this grab-bag of European NHL stars.
Story continues
He would roll his eyes a bit when asked the same questions about “Team Kopitar” and the locker room dynamics between rival nations. But it was clear that, for him, getting a chance to play in the World Cup and represent Slovenia trumped the awkward inconvenience of having a hodgepodge team, like that table at the wedding with the childhood friend sitting with the work acquaintance sitting with mom's second cousin.
“For selfish reasons now, it would be cool to be part of that,” he said back in January. “There are a lot of good players coming from Switzerland and Slovakia.”
Both of those countries could have made a case for inclusion in a World Cup tournament, if this World Cup tournament wasn't simply a brand extension for the National Hockey League and international players were invited en masse to participate.
In Switzerland's case, they've been a competitive Olympic team for some time and jumped up to win silver at the 2013 IIHF world championships. While the national team's roster only boasts about a half-dozen established NHL players, the thought that Switzerland couldn't be counted among the eight hockey powers internationally is insulting to Swiss players.
"I don't like it at all. Not one thing about it. It's a nations tournament. You love playing for your country,” said defenseman Mark Streit back in January.
PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC - MAY 05: Roman Josi (R) of Switzerland and Yannic Seidenberg (L) of Germany battle for the puck during the IIHF World Championship group A match between Switzerland and Germany at o2 Arena on May 5, 2015 in Prague, Czech Republic. (Photo by Martin Rose/Getty Images)
Roman Josi, the Swiss defenseman for the Nashville Predators, felt that his country earned their inclusion in the tournament.
“I really feel like Swiss hockey made a good step forward in the last few years. We played some good international tournaments, did well at the Olympics too. It's disappointing that Switzerland can't be there as a nation,” he said. “But it's the World Cup. You play against the best players in the world. It would be an honor to be on that team.”
The primary concern for Switzerland and Slovakia is how this all plays back home. The players talk about having been inspired by seeing their forefathers compete against the world's best in international tournaments; they fear that by being placed on “Team Europe,” young players back home won't feel the same sense of pride.
“I was wondering about that. How the fans are going to react to that. I think a lot of people want to have it the other way,” said Josi.
“It would be better to have Swiss hockey or Slovakian hockey to have their own teams, and send their own players.”
***
As a hockey nation, Switzerland feels like it's on the upswing. Slovakia, meanwhile, has a different trajectory.
“If this were 10 years ago, and the World Cup would have happened, they'd have to put Team Slovakia. We had way too many players in the NHL,” said Tomas Tatar of the Detroit Red Wings. “But our numbers are, maybe right now, about 12. We might not be able to compete with Canada or the U.S.”
That said, Slovakia has competed internationally despite those diminished numbers, and Tatar isn't sure how fans are going to feel about what he called a “relegation” to Team Europe.
“I don't know if they're going to cheer for a Team Europe,” he said. “We've been part of hockey tournaments for a decade. Slovakia … I'm not saying we're the best, but we've been a part of the Olympics and the World Championships. So the fans are disappointed. It's not the same.”
Defenseman Zdeno Chara of the Boston Bruins has represented Slovakia in seven world championships and three Olympics.
“I prefer country vs. country. It's always more excited to be playing for your own country,” he said. “Don't get me wrong, it's going to be very exciting for the fans. But still, there are a few unknowns about how it's going to be melded together.”
Like, for example, what they're playing for. Every individual nation wants to see its flag above Canadian ice in Toronto, wants to hear its anthem echoing through an arena as they're handed the World Cup, wants to know the fans back home understand their nation was just crowned champion.
Even the “Young Stars” players told us they have a distinct motivation: Beating the old guard, like underclassmen embarrassing the seniors in a scrimmage.
But what is “Team Europe” playing for?
[Yahoo Sports Fantasy Hockey: Sign up and join a league today!]
“It won't be the same kind of pressure for me, playing for Team Europe with the mixed players. Playing for Team Slovakia, you don't want to disappoint your fans,” said Tatar. “You're playing for your teammates in your locker room. I will do my best to win the World Cup. It won't be the same as playing for Team Slovakia, but we can have fun. If I get picked, you want to win it.
Chara said the important thing for all of “Team Europe” – whether the players are from Slovakia, Switzerland, Slovenia or other “relegated” nations – is that they understand that not having the logo on the front doesn't mean you aren't representing your country in Toronto next September.
“Even when you say you're not playing for Slovakia, you actually are. It's just that you're playing on a team with other countries, too,” he said.
Now, if only they have a flag …

Below is a detailed video explaining how the Peachy Printer works through explanation and demonstration!
The peachy printer is a Photolithographic printer. That means it uses a controlled beam of light to cure light sensitive resin into hard objects. The peachy moves a laser beam along the X and Y axes to create the shape of the object, while using a drip system to control the level of the resin on the Z axis which determines the height of the object.
The object you want to print must first become a 3D model in Blender. The software we wrote as an add-on to blender takes the data from that 3D model and translates it into an audio waveform. It then plays the audio file out to the printer through the headphone jack in your computer. This waveform drives a pair of electro magnetic mirrors. The higher the volume, the higher the voltage, the more the mirrors move. The purpose of these mirrors is to reflect and control the path of the laser beam. By using the audio waveform generated from the 3D model data to drive the mirrors, we are able to get the laser beam to draw out the shape of the object. That's takes care of the X and Y axes.
Now let's talk about the drip system that creates movement on the Z axis. The salt water in the top container syphons down to a drip feed. The rate of this drip feed is controlled by a valve. As each drip leaves the feed, it passes through two contact points creating an electrical connection that is detected by your computers microphone jack. The drip continues to fall into the bottom container where it causes the resin floating atop it to rise. The software listens to the microphone level, counting each drip that falls and calculates the resultant level of the resin. This allows the software to send the layer that corresponds with the current Z-level of the resin. This process continues until the print is complete!
Under The Hood
Below are some detailed pictures showing under the hood of our current prototype. This is the exact hardware that made every print pictured and shown in the videos. Everything we do will be freedom respecting, and unlike some companies we will NEVER make any of our plans or source code non-free.
A few separate parts, as well as the fully built printer. During the R&D process we have been cutting our housings out of MDF to save on expenses.
Here you can see one of the mirrors that moves and directs the laser beam.
In this image you can clearly see the electro-magnet assembly that moves the mirrors.
If you've seen our main video then you already know just how well these new methods work. This extremely unique design has resulted in a very affordable product, however there are many challenges we must overcome to utilize the overwhelmingly high resolution of the Z-level drip system and todays sound cards. We are very confident in our ability to overcome these challenges and develop a great final product!
How does the 3D Scanner work?
When combined with a camera, the Peachy Printer also functions as a 3D scanner! The Peachy repeats a back and forth laser pattern that simulates a line laser. This illuminates the profile of the object you are scanning. Your video camera, webcam, or DSLR will capture this happening while you rotate the object a full 360 degrees. The software we wrote in Blender then searches through each pixel in every frame looking for the point where the laser is hitting the object. Next it calculates the distance of those pixels from the objects rotational centre and plots the points and mesh accordingly in 3D space. You now have a 3D model of the real life object you scanned.
We're even working on a feature that creates a texture map from the footage and applies it to the 3D models mesh automatically. This gives you a even more realistic looking 3D model.
More About Blender
Blender is 3D modelling and animation software. It is freedom respecting and available to download for free from Blender's website. Blender is central to the software side of this project. All the software that runs the printer will do so from within Blender. Since Blender can import many file types this actually leaves you free to use practically any CAD program to create your models. The blender add ons we write will be capable of running many different printers, not just the Peachy. One unique feature our add-on will have is real time processing. This will enable you to model as the printer prints! You will be able to make changes to any part of your model that hasn't been printed yet!
You may be wondering… What is our plan when it comes to fulfilling the orders if our campaign is successful? We have 2 different manufacturing plans:
Manufacturing Plan #1 - Under 5000 orders
We will start by taking two months to continue with R&D. We will be improving the software, hardware, and finalizing the overall design of the product.
After the R&D process is complete we will start manufacturing the printers on our own CNC routers. We are planning on milling the outer housing, mirror assembly, laser holster, and the coil holsters all out of polycarbonate first-surface mirror (vacuum coated with aluminum) which we have already completed successfully.
Manufacturing our mirror assemblies on the CNC router
We also have multiple suppliers in mind - most of which we have already used - for specific parts such as the custom wire coils, earth magnets, and the laser.
Pre-assembled models will be built here in Canada and each one will go through quality control at the end of our assembly line. We will likely have each printer draw out a grid in a dark room. A camera will capture the entire pattern in one image using a long exposure. If the printer is sufficiently capable of drawing an accurate grid, then that grid will be used in a calibration feedback loop for the individual printer that produced it. Not only is this a quality check, it also calibrates your printer to account for any tiny anomalies specific to it. You will receive the test photo and clear instructions on how to perform a re-calibration if you wish to do so.
Manufacturing Plan #2 - Over 5000 Orders
We will start by taking two months to continue with R&D. We will be improving the software, hardware, and finalizing the overall design of the product.
After the R&D process is complete we will get many of the parts that we are currently producing on CNC routers made with injection moulding instead. This manufacturing process ensures that each printer will be produced to more precise specifications and will be our go-to choice if we get enough orders.

David Boe - Owner, Investor, Business Manager
David is a 38 year old certified Heavy Duty mechanic who is currently employed by Edmonton Kenworth in Fort McMurray, Alberta. He is also a certified Automotive mechanic and has been “twisting wrenches” on and off for around 20 years. In between those times, he has owned two small businesses, which taught him a lot, and aligned him with his entrepreneurial spirit. He has also worked in the insurance industry for a number of years. Having committed himself to lifelong learning and since one of his main interests is in manufacturing, he started training in the Six Sigma/Lean manufacturing process a couple of years ago after having read numerous books and articles on the subject. He has also read books and articles on the “Theory of Constraints” logic to manufacturing and found them both to be interesting.
Dave and Rylan met in mid 2012 and instantly hit it off. They were very interested in each other's ideas and it didn't take long before they were in business together. Over the past year they have been working together to get the Peachy Printer to where it's at today.
Nathan Grayston - Advertising & Marketing
Nathan is a 21 year old entrepreneur living in Yorkton, SK. He owns a business specializing in video production and graphic design. He started creating videos and designs at a young age and began doing it professionally 2 years ago.
Nathan is a very passionate and dedicated young man… No stranger to online fundraising campaigns, in 2012 he was a key member of the volunteer team that won the top prize in the Aviva Community Fund bringing in $150,000 for a new skateboard park in Yorkton. In total, the group raised $350,000 and saw the park come to completion in under a year.
Much like his role in that project, at Peachy Printer he's currently in charge of video production, graphic design, web design, marketing and advertising.
Josh Ellis - Owner and inventor of MakerJuice
Josh is a 28 year old engineer residing in Kansas City, MO. A lot like Rylan he has been taking things apart, and putting them back together from a young age. As he grew older he became interested in computers and programming. These passions led him to attend a mechanical and electrical engineering course at Louisiana State University. After his time at LSU, he served in the U.S. Airforce for 4 years. He now holds down a career doing R&D on A.I. Traffic Control Systems for an engineering firm.
Josh has been extremely interested in 3D printing as a hobby for years. After building his own CNC router from scratch and playing around with a RepRap, he started looking into stereolithographic printing. After doing some searching he was disheartened by the price of resins, and the lack of customer service from the providers. With a goal of providing the 3D printing community with a high quality, reasonably priced product, he started looking into making his own resin. After 6 months of testing out formulas and talking to suppliers he launched MakerJuice with 1 formula. Since then he has been continuously developing new resins and now has 4 products available.
Josh has been crucial to the development of the Peachy Printer. His highly sensitive resins have played a key part in attaining our goal of selling the Peachy for $100. We are currently in communication with Josh, and we will be working with him to develop a special resin formula just for the Peachy Printer.

LeBron James has been so great for so long that, sometimes, it's easy to take him for granted. This season was relatively ordinary by his standards — ho-hum, another 25, 7 and 7 campaign. There were differences from James's earlier incarnations, such as an out-of-whack shooting stroke, but nothing so substantial as to much separate this LeBron from any LeBron of seasons past.
But during these NBA playoffs, and the finals in particular, James has been playing at a level so superhuman that even the most jaded LeBron watchers have to sit up and pay attention.
James's best per-minute playoff campaign came in the Cleveland Cavaliers' ill-fated 2009 postseason, when they flamed out against the Orlando Magic in the conference finals. His per-game averages in that series were 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, 8.0 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.2 blocks. But apart from that one-man exhibition in a losing effort (something James knows well), these 2016 playoffs have seen the best statistical version of LeBron — and certainly the best version ever to appear in the NBA Finals.
In fact, when it comes to production in the finals, James has also saved his best performance for 2016. According to Game Score, John Hollinger's pet single-game productivity rating, LeBron is enjoying the highest (pace-adjusted) per-game average of his finals career right now, and it isn't especially close:
AVERAGE PER GAME YEAR GAMES PLAYED POINTS REBOUNDS ASSISTS GAME SCORE 2016 6 30.2 11.3 8.5 28.2 2012 5 28.6 10.2 7.4 25.9 2015 6 35.8 13.3 8.8 25.6 2014 5 28.2 7.8 4.0 25.3 2013 7 25.3 10.9 7.0 24.4 2011 6 17.8 7.2 6.8 15.6 2007 4 22.0 7.0 6.8 12.4 LeBron's 2016 stats for games played in the NBA Finals are his best Game Score has been adjusted to a pace of 100 possessions per game. Source: Basketball-Reference.com
In Thursday night's Game 6, James produced the top Game Score of his finals career (44.1 after adjusting for pace), thanks to a jaw-dropping stat line: 41 points on 59 percent shooting, 11 assists, 8 rebounds and 4 steals. He even splashed home three of six threes, bringing his finals 3-point percentage to 40 percent, a massive difference from the 31 percent rate we were all so worried about during the regular season.
In other words, James's game has rounded into peak form at exactly the right time for the Cavs. And I really mean peak form: If we look at his Game Scores relative to what a league-average player would produce in the same number of minutes and then weight by the importance of each game in terms of championship odds, we're currently witnessing the second-best three-game stretch of James's entire career, culminating in his second-best game ever on Thursday night:
The only run of performances that surpassed it came in the closing three games of the 2013 finals. That year, James averaged a 26.7 Game Score over games 4 through 6 of the series — remember the headband-losing moment in Game 6 that seemed to activate his powers? — before dropping the very best game of his career (after adjusting for the stakes) in Game 7: 37 points on 52 percent shooting, to go with 12 rebounds, 4 assists and 2 steals. The magnitude of that game helped make it LeBron's greatest, but he's been even better (with an average game score of 35.5) in games 4 through 6 this year. And on Sunday, James will get a chance to set a new standard in another Game 7, with the championship on the line again.

When I was growing up, I was always told that we have so much to learn from Japan. I grew up during the rise of the Japanese auto industry, I was taught “Japanese” business tactics, and I watched movies like Gung Ho that portrayed discipline, perseverance, and efficiency.
On my first trip to Japan, though, I wanted to explore the weird and wacky high-tech world the media has portrayed so often. What I found was a place that isn't as “high tech” as many westerners assume but rather a relatively “low tech” cornucopia of conveniences that could make many westerners jealous.

The first thing I noticed was the lack of “open” Wi-Fi before leaving for Japan. My research found that in most places, free Wi-Fi had to be registered for before entering Japan; it's not ubiquitous. Despite the airports or an occasional restaurant or tourist site offering free Wi-Fi, I found this to be true. Luckily, my Airbnb provided me with a free mobile access point, and my $13 sim for my unlocked Blu Android phone filled in the gaps.
Though I was visiting Hiroshima, not Tokyo, I still expected to pay by credit card everywhere. This was not possible, as taxis, public transit, and most small restaurants and shops do not take credit cards at all, so I found myself visiting the ATM more than once.
Despite those low-tech facts, the conveniences I sought did not disappoint: from delightful taxi auto-open doors to parking lot tech, disabled and safety technology, conservation and cleanliness, and advanced toilet tech—I was awed. Not only did these relatively small conveniences impress me, but they were all in working order (not what I'm used to in NYC).
We may not need restroom noisemakers, and filthy NYC subway tracks have proven we do need public garbage cans, but there is so much simple and creative “tech” that we can definitely continue to learn from Japanese culture.

Are black holes the ruthless killers we've made them out to be? Samir Mathur says no. According to the professor of physics at The Ohio State University, the recently proposed idea that black holes have "firewalls" that destroy all they touch has a loophole.
In a paper posted online to the arXiv preprint server, Mathur takes issue with the firewall theory, and proves mathematically that black holes are not necessarily arbiters of doom.
In fact, he says the world could be captured by a black hole, and we wouldn't even notice.
More than a decade ago, Mathur used the principles of string theory to show that black holes are actually tangled-up balls of cosmic strings. His "fuzzball theory" helped resolve certain contradictions in how physicists think of black holes.
But when a group of researchers recently tried to build on Mathur's theory, they concluded that the surface of the fuzzball was actually a firewall.
According to the firewall theory, the surface of the fuzzball is deadly. In fact, the idea is called the firewall theory because it suggests that a very literal fiery death awaits anything that touches it.
Mathur and his team have been expanding on their fuzzball theory, too, and they've come to a completely different conclusion. They see black holes not as killers, but rather as benign copy machines of a sort.
They believe that when material touches the surface of a black hole, it becomes a hologram, a near-perfect copy of itself that continues to exist just as before.
"Near-perfect" is the point of contention. There is a hypothesis in physics called complementarity, which was first proposed by Stanford University physicist Leonard Susskind in 1993. Complementarity requires that any such hologram created by a black hole be a perfect copy of the original.
Mathematically, physicists on both sides of this new fuzzball-firewall debate have concluded that strict complementarity is not possible; That is to say, a perfect hologram can't form on the surface of a black hole.
Mathur and his colleagues are comfortable with the idea, because they have since developed a modified model of complementarity, in which they assume that an imperfect hologram forms. That work was done with former Ohio State postdoctoral researcher David Turton, who is now at the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the CEA-Saclay research center in France.
Proponents of the firewall theory take an all-or-nothing approach to complementarity. Without perfection, they say, there can only be fiery death.
With his latest paper, Mathur counters that he and his colleagues have now proven mathematically that modified complementarity is possible.
It's not that the firewall proponents made some kind of math error, he added. The two sides based their calculations on different assumptions, so they got different answers. One group rejects the idea of imperfection in this particular case, and the other does not.
Imperfection is common topic in cosmology. Physicist Stephen Hawking has famously said that the universe was imperfect from the very first moments of its existence. Without an imperfect scattering of the material created in the Big Bang, gravity would not have been able to draw together the atoms that make up galaxies, stars, the planets -- and us.
This new dispute about firewalls and fuzzballs hinges on whether physicists can accept that black holes are imperfect, just like the rest of the universe.
"There's no such thing as a perfect black hole, because every black hole is different," Mathur explained.
His comment refers to the resolution of the "information paradox," a long-running physics debate in which Hawking eventually conceded that the material that falls into a black hole isn't destroyed, but rather becomes part of the black hole.
The black hole is permanently changed by the new addition. It's as if, metaphorically speaking, a new gene sequence has been spliced into its DNA. That means every black hole is a unique product of the material that happens to come across it.
The information paradox was resolved in part due to Mathur's development of the fuzzball theory in 2003. The idea, which he published in the journal Nuclear Physics B in 2004, was solidified through the work of other scientists including Oleg Lunin of SUNY Albany, Stefano Giusto of the University of Padova, Iosif Bena of CEA-Saclay, and Nick Warner of the University of Southern California. Mathur's co-authors included then-students Borun Chowdhury (now a postdoctoral researcher at Arizona State University), and Steven Avery (now a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University).
Their model was radical at the time, since it suggested that black holes had a defined -- albeit "fuzzy" -- surface. That means material doesn't actually fall into black holes so much as it falls onto them.
The implications of the fuzzball-firewall issue are profound. One of the tenets of string theory is that our three-dimensional existence -- four-dimensional if you count time -- might actually be a hologram on a surface that exists in many more dimensions.
"If the surface of a black hole is a firewall, then the idea of the universe as a hologram has to be wrong," Mathur said.
The very nature of the universe is at stake, but don't expect rival physicists to come to blows about it.
"It's not that kind of disagreement," Mathur laughed. "It's a simple question, really. Do you accept the idea of imperfection, or do you not?"
George Zimmerman attorney and new CNN contributor Mark O'Mara joined Anderson Cooper Monday night to react to Zimmerman getting into an altercation with his estranged wife and her father. Shellie Zimmerman called the police, saying her husband threatened them with a gun, but she ultimately did not file charges. O'Mara admitted there's been some tension given Zimmerman's divorce, telling Cooper they're still “suffering” from being in the media spotlight.
O'Mara confirmed that Zimmerman had a gun on him, explaining the details of the altercation and how a friend of Zimmerman's intervened to keep things relatively calm.
Cooper asked O'Mara is he's concerned about Zimmerman, given that since his trial this summer, he was pulled over twice by police and now has this hanging over his head. O'Mara said Zimmerman is normally a “peaceful” and “helpful” person, but he's currently under an “enormous amount of stress.”
Cooper pressed him whether Zimmerman having a gun should then be concerning. O'Mara insisted Zimmerman “acted appropriately.”

Republicans want to make the unemployed get a job before they receive unemployment benefits, and four other reasons to be glad you didn't watch the Fox News Republican Debate.
1). Mitt Romney Now Claims He Created 120,000 Jobs At Bain
Within 10 minutes of the beginning of the Fox News GOP South Carolina debate, Mitt Romney uncorked his first lie. Instead of clarifying that he didn't really create 100,000 jobs at Bain, Romney upped the ante and claimed that four companies that Bain invested in created 120,000 jobs. Romney continued to take credit for creating jobs at Staples and The Sports Authority.
The AP has already debunked Romney's claims, “”Romney has never substantiated his frequent claim that he was a creator of more than 100,000 jobs while leading the Bain Capital private equity company. His campaign merely cites success stories without laying out the other side of the ledger — jobs lost at Bain-acquired or Bain-supported firms that closed, trimmed their workforce or shifted employment overseas. Moreover, his campaign bases its claims on recent employment figures at three companies — Staples, Domino's and Sports Authority — even though Romney's involvement with them ceased years ago. … Staples, now with close to 90,000 employees, and Sports Authority, with about 15,000, were start-ups supported by Romney. The direct work force at Domino's has grown by nearly 8,000 since Romney's intervention. But Romney got out of the game in 1999, which has not stopped his campaign from crediting him with jobs created at those companies since then.”
2). Rick Santorum Sets Up Mitt Romney On Felons Voting
Rick Santorum brought up a Romney Super PAC ad that attacked him for letting felons vote. Santorum asked Romney if felons should be allowed to vote. Romney said no, then Santorum said that while governor of Massachusetts, Romney's state was more liberal in allowing felons to vote than the bill Santorum voted on. Rick Santorum set Mitt Romney up, knocked him down, and left Romney spinning in circles.
3). Republicans Want To Attach A Work Requirement To Unemployment Insurance
Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum said that unemployment insurance should not be extended unless the unemployed help themselves by working. Gingrich and Santorum's model was the failed 1990s welfare reform. This is what the Republican Party has come to. The Republican candidates for president think that attaching a work requirement to unemployment benefits is a good idea. Do these candidates understand that the unemployed would not need unemployment insurance if they could get work? Unemployment insurance exists in order to help people when there aren't enough jobs available. The Republican position is based on the moral judgment that unemployed people are lazy. Only Ron Paul suggested that we cut military spending instead of throwing people off unemployment insurance.
4). The GOP Debate Audience Cheers Child Labor
Juan Williams asked Newt Gingrich if he could see that it was insulting to people especially African Americans that he thinks poor kids should work as janitors. Newt Gingrich said no, and said that for the cost on one union janitor schools could hire 37 poor children. Gingrich said that giving poor people money for work is a good thing. When Williams suggested that Gingrich was trying to belittle the poor and minorities, and the white South Carolina debate crowd booed. In summary, Gingrich suggested that child labor is actually a good thing because it makes money for the wealthy, and denies the poor educational opportunities, which they apparently don't deserve according to Republicans because they are poor.
5). Rick Perry Uses The Beheading Of Daniel Pearl To Justify Marines Urinating On Corpses
Rick Perry continued to stand up for military behavior that will make the United States the most hated nation in the world. Perry actually used the horrible beheading of Daniel Pearl in order to justify the bad behavior of the four Marines who urinated on dead Taliban fighters. If any of these Republicans are elected into the White House, they will make the behavior of the Bush administration look angelically humanitarian.
Bonus: Mitt Romney Wants All Campaign Finance Laws Abolished
Mitt Romney said that not only does he want to get rid of Super PACs, he wants to get rid of all campaign finance laws. Romney argued that people should be able to give as much as they want, and campaigns should be able to run any ad they want. Romney was arguing for Citizens United on steroids, because in Mitt Romney's mind, “Corporations are people, my friend.” Mitt Romney's vision for America includes total and completely legal corporate campaign finance.
Winners and Losers
Winners:
1). Newt Gingrich – Gingrich showed at the debate why he is still a threat to win in South Carolina. Juan Williams confronted Gingrich about child labor and crowd lustily applauded the idea that poor kids should be denied an education in order to work as child laborers. Republicans love child labor, and Newt Gingrich hit them in their sweet spot.
2). Mitt Romney – Yet another wishy-washy debate performance from Romney. He made big news by announcing, kind of sort of, that he may release his tax returns in April. Romney answered questions about Bain, and got set up for a huge fail by Santorum. If Rick Santorum was able to set Romney up, imagine what Obama will do to him?
3). Ron Paul – Many of Rep. Paul's positions weren't popular with the audience, but he was able to differentiate himself with his positions on NDAA, and the use of the justice system instead of detention centers like GITMO. It is certain that Paul's plea not to give up on the judicial system fell on deaf ears, and he didn't win any new Republican supporters tonight, but he avoided going off on any tangents about the gold standard or the FED, which makes him a winner.
Losers:
1). Rick Perry- The Texas governor was bumbling and stumbling over foreign policy, and otherwise looks like the next most likely candidate to exit the race. Perry spent the debate repeating his flat tax and zero foreign aid talking points. His use of the beheading of Daniel Pearl to justify Marines urinating on corpses was the move of a desperate candidate who is willing to sink to any low to stay in the race.
2). Rick Santorum- After a little burst of support in Iowa; Santorum has pretty much flamed out. Oddly after his initial attack on Romney, Santorum did not tout himself as the real conservative. He also never bothered to mention the recent endorsement of evangelical leaders. Rick Santorum looks like he is trying to moderate his positions in order to be Mitt Romney's running mate.
Final Verdict: What felt like the billionth Republican debate is now in the books, and just like all the others that came before it, this debate did nothing to change the course of this race. Mitt Romney's challengers are so weak that he can get away with continual sub par debate performances. If this is all Mitt Romney is going to bring to the table in debates with Obama, he will be eaten alive by this president.

The French asset management company TOBAM, with $9 bln under management, has officially announced the creation of the first Bitcoin mutual fund. The goal is for institutional investors to gain access to the cryptocurrency.
The company has created the fund as an unregulated alternative investment in order to provide a vehicle for allowing more regulated investors at the institutional level to gain Bitcoin exposure without the regulatory concerns. According to the business development lead, Christophe Roehri:
"Direct investment in Bitcoin can be operationally challenging, from dealing with the choice of the platform, to maintaining the proper security measures in terms of custody and to managing the changes made to the protocol.”
Massive institutional movement
As the last two months has unfolded, the widespread adoption of Bitcoin at the institutional level has continued. The announcement by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) for the provision of Bitcoin futures, as well as other firms, has propelled the cryptocurrency to new all-time highs over $8,400. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $8,301, just off those highs.
A customer at a Massachusetts McDonald's was clearly not lovin' it earlier this month -- so much so that he considered it a crime.
A man called 911 from a McDonald's in Woburn to complain of customer service. He told police that he received a crispy chicken sandwich instead of the McChicken sandwich he ordered, Woburn Wicked Local reports. Additionally, the customer alleged he found a bone in the sandwich.
The call was made to police just before 3 a.m. on Wednesday, May 13. He was told by police to hold on to his receipt and speak to a manager at the restaurant the following morning.
Hours after the man's call, Woburn police reminded their followers on social media that 911 is for emergencies only. Questions or complaints should be made to the department's direct phone number.
While this customer was the only to call law enforcement on the establishment, many have complained about the franchise online.
Several reviewers on Yelp said they also received the wrong order from the Woburn location. One man wrote, "They have the distinction of being the worst fast food establishment I ever visited. For years they have never successfully completed and order correctly."
One woman, who gave the location a four-star review, wrote, "The food here scares me, but I love dollar coffee! The service is fast and the coffee is hot! You really can't beat a deal like this!"
EDIT: This post is also no longer accurate. EasyApache 3 support will end in December 2018, with nothing more than security updates effective immediately. Read the full blog post: Time to Say Goodbye to EasyApache 3 We encourage administrators that are still using EasyApache 3 to upgrade as soon as possible. If there are blockers or reasons that you are hesitating to upgrade, please let me know!
====================
In July of this year we announced our goals for deprecating EasyApache 3 and migrating everyone over to EasyApache 4. With the release of cPanel & WHM version 58 we saw record adoption numbers of EasyApache 4 and have seen loads of success for our users in EasyApache 4 environments. However, along with that success have seen a lot of requests for more time to migrate existing servers to EasyApache 4, and we have seen a few really good requests for EasyApache 4 that are preventing clients from switching. For those reasons, and to reduce the pressure on our EasyApache development team, we have decided to adjust the deprecation schedule for EasyApache 3.
v58 – EasyApache 4 is the default on new cPanel & WHM installations With the release of cPanel & WHM version 58, EasyApache 4 will be the default web stack on fresh installations. EasyApache 4 offers full parity with EasyApache 3, with improved install and configuration times. You'll still be able to use EasyApache 3 if you prefer, with a bit of extra configuration first. To use EasyApache 3 instead of EasyApache 4 at install time, issue this command before installing cPanel:
touch /etc/install_legacy_ea3_instead_of_ea4
v62 – Support for EasyApache 3 is Deprecated The last version of cPanel & WHM to support EasyApache 3 will be version , currently planned for January 2017. Once version 62 goes End of Life (Currently expected in January of 2018), EasyApache 3 will receive no further updates, and will be fully deprecated.
v64 – Support for EasyApache 3 is Removed If you have not yet converted EasyApache 4, you will be prevented from upgrading to version 64.
Where to get more information
Even with the updated deprecation schedule, EasyApache 4 won't be supported on CentOS 5. In case you missed it, v56 is the last to support CentOS 5. If you want the benefits of EasyApache 4, you'll need to migrate! Our Server Configuration additions to the Transfer Tool make it easier than ever before.
If you are looking for more information about EasyApache 4 you can start with this post blog post. If you're brand new to EasyApache 4 you can watch this introduction video that Jacob Perkins put together. We have a public document for tracking the Current Status of EasyApache 4. If you have any questions, find me (@cpaneldev) or @cpaneljacob on Twitter, or find Perkins on IRC (Perk on freenode).

Taking one week off from work per year is now considered a luxury for European workers.
According to data from Eurostat, four out of ten EU citizens don't have the money to take one week off and spend it anywhere else than at home.
The data also shows that even in the richer north, a major part of the population has great economic problems and is on the edge of poverty. In Sweden, 10% of the population will have to skip a vacation, compared to 14% in Denmark, 17% in the Netherlands, and 22% in Germany.
The new data, combined with new information from the German statistics office published last week, reports that one third of the German population can't afford to pay unexpected costs for repairs, or for new items, if the amount exceeds around €1,000, has received attention in German media.
Poverty is defined as earning less than 50% of the average income in a country. In 2011, a worker in Germany was at risk of poverty if he or she earned less than €1,000. Eight percent of Germans also say they can't afford to eat a meal with fish, meat or poultry at least every other day. The average in the EU is 11%.
But the problems are by far greater in southern and eastern Europe, where 75% of the population can't afford to go on holiday, like in Romania (75%) and Bulgaria (74%). In Poland, the number is 62%, with 56% in Portugal, 53% in Greece and 51% in Italy.
Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives didn't even wait for the new congressional session to begin before betraying President-elect Donald Trump's key promise "to drain the swamp" of political corruption.
"If the 115th Congress begins with rules amendments undermining OCE, it is setting itself up to be dogged by scandals and ethics issues for years and is returning the House to dark days when ethics violations were rampant and far too often tolerated." —Norman Eisen and Richard Painter, CREW
On Monday evening, in a closed-door party meeting, GOP lawmakers in the House voted overwhelmingly (119 to 74) to neutralize and reconfigure the Office of Congressional Ethics by stripping its independent authority and making it subservient to the very members of congress it was designed to oversee.
Though Trump himself has already showed (repeatedly) how the "drain the swamp" mantra was nothing more than empty campaign rhetoric, the Republican Party's decision to ditch independent oversight of themselves looked to many like an ominous way to kick off the New Year or the 115th Congress, whose members will be sworn on Tuesday.
As I said, we are entering an era of epic corruption. https://t.co/nXMSyOiYfR — Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) January 3, 2017

.@BarackObama's 1st act in 2009 was signing Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. @SpeakerRyan's 1st act in 2017 is eviscerating House ethics. — Col. Morris Davis (@ColMorrisDavis) January 3, 2017
The vote was an approval of an amendment put forth by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), who chairs the House Judiciary Committee. If finalized, as the Huffington Post explains, the change would:
place the OCE under the "oversight" of the lenient Ethics Committee and rename it the Office of Congressional Complaint Review. The new group would no longer be able to release information to the public, employ anyone "for a position involving communications with the public," or directly contact law enforcement without approval. It would also be prohibited from investigating anonymous complaints.
Outrage among Democrats and outside ethics advocates was immediate.

"Republicans claim they want to 'drain the swamp,' but the night before the new Congress gets sworn in, the House GOP has eliminated the only independent ethics oversight of their actions," Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California said in a statement after word of the vote broke Monday night. "Evidently, ethics are the first casualty of the new Republican Congress."
The new rule she said would essential "destroy" critical oversight over potential conflicts of interest or abuse by lawmakers.
Norman Eisen and Richard Painter, chair and vice chair of the non-partisan Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), agreed.
"Undermining the independence of the House's Office of Congressional Ethics would create a serious risk to members of Congress, who rely on OCE for fair, nonpartisan investigations, and to the American people, who expect their representatives to meet their legal and ethical obligations," Eisen and Painter said in a joint statement.
Created in the aftermath of high-profile corruption scandals and ethics question during the George W. Bush era, the OCE was specifically established as an independent panel that could conduct discrete investigations of congressional members without the shadow of political influence.
But Daniel Schuman, policy director of the activist organization Demand Progress, said Monday night's move by the House GOP was a clear step backward.
"With [this] action — taken behind closed doors and with no opportunity for public debate ," Schuman told the HuffPo, " the House now rolls back the clock to an era of corruption and decay. We will all be the worse for it."
Eisen and Painter said the OCE was "one of the outstanding ethics accomplishments" of the House because it prevented ethical questions or possible infraction from being swept under the rug. "If the 115th Congress begins with rules amendments undermining OCE," they warned, "it is setting itself up to be dogged by scandals and ethics issues for years and is returning the House to dark days when ethics violations were rampant and far too often tolerated."

With the Dauphiné having arrived in a town called Gap what better time to talk about the science and art of managing a breakaway?
Everything about a breakaway says freedom, liberty and space. But as well as a hard physical effort it's also a tricky game of poker with bluff and counter-bluff and the bigger the race, the greater the tactics.
Classic scenario
The race starts and some riders jump away to establish a lead. The fugitives are identified, either on sight by riders or via race radio and once the composition of the breakaway is decided the bunch can decide whether to let them go or try a chase.
For a move to have a chance of making it to the finish there are several ingredients are suggested. None are sufficient but they're often necessary:
strong riders: it's not enough to see names nobody has heard of going up the road, you need some big engines. It sounds obvious when you read it but it's still helpful to spell out
strength in numbers: a large group is able to share the work. Also the more riders up the road, the fewer the teams in the bunch who need to chase. The reverse is true, a solo breakaway is always a challenge.
the course: a hilly or awkward route makes an organised chase harder
the finish: a flat finish for the sprinters or a large summit finish have something in common as there are specialist riders backed by dedicated workers to set up their team leader for this kind of finishes which means a concerted chase
GC standing: riders who pose no threat to the race leadership are given their day; to a lesser extent the team prize can also come into play, if three riders from one team go up the road other teams won't be happy.
All these factors in establishing the breakaway and gauging its chances of success. But next comes the tactical component which is harder to view from the outside. For simplicity's sake let's talk of the bunch and the breakaway, even if “the bunch” is split between a few teams with an interest in chasing and many who are content to sit tight.
The breakaway knows the bunch is stronger and that typically any lead given away can be reclaimed later on. A group of six riders left to marinate for half the day are going to be easy to pull back once several teams start working, the numbers toiling on the front of the bunch will exceed those working in the breakaway. Think of it as two time trials with one squad of 15 riders versus another of six.
the bunch will judge its pacing knowing the gap is coming down and you don't want to catch a group too soon otherwise another will surge up the road
the breakaway is not pacing themselves in a linear effort to the finish instead the slight reduction in pace means they can keep a little in reserve for the finish so that just when the break thinks it can reel them in with 10km to go, the breakaway riders can up the pace and ruin the chasers' calculations to stay away
But like all fugitives trying to outrun the law, the breakaway knows they're outnumbered so they have to resort to tactics. Ideally as they enter the last 50km they'll begin to soft-pedal. The bunch then gets the information that the time gap is falling. This has two consequences:
Both groups know very well what the other is doing, creating a tactical contest that students of Game Theory might like to model but it's not easy to analyse. The bunch knows very well the breakaway might ease up a bit only to accelerate. But it's never so obvious, after all the break is not a team time trial of riders with aligned interests. Some might be soft-pedalling for private reasons to save energy over their companions for day and the group might not be able to conspire to adjust their pace.
At the pro level when information is constantly transmitted. There is the moto blackboard which relays the time gaps but also race radio communicates information to the teams who then relay the updates via their radios. There are two more sources of time gap info, first the TV as many team cars have TV screens and can get the GPS time gap. In addition a team with car behind the breakaway and another behind the bunch can also take private time checks.
It's this constant supply of information communication that makes a breakaway in a pro race very different from other events. For example in an U23 event it can be common for the strongest riders to club together and simply ride off knowing that a chase can be hard to organise and measure.
Case Study
Today's Dauphiné stage win by Yuri Trofimov is a good case study. It worked thanks to a powerful group of riders and because there were no sprinters teams chasing to set up the rider, they were deterred by the Col de Manse.
The breakaway contained Andriy Grivko (Astana), Christian Meier (Orica-GreenEdge), Imanol Erviti (Movistar), Maxime Bouet (AG2R), Romain Sicard (Europcar), Pim Lightart (Lotto), Gustav Larsson (IAM), Damiano Caruso (Cannondale), Bob Jungels (Trek), Peter Velits (BMC), Yuri Trofimov (Katusha), Jan Bakelants (OPQS) and Lars-Petter Nordhaug (Belkin). All are strong riders and there were some big engines in there.
Summary
The chances of a breakaway making it to the finish are often low but many still want to try. The odds increase substantially given the right circumstances. But even on those days when the break looks to have no chance there are tactical games to play, notably for the breakaway to signal to the bunch that the chase is working only to accelerate in the final. Watch closely next time a move is away to see if you can spot this.
A Tennessee witness at Cedar Grove reported multiple, low flying, triangle-shaped UFOs moving overhead and a “black, ape-like” creature on the ground, according to testimony in Case 66916 from the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) witness reporting database.
The reporting witness, age 14, and his 12-year-old brother, stepped outside after a recent snowfall about 9:30 p.m. on January 15, 2015, when triangle-shaped objects were first seen in the sky overhead.
“They had two red lights on the back corners and one white light in the front corner,” the reporting witness stated.
The witnesses then seemed to think that they were noticed on the ground by the objects.
“It was like they didn't notice us and then they did. The objects were about 500 feet in the air and when they noticed us they came down to about 60 feet above us.”
The witness said his dog lowered his head as though something was bothering him. He described the objects.
“The objects made no sound at all. They stayed about 50 yards away and circled us. There was about three of them.”
Then a second, orb-like object appeared.
“This went on for about 10 minutes and then a white orb lit up about 20 feet over us and zipped off about 20 feet and disappeared.”
The younger brother became afraid and moved toward the house, but had another encounter along the way.
“After that my brother got freaked out and went back to the house and that's when he saw a black, ape-like creature looking at us. He started yelling at me and that's when it took off into the front yard and disappeared into the darkness. After this we went back inside and said we wouldn't tell anyone.”
Back inside the house, the reporting witness was watching MUFON's “Hanger 1: The UFO Files” on the History channel – which triggered him to report the sighting to MUFON.
The witness reported the incident on June 22, 2015. Tennessee MUFON is investigating.
Cedar Grove is an unincorporated community in Carroll County, Tennessee, and is situated about 20 miles southeast of the Milan Army Ammunition Plant. Please remember that most UFO sightings can be explained as something natural or man-made. The above quotes were edited for clarity. Please report UFO activity to MUFON.com.

Claudia Gadelha already has a target for “when” for her octagon return. It's the “who” that's proving to be the difficult part.
Gadelha (15-2 MMA, 4-2 UFC) is in a tough spot in the UFC's 115-pound division. Currently ranked No. 2 in the USA TODAY Sports/MMAjunkie MMA women's strawweight rankings, and No. 1 in the official UFC rankings, she's behind only one person in both lists: undefeated champion Joanna Jedrzejzcyk (14-0 MMA, 8-0 UFC) .
Gadelha is also fresh off back-to-back wins – the most recent quick and dominant over fellow top contender Karolina Kowalkiewicz (10-2 MMA, 3-2 UFC), who'd just come off a five-round title shot herself.
Under normal circumstances, Gadelha would be a shoo-in for a title shot. Problem is, she already fought the champ – twice. And while the first bout was a non-title affair with a controversial split-decision ending, the second one was a clear five-round loss. Gadelha, in fact, is the first one to say that Jedrzejzcyk is not in the cards for her right now.
But that puts her in a bit of a bind.
“I intend to fight in September,” Gadelha told MMAjunkie. “I'm waiting for the UFC to get back to me. They're trying, but it's that same situation – I can't find an opponent. It's kind of annoying. Sometimes I wish I was the (Donald) Cerrone of strawweights. I wanted to get one fight right after the other. But I also understand that the men's divisions have more options. And my situation at strawweight is very complicated. I wanted to fight again, I wanted to have a fight scheduled.
“I wanted to leave one fight with another one good to go, because that's my goal in the division. But it's hard. It's complicated. There's not much I can think or say, because all I can do is wait for someone to show up and want to fight. I've told the UFC multiple times that I'll fight anyone in the division. It doesn't matter who it is. I won't handpick. But there are no opportunities, no options arising.”
While her octagon future remains muddy, Gadelha is making moves what she can control. After two camps in the U.S. – which led to the wins over Kowalkiewicz at last month's UFC 212 and Cortney Casey at last November's UFC Fight Night 100 – the Brazilian contender is now officially moving from Rio de Janeiro, where she's lived for the past decade, to Albuquerque, New Mexico.
A former Nova Uniao product, Gadelha has made no secret of how well she's adjusted to her new training regimen both under Greg Luttrell, who's now her head coach, and at Greg Jackson's gym. But, ultimately, her decision to make a new life abroad was about more than more advanced facilities and effective training methods.
As much as she loves Brazil, life at home was just too hard.
“I always tell my fighter friends who are still in Rio – it's like you learn more,” Gadelha said. “You absorb more when you're not worried, or stressed out. When you're focused solely on that. In Rio there was traffic, stress, problems with a bunch of things. Everything was expensive. I was worried about a variety of things that got in the way of my training. Sometimes I'd get to the gym upset or late.
“In Albuquerque, it's a lot more relaxed. I wake up, have breakfast at a big home. Everything is good and a lot different than what I was used to going through in Rio, in Natal (city where she lived for three years) and Mossoro (city of birth). That makes all the difference when it comes to absorbing techniques and learning. Even in physical conditioning, you get more time to rest. You don't spend so much time in traffic. The whole context is a lot easier abroad.”
While she's in a tricky situation as far as her current octagon position goes, Gadelha is also in a great place overall in her life. At 28, as one of the leading athletes on the biggest stage of the UFC, she looks back on the much different situation of when she arrived in Rio as a jiu-jitsu champ looking to break into MMA.
“It was very hard for me,” Gadelha said. “I arrived in Rio all by myself. I didn't have anything. I had only a backpack, a gi and a bunch of dreams. I went to Rio wanting to be a fighter, but I didn't have opportunities. I fought a lot of jiu-jitsu. I wanted to compete at MMA, but there were no opportunities. So I kept competing in jiu-jitsu, awaiting my shot until that first fight came. I was 18, and I loved it. But I made just enough money to get sneakers to train for the next fight. My purse was 300 reais (around $90.00 U.S.).
“It was very hard to support myself, to train, to eat well, and to fight. Everything was hard. Until I got opponents, and promotions that allowed women to fight – that was hard, too. I went through a lot of difficulties to be able to make it anywhere.”
In spite of all the difficulties, Gadelha managed to persevere not only as an athlete, but to pursue academic endeavors simultaneously. She attended law school and, while she hasn't yet been able to finish, she's got only one half of a final paper to turn in before earning a degree. And she's already in talks with her university to get that done soon.
Being a lawyer, however, was never Gadelha's dream. Yet, she wanted to apply to become a precinct chief – a position that, in Brazil, demands a degree and passing a highly competitive selection process. For now, with her focus elsewhere, these plans have taken a backseat.
But as Gadelha looks into her new life, they're not dead just yet.
“I've been looking into my documentation in the U.S.” Gadelha said. “I do want to be a police officer. That's why I went to law school in the first place, not to be a lawyer. And I've been studying the possibilities of joining some kind of special forces in the United States.”

AUSTIN – A fight outside an East Riverside business ended with one man losing his leg below the knee and another man facing a charge for hitting him with a SUV.
The arrest affidavit for Rogelio Berrones-Campos, 28, states officers were dispatched to the 1900 block of East Riverside around 2:25 a.m. Nov. 26 for a report of 20 people fighting in front of the club. Officers were directed toward the victim when they arrived, and found the man's right leg had been partially amputated below the knee. Police said the victim was rushed to emergency surgery, and that doctors “had to remove his lower right leg approximately 4 inches below his knee.”
Witnesses told officers two groups had gotten into an argument, possibly about broken beer bottles under and around the tires of a vehicle. Women from both groups began physically fighting, and witnesses told police the fight escalated when the men got involved to break them up.
Police allege that after the disturbance, Berrones-Campos got behind the wheel of a white Chevrolet Tahoe and rammed the other vehicle multiple times before driving around and ramming the back of the other vehicle. When the people in the other vehicle exited due to the airbags deploying, Berrones-Campos allegedly “began driving circles at a high rate of speed multiple times trying to strike the occupants” of the other vehicle. It was during these circles that police say the victim was struck and pinned between the Tahoe and the other vehicle.
Three witnesses and one person inside the Tahoe told police that Berrones-Campos was behind the wheel at the time the victim was struck.
Berrones-Campos has been charged with aggravated assault (motor vehicle). He is in the Travis County Jail on $60,000 bond. A booking photo is not available as of early Tuesday afternoon.
One blast goes bar down. Another snipes a top corner. The next one pings resoundingly off the crossbar.
It's not a defenceman or a forward gliding around the ice at the Canadiens' practice facility in Brossard, firing puck after puck fluidly and powerfully from the point.
It's Carey Price.
"He probably shoots harder than I do," says defenceman Nathan Beaulieu of his teammate who is known more for stopping pucks than shooting them with the same velocity as many NHL defencemen.
Predators' defenceman P.K. Subban can't resist taking a playful jab at his close friend and former teammate when asked to describe Price's slap shot.
"I'd compare it to a muffin. I thought that my baby niece had a harder shot."
On a more serious note, Subban adds, "I'd say it would be a tie between Pricey and Shea Weber. Shea has a muffin too." That's high praise for Price and hijinks from one superstar blueliner to another.
McKenzie: Is the shutout jinx real? Carey Price lost his shutout in the final seconds of last night's game. Was our own Conor McKenna to blame?
The blueline is where Price's slap shot originated. As a child growing up in Anahim Lake, B.C., Price played defence from novice through atom.
"Just like a lot of kids, I spent a lot of time on the pond in the backyard… [A hard shot] was just something that came naturally to me," he says.
Price doesn't know what speed his shot currently reaches, but he remembers that when he was nine years old a family acquaintance clocked his slap shot at 79 km/h.
"That's pretty hard for a nine-year-old," Price says. "Scored quite a bit [from the point], from what I remember."
Price's favourite childhood stick was a white and blue Canadien with a wood-coloured blade in a Cam Neely curve. The stick no longer exists but Price says he still has the old Habs-coloured gloves he used to use.
Now when Price wraps his Habs-coloured gloves around his weapon of choice, it's a CCM Tacks composite in 90 flex – and yes, it's a Carey Price pattern.
Five seasons ago, when Price and Mike Cammalleri were teammates, the goalie took a liking to the curve in Cammalleri's stick, if not the length.
"I'd have to put a foot-long plug in it," jokes Price, referring to the six-inch height difference between him and the New Jersey Devils sniper.
Price gave CCM a Cammalleri stick to mimic the curve, which Price likes because it is similar to a Joe Sakic blade but with more curve to better cup the puck. CCM made a longer model and stamped it with Price's name.
For much of Price's 10-year Canadiens career, when he plucks his CCM out of the stick rack on non-practice days and hits the ice in his tracksuit, it's like on-ice therapy.
"It's fun to mix things up," he says. "I'd rather go out and work on my skating and work up a sweat as opposed to being in the gym riding the bike."
Even though it looks like carefree fun, there's purpose behind Price's relaxed skate-and-shoot sessions.
For example, when goalies leave the net to play the puck they often have to cross over on the outside edges of their skates, which is different from the usual movements in the crease that rely heavily on inside edges.
The casual solo skates allow Price to work on his outside edges without the impediment of bulky goalie pads.
“One thing that helped my shot a lot was my skating ability,” he says. “I always felt like I had a good, solid base. I think that's the key to anybody's shooting ability.”
The evidence lies in the bar down, the snipe and the ping.

Mayor Greg Fischer announced a rally with Louisville civic, faith and other community leaders will take place Monday at the Muhammad Ali Center in response to President Donald Trump's controversial executive orders that kept an untold number of refugees from entering the U.S. on Saturday.
Fischer said in a tweet Saturday evening the event is "to voice support for our nation and our city, which was founded and is strengthened by immigrants."
Trump's executive actions, enacted on Friday, bar Syrian refugees indefinitely while prohibiting refugees from six other predominately Muslim countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen — for 90 days. The presidential decrees have also suspended the entry of all refugees for 120 days.
The decision rumbled through the country on Saturday with refugees being detained at U.S. airports, sparking protests and a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union. It has also been met with a sharp rebuke by Trump's critics.
►RELATED: Court grants emergency stay of Trump's immigration ban
Speaking to reporters from the Oval Office, Trump said his executive orders are "not a Muslim ban," which is what he called for during the 2016 presidential campaign in response to terror attacks. His administration has said the block on refugees is meant to protect the homeland from foreign nationals and to implement a more rigorous vetting process.
"It's working out very nicely," Trump said. "You see it at the airports, you see it all over."
Louisville has seen its immigrant population grow immensely in past 20 years, according to demographers.
Roughly 50,345 Louisville residents were born outside the U.S., which amounts to about 7 percent of the overall population. And about half of the city's foreign-born population originate in one of five countries, the most predominate being Mexico, at 14.3 percent, followed closely by Cuba, India, Bosnia and China.
Fischer's "Rally for American Values" will take place Monday at 6 p.m. at the Muhammad Ali Center, 144 N. 6th St.

A long-term follow-up of a clinical trial has shown promising results for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The findings, presented at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting 2012, represent an updated long-term survival analysis on patients treated with belagenpumatucel-L, a therapeutic vaccine derived from four lung cancer cell lines. The study included 75 patients with NSCLC who were randomly assigned three different doses of the vaccine. For all patients, the median survival was 14.5 months and the five-year survival rate was 20 percent. The 40 patients with stage 3B/4 cancer who received the two higher doses had a median survival of 15.9 months and a one-year survival rate of 61 percent, a two-year survival rate of 41 percent and a five-year survival rate of 18 percent. A phase III clinical trial of the vaccine is currently underway in eight countries.
Supporters of The Yes Means Yes Law
History doesn't repeat per se, but it seems to rhyme. In 1979, The Dead Kennedys sang “California Uber Alles” in honor of the statism embodied by then Governor Jerry Brown. Whether his aura smiles, frowns or requires a prune juice enema, Governor Brown remains Governor Brown. Like Big Brother, he is watching you. It could also be argued that like Big Brother, he has formed an alliance with his very own version of The Junior Anti-Sex League out of Orwell's dystopian novel. In supporting and signing the “Yes Means Yes Law” to govern how California Universities investigate sexual assaults, he has proven that 1984 remains depressingly relevant in 2014.
A subset of Right Wing Commentators are arguing over the impact and intent of this bill. I think they are looking at too small of a picture. Some, such as Heather MacDonald see it as the end of the collegiate bacchanal. She opines as follows.
But isn't this bureaucratic and legislative ferment, however ham-handed, being driven by an epidemic of campus rape? There is no such epidemic. There is, however, a squalid hook-up scene, the result of jettisoning all normative checks on promiscuous behavior. A recent case from Occidental College illustrates the reality behind so-called “campus rape.” Girls are drinking themselves blotto precisely in order to lower their inhibitions for casual sex, then regretting it afterwards.
Man-O-Sphere Bloggers consider the law to be a feminist plot to further weaken men. Dalrock offers this explanation for why he is bothered by the passage of the law.
Feminists are pushing for a world where female promiscuity is encouraged and defended with the full force of society. The danger is, conservatives could be baited into backing this as they were baited into backing child support. Those who don't formally approve of the new order are likely to want to stay out of it, out of a reluctance to being perceived as going to bat for promiscuous men. Ironically the standard argument against the law, that it will create a chilling effect on the hookup culture, only confirms to conservatives that this is in fact a good law. But the law isn't designed to put a damper on the hookup culture, it is designed to grease the skids for women to participate more fully in the hookup culture.
My Evil Inner Libertarian is entirely repulsed that Right Wing Thinkers would even be arguing over how this totalitarian, garbage legislation impacts their participation (or lack thereof) in anonymous, soul-sucking fornication. This isn't about the protection of anybody. This is about control and deconstruction of the individual. George Orwell had The Party encourage all young women to join the Junior Anti-Sex League so that people would find it harder to develop any affectionate attachment outside the society.
So rather than going to bat for promiscuous men, or celebrating the return of campus Neo-Victorianism, we need to ask ourselves a much more important question. “Who in the heck are these university administrators to try, convict and sentence anyone of rape?” Rape is a criminal act with harsh yet condign prison terms in any State of the Union. We already have a legal system that investigates and tries allegations of such despicable misdeeds.
Non-judicial trial or arbitration set-ups unalterably produce outcomes skewed towards a favored party in the preceding. For now, accused men are the party out of favor and can reasonably expect to get their names blackened and there posteriors run out of town on the railroad. For now this may temporarily make people think twice before they indulge in the morally dead liquored-up banging session. Yet these are all externalities that miss the main point that no apparatus of state should be defining intimate experiences or controlling that aspect of our lives. It sort of makes my skin crawl that politicians would do so for their own benefit. Statist indulgences such as the “Yes Means Yes Law” in California are one major reason why most of the political ambitions of the surviving Kennedys are blessedly dead.
“The only trade agreements I believe in are ones that put workers first – because trade deals aren't good for the American people if they aren't good for working people. That's why I opposed CAFTA. That's why I oppose the South Korea Free Trade Agreement. -Barack Obama on the campaign trail, 11/13/2007
Three years later, Obama is taking bows for that very same South Korea Free Trade Agreement, negotiated by George Bush in 2007. He made a couple of changes that could potentially net the automakers a few hundred more jobs — but got no guarantees, and at the cost of hundreds of thousands of jobs. And all the things he said he opposed in the deal, that were bad for American workers and the environment, like limiting our ability to regulate banks and forcing American taxpayers to submit to judgments made by World Bank and UN tribunals? He didn't touch those.
So what does this deal do?
Like NAFTA and CAFTA, the Korea FTA (KORUS):
Allows foreign corporations to operate inside the United States underprivileged international trade agreements rather than having to obey our laws that apply to our businesses.
Prohibits us from limiting the size of banks — and thus we give up the right to decide what “too big to fail” is on our own shores
Prohibits us from banning risky financial goods and services (like derivatives trading), otherwise US taxpayers will have to pay compensation to international companies for the profits they won't be able to steal reap from engaging in such transactions
reap from engaging in such transactions Prohibits us from stopping capital transfers unless the IMF approves – even to fight money laundering and other financial
crimes
crimes Bans the government's ability to adopt “buy American” policies, determining how US tax dollars can be spent.
Limits what policies states and localities can establish over land use, and allows any such policies to be attacked in foreign tribunals if they do not conform to the trade pact's constraints
Forces the United States to submit to the judgment of foreign tribunals
Elevates foreign corporations to equal status with the sovereign United States, empowering foreign companies with new rights to sue the U.S. government before the UN and World Bank tribunals, skirting US courts.
Think that can't happen? To date, US taxpayers have paid out over $400 million in compensation to foreign corporations from such cases under NAFTA. And we also spent a million in legal costs even on cases we won, and there are billions more outstanding in unsettled cases. KORUS would extend that privilege not only to the 300 Korean establishment now in the United States — but to any Chinese or other firms incorporated in Korea that operates here.
President Obama says he's doing this to create jobs. As Paul Krugman points out today, that's hogwash. This deal will not do that — it's just NAFTA extended to another country, one with a huge manufacturing base. Since NAFTA was enacted, more than 45,000 U.S. manufacturing facilities have closed nationwide, and 5.5 million manufacturing workers have lost their jobs. Currently, American workers suffer a $2000 annual net loss due to our trade policy — more than the average American's federal tax burden. [cont'd.]
The President is also claiming it will close the trade deficit. In fact, the US trade deficit has exploded since NAFTA and WTO. America has become the dumping ground for the world, and we now have a trade deficit of over 6% of GNP — going from $103 billion before 1993 to a peak of over $830 billion.
As President Obama well knew when he was on the campaign trail, NAFTA has been devastating to our workforce. Over 5.6 additional American jobs could have been supported had NAFTA and the WTO not led to increased trade deficits. EPI estimates that Obama's KORUS deal could cost the loss of another 159,000 jobs — which is why Sherrod Brown, Mike Michaud and Linda Sanchez have all come out against it.
Sherrod Brown calls it a “dangerous mistake.”
With 15.1 million people currently unemployed in the United States, it is insane to extend the same NAFTA privileges to Korea that have already ransacked America's manufacturing sector and our labor force.
Candidate Obama knew that the way to curry favor with the public was to oppose NAFTA and CAFTA. But privately, he had people calling the Canadian government to assure them it was all just “campaign rhetoric.” The campaign then denied those reports.
Well, I guess we know the truth now. The President is doing just what Jamie Dimon and the Chamber of Commerce want — anything else was just campaign rhetoric.
Tibetans inside Tibet are the torchbearers of Tibetan movement, says His Holiness the Dalai Lama
0 Share with your friends Submit
Dharamshala: His Holiness the Dalai Lama today addressed a gathering of Tibetan devotees from various parts of India, including scholars of the Institute of Buddhist Dialectic and non-Tibetan devotees from Mon, Bhutan and Britain.
Following a brief photo session with each group at Tsuglagkhang courtyard, His Holiness the Dalai Lama spoke for over an hour, emphasising his lifelong commitments towards a better humanity, preservation of Tibetan Buddhist tradition and meaningful resolution of the Tibet issue.
“I always keep saying that the Tibetans inside Tibet are the real masters of the Tibetan destiny. Even when faced with dangers to their lives, they have, in every respect, shown great valour and courage in preserving the indomitable Tibetan spirit, while upholding their rights and dignity as a people,” he told the gathering.
“The principal asset for credibility of Tibetan cause on the world stage is the dedication of the Tibetans inside Tibet to the common cause and their unrelenting courage. It is because of these that the truth of our position stands proven,” His Holiness said, urging them to uphold the spirit.
“Tibetans are a unique people, spiritually blessed by the Chenresig, Avalokiteshvara and in reality, blessed with the rich culture, heritage and language.”
Reasserting his position on seeking genuine autonomy, His Holiness said, “Tibet was materially backward but spiritually highly developed. There is mutual benefit.”
He also expressed hope for positive changes to take place within China. “The present situation inside Tibet is indeed sad and unfortunate, but I am hopeful that in time, changes will take place within China.”
On the cultural aspect, he said, Tibetans should pride themselves of its thousand millennium old cultural heritage, rooted in the profound Nalanda teachings.
“The tradition handed down to us from Nalanda includes profound philosophy and logic, as well as a rich understanding of the workings of the mind and emotions. We have kept this alive for more than 1000 years and now are in a position to make positive contribution to the well-being of humanity through our own culture. It is a meaningful aspiration to have.”
The 82-year-old Tibetan leader urged youth to pay serious attention on learning Tibetan language and take heed of his advice.
“The most profound teachings of Buddha and the Nalanda masters are in Tibetan and therefore, the best medium to receive these teachings is through the Tibetan language.
Also in attendance were graduates of the Tibetan Medical and Astro Institute and scholars of the Institute of Buddhist Dialectic.
His Holiness spoke of the unique aspects of the Tibetan medicine and how it serves as an advanced preventive medication.
He also commended the members of the LHA institute for their dedicated public service, particularly in field of education. He said, “Making efforts in the field of education is highly important and indispensable for sustaining the Tibetan Buddhist culture and ethnicity in these most difficult circumstances in Tibet's history.”
Arsenal went top of the Premier League with a handsome 3-1 win against Stoke City at Emirates Stadium on Sunday.
New-signing Mesut Ozil lived up to his billing by supplying all three goals. His free-kick was spilled by Asmir Begovic for Aaron Ramsey to make it 1-0 after five minutes.
After Geoff Cameron had equalised, the German fired in the balls from which Per Mertesacker and Bacary Sagna headed home.
By the end, the Arsenal fans had begun the “olés” every time a home player touched the ball.
In fairness, Stoke were better than that and Wenger's men were under significant pressure in patches.
However Arsenal keep coming through those periods and then find the net themselves. That is not luck.
Neither is seven straight wins. Nor being top of the Premier League.
Arsenal were decent before Ozil came, but now they are significantly better.
This was more than a regulation fixture for the Emirates faithful. There was already excitement in the air as the record-signing was going to play in front of a home crowd for the first time.
In addition, it was #Islington100 Day. The Club were celebrating a century in the borough and, to commemorate the event, the matchday programme came with a free re-print of one that had accompanied the fixture with Leicester Fosse on September 6, 1913.
Before kick-off, Wenger named an unchanged line-up. Theo Walcott warmed up but was scratched off the starting XI after picking up a minor pelvic/abdominal problem. Serge Gnabry stepped up from the bench and Ryo joined the substitutes.
Arsenal were ahead within five minutes. Ozil's free-kick was pushed out by Begovic to Ramsey, who slotted home his seventh goal of the season.
It was the 13th straight game in which Arsenal had taken the lead. But, this time, they did not kick-on.
Stoke did not exactly pour on pressure but their drip-drip-drip approach brought a result.
In the 26th minute, Stephen Nzonzi clipped a clever ball to the far post. Marko Arnautovic sidefooted a volley against the upright and Cameron returned the rebound into the net from the edge of the area.
It was the American's first goal in English football and a wake-up call for Arsenal.
As if sharply dug in the ribs, they responded. Jack Wilshere waltzed through but his shot was blocked.
Then, in the 32nd minute, Ozil floated a corner on to head of Mertesacker but his goalbound header was cleared off the line.
Stoke did not learn their lesson as, four minutes later, Arsenal did the same thing and this time found the net.
Ozil's corner was nodded towards the far post but Mertesacker. Laurent Koscielny jumped at the ball but missed it. That may have been a factor in Begovic failing to claim and it's finding the far corner.
At half-time, Arsenal had done enough to deserve their lead but the points were far from secure.
They went about acquiring a lock and key early in the second half. Olivier Giroud's piledriver was tipped over by Begovic and then the Frenchman fired wide.
On the hour Ozil popped up on the right of the area but his low shot was saved.
But despite Arsenal's superiority, Stoke were seriously searching for an equaliser.
Marc Wilson forced Wojciech Szczesny to palm the ball aside and then Mathieu Flamini cut out Cameron's dangerous low cross.
At this point, the statistics said that Stoke were enjoying almost 70 per cent possession in the second half. They were hardly pinning back Arsenal but they were asking tricky questions of the Arsenal defence.
So Sagna's goal was very welcome. Once again the supplier was Ozil. His left-wing free-kick was met with an arching header that dropped into the far corner of the net.
It was Sagna's first goal since that crucial header in the 5-2 comeback against Tottenham in February 2012.
Stoke struggled to muster much after that and Ramsey might have added another in injury time.
But, at the whistle, Arsenal had more than done enough.
ADVERT
In its first official statement on the case, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it would not allow outside interference with Saudi Arabia's judicial system.
Mr Badawi has been sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes – of which so far only 50 have been carried out – for using his liberal blog to criticise Saudi Arabia's clerics.
Last month judges in the country's criminal court want him to undergo a retrial for apostasy, which carries the death sentence.
“The Kingdom cannot believe and strongly disapproves what has been addressed in some media outlets about the case of Citizen [Badawi] and the judicial sentence he has received,” the statement read.

“The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been one of the first States to promote and support human rights. Though these commitments are more than obvious, some international quarters and some media, regrettably, have emptied human rights of their sublime meanings,” it added.
“Instead, such quarters and media deviated towards politicising and abusing those rights to serve aggressions against the right of States to sovereignty. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will most certainly disallow such matter.”
The Ministry also said the Saudi constitution “originates from the Islamic Sharia which enshrines one's sacred rights to life, property, honour, and dignity”.
Under its interpretation of Sharia law, rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking are all punishable by death.

Mr Badawi's case has prompted protests across the world and has been raised by several governments.
Over the weekend Germany's economic affairs minister and vice-chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, became the latest diplomat to raise the subject with King Salman.
Ahead of a meeting with the Saudi monarch in Riyadh on Sunday, Mr Gabriel said: “The harshness of this sentence, especially the corporal punishment, is something unimaginable for us and of course it weighs on our relations.”

BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten has announced he will be standing down with immediate effect on health grounds following major heart surgery.
Appointed in 2011, he had a turbulent tenure, including the Savile crisis and the row over senior staff pay-offs.
In a statement, Lord Patten said he had been admitted to hospital with chest pains on 27 April and had successful heart surgery the following day.
Doctors have advised him he "cannot continue to work at the same pace".
Analysis The issue here is timing. When Lord Patten said he planned to stand down in April 2015, he admitted it was "not ideal", given that an election would be about to take place and the negotiations over the renewal of the BBC's Charter were due to begin. Standing down a year early merely adds a degree of urgency to a process that was probably going to begin in a few months time anyway. So expect a job advert to appear in the papers in the months to come. The final decision lies with the Government.
"On this basis I have decided with great regret to step down from much the most demanding of my roles - that of chairman of the BBC Trust," he said.
"This is a position that requires and has received from me 100% commitment and has been my priority at all times."
As BBC Trust chairman, Lord Patten earned a salary of £110,000 for working three to four days a week. His term was due to end in April 2015, after four years in post.
However, he had admitted the timing was "not ideal" - with both a general election and negotiations over the renewal of the BBC's Royal Charter looming.
Indeed, Lord Patten was previously believed to have floated the idea of extending his term in order to avoid the process of appointing a successor - which is handled by the government of the day - becoming politicised.
'Not perfect'
Lord Patten, who will be 70 next week, has had a varied career, including senior roles in the Conservative Party, the chancellorship of Oxford University, the governorship of Hong Kong and a seat in the House of Lords.
He said of his decision to stand down from the BBC: "It would not be fair to my family to continue as before; and equally it would not be fair to the BBC and those it serves not to be able to give that commitment which the role demands."
He said it had been "a privilege" to have served as chairman of the BBC Trust but added that "it is not perfect - what institution is?"
Image copyright PA Image caption Chris Patten [third from left, middle row] was a member of the 1989 Tory Cabinet
Media commentator Steve Hewlett said Lord Patten would be "the first to agree" his chairmanship "hadn't gone as well as he would have hoped".
Lord Patten appointed George Entwistle as the BBC's director general - only to see him quit 54 days later in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.
He also had to appear in front of MPs to explain why the BBC had written off £100m of licence-payers' money on an ambitious but doomed IT project - even though the scheme pre-dated his tenure.
Most embarrassingly, he became embroiled in a public spat with former BBC director general Mark Thompson over who knew what, and when, about the BBC over-paying its senior staff.
'Staunch believer'
In his statement, Lord Patten said he would "be making no further statement whatsoever about the BBC or my period as chairman of the BBC Trust" for the time being.
However, he added that he hoped to "say more on the future of the BBC" at Charter Review time.
The BBC's royal charter, which sets out the corporation's purposes and the way it is run, is reviewed every 10 years. The current charter runs until the end of 2016.
Lord Patten's family has requested that their privacy is respected while he recovers.
Vice-chairman Diane Coyle will take over as acting chairman of the BBC Trust until a successor is appointed.
BBC director general Tony Hall said: "I have enjoyed working with Chris over the last year; he is a staunch believer in the BBC and he has brought his vast experience to the role of chairman.
"He has steered the BBC through some of its most difficult days. In undertaking this role he brought unrivalled experience, wisdom, and an overwhelming desire to ensure that the BBC remains the best public service broadcaster in the world."
Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said in a letter to Lord Patten that he had "embraced the challenges that have confronted the BBC" and "shown an unfettered personal commitment to securing the best outcome for the public".
Shadow Culture Secretary Harriet Harman said: "Lord Patten became trust chair at a difficult time in its history and helped the BBC to turn a corner under new leadership with Tony Hall."
Online petitions, twibbons (those cause-supporting icons on people's Twitter avatars) and Facebook protest pages are all godsends for the well-meaning activist short on time. For very little effort (just one click in most cases), any one of us can look worthy to our friends and quite probably cure breast cancer at the same time. Remember when we watched a video and stopped Kony? Half of us didn't even make it all the way through that film but look how effective we were.
Annoyingly though, not all grassroots social campaigns are quite as successful. It turns out, for example, that copying and pasting a made-up legal statement into your Facebook status doesn't make a long-standing contractual agreement null and void.
Every time you fall for a Facebook hoax, this random lady despairs (Picture: Corbis)
This morning, I've seen nearly a dozen online acquaintances fall for the latest Facebook hoax – a message encouraging users to repost a statement that apparently limits public use of anything they post on the site. If you see anyone posting the following message, ignore it:

“In response to the new Facebook guidelines I hereby declare that my copyright is attached to all of my personal details, illustrations, comics, paintings, professional photos and videos, etc. (as a result of the Berner Convention).
For commercial use of the above my written consent is needed at all times!
(Anyone reading this can copy this text and paste it on their Facebook Wall. This will place them under protection of copyright laws. By the present communiqué, I notify Facebook that it is strictly forbidden to disclose, copy, distribute, disseminate, or take any other action against me on the basis of this profile and/or its contents. The aforementioned prohibited actions also apply to employees, students, agents and/or any staff under Facebook's direction or control. The content of this profile is private and confidential information. The violation of my privacy is punished by law (UCC 1 1-308-308 1-103 and the Rome Statute).”
It's probably worth noting immediately that there is no ‘Berner Convention'. There is the Berne Convention (for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works) but that typo isn't what makes the entire statement completely false.
The message also references the Uniform Commercial Code, specifically UCC 1 1-308-308 1-103. The UCC is a set of US recommended laws that regulate the way states do business with each other; it's got nothing to do with social networks. But pedantry aside, is the gist of the message accurate?
No.
Anyone signing up to Facebook agrees to their terms and conditions (which can be read here). In the same way that posting your own hotchpotch rental agreement in your lounge window makes no difference to your landlord once he's got your original signed contract, neither does this status update amend your agreement with Facebook. You simply can't retroactively alter the mutually-agreed terms by making a Facebook post.

So what should you do if you've already amended your Facebook privacy settings and you're still unhappy with the site's policies? Other than renegotiating your terms with them, your options are limited to this: lump it or leave.

Update: Facebook spokesperson Andrew Noyes said in a statement that Facebook users own any content they post and any message saying otherwise is false:
“We have noticed some statements that suggest otherwise and we wanted to take a moment to remind you of the facts.”
“When you post things like photos to Facebook, we do not own them. Under our terms, you grant Facebook permission to use, distribute, and share the things you post, subject to the terms and applicable privacy settings.”

Here are some of the things that have been said by the guy who has galvanized the GOP's Tea Party base and taken the lead in the Republican presidential race:
“Every Republican wants to do a big number on Social Security, they want to do it on Medicare, they want to do it on Medicaid. And we can't do that.”
Story Continued Below
“As far as single payer [health care], it works in Canada, it works incredibly well in Scotland. … You can't let the people in this country, the people without the money and resources, to go without healthcare."
“People as they make more and more money can pay a higher percentage” of taxes.
Only one of two conclusions can be drawn here. Either the Tea Party base—which the media would have us think mainly consists of angry libertarians inveighing against taxes and runaway big government—hasn't really been listening to Donald Trump, who made all the above statements, or, alternatively, most of the media have read the Tea Party and its true aims and ambitions entirely wrong.
I suggest the latter is the correct answer. The success of Trump's campaign has, if nothing else, exposed the Tea Party for what it really is; Trump's popularity is, in effect, final proof of what some of us have been arguing for years: that the Tea Party is less a libertarian movement than a right-wing version of populism. Think William Jennings Bryan or Huey Long, not Ayn Rand. Tea Partiers are less upset about the size of government overall than they are that so much of it is going to other people, especially immigrants and nonwhites. They are for government for them and against government for Not-Them.
This is what explains a lot of what's going on now. After all, according to the commentariat, the Summer of Trump was supposed to have been the Summer of Rand Paul. It seems like only yesterday that the media were interpreting the rise of the Tea Party as a triumph of anti-statism and predicting that Paul, with his libertarian views on national security and data privacy, represented the future of the American right.
But Paul has all but disappeared from view, polling in the low single digits, while Trump has soared into the lead, and nothing he says, no matter how outrageous, seems to sour the right-wing base on him. Trump is no libertarian; quite the opposite. He is a classic populist of the right who peddles suspicion of foreigners—it's no accident that he was the country's leading “birther” raising questions about Barack Obama's citizenship—combined with a kind of “producerism.” In populist ideology, society is divided not among rich and poor but among producers and parasites.
Populists are suspicious of unearned wealth, including the interest charged by bankers who manipulate “other people's money” (to use the phrase of Louis Brandeis). And populists the world over are hostile to the idle or undeserving poor who allegedly live on welfare at the expense of productive workers and capitalists. Populists tend to attribute the existence of large numbers of the idle rich and the idle poor to government corruption. In the words of the 1892 People's Party platform: “From the same prolific womb of governmental injustice we breed the two great classes—tramps and millionaires.”
To anyone paying attention, it should have been clear from the 2010 elections onward that Tea Party voters were at odds with the libertarians in the Republican donor class and Beltway think tanks. Further confirmation came when David Brat, an obscure college professor, defeated Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a 2014 Republican primary in a shocking upset. Cantor was punished for supporting more legal immigration and amnesty for illegal immigrants, something favored by Republican elites but opposed by conservative voters. Of immigration, Brat told Fox News: “It's the most symbolic issue that captures the differences between me and Eric Cantor.”
As those inside the China deal were quick to point out, the latest development at Manchester City is not about buying Lionel Messi or even attracting Pep Guardiola. It is bigger than that. Seriously. Much bigger. This is the game changer.
To relay the simple exclamation of one of the leading figures behind the deal: we're in. Inside China, inside a new way of doing football business, inside the world's biggest emerging market, inside and making their rivals nervous.
It was only last September that David Gill, the former chief executive at Manchester United and now a leading figure on football's world stage, was pontificating with confidence about where the power in the game resided.

Kevin De Bruyne (right) scored twice as City beat Hull 4-1 in the League Cup quarter-final on Tuesday
‘I'm not being arrogant,' he said, ‘but Manchester City will never be as big as Manchester United in Asia and certain markets.'
That statement seems very naive this morning. At the precise moment he was speaking, City were already in advanced talks with a government-backed Chinese investment group, China Media Capital Holdings.
The conversations were the culmination of a three-year strategic plan to link with the region. Not in ways that now seem rather ham-fisted and guileless. Not by signing a player from the Japanese league and thinking that was Asia sorted. Not by playing the odd friendly, getting ripped off by agents and promising to return again in two years' time (because next summer was America's turn). Not by dipping a toe in the market, opening the odd superstore, or making Wahaha the official soft drink partner for China.
City targeted a substantial, long-term investment and allowed it to play out at government level. It is the only way to do business, real business, in China. They were thinking far bigger than their rivals, and were already putting the pieces in place to strike a unique arrangement.
Manchester City, New York City, Melbourne City and Japanese side Yokohama F. Marinos all belong to CFG
CMC chairman Ruigang Li will represent the consortium at CFG by becoming its seventh board member
WHAT IS CITY FOOTBALL GROUP? An Anglo-Arab holding company founded in 2014 which oversees the network of clubs linked to Manchester City as well as dealing with other footballing operations. Manchester City, New York City, Melbourne City and Japanese side Yokohama F. Marinos all belong to CFG. CFG runs under parent company the Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG) and recorded a revenue of over £300m last year. The ADUG was set-up in order to facilitate the purchase of the Premier League club. City chief executive Ferran Soriano and club chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak oversee the day-to-day running of the CFG. Under Sheik Mansour's leadership, City have won the FA Cup, Capital One Cup, two Premier League titles and the Community Shield.
CMC have bought 13 per cent of the City Football Group, but that is not the same as buying into Manchester City. The new investors will have a presence on the board of the holding company, but no say in the running of the individual clubs.
Were Guardiola to come to City next summer, he would still be in charge of his football team, in conjunction with his Barcelona allies Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain. CFG comprises a worldwide network of clubs including New York City, Melbourne City and Yokohama Marinos. Through them, China will branch into football, with the ultimate aim of hosting the World Cup.
Further down the line a Chinese arm for CFG is certain to be sought, perhaps in Beijing or Shanghai, or by creating an entirely new team for the Chinese Super League, maybe based in Hong Kong.
A lot of options are being thrown at China's new partners, including the possibility of starting up in burgeoning holiday-resort cities to the south, such as Sanya. There is much still to be decided.

Yet what was plain as City announced the arrangement on Tuesday morning is that their rivals have been left in the traps. Of course, Manchester United are huge in China and could easily court similar investment. They do not, however, have the structure that would keep the club off-limits.
Manchester United could sell 13 per cent to China tomorrow, but it would give the investors direct involvement in the football. There is no network of clubs, no global arrangement of development and expansion that can be fed straight into China. A new investor at United would be sitting down discussing whether to sell Wayne Rooney, or bid for Cristiano Ronaldo. That is not what China is looking for.
Xi Jinping, China's president and party to this deal, has unveiled a 50-point plan aimed at making China a ‘soccer powerhouse'. The sport has recently become compulsory in schools, for instance. China recognises football's influence and prestige, it sees the status of the World Cup, it wants in on it all.
As for City, what is now incontrovertible is that this is not some vanity project, some rich man's toy. The reason Sheik Mansour is not at every home game ligging with Liam Gallagher is that he is not some dotty playboy, who is bored and fancies a little excitement. He is a serious financial player, and investor, who sits in the rooms where power resides, discussing foreign policy and the economic outlook of the planet. And he intends securing the financial future of his country long after the natural resources have run out.
His rivals have underestimated that. Gill thought Asia was all about league titles. ‘Look at Liverpool,' he said. ‘The club haven't won the league for so many years but they are very popular in Asia. The big teams with history and heritage — Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Juventus and Real Madrid — have that.'

WHO Is THE INVESTORS? State-backed China Media Capital was founded by Li Ruigang, an influential Shanghai Communist Party member who has deftly mixed business and politics. During Xi's state visit to Britain, the Chinese president and the Prince William looked on as Li inked a deal with a British attraction operator to build a new Lego theme park in Shanghai. Li was present during Xi's visit to the US weeks earlier, when CMC announced a tie-up with Warner Brothers to produce and distribute films. Aside from his film and entertainment concerns Li splashed $1.3bn last year to win broadcast rights for five years to the Chinese football league, in the latest sign of growing interest in football among China's business elite. In 2014, Jack Ma, chairman of Internet giant Alibaba, purchased half of Guangzhou Evergrande, the reigning Asian Champions League winners.
And City don't, was the underlying message. But he ignored what they do have. An owner who talks to Xi, to Cameron, to Obama, who sees legacy projects and geopolitics from a government perspective. Abu Dhabi now moves into China selling its clubs as brands and using its expertise to facilitate the ambitions of the Chinese government.
If this results, long term, in a Chinese World Cup, then City are in at the ground floor as partners. City academies, City infrastructure. It is an echo of what they have done here, but from a more firmly established base. Sheik Mansour took a club that was a punchline and turned it into a force in world football. City barely had a human resources department when he arrived.
Now it is an exemplary business. The academy has been seven years in the making; the City Football Group is three years old. The value of the company was $3billion — and then the Chinese bought in. What might it be in several years' time, with the rewards of this alliance? So when those inside Abu Dhabi dismiss the idea that this deal is merely a shrewd way of affording Messi's £400,000 a week, football would do well to listen. They have been thinking far bigger than any imagined all along.
Napolitano appointment to impact Real ID?
Arizona is one of roughly a dozen states that have passed legislation saying they would not comply with Real ID. With the nomination of Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano to become secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security it raises questions of whether or not it will effect what states have to do with their driver licenses.
In June Napolitano called Real ID an unfunded mandate. She cited a White House estimate that Real ID would cost at least $4 billion to implement. But at that point the federal government has only appropriated $90 million to help Arizona and other states comply with the measure.
And while Arizona was against Real ID, it was one of the states scheduled to start issuing enhanced driver licenses. Washington and New York are issuing EDLs to expedite land border crossings and as part of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. The IDs have an embedded radio frequency identification tag that can be read from 15 to 20 feet away. The tags transmit an identification number that corresponds to the cardholder's personal information that is stored in a secure database.
Investors in two of 2016's wildest sectors won't be getting a break from big swings in the new year.
Exchange-traded funds that track gold miners and biotechnology stocks, both of which saw massive daily moves last year, will remain “among the most volatile” in 2017, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis of the options market.
“Gold miners posted the best 2016 performance across our ETF universe, whether judged on an absolute or risk adjusted basis, and the options market is pricing in another big year for volatility for the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF GDX, -0.18% and the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF GDXJ, +0.81% ” the firm wrote in a note to clients.
According to Goldman's analysis, the Gold Miners ETF could see a swing of as much as 34% in the coming year—either to the upside or the downside—while the Junior ETF, which focuses on small-cap companies in the space, could see a move of 44%.
While there are a variety of options strategies that investors can employ, a popular one is to use a “straddle,” where a call option and a put option are purchased at the same strike price. This is a bet that a security will move by a certain amount, rather than in a specific direction. A call option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to buy a security at a specific strike price. A put option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to sell at a specific strike price.
Read: These ETFs could make your 2017 a happy new year
Both mining funds saw big gains last year, with the large-cap ETF up 52.5% and the Junior fund soaring more than 64%. They easily exceeded the 8.6% gain in the price of gold US:GCZ7 thanks to cost-cutting and improved margins. Despite that, the funds are heavily correlated to moves in commodity prices, which could lead to the volatility Goldman expects in 2017. By some forecasts, gold could fall below $1,000 an ounce this year; it is currently trading around $1,174. Others remain bullish on the precious metal, citing uncertainty over President-elect Donald Trump and the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Biotech stocks were also extremely volatile in 2016, with the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology IBB, -0.41% falling 21.6% over the course of the year and the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF XBI, -0.78% losing 15.7%. The sector came under pressure due to a backlash over drug price hikes, an issue that became a political theme in the presidential election. Subsequent to his victory, Trump promisedto “bring down drug prices,” implying legislation that, if enacted, could hurt the sector's sales and profits.
According to Goldman's analysis, the options market is pricing in a move of 23% for the iShares fund and of 31% for the SPDR fund. While the move could again to be to the upside or the downside, Goldman noted that “sentiment is bullish” for the sector.
The handicap system does a simple, elegant job of identifying a player's ability. A 20-handicapper, a single-digit golfer, a club champion and a tour player all have different skill levels that lead to different scores. But what is it about a player's swing that produces those various scores? There have always been plenty of theories, but we at GolfTEC have used cutting-edge measuring tools to quantify the swings of 30,000 golfers of all abilities. The result is the SwingTRU Motion Study, and its findings allow us to pinpoint those elements of good players' swings that are the biggest separators from average or developing players. With the differences uncovered by SwingTRU, we can essentially build a "good player" composite. Here we'll look at six elements of the backswing and downswing and compare the data collected from high-handicappers (players shooting over 100) to that of professional golfers. The closer you can get to the pro numbers, the better results you'll see. It's Big Data producing smaller scores with facts, not opinions. – With Matthew Rudy
HIP SWAY AT THE TOP
The term "sway" is one of those general-purpose instruction words every golfer has heard, but it can be confusing. Are we talking about the hips? The upper body? Let's simplify it: The best players shift pressure over the back foot but without swaying the whole body off the ball. Less-skilled players exaggerate that pressure shift with a big body movement away from the target. To do it right, feel like you're moving your tailbone closer to the target than it was at address ( below, left ), but without letting your head shift toward the target or over your back foot. The SwingTRU study shows pros' hips on average move 3.9 inches toward the target on the backswing, and high-handicappers' hips move 2.55 inches. But it looks like the high-handicapper is shifting away from the target here ( below, right )—so what gives? We measure hip movement using the tailbone as the reference point, and anytime you turn your hips, your tailbone will move closer to the target. The key is, it should move several inches closer, not two.
Hip sway: Pros shift the hips toward the target more than high-handicappers do (above).
SHOULDER TILT AT THE TOP
When it comes to amateur players trying to hit the ball longer, the advice that steals most of the attention is "Get more turn." But all turn is not created equal. If you focus only on turning the shoulders and not how they turn, you're missing one of the key elements that separates you from the players on tour. For many golfers, the tendency is to turn the shoulders relatively level, as if you were turning to look behind you to talk to someone ( below, right ). But tour players tilt their shoulders in addition to turning them. SwingTRU recorded the pros at 36 degrees of downward shoulder tilt at the top of the backswing and high-handicappers at 29.6 degrees. What does that mean for you? Feel like your front shoulder moves directly toward the ground on your backswing ( below, left ). At first, this might seem like you're only tilting, but trust me, you'll be turning, too.
Shoulder tilt: pros turn the front shoulder downward; high-handicappers turn it more level.
HIP TURN AT IMPACT
Many of the swing mistakes amateurs make—like cutting across the ball and hitting a slice—happen because the upper body gets too active or active at the wrong time. Improving how you use your arms and chest is useful, but changing how you use your lower body also clears up some of those upper-body problems. Hip turn at impact is a prime example. Beginners tend to stall the hip rotation on the downswing and try to control the swing with their hands and arms ( right, bottom ). Tour players have their hips turned toward the target at impact almost twice as much ( right, top ).
The arms and club come through at the end of the chain reaction, not the beginning. In SwingTRU, the pros average 36 degrees open with the hips at impact; high-handicappers average 19.5 degrees open. Try these feels to increase hip turn: Get your belt buckle facing more toward the target than the ball at impact, and both knees pointed at the target a split second later.
HIP SWAY AT IMPACT
Does this sound familiar? On the downswing, you try to quiet your body to get more ball-striking consistency—and to avoid sliding through it, which you've heard is bad. Unfortunately, the byproduct of that is an insufficient pressure shift to your front leg on the way down. As a result, you aren't getting the most you can out of your swing. The best players at impact have shifted their hips ahead of where they were at address ( below, left ), but less-experienced players move farther behind the ball ( below, right ). SwingTRU data says the pros shift the hips on average 1.6 inches toward the target compared to the setup, and high-handicappers shift them .4 inches away from the target. For many students, thinking about what the hips do is too abstract. Instead, feel your front knee move toward the target on the downswing so that it's over the outside of your front foot. If you're used to hanging back, this will feel like a dramatic change. Get ready for some speed.
Hip turn: pros rotate the hips open faster than high-handicappers.
SHOULDER TILT AT IMPACT
We've said the shoulders need to tilt downward at the top of the swing, and that concept should carry through to impact—except now the tilt is upward. Making an arms-dominated swing, which so many amateurs do, tends to produce relatively level shoulders at impact ( below, right ). Better players have the back shoulder significantly lower than the front shoulder at impact ( below, left ). The biggest jump in our SwingTRU measurements came between the best amateurs (0 to 5 handicaps) and the pros. That tells us that shoulder tilt is one of the hallmarks of the elite player. The pros in the study averaged 39 degrees of upward tilt at impact; high-handicappers 27.5 degrees. To achieve it, your belt buckle should be over your front foot at impact, with your head still over the middle of your stance. Imagine a friend was holding an alignment stick against your ear closest to the target—your head would be moving away from that stick at impact.
Shoulder bend: pros finish with the torso stretched back; high-handicappers stay bent over.

SHOULDER BEND IN THE FOLLOW-THROUGH
The difference between shoulder tilt and shoulder bend is direction: Tilt is the movement of each shoulder up or down in relation to the ground, like a teeter-totter, and bend is the amount your upper body is stretched back, away from the target. The easiest way to think about it is how proud you look in your finish position. Good players get very tall through the chest in the follow-through ( below, left ), with the spine extended and the neck bending a few degrees away from the target. The typical issue amateurs have is staying bent over through impact ( below, right ). When you do that, you aren't getting the full benefit of the levers in your body or between your body and the club. Longer, taller levers produce more speed. In SwingTRU, the pros average 32 degrees of back bend, and the high-handicappers average 3.2 degrees. How can you get better? As you swing to your finish, try to feel like Superman or Wonder Woman, with an expanded, bulletproof torso and your front leg fully extended as if you just pushed off the ground to jump.
Good players look tall and proud at the finish, like Superman or Wonder Woman .

Path of the Protector
THERE IS A FURY EVEN DEMONS FEAR. The rage of a mother protecting her young ones. A mother bear, a dragon guarding her wyrmlings, an octopus guarding her eggs. Who would dare to stand between the younglings, and the protector that would die for them? You would die if you were so bold.
-Balli O'gane, Philosophies of Nature
Primal Path
Rage burns in every barbarian's heart, a furnace that drives him or her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, however. For some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a totem animal.
Path of the Protector
Following the legendary example of the barbarian leader known as Ayem, those that follow the Path of the Protector are hailed as the most powerful bodyguards on the Material Plane. Ayem herself was called the mother of her people, and the way she devoted herself to them, guided them, and protected them, is an inspiration to all who hear the tale.
Protective Rage
At 3rd level, when you Rage, pick 1 ally within 15ft of you. As long as you remain within 15ft of that ally, all enemies within melee range of you have disadvantage on weapon attacks made against that ally. Every time that ally takes damage from an enemy or aggressive entity, you gain temporary health equal to (your barbarian level) + (your Constitution modifier). This temporary health disappears when your rage ends.
If you do not deal or take damage for a round, but your chosen ally takes damage, you can continue to rage. If that ally falls to 0 hit points while you are raging, you gain advantage on all attacks for your next turn; however your rage then ends at the end of your next turn, and you suffer from two levels of exhaustion.
Nurturing Instinct
At 6th level, when you take a short or long rest you can choose a number of allies less than or equal to your proficency bonus. You instantly become aware of the position of any of those allies within 100ft of you that are at or below 1/4rd of their health, relative to your position. Furthermore, your movement speed increases by 10ft for each ally that you sense in this way.
Familial Protection
At 10th level, when you Rage, you can select an additional ally to protect. Should you decide to protect 2 allies instead of 1, then the temporary health you gain when a protected ally takes damage from an enemy or aggressive entity is reduced to (half of your barbarian level) + (your Constitution modifier).
Raging Retribution
At 14th level, while you are Raging, if an ally that you are protecting is being attacked by an enemy within range of your melee weapons, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that enemy.

This Primal Path was inspired by Almalexia (a.k.a. Ayem) from The Elder Scrolls series. She was a warrior princess who, upon being turned into a Living God by her companion Sotha Sil (a.k.a. Seht), became known as the Mother of Morrowind. She was the protector of her people, and it is said that in a direct fight she could best Sotha Sil and Vivec (a.k.a. Vehk), both great warriors in their own right.

HARTFORD, Conn. (WTNH) -- Thursday through Saturday, Tracy Keza's nationally recognized portrait series and senior thesis, "Hijabs & Hoodies," will be on display at Trinity College's Broad Street Gallery in Hartford.
A senior at Trinity College from Kigala, Rwanda, Tracy Keza began taking portraits of Hartford residents in 2015, in an effort to unravel racial and religious profiling.
Keza says she was galvanized by the many cases of police brutality against young black men in the United States between 2014 and 2015, and their depiction across media. She tells the Courant, "Images were just being made and shared online in a way that I felt wasn't productive." What's more, she says she was "frustrated that the field [she] wanted to go into was part of the problem of circulating a lot of these images."
"Hijabs & Hoodies" aims to reclaim and subvert the depiction of and narrative surrounding people of color, specifically the ways in which "clothing can be perceived as a threat."
The Courant explains that the project began as an "on-campus demonstration." Keza tells the Courant, "I took portraits of my friends, who were either black or Muslim or both, and I projected them onto the side of the chapel at Trinity College at night."

Keza will attend the opening reception at Trinity's Broad Street Gallery on Friday from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. Her 11-image black-and-white series can also see Saturday and Sunday from 2:00 to 3:00 p.m.
She says, "I want to humanize people who otherwise have been impacted by a broken system that continues to disenfranchise and disembody black and brown people and people from marginalized communities."

By DON McINTOSH, Associate Editor
Beer is said to be the beverage of the American worker — an ice-cold reward for a hard day's work, steeped in heritage and pride for the place it was made. Half the beer in America sports images of a bald eagle, verbiage about tradition, or a red-white-and-blue label. But look past the marketing and you find an industry profoundly reshaped by corporate consolidation and globalization in the last three decades. Today, 10 of the 10 best-selling beer brands in the United States come from just two companies, both of which are foreign-owned.
This story began as a quest to find union-made beer. But it turns out it's not easy to identify what beer is made by union workers. There's no union label on beer today, and accurate, up-to-date information isn't easy to come by. To produce this guide, the Labor Press spent days poring through government databases and corporate annual reports, hounding union and corporate press officers, and cold-calling local union officers. Here's what we found: Two massive and mostly unionized companies, one big beer company that doesn't make any beer, several smaller unionized breweries, and a fast-growing and almost entirely nonunion craft brewery sector.
Anheuser-Busch
Everyone knows Anheuser-Busch was started in St. Louis, Missouri in 1876. But since 2008, it's been a wholly-owned subsidiary of the world's largest brewer, the Belgian-Brazilian multinational that now calls itself AB InBev, headquartered in Leuven, Belgium and São Paulo, Brazil. With over 200 brands, AB InBev has a quarter of the world beer market, and 47.6 percent of the U.S. market.
In the United States, all of the company's domestic brands are union-made by members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, in 12 massive company-owned breweries around the country. In April, they ratified a new five-year union contract, which contains a pledge not to close any breweries. So all varieties of Budweiser, Busch, Natural Light, Michelob, Rolling Rock, O'Doul's non-alcoholic, Shock Top Belgian-Style wheat ale, and Hurricane and King Cobra malt liquors are union-made. A company web page lists which brands are brewed at each brewery for which area of the country, so if you're drinking a Budweiser in Oregon, for example, you can tell that it was brewed in Fort Collins, Colorado or Fairfield, California.
MillerCoors
The can says “since 1855, Milwaukee, WI” but today, Miller is one of over 150 brands in the world's second largest beer company, SABMiller, headquartered in London.
In the United States, SABMiller owns a 58 percent stake in a joint venture with Molson Coors (Canada's Molson and Denver's Coors having merged in 2005). The joint venture, MillerCoors, functions as a single company, brewing, marketing, and distributing the brands of its two parent companies, totaling about 28 percent of the U.S. beer market. The six former Miller breweries are union. The two former Coors breweries are not.
At the MillerCoors breweries in Irwindale, California; Fort Worth, Texas; and Eden, North Carolina, workers are represented by the Teamsters. In Trenton, Ohio, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, it's the United Auto Workers (UAW). And in Albany, Georgia, it's the International Association of Machinists.
MillerCoors' largest facility is the flagship Coors brewery in Golden, Colorado. Workers there were union-represented for 44 years, but Coors famously busted the union after permanently replacing workers who went on strike in 1977. That led to a 10-year boycott of Coors by the AFL-CIO, until Coors agreed to give union organizers a shot. But workers voted down the Teamsters in 1988. Today, five members of Operating Engineers Local 9 are the only union-represented workers among the brewery's 1,100 employees.
Meanwhile, Coors' newer Shenandoah brewery, which opened in 2007 in Elkton, Virginia, has never been union: Teamsters campaigned there in 2009 and again in 2012 and 2013, losing all three elections, the third of which was a rerun election ordered by the National Labor Relations Board after it found management's anti-union campaign broke labor law in multiple instances.
Since two of MillerCoors' eight breweries are nonunion, it's not easy to know which products were union-made. John Drew, Milwaukee regional representative for the United Auto Workers, says UAW considers any Miller products to be union-made. That includes top-selling Miller Light and Miller High Life, but not Coors Light or Keystone Light, even though those are also brewed at the former Miller breweries. Teamsters take the opposite tack, listing Coors as union-made, even though the former Coors breweries are nonunion.
SABMiller does have an upper-Midwest regional subsidiary that's all-union: Leinenkugel's, brewed by Teamsters in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin and by members of UAW in Milwaukee.
Pabst Brewing Company
The red-white-and-blue label says “Established in Milwaukee, 1844.” It should also say, “left town, 1996.” Pabst Brewing Company calls itself the largest American-owned brewery — because its larger competitors AB InBev and SABMiller are foreign-owned. But that's only half true. Pabst is American-owned — by a Greek-born billionaire who lives in Connecticut. But it's not a brewery. It's a collection of over 30 beer trademarks and secret recipes, plus marketing and sales. In the 1980s and 1990s, Pabst bought up a succession of beloved local breweries, closed them, and contracted out brewing to other companies. Today the company headquarters is in Los Angeles. The original Pabst brewery, closed in 1996, is now a LEED-Platinum-certified seven-block mixed-use development in downtown Milwaukee. And Pabst beer brands are brewed, packaged and shipped by competitor MillerCoors, in a contract that extends to June 2020.
So it's a double irony that Pabst Blue Ribbon experienced a resurgence among younger drinkers in the last decade who adopted it as a marker of working class authenticity. Pabst is the leading outsourcer of its industry, a beer company that makes no beer. And in the city where it was born, it's considered “beer non grata” for closing up shop and trying to skip out on its pension obligations on the way out of town.
Pabst's brand portfolio includes many national and regional beers: Schlitz, Old Milwaukee, Rainier, Olympia, Stroh's, Lone Star, Colt 45, and St. Ides. So when Pabst brands appear on a union-made list, it's because some of the facilities that make Pabst beers are union-represented, including the UAW-represented MillerCoors brewery in Milwaukee.
Contract Brewers with a union contract
The Labor Press also found several unionized contract breweries, which brew beers on contract for other companies. City Brewing Company owns the former Latrobe brewery (which originated Rolling Rock) in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, which employs members of Communications Workers of America. It also has a brewery in LaCrosse, Wisconsin, where workers are represented by the Teamsters. Teamsters also represent employees of the Minhas Craft Brewery in Monroe, Wisconsin; the Matt Brewing Company in Utica, New York; and the Genesee Brewing Company in Rochester, New York. Genesee brews its own line of beers as well as other brands.
Union Craft Breweries: Good Luck
Beer sales as a whole are actually declining in the United States. Older drinkers are turning to wine. Younger drinkers are increasingly consuming distilled spirits. But one category of beer has experienced rapid growth, and that's the craft beer segment that began among home brewers and small independent microbreweries. Today, craft beer accounts for about 7 percent of U.S. beer sales. Unfortunately for would-be drinkers of union-made beer, craft beer is almost entirely nonunion.
The Labor Press was able to identify just one unionized craft brewery: Mendocino Brewing Co., which makes Butte Creek organic beers and Talon Double IPA at a facility in Ukiah, California, where workers are represented by the Teamsters.
[NOTE TO READERS: Beer is an industry in a state of constant ferment, and with hundreds of new, mostly small craft breweries opening each year, it's possible we missed one or more union shops. If you know of any unionized breweries not identified in this article, please let us know by email or in the comments. We'll look into it, and update this list.]
Burnt out vehicles are strewn next to a destroyed building in Pisky village, in the eastern Donetsk region, controlled by Ukrainian froces on February 26, 2015 (AFP Photo/Oleksandr Ratushniak)
Pisky (Ukraine) (AFP) - This frontline Ukrainian village lacks gas, power and water.
Yet with barely a house left standing, Pisky remains a daily target of shelling, despite the latest truce with pro-Russian rebels, and Kiev's troops are digging down to survive.
Before the separatist conflict erupted in the east of the ex-Soviet country 14 months ago, Pisky was home to 2,000 people, many of whom worked in the coal mining centre of Donetsk just three kilometres (two miles) away.
But with Donetsk becoming the rebels' de facto capital last summer, Pisky became a strategic flashpoint that changed hands on repeated occasions.
It was an important supply centre for troops trying to control Donetsk's international airport, and became a prized outpost once the militants finally seized the hub in January.
Pisky's residents fled for safety, with only a handful of elderly people still somehow managing to survive amid the mangled metal and piles of rubble today.
Their new neighbours are Ukrainian soldiers, who spend much of their time underground. The troops like to remain inside a network of trenches facing southeast toward Donetsk, the well-armed rebels just 300 metres (yards) away.
"Man is an animal who can get used to living in conditions like this," said one soldier nicknamed Uncle Vova, short for Volodymyr.
- Watching Batman on TV -
Now 46, Uncle Vova lives with a dozen other soldiers in a two-storey house just behind the trenches.
They say the house was built by a businessman as his summer retreat. It was abandoned when the first booms of warfare echoed over Ukraine's once-thriving rust belt.
Traces of its original use as a summer residence are still evident. There is a small gym and a second outdoor kitchen in the garden. The soldiers spend their time in the basement, where they sleep, eat and while away the time.
The television still works, using a generator, as does an ancient video player. Tapes of Batman and Moby Dick are scattered nearby.
The soldiers say they prefer watching films to the news on TV.
That is hardly surprising, since the channels aired locally are only Russian or the one run by the rebels' self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic.
Troops take turns cooking on a gas cylinder. And to make life even remotely resemble the one before daily bloodshed, they have started gardening and planting vegetables. In a central courtyard, a small farmyard is sprouting up.
"I've got five chickens, a rooster and a turkey," said an officer who goes by the call sign Farmer.
"There's even a small pig named Putin," he added, referring to the Russian president that most in Pisky blame for starting the war.
"We used to have Yanukovych, but we killed him and ate him on Victory Day," he said, invoking the name of the Kremlin-backed Ukrainian president ousted in the weeks preceding the fighting.
- Walls pierced with bullets -
To wash, they have set up a small wooden outdoor hut that they prefer not to use more than once a week. The shower drains precious water, which they get through irregular deliveries in plastic bottles.
But one man, 75-year-old Vasyl Bobyl, refuses to spend his nights sheltering underground like the other dozen or so residents still clinging on in the village.
"I'm not afraid," said Bobyl, a toothless man who has lived in Pisky for six decades.
"Those who can still walk have left, the others have stayed," said Bobyl, who walks with a limp. His daughter, for example, has fled for Odessa, a southern port controlled by Kiev and a fairly safe distance away from the front.
A poster of a religious icon is pinned on one of the walls inside Bobyl's residence. "That's my armour," he said with seeming irony.
"You see, all the other walls have been pierced with bullets or shrapnel. But this one is intact."
Hillary Clinton relented Tuesday to months of demands that she relinquish the personal email server she used while Secretary of State, directing the device be given to the Justice Department.
Clinton's use of her private email account linked to a server in her home in a New York City suburb for her work as America's top diplomat came to light in March and drew fire from political opponents who accused her of sidestepping transparency and record-keeping laws.
Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said she has “pledged to cooperate with the government's security inquiry, and if there are more questions, we will continue to address them.”
Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, turned over the emails after the FBI determined that he could not remain in possession of the classified information, an official who had been briefed on the matter told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to be quoted publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
The State Department previously had said it was comfortable with Kendall keeping the emails at his Washington law office.
It's not clear if the server will yield any information — Clinton's attorney said in March that no emails from the main personal address she used while secretary of state still “reside on the server or on back-up systems associated with the server.”
Clinton, currently the frontrunner for the Democratic Party's nomination for president in 2016, had to this point refused demands from Republican critics to turn over the server to a third party, with Kendall telling the House committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that “there is no basis to support the proposed third-party review of the server.”
Republicans jumped on Clinton's Tuesday decision to change course, as well as the additional disclosure that two emails that traversed her personal system were subsequently given one of the government's highest classification ratings.
“All this means is that Hillary Clinton, in the face of FBI scrutiny, has decided she has run out of options,” Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement. “She knows she did something wrong and has run out of ways to cover it up.”
House Speaker John Boehner said in a press release on his website that Clinton's “mishandling of classified information must be fully investigated.”
The chairman of House Select Committee on Benghazi, Trey Gowdy, lambasted Clinton and the Obama administration over what he called a “serious national security issue.”
News of Clinton turning over her server came as Sen. Charles Grassley said two of the emails, which traversed Clinton's insecure home email server, were deemed “Top Secret, Sensitive Compartmented Information,” which is among the government's highest classifications.
Goldman Sachs is once again warning the world of a coming spike in oil prices that will remind everyone of 2008.
The current financial crisis is to blame. While we focus on fixing the banking sector, we've forgotten that there are fundamental problems with the commodites markets.
The spike from 2008 will return because there's been "decades" of poor investment decisions by oil producers.
When the economy kicks into gear around the world, supply shortages will become problematic, and the price of oil will spike. Says Goldman via Alphaville, "As the commodity markets rebound with the broader global economy we expect a redux of 2008 when severe supply constraints forced the rationing of demand through sharply higher prices to keep the markets balanced."
Apparently, Goldman Sachs didn't get the memo. We're going to chase the speculators out of the market, so none of this will be a problem.

Hiya guys! It's time for another simple and beautiful nail art day featuring polish(es) from thefrom OPI . As I've mentioned the previous weeks, the press samples here were received as part of the campaign with Preen.Me and OPI for being part of the. As much as I love doing detailed freehand manis, sometimes! That's why I wanted to create this segment to show you guys how to do some quick designs that'll get you where you need to go with eye-catching nails. I know this may look intimidating, but this was only three steps! Gradient, stamping, and topcoat... that's it!At this point I think it's safe to say that this gorgeous blue is my favorite from the entire OPI Starlight Collection. I think I have used it as a main polish in about four different manis, haha. At this rate I'll need to purchase a backup by the end of the month!I adore using lace stamping, it adds such a nice pop factor to a mani. It's very modern and sleek no matter the colors you decide to go with. This mani overall is super quick and easy to do, maybe twenty minutes tops. Perfect if you're rushing to get ready for that holiday party!Now here's a break down of everything else I used to create this mani:The key to this design is the blending! You want to choose a stamping polish that will 'disappear' into the gradient. Ooh, nail magic haha.I'd like to note that Essie's Sugar Daddy is a total optional step! My nails are stained a bit yellow and that's not something I want to show through so this polish ends up being the perfect solution. It's definitely my go-to whenever I want to do negative space manis.Well that's it for todays nail art look! I hope you like it and thanks for reading guys!

Bishnu Shrestha, a brave Gurkha soldier in Indian Army, defeated 30 train robbers while returning home after a voluntary retirement. The Indian army, is going to award Bishnu with Sourya Chakra, Bravery Award and Sarvottam Jeevan Raksha medals during the Indian Republic Day celebration on January 26 .
While in the train, Maurya Express from Ranchi to Gorakhpur, on September 2, 2010, 35 year-old Bishnu saved a girl about to be raped by the train robbers in front of her helpless parents. After looting the train, when the robbers started to strip a 18 year old girl in front of him, he couldn't contain his calmness. He took out his khukari and took on the group of 30 robbers, alone. In the fight, he killed three of dacoits and injured eight others. Remaining dacoits fled the scene to save their lives.

Buy Dead Synchronicity: Tomorrow Comes Today as a Steam Key.
Just darkness. And then there was light…
But not enough for Michael to find out who he is and what happened to the outside world. The Great Wave, the Dissolved… are just hollow words in his looted mind. Help Michael face a rotten reality, a universe that's fading away fast! Face a merciless world that gets sick and vanishes. Face no past, no present, no future. Face the impending moment of “dead synchronicity”. And you'd better hurry. Otherwise…what will you do when Time dissolves itself?
A terrible pandemic is turning all of humanity into the Dissolved – the sick whose deliria provide them with supernatural cognitive powers... but also steer them towards a gruesome death. The root of this illness seems to be the Great Wave, an inexplicable chain of natural disasters that destroyed all energy sources and communications and plunged the world into a chaos ruthlessly controlled by both the authorities and the army alike. You will have to help Michael, a man with no past, recovering his identity and decode the events that brought the world to the edge of collapse. Because, if Michael doesn't hurry, he won't be able to avoid the impending moment of dead synchronicity... when Time dissolves itself.
Dead Synchronicity: Tomorrow comes Today is a 2D point and click adventure featuring a script with dystopian overtones. The game pays homage to classic adventures (The Secret of Monkey Island, Broken Sword, Day of the Tentacle...) but revolves around a more mature theme, along the lines of games such as “I have no mouth and I must scream” or “Sanitarium”.
Features
It's fair to say that the Discovery Channel is not what it used to be. What was once an enthralling educational program that left you itching to learn more has disappointedly begun indulging the masses with sensationalist garbage and lies that have understandably tainted its reputation. But thankfully, we can now wave goodbye to “documentaries” that make science lovers want to tear their hair out as there's a new president on the scene, and it seems he's got some sense.
The channel's new chief, Rich Ross, was elected as president in late October, but only officially joined the company this month. Yesterday, at the Winter TV press tour, he promised to stop broadcasting fake stuff, or "mockumentaries".
“It's not whether I'm a fan of it,” he said, speaking about said mockumentaries, which we shall ignore. “I don't think it's right for Discovery Channel, and think it's something that has run its course. They've done very well… but I don't think it's something that's right for us.” And we're glad to hear it.
While producing fake documentaries might seem harmless and amusing at first glance, such as convincing the credulous that mermaids actually exist, some of these are in fact damaging, and therefore not a laughing matter. For example, during shark week last year, rather than focusing on celebrating and admiring these wonderful animals, the channel decided to help perpetuate the idea that sharks are savage, cold-blooded killers.
They recycled an old (fake) story about a Megalodon (a giant, prehistoric shark that is now extinct) and convinced people that a 35-foot shark with an “insatiable appetite for human blood” had been terrorizing a coast off South Africa. Despite the fact that they included a small disclaimer, and the program also featured actors and doctored footage, many became convinced that this extinct animal still exists, something that has been frustratingly difficult to rectify.
Another stunt that received a bit of a slamming, to say the least, was their recent special Eaten Alive, which promised to show viewers naturist Paul Rosolie being gobbled up by an anaconda. Why, you ask? Well, apparently, Rosolie wanted to draw attention to deforestation that is threatening the snakes he cares so deeply about. A bit of a weird way to get the message across, though. And of course, understandably, Rosolie decided to bail out of this ridiculous stunt, which ticked a few people off.
When Ross was asked for his opinion about the documentary, he said: “It was the right intention with a packaging that was misleading. You don't have to be so sensational. In his mind he thought [being eaten by the snake] was actually possible. But the fever of that story got out of control.” Much to our relief, he then added: “I don't believe you'll be seeing a person being eaten by a snake in my time [at the channel].”

The Australian dollar rose 2 per cent on Thursday. National Australia Bank chief economist Alan Oster said the RBA may resort to talking the dollar down if it crept towards the US73¢ or US74¢ mark. But signs that the recent market "kerfuffles" had adversely affected the non-mining economy would be needed for them to consider a cut, he said. "To the extent that the Australian dollar goes higher, that's a negative to the non-mining economy, but it is still helpful having a currency at US71.70¢," he said. On Thursday afternoon the dollar was buying US71.82¢. The currency surged more than 2 per cent on Thursday to US71.88¢, its highest point in a month after the US dollar posted its worst day in seven years on weak services sector data and a speech by US Federal Reserve president William Dudley in which he said the Fed outlook could change on tightening market conditions. The latest hit to the US economic recovery was the Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index registering at 53.5, its lowest reading since February 2014.
"The volatility in the financial markets, decline in commodity prices and weakness in parts of the US economy is beginning to shake the Fed's confidence," BK Asset Management managing director of FX Kathy Lien said. The New Zealand dollar also surged against the greenback, up as much as 2.8 per cent after its unemployment rate fell to 5.3 per cent in December, its lowest level since 2009. FED rate rises in doubt Disappointing economic data from the world's biggest economy and the fallout from the prolonged oil price rout has stoked doubts that the US Federal Reserve can lift interest rates at all this year, let alone the four hikes it suggested when it began its rate rise cycle in December. Not that the RBA will be rushing to hit the button on rate cuts on a dollar rally against the greenback. Local economic indicators, including the labour market, which has shown recent strength, and core inflation numbers, are key to the mix.
St George Bank senior economist Janu Chan said the Australian dollar's rally on Thursday was a story about a weaker US dollar, and on a trade-weighted basis, the moves were more modest, an indicator the RBA watched more closely. "It is a moving target for the RBA, it is more concerned in relation to where [the dollar] is with commodity prices," she said. Mr Blythe said the bank expected rates to remain on hold at 2 per cent this year, but it had also slated three hikes in the US, a number the market believes is increasingly unlikely. Bond futures traders see just a 47 per cent chance the Fed will lift rates before December, down from 93 per cent at the end of last year, according to Bloomberg. Also in the mix is the threat of a currency war, sparked by the Bank of Japan's move last week to impose negative interest rates on bank deposits in a bid to keep the yen from appreciating too highly.
"The AUD/USD is being dragged reluctantly into the global FX crossfire," Su-Lin Ong, chief economist at RBC Capital Markets said. "A weaker USD amid a repricing of Fed expectations coupled with a desire from the authorities for a weaker yuan and yen is pushing the TWI [trade weighted index] in the wrong direction," she said, noting the US dollar, yuan and yen accounted for half of the Australian dollar's TWI. BNP Paribas greater China senior economist Chi Lo said the currency war could intensify this time around due to China's entry into the mix, with the People's Bank of China (PBoC) keen to move the currency's focus towards a trade-weighting basis rather than a US dollar peg. "If the renminbi does weaken against the US dollar further, courtesy of a weakening Japanese yen, Asian currencies will be dragged down further," he said. That the markets have little clue as to the policy goals of the PBoC adds to the murkiness and volatility in both Chinese and global markets, he warned.
To say I have mixed feelings about Apple is putting it mildly. On the positive side, I love most Apple products — the MacBook Air is my go-to laptop, I think the iPhone 6 is the best all-around smartphone on the market, and I'm seriously pumped about the prospects of the new Apple TV. Apple also has a well-earned reputation for customer care that is part of why it enjoys such strong loyalty among its customer base.
But unfortunately, Apple isn't just about making great products and having terrific customer service — it's also about feeding us gigantic piles of bullshit that it expects us to swallow without question.

iPhone 6s: The 9 best new features
The 5 worst things about the iPhone 6s
6 ways the new iPhone 6s is better than the iPhone 6
What really drove this home for me yesterday was the ridiculous way that Apple went about describing its new Apple Pencil, the stylus it's designed for the new iPad Pro tablet. Even if we leave aside the fact that Steve Jobs infamously trashed styluses on two different occasions, the hyperbole that Apple used to describe the $99 pen was practically Samsung-esque. Phil Schiller called Apple Pencil “one of the most advanced technologies we've created,” while Jony Ive narrated a silly two-minute video dedicated entirely to explaining why the Apple Pencil was the most magical stylus the world has ever seen:
Let's be honest: If Samsung had dedicated an entire two-minute video, complete with drippy New Age synth music, to explaining the game-changing features of the Galaxy Note 5's stylus, the world would still be laughing at them. And that's especially true if Samsung decided to sell the Note 5's stylus as a separate accessory that cost 99 freaking dollars.
And speaking of $99 styluses, is there any other company that does so many ticky-tack things designed to extract more money from its loyal fans than Apple? It's well within Apple's means to offer a 32GB iPhone 6s as the entry-level option but the company figures it will offer a mere 16GB entry-level model to push fans to pay an extra $100 for the 64GB version. This is despite the fact that Samsung and other major smartphone rivals stopped selling 16GB smartphones generations ago.
And you know that cool new Apple TV remote control that also doubles as a Wii-style game controller? Well if you want a Wii-style loop that you can attach to the controller and wrap around your wrist to prevent it from flying into the TV, you'll have to pay extra. And remember when Apple switched from a 30-pin dock connector to a 9-pin dock connector and it didn't include any adapters with new iPhones but instead sold them separately for $29 a pop?
Oh, and who can forget last year's iPad mini 3, which had the exact same specs as the iPad mini 2 and was different from thee earlier model only because Apple gave it Touch ID functionality?
This has turned into a much more negative rant against Apple than I had originally intended. As I said earlier, I love many of the company's products and I think they are worth the money Apple charges for them. However, I also feel that the company's reality distortion field often blinds people to the fact that it is often embarrassingly full of shit.
I have to admit I was slightly apprehensive in the days leading up to the Women's Olympic 7s Tournament as to how it would be received by the global audience that would be undoubtedly tuning in to watch.
My main concern came from how alien the sport of 7s must seem to those totally unfamiliar with rugby. The sport's infamously huge number of laws and odd terminology might put people off from putting in the effort to keep up with the gruelling schedule that is a natural part of a 7s tournament.
My second concern came from the lack of coverage that Women's Rugby gets during the regular season, in that people wouldn't be tuning in to see their country's star of the World Series play simply because they would have no idea who they are.
I'm very happy to say that after just three days of competition my first concern turned out to be a non-issue and my second won't be a concern any longer. The reaction to 7s from the greater Olympic audience has been absolutely fantastic, with many people tuning in due to curiosity and staying because they were hooked.
As for big names and stars, this tournament has created plenty. Players like Jennifer Kish, Charlotte Caslick and Portia Woodman are bound to have inspired young girls all around the world to pick up a rugby ball and get playing and countless more men and women will want to follow the heroines of the Olympics on their next World Series.
Of course, none of this would have been possible if the rugby on display wasn't thrilling and entertaining, which it was. Whether it was from the slick passing of Australia or the hard-hitting kiwis, down to the passionate and plucky performances from underdogs like Spain and Brazil there was something in every match to enjoy. Unfortunately, the skill gap between the top and bottom ranked teams was all too noticeable, Colombia and Kenya looked notably out of their depth and regularly gave up 40-50 points per match. Some people complained that it went a little bit too much to script, with Australia, New Zealand and Canada all placing on the podium, but how many people complain when Usain Bolt wins the 100m? Upsets are fun, and underdog stories can be lovely, but what most people want to see is the best athletes in the world competing to the best of their ability and that's what we got.
As for the future of Women's Rugby, I think this tournament will have done wonders for it. As I mentioned earlier the positive reaction from those watching for the first time is very encouraging, there's a whole new group of people ready to watch more Women's 7s and possibly even Women's 15s.
However, progress isn't going to happen purely through brand-new fans and breaking a few more star players. World Rugby and Unions around the globe really need to take advantage of this situation and promote the sport better than they have in the past. One of the things I think helped, this time, was having the Men's and Women's competitions on at different times, meaning spectators can watch both without having to choose. In the 6 Nations, some Women's games are broadcast at the same time as the Men's which means the audience is forced to make as to which one to watch, which cuts the potential audience drastically. The key is in promoting Women's rugby as more rugby instead of alternate rugby.
That all being said, these past few days can be described as nothing less than a triumph. I'm looking forward to Tokyo 2020 already.

Westminster has been hit by allegations of sexual harassment and abuse
Theresa May is urging anyone with information to come forward over "deeply concerning" claims of sexual harassment in Westminster.
Downing Street said the Prime Minister will take allegations "extremely seriously", following reports Cabinet ministers have been named among a list of politicians accused of inappropriate behaviour and abuse.
According to The Sun, a WhatsApp group of female employees at Westminster is used to warn members about MPs and other senior figures from across the political parties.
It follows allegations made about movie mogul Harvey Weinstein by a number of women working in Hollywood.
:: Analysis: Is Westminster harbouring the next harassment scandal?

A Number 10 spokeswoman said: "Any reports of sexual harassment are deeply concerning.
"The Prime Minister was very clear when we responded to the reports about Harvey Weinstein in the last few weeks that any unwanted sexual behaviour is completely unacceptable, and that is true in any walk of life - including politics.
"Any allegations that may come to light will be taken extremely seriously and we would advise people to contact the police if there is such an allegation so that it's fully investigated."
The Prime Minister was said to be unaware of any allegations having been formally reported.
Asked if claims about a minister would lead to their sacking by Mrs May, the spokeswoman added: "She would take it extremely seriously and serious action would be taken where it's necessary."
Downing Street also advised allegations that may not warrant a police investigation could be made to House of Commons officials or party authorities.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn welcomed the Prime Minister's comments, telling LBC Radio: "There has to be a proper system of people, women in particular, being able to report if they've been abused in any way and have it dealt with in a timely and proper manner.
"Our party, the Labour Party, has a process of doing that both for employees of party officials, MPs and councillors, but also for party members who feel they've been abused in any way."
The reported WhatsApp group, said to include female researchers, secretaries and aides, is claimed to include warnings such as "very handsy", "not safe in taxis" and "groped my a*** at a drinks party".
I will be naming a Labour MP who behaved appalling towards a young woman to the chief whip and leader Why was her complaint ignored before? — John Mann (@JohnMannMP) October 19, 2017
At the weekend, John Mann revealed he had named one of his fellow Labour MPs to Jeremy Corbyn and the party's chief whip.
In apparently separate claims to those from the reported WhatsApp group, Mr Mann alleged the MP had "behaved appallingly towards a young woman".
Posting on Twitter, he said: "This case and a non-Labour one I have raised demonstrate a shocking lack of any system for dealing with this in Westminster."

The Harvey Weinstein scandal prompted a #MeToo campaign on social media, in which women spoke out about their own experiences of sexual harassment.
Parliamentary officials said there is a free and confidential 24/7 helpline provided by the House of Commons for all MPs' staff.
A House of Commons spokesperson said: "The House of Commons takes the welfare of everyone who works in Parliament very seriously.
"The House is limited in its ability to intervene in employment matters, such as allegations of bullying or harassment by MPs of their staff as MPs are self-employed and employ their staff directly."
The number of overdose deaths from illegal drugs has nearly doubled this year in B.C.
The B.C. Coroners Service released a new tally Thursday of the number of illicit drug overdose fatalities.
So far this year, 1,103 people have died from an overdose, up from 607 at this time in 2016. None of the fatalities happened at a safe injection site.
B.C.'s Minister of Mental Health Judy Darcy called the numbers “staggering.”
The coroner says there were 80 suspected drugs overdose deaths this September, a 31 per cent increase from the same month last year.
Of the total number of overdose deaths, fentanyl was detected in 83 per cent, representing an increase of 147 per cent over the same period in 2016.
The coroner said that in most cases fentanyl was combined with other drugs, most often cocaine, heroin or methamphetamines.
Carfentanil has been detected in 37 suspected illicit drug overdose deaths between June and September of 2017.
“It really is devastating, we are still seeing an average of four people dying a day in British Columbia, and this trend is worsening,” said Darcy, speaking in Victoria after the numbers were released.
She said the government will make an announcement Friday to outline its plan to respond to the crisis.
She agreed there needs to be a dialogue in Canada looking at new ways to deal with the soaring number of fatalities.
Darcy said the government is looking into whether testing street drugs for the presence of fentanyl and carfentanil is an option.
“We are working on a whole lot of issues including drug checking. We are also ramping up, as all health authorities are, our major anti-stigma campaign,” she said.
Authorities last year declared a public health emergency, and the government has taken some steps. In the spring, the province opened 500 new substance-abuse treatment beds, including 131 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region.
But despite the efforts, fatalities continue to spike, and with each surge authorities again warn that most street drugs — everything from cocaine to ecstasy — are laced with fentanyl and/or carfentanil.
The Abbotsford police put out a warning last month after five people died in under 10 hours. All of the victims were found alone, and most were inside a residence.
Vancouver Coastal Health has the highest rate of illicit drug overdose deaths, and also experienced the largest increase in fatalities at 59 per cent over last year, according to the coroner.
The coroner said nine out of every 10 deaths occurred indoors, including more than half in private residences.

White House Chief of staff Denis McDonough promised Latino lawmakers Thursday that President Obama will take unilateral action on immigration reform by the end of the year, according to the Associated Press.
In a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill with Congressional Hispanic Caucus members, according to the AP, McDonough reportedly heard lawmakers concerns about the recent delay and said that regardless of the outcome of the November elections, Obama would act.
The renewed commitment comes on the heels of a decision from the White House to delay taking executive actions on immigration amid concerns that the political fallout could be detrimental to Democratic candidates facing tough elections.
“We told him we were mad, we thought for sure he was going to act because he said he would, we're very upset about that,” Rep. Juan Vargas, D-Calif, said according to the AP report. “At the same time we got the promise that he's going to act as generously as he possibly can before the end of the holiday season.”
McDonough left the meeting telling reporters that the president will act before the end of the year.
“It was good to catch up with the caucus and underscore to them our continuing commitment to resolve the challenges with our broken immigration system and underscore to them that the president will act on this before the end of the year” he said.
According to the report, Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) pressed the White House to elaborate on how far Obama would go and that McDonough said it is as far as legally possible.
Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ) said that the action will be one “of significant scope.”
History links You are in: Berkshire > History > History links > UK's oldest Roman Coin found in Thatcham UK's oldest Roman Coin found in Thatcham Imagine finding a 2,000 year old Roman coin near the ancient path of the Ridgeway that had slipped from the fingers of a Celt in 207BC. Thatcham metal detectorist Malcolm Langford has discovered the UK's oldest Roman coin. The UK's oldest Roman coin. Driven by his love of history, retired electrician Malcolm Langford has been metal detecting for seven years, always with the permission of the relevant landowner. Treasure Treasure Trove was originally defined as gold or silver in any form, whether coin, plate or bullion which had been hidden and rediscovered, and which no person could prove he or she owned. The Treasure Trove law was replaced by the Treasure Act in 1996. If you find treasure there is a legal obligation to report it. The British Museum decides if a found item falls under the treasure act, and then the local coroner holds an inquest to decide who is the legal finder of the treasure. If the museum decides to buy the treasure, it must pay the finder its full value. However, most metal detectors agree to split any money from treasure found 50/50 with the landowner where the treasure was found. He has found everything from stone age artefacts to Roman coins, and enjoys taking his finds to schools to pass on his passion for the past. But his latest find, the UK's oldest Roman coin, has amazed archeologists. Malcolm told BBC Berkshire's Henry Kelly: "It was in a pasture field, near the ancient Ridgeway and it was probably six to eight inches into the ground. "I dug it up and I could see it was a Republican denarius because there was a Roman head on it. The Ridgeway "It came out of the ground all brown, and I used a bit of spit and a bit of sheep's wool to clean it and it came up silver." Malcolm said he discovered the age of the coin when he took it, along with another Iron Age silver coin of Eppillus to the West Berkshire and Oxfordshire Finds Liaison Officer, Anni Byard, so she could record them. Anni immediately confirmed the Iron Age coin was only one of 11 that have been recorded in the UK and suspected the Roman coin, a Republican silver denarius, was quite rare. She said: "I almost fell of my chair when I found out what date it was, it's in almost mint condition, which shows it was here much earlier than other Roman coins. "Historically it's a wonderful find and I think Malcolm should be very proud. Malcolm Langford, Henry and Anni Byard. "This coin is very important. It means that these Republican denarii were around in Britain before the Claudian invasion in AD 43 and possibly even before Caesar. "At that time there was a lot of trade going on. It could have been a Celtic trader or a mercenary back from the wars." "A find like this could update all of our history books." The silver denarius depicts the helmeted head of Roma on the obverse and the galloping Dioscuri on the reverse. The coin was struck in Rome during the Republican period, just two years before the Roman general Scipio defeated Hannibal near Carthage. Republican silver denarii are often found in Britain, and although the coins began to be struck in Rome in 211 BC, this new coin appears to be the earliest denarius recorded from Britain, earlier than any of the 600 similar coins which have been recorded.

ON FEBRUARY 2nd, Pope Francis appointed Archbishop Angelo Becciu as his special delegate to the Order of the Knights of Malta, an exclusive, centuries-old Roman Catholic fellowship. He told him to collaborate with the Order's acting head for the “reconciliation between all its members” and to work for it “spiritual and moral renewal”. The letter in which he gave these instructions completed a virtual takeover of the Order that began on January 24th when the pope forced the resignation of the order's grand master, a 67 year-old Briton, Matthew Festing. What is going on?
Popes have occasionally sent representatives in to crack the whip over monastic orders suspected of veering from the doctrinal straight-and-narrow. But the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which defended pilgrims to the Holy Land during the Crusades, is an order of chivalry. And a singular one. Like countries, the Order has sovereignty (its knights having previously ruled Malta). Yet it no longer has territory beyond its headquarters on the fashionable Via Condotti in Rome. From there it dispatches ambassadors and issues stamps, coins and even its own licence plates. The only similar, sovereign entity with little or no territory is the Holy See. So Francis's putsch is akin to the annexation of one state by another.

The Order today is an international body with around 13,500 knights and dames. It organises humanitarian initiatives in many parts of the world. But its leadership is formed of the rich and noble. A clash with Pope Francis, a champion of the poor and an adversary of privilege, was perhaps inevitable at some point. The showdown was triggered on December 6th when Mr Festing dismissed his grand chancellor, Albrecht Freiherr von Boeselager, after he refused to step down over claims, which Mr Boeselager denies, that he allowed the distribution of condoms in Myanmar. The Vatican appointed a commission of inquiry. The Order responded with a statement that, to protect its sovereignty, “it should not co-operate”. Two weeks later, the pope summoned Mr Festing to demand his resignation. Shortly afterwards the Order's governing council agreed to its grand master's removal and the appointment of an interim leader. Mr Boeselager has since been reinstated.
The affair has left some Catholics wondering if the pope is less stringent about artificial contraception than the Catholic catechism, which teaches that its use is sinful. But there have been suggestions that the affair is about more than birth control. There have been claims of freemasonic infiltration and a power struggle within the Order between Germans and Italians. A London-based Catholic weekly, the Tablet, reported that the former grand master had objected to the Vatican commission because of links between three of its members and an unidentified “Geneva fund”. What is more certain is that this opaque affair has become the latest stage in a continuing trial of strength between Pope Francis and his traditionalist critics. Even before the appointment of Archbishop Becciu, the Vatican had the power to appoint a representative inside the Order. Raymond Burke, an arch-traditionalist and critic of the pope, is regarded as having been made its cardinal patron—in order to keep him on the sidelines. Then by making Archbishop Becciu his “exclusive spokesperson in all matters relating to relations between the Apostolic See and the order,” the pope has not just sidelined, but humiliated, one of his most outspoken adversaries.
REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov dismissed criticism over reports that Moscow sent advanced antiship cruise missiles to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
"I do not understand why the media is trying to create a sensation out of this," Lavrov said during a press conference with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. "We have not hidden that we supply weapons to Syria under signed contracts, without violating any international agreements, or our own legislation."
The New York Times reports that Syria sent a shipment of upgraded Yakhonts anti-ship missiles, which Michael Gordon and Eric Schmitt describe as "a formidable weapon to counter any effort by international forces to reinforce Syrian opposition fighters by imposing a naval embargo, establishing a no-fly zone or carrying out limited airstrikes."
"It's a real ship killer," which Nick Brown, editor-in-chief of IHS Jane's International Defense Review, told The Times.
Russia says it's business as usual.
"We are first and foremost supplying defense weapons related to air defense," he said. "This does not in any way alter the balance of forces in this region or give any advantage in the fight against the opposition."
That last claim is certainly debatable, based on the assessment by the Times.
Nevertheless, Russia's latest moves, including sending their Pacific Fleet to the region for the first time since the Cold War, reinforce Moscow's support for Assad.

A weary few days and some miracle-working by North Jr and friends has got us back online (with the forum and other tweaks to follow when we can), after a series of massive DDOS attacks. So focussed and relentless were the attacks that we conclude that they were directed specifically at EUReferendum, with a view to taking us out of circulation.

The newspaper is asserting that the way to "take the legs from under Farage" is for the prime minister to campaign for an "out" vote. That is an obvious line to take except that it suffers the obvious flaw. Those unwilling to believe Mr Cameron's promise for a referendum are just as likely to disbelieve any commitment to fight against EU membership.
What might deal a death blow to Farage's ambitions, however, is the double whammy of explaining to the voting public that his party has no idea of how to manage our departure from the EU (and no capability in that respect) while simultaneously demonstrating that a workable plan does exist and can be implemented quickly and easily, to the very great advantage of the UK.
This, in my view, is what is needed to transform the debate. Having long accepted the need to leave the EU – for any number of reasons – I no longer wish to endure the tedium of the continuous tales of woe on how badly we are treated by the Barons of Brussels.
Rather, I am in the market for some "sunlit uplands", the very thing Mr Farage and his dysfunctional acolytes have no means of bringing us. His shambolic party is set to deliver the only thing of which Ukip is capable - its own brand of discordant negativity. It will never achieve anything but chaos and disruption.
In order to defeat Ukip, what the Conservatives need to realise is you don't fight a negative with a negative. The only thing that cancels out a negative is a positive. All Farage's party can do is tell us how bad it is inside the EU. The Conservatives need to tell us how good it is on the outside.
That, in fact, is quite difficult to do. Any fool can tell us that we need to leave – very few people can come of with a credible, structured plan for making it happen. And as this is a task quite beyond the capabilities of Ukip, and neither Labour nor the Lib-Dems have any intentions of filling the void, this leaves the field wide open to the Conservatives.
This is why the next few dys and weeks are going to be increasingly interesting. Gradually, there is a realisation emerging that the need to get out of the EU is only a tiny part of the equation - the easy bit that even the febrile minds of Ukip supporters can grasp. It is how we get out that matters more. Unless a safe exit can be assured, it is never going to happen.
Once it is evident that the feat can be done, though, it is much more likely that it will then happen. Thus, the realisation that we need an exit plan may be one of the most enduring effects of this period. Knowledgeable commentators will then see the pressure to withdraw as a child of the time. Others will try to link unrelated events, and argue cause and effect.
What we are seeing, though, are effects with common causes. Some have taken the cul-de-sac towards Ukip while the more enlightened are looking for the way to the sunlit uplands. The reasons for those actions are deep-rooted and do not lie in recent events. But the outcome is not to be denied – it was going to happen sooner of later. And even if later, that is better than not at all.

But the outcome is not to be denied – it was going to happen sooner of later. And even if later, that is better than not at all.
In life it's funny what ends up making a lasting impression on you. An offhand comment can stick with you for years and years, and have an effect way beyond anything the original person intended.
There's a phrase like that that pops up in my mind often when I'm thinking about BJJ. But it originated in a very different place.
In fact this comment got stuck in my brain more than 20 years ago when I was taking a biochemistry class at McGill University of all places… The material we were covering was pretty technical stuff: metabolic cycles, enzymatic pathways, DNA repair mechanisms (i.e. standard, everyday water-cooler discussion topics).
The lecturer – Dr. Nishioka – was very precise and proper, and spoke with a heavy Japanese accent.
The exact details aren't important, but at one point he was describing the mechanisms cells use to recover from damage inflicted to their DNA by chemicals or radiation. For the sake of this discussion it's enough to know that if DNA gets smashed up then there often is a way to put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
One of the key points of the lecture was that these repair mechanisms aren't perfect. Sometimes mistakes get made and things don't get put back together exactly the right way. This can lead to all sorts of interesting side-effects, most of which are bad for the cell in question.
But, Dr Nishioka reminded us, poorly repaired DNA was the lesser of two evils. The other alternative was being dead.
Or, as he put it so philosophically in his broken English, “Having something… is better… than having nothing.”
And that gets us to the crux of what I want to talk about today…
Having something is better than having nothing.
People often make the mistake of all-or-nothing thinking in their training. They want to do things the right way, but if they can't do things perfectly then sometimes they decide not to do things at all…
People might have great plans of how they're going to train 5 days a week. Or they want to eat healthy, starting every day with kale smoothies and finishing it with a giant multicolour salad. Or they map out the perfect fitness program including cardio, strength-building, flexibility and recovery components.
But no plan of action survives contact with the enemy. Real life has a way of making a hash of all your best intentions. Or as the old proverb so succinctly states, “Man makes plans and God laughs.”
So nothing is ever going to go exactly according to plan. And this can be very frustrating.
So frustrating in fact that some people just say, “Screw it, I'm not going to do anything then until I can do it perfectly.” But this is a HUGE mistake.
Let's say you were planning to train really hard for a competition, but early in your training camp you badly hurt your shoulder (again). That sucks, but don't go and sulk. Maybe you can't train as hard or as often as you were planning. Maybe you can't even compete this time. But you can still do some controlled one-handed drilling, study an aspect of the game that you need to work on, start running stair sprints, or do something else to get at least a little bit better.
Having something is better than having nothing.
Maybe you've gotten really, really busy at work. Perhaps you're working on some giant project that requires 12 hour days, including weekends, for several months. And this insane work schedule has completely nuked your training regimen. Then, just to make things worse, the one time that you did make it to class (late) your timing was way off, your conditioning was non-existent, and you got murdered by the training partners that you used to be able to hang with.
This is pretty discouraging, and I would understand if you wanted to throw in the towel for a while.
But BJJ is a marathon, not a sprint, and you can't go full speed all the time anyway. So hang in there, go once a week if that's all you can manage, and just do a little bit – it'll pay off, I promise. Training once a week is a hundred times better than training zero times a week; it'll keep your head in the game and make things SO much easier when you finally get back to regular training.
Having something is better than having nothing.
Maybe you used to go to the gym 3 times a week, and really enjoyed the feeling of being fit and strong. But now you've got a newborn child in the house, plus her two year old brother suddenly became über-needy and needs even more of your attention all the time. You love your kids and want to do the right thing, but dammit, you also miss your two hour workouts.
At this point being a gym rat may no longer be in the cards for a few years, but maybe you can still load a kid in a baby-jogger a couple times a week and prevent your cardio from absolutely going in the toilet (here is the quick default cardio workout I used when my own kids were young) .
Doing even a little bit of fitness activity is much, much better than doing zero fitness.
Or, as Dr. Nishioka would say, having something is better than having nothing.

COLMA, Calif. — While the Super Bowl will be played at Levi's Stadium, and thousands of news media members who descended on the Bay Area this week were based at the Moscone Center, Levi Strauss lay inside a marble crypt in one of this tiny town's 17 cemeteries, and George Moscone lay under the grass in another.
In a broad valley devoted largely to the dead, the history museum in Colma — nicknamed the City of Souls — sells T-shirts that read, “It's Great to Be Alive in Colma!”
It is a town of 1,600 living residents and about 1.5 million dead ones — many of whom, like the 49ers, uprooted and left San Francisco for greener pastures to the south.
The road to Sunday's Super Bowl stretches about 50 miles, from San Francisco, the epicenter of festivities this week, to Santa Clara, site of the actual game. The corridor, mostly along Highway 101, is a time capsule of the Bay Area's history and its quirks — and a modern-day testament to its traffic problems.
Dear President-elect Trump,
I know there is a lot on your plate over the next couple months, but I wanted to bring your attention to a pressing issue that might not make it to the top of your radar during your transition: Africa. Some would argue that Africa shouldn't be at the top of your list when it comes to priorities, but I beg to differ. If you are committed to taking on China and averting their ability to “eat our lunch,” then we should be concerned with their dominance in Africa and the impact they may have on our future hegemonic power.
During the month of November, I had the great privilege of visiting a couple of countries in Southern Africa. That trip opened my eyes to the impact that China is having on the continent. Chinese foreign direct investment in Africa has skyrocketed from $7 billion in 2008 to $26 billion in 2013, according to figures cited by the Wharton Africa Business Forum. But to be honest, those numbers don't tell the entire story. I found a dominance of Chinese expats, Chinese-run businesses, and sky-scraping Chinese hotels littering the skyline of every major city I visited.
Africa presents a huge business opportunity to China's ballooning populations. Not only does the continent provide an abundance of resources necessary for the Chinese economy to grow, but they also provide China with something else stronger than money: global influence. Investing in Africa—a continent ravished by colonialism, civil war, and poverty—gives China the ability to gain new allies and assert power on a continent that has all but been neglected by the developed world.
The only thing that stands in the way of Chinese dominance in Africa is the United States and the work that we have done through the President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). In 2004, President Bush created PEPFAR with the goal of addressing the global HIV/AIDS epidemic, improving health outcomes, and helping to save the lives of those suffering from the disease in resource-limited countries. Renewed by President Obama in 2008, PEPFAR has increased the number of Africans receiving treatment and other resources from 50,000 in 2004 to more than 56.7 million in 2014. In many cases, PEPFAR benefits have enriched economic outcomes, and coupled with other USAID and UN programs, have led to greater economic stability in the continent.
What makes this initiative so successful is its ability to create sustainable country programs for tackling the AIDS epidemic, rather than just depending on previous emergency response programs. PEPFAR has allowed the US to aid its partnering countries in developing country-owned and country-driven initiatives, creating a collective impact at the country level while also increasing collaboration amongst multilateral organizations.
Since its creation, PEPFAR has directly supported life-saving treatments for millions of men, women, and children, including HIV testing and counseling for more than 11 million pregnant women in 2012 alone. The program's work has also provided care for approximately 750,000 pregnant, HIV-positive women, resulting in the birth of over 250,000 HIV-free infants.
PEPFAR's success is dependent on the efficiency of collaboration with its partnering organizations as the program expands its impact and improves its methods. These partnerships include a variety of governmental agencies such as the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as the Departments of Labor and Commerce.
Now don't get me wrong, there is still a lot more work to be done to stabilize many of the poverty stricken countries in Africa, but PEPFAR and the hardworking American diplomats and aid workers implementing it have had an enormous impact on the lives of South Africans and Mozambicans (two of the nation's visited on my tour of Southern Africa), as well as Africans throughout the continent.
When asked about PEPFAR, you stated, “Yes, I believe so strongly in that, and we're going to the lead the way.” And now I am asking for you not to waver in your commitment. If PEPFAR is eliminated the people of Africa will suffer beyond belief. And beyond that, we will hand over our influence in Africa to the Chinese, a move that we as a nation might never recover from.
If we want to compete with China, then we must take them on in every way possible. That means we must compete with them by increasing our aid and foreign direct investment in Africa. By bolstering our influence in Africa, we would counterbalance much of the influence currently being peddled by the Chinese.
Mr. Trump, China is hurting our workers, our jobs, and our economic future. As you work to reign them in, I urge you to see our work in Africa as part of that strategy. By increasing aid to Africa, we can curtail the Chinese, significantly benefit the health of the global community, and fulfill our ethical obligation to help those in need in the international community.

Battletoads
These things were annoying, but not impossible
I never stopped to wonder why there was a Kangaroo riding a
rocket, trying to drop blocks on a toad riding a hoverbike
So close, yet so far away!
little
So the polls are closed and you guys voted for me to try Battletoads for the NES. I had heard of Battletoads before starting this, especially how the difficulty made kids throw controllers and yell at the TV in rage. It was released in June of 1991, and I was born in December, so it barely manages to be older than me. Now before I start, I would like to say thank you guys for all your feedback and support, but seriously why would you want me to go through this kind of torture? I thought Contra was hard, and now I spend around 10 hours on this game and only managed to get halfway through before finally giving up. And then I see this runthrough and I just want to cry.While reading the manual, I was glad to find that the developers had a good sense of humor, naming their characters Zitz, Pimple and Rash. I'm not sure how provocative the games usually were when I was born, but I have a feeling the Dark Queen was a little risque for her time. So the Dark Queen has kidnapped Pimple and his girl-toad, and it's up to Rash and Zitz to save them.After the first level, I thought that people must have been over-exaggerating the difficulty of this game; I didn't die once and had a fairly easy time blowing through the enemies. The "Wookie Tunnel" wasn't anything overly difficult either, so I was beginning to have my doubts. And then all my doubts were shoved back in my face, I was thrown to the ground, and then repeatedly kicked while I was down (figuratively speaking). The "Turbo Tunnel" was extremely difficult for me; if I hadn't found the warp in the first level, I would have given up there. Because I could warp there from the beginning of the game, I spent the next two hours just trying to get past this tunnel. I never actually fully beat the level, and instead accidentally ran into the warp and couldn't believe it. I jumped up and down yelling and cheering with such enthusiasm that my family came to check on me (they thought that I had won a lot of money or something like that). I honestly couldn't remember a time when I had been so happy that I had cleared a level. Clearing the first level on Contra was gratifying, but did not come close to how I felt at this time.The next level was slightly easier for me, only because the 1UPs allowed me to not have to start the game over again. The mini-boss at the end seemed way to easy after the torture I had just been put through, but nevertheless I was on to the Snake Pit. This is where I started raging uncontrollably and literally almost broke something. I do not understand why the developers thought the 2nd and particularly the 3rd part of the Snake Pit would be a good idea, unless their goal was to make people hate them with a passion. Those of you who have played this, you know what how I felt when I over-jumped the Exit and landed on the spikes... When I finally ran out of continues the 3rd time through, I couldn't convince myself to go any further. And thus ended my futile attempt at beating the infamous Battletoads.This game was really fun if you weren't concerned with dying, having to start over or generally progressing through the game. The fighting mechanics were very nice and the animations were very funny (who doesn't want to see a toad slam a kangaroo into the ground and kick it repeatedly in the face?). The humor in the game was entertaining when I wasn't too busy yelling at the game or the controls. It was also nice how each stage presented something unique and interesting (yet ridiculously hard) about it, be it climbing and jumping on snakes to "surfing" your way around whirlpools.How unnecessarily difficult this game is. I played halfway through the game and already was ready to break some controllers, and it only gets harder from there. It would have helped tremendously if there had been a save system that allowed you to not have to start the whole game over, but I have heard that saving systems were never heard of in NES games.Now many of you have read my Contra post and know that I have gained an appreciation for harder games, but this was alot over the top for me. The gameplay was really enjoyable and the humor was subtle but still funny, but the hatred I had for the developers when I stopped playing was too great for me to continue to appreciate these parts of the game. Many of the later parts rely on memorization (and luck), but when you have to play through the whole game to practice these later levels, it becomes extremely frustrating.I genuinely enjoyed this game and would recommend people play it, but I would definitely warn them to not take it too seriously and not to expect to beat it or else controllers will be thrown and things will be broken.**Edit: This game has some of the coolest pause music I've ever heard **

Just like “snow birds” — residents who fly south for the winter and return in the spring — a piece of aviation history has returned to its home in Port Clinton.
The “City of Port Clinton” 5-AT-B Ford Tri-Motor airplane returned to its hangar at Liberty Aviation Museum at 3515 E. State Road in Portage Township on Monday. Historically known as the “City of Wichita,” the plane spent the harsh winter down in sunny Florida, giving visitors to local air museums and airports a chance to ride on a working “Tin Goose.”
The plane returns to Ohio where it made aviation history, now educating people from around the country and the world about aviation's Golden Age.
In 1925, Henry Ford, of the Ford Co., bought the Stout Metal Airplane Co., with the hopes of creating America's first mass-produced airliners. The three-engined planes were all metal, and like Ford cars and tractors, they were well-designed, relatively inexpensive and reliable for the era.
In the late 1920s, Transcontinental Air Transport — which later become TWA — bought 10 Ford Tri-Motors, aiming to create the first transcontinental air and rail service. Regional airports with concrete runways and passenger terminals had popped up across the country, and Ford sold the three-engined planes to the company. The “City of Wichita” was one of the 10 planes, and it is the only one still surviving.
On July 8, 1929, famed aviator Amelia Earhart and twenty others boarded two Ford Tri-Motors (one being “Wichita”) and began the first leg of the cross-country air journey from Columbus to Glendale, California.
Traveling by rail at night and by Tri-Motor at day, it took passengers just 48 hours to journey from coast-to-coast, an incredible feat for a mode of transportation created by Dayton's own Wright brothers less than 30 years earlier.
As aviation technology and demands increased, the plane was passed among several owners and spent time in Central America and Mexico, where aviation travel was coming to fruition. Boeing and Douglas airlines began building their own aircraft, doubling the capacity and the luxury for passengers and crew.
In 1933, Ford ceased its production of the planes and focused on automobiles again. After World War II, regional airports began buying the slightly aged but still sturdy Ford Tri-Motors. Island Airlines in Port Clinton became home to several of the 199 original Tri-Motors.
In the 1950s and '60s, Island Airlines Tri-Motor planes hauled cargo, farm animals, groceries, fish, wine, passengers and schoolchildren for the people of the Lake Erie Islands. The planes also served as ambulances and hearses.
The “City of Wichita” was damaged while in Mexico in the 1950s and sat for 10 years before being bought by Harrah's Casino of Las Vegas in 1964. The company invested more than $650,000 into it, using it for high-rollers at casinos before selling it again.
Last summer, it was purchased for $1.5 million from the Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon, where it had been overshadowed by the museum's “Spruce Goose.” After not being flown for several years, three new engines were rebuilt and the propellers were rebalanced before arriving at its new home at the Liberty Aviation Museum.
Jeff Sondles, operations director for the museum, said the purchase was the culmination of years of hard work to acquire a flyable model.
“It's just a great piece of aviation history,” Sondles said Tuesday. “So many people around here remember these planes as the ones they flew in first.”
“We have grandparents bring their grandchildren to show them what they flew in to the islands. It's just great,” he said.
Working with the Experimental Aircraft Association Chapter 1247, the museum will be using the 1929 Ford Tri-Motor to promote the museum around the country. This holiday weekend, residents and visitors will be able to purchase flights on the “City of Port Clinton.”
“Neil Armstrong had his first flight on a Tin Goose,” Sondles said. “They mean so much to people.”

Diplomat says jailed opposition leader will be allowed to organise her party for elections next year
Burma's opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, may soon be released so she can play a role in next year's election, a senior Burmese diplomat has said.
"There is a plan to release her soon ... so she can organise her party," Min Lwin, a director-general in the foreign ministry, to ld the Associated Press. He gave no details and it was unclear whether Aung San Suu Kyi would be allowed to campaign or stand for election.
Despite the conciliatory remarks, the country's constitution includes provisions that bar her from holding office and ensure the primacy of the government in the military.
The Nobel peace prize winner has spent 14 of the last 20 years under house arrest. In August a court sentenced her to an additional 18 months after an American, John Yettaw, swam across a lake to her villa in Rangoon and stayed overnight.
Burma's junta in the the past has raised expectations of Aung San Suu Kyi's imminent release only to dash the hopes of her supporters at home and abroad.
Pro-democracy campaigners cautioned against reading too much into the latest hints on Suu Kyi's release. "They've been saying these sorts of things for a long time but they have never delivered on them," said Anna Roberts, the director of the Burma Campaign UK. "The regime's main concern is got economic sanctions lifted and get approval for the sham elections next year."
Tantalising hints of a possible release for the political prisoner came as Min Lwin was in Manila for a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and the US.
In a break with George Bush's policy of isolating the Burmese regime, Barack Obama has decided on a policy of engagment with the junta. Last week the US assistant secretary of state for east Asia, Kurt Campbell, and his deputy, Scott Marciel, became the most senior American officials to visit Burma since 1995, when Madeleine Albright went as Bill Clinton's ambassador to the UN.
Campbell and Marciel held exploratory talks with senior figures in the junta, including the prime minister, Thein Sein, but not Than Shwe, the general who has ruled the country for the last 17 years. They also met Aung San Suu Kyi.
Obama will meet Asean leaders this weekend during the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Singapore, possibly bringing him into rare contact with Thein Sein. The last US president to meet a Burmese leader was Lyndon Johnson, who held talks with prime minister Ne Win in 1966.
Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won Burma's last elections, in 1990, by a landslide but was blocked from power after the junta in place since a 1962 coup refused to recognise the result. Outside observers fear next year's election will be a sham to provide the veneer of credibility the regime has been looking for since 1990.

Britain has sold almost £50m-worth of arms to Turkey since the crackdown on opposition groups by the government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan after last year's failed coup attempt.
Newly published export statistics confirm that Turkey is now a major buyer of UK-made weapons.
Between 1 July and 30 September, the UK sold Turkey £26m-worth of ML13 licences, which relate to exports of armoured plate, body armour and helmets. In addition, Britain sold Turkey £8.5m-worth of ML10 licences, for aircraft, helicopters and drones, and almost £4m-worth of ML4 licences, for missiles, bombs and “counter-measures”.
Since 2015 the UK has sold Turkey £330m-worth of arms. The country is on the Department for International Trade's list of “priority markets” for arms exports. But the sales come amid mounting concerns about the abuse of human rights. Last week Turkish MPs held a second and final round of voting on constitutional changes to give President Erdoğan sweeping new powers. Under the plans, he will be able to choose ministers and judges and the post of prime minister will be axed. Critics have seen the move as a power grab.
British arms companies buck global trend with increase in sales Read more
Since last July's failed coup, more than 125,000 people have been dismissed or suspended from their jobs and around 40,000 others arrested. There are claims from human rights groups that opponents of the regime have been tortured. Turkey says that it is investigating 10,000 people on suspicion of using social media to support terrorism.
“The political situation in Turkey is unstable, and the crackdown has meant that the repression is getting even worse,” said Andrew Smith, of Campaign Against Arms Trade. “This should be a time for caution and the promotion of human rights, not arms sales. The government is always telling us how rigorous its arms export criteria supposedly are, yet it continues to arm and support repressive governments across the world. The aftermath of the coup attempt has seen an erosion of democracy in Turkey, and Whitehall should not be legitimising it. The rights of Turkish people are more important than arms company profits.”
An EU intelligence report claimed individual military officers, who did not rank above lieutenant or captain, might have felt “under pressure” to join the coup attempt in July because they knew that Erdoğan had planned to go after them for supporting the US-based cleric Fethullah Gülen in August anyway.
However, the government believes that arms exports can be a key growth driver for the UK economy. Ministers have been dispatched to a number of Gulf and Middle East states in recent months to promote British weapons. Last year the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, talked of his desire to agree a “jumbo” trade deal with Turkey. But the UK's position may put it at odds with the EU. A leaked confidential EU report last week suggested that Erdoğan had anticipated the coup and had sought to exploit it so that he could launch a campaign against his opponents.
The EU report said that the MIT, Turkey's intelligence service, had begun compiling lists of “troublesome individuals” years ago. It said the lists also contained the names of “civil activists” who took part in anti-Erdoğan protests in Taksim Gezi Park, Istanbul, in 2013. “The huge wave of arrests in the days following the coup attempt was already previously prepared. The coup was just a catalyst for the crackdown prepared in advance,” the intelligence report, obtained by the Times, said.
A government spokesperson said: “The UK takes its arms export responsibilities very seriously and operates one of the most robust arms export control regimes in the world. We rigorously examine every application on a case by case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria. Our export licensing system allows us to respond quickly to changing facts on the ground. We have suspended or revoked licences when the level of risk changes and we constantly review local situations.”
Malwarebytes 3.0 was a major update when it arrived in December 2016 -- and like many major updates, some aspects were a little rough, particularly stability within Windows 10. With version 3.2, the company claims it has corrected some major issues, so let's take a look at how this revision stacks up.
Pros
It's stable in Windows 10: With version 3.0, some users (us included) experienced seemingly random blue-screen errors in Windows 10 unless we disabled most or all of Malwarebytes' active scanning functions. As a result, there wasn't a lot to distinguish the paid version from the free one. However, we can report that we didn't see any BSODs in Windows 10 during our testing of 3.2. This was the only truly major issue we saw in version 3.0, so addressing it brings Malwarebytes back up to "recommended" status.
The scanning engine remains high-quality: During our tests, the app's malware scanner picked up some files and a Registry entry left over from an apparently incomplete uninstallation of a third-party driver management utility that, according to Malwarebytes, may have bundled a potentially unwanted program (PUP). Malwarebytes defaulted to placing these files in quarantine rather than deleting them. This is actually the preferred reflex, since PUPs aren't necessarily harmful, and extracting them can disable the program that they came with. Generally speaking, Malwarebytes' scanning tech is rated favorably by independent testers, such as West Coast Labs and Google's VirusTotal service, and it's cultivated a reputation for not bogging down your PC.
Detailed, plain-English explanations: While other security vendors often slather on fancy-sounding terminology, Malwarebytes is good at telling you exactly what a given feature is doing. Take the "Usage and Threat Statistics" toggle, for example. This covers the anonymous usage data that it collects. In the description on its website, Malwarebytes itemizes basic things like, how many people are running the free version, trial version, and subscription versions? Where is Malwarebytes being used globally? What malware is being detected the most, and how often?
Its full privacy policy even includes detailed and simplified explanations side-by-side. This kind of transparency about your data -- and the deliberately limited extent of it -- is good to have, and it's not as common in the security industry as it should be.
Cons
Limited testing by independent labs: The company asserts that the average "zero day" malware (the kind that's too new for there to be reliable detection/removal) has only a 55 percent detection rate, which can make a given antimalware app look worse than it is when subjected to a barrage of zero-day infections during testing. Therefore, Malwarebytes does not submit its apps to the full gauntlets provided by AV-Test and AV-Comparatives, whose testing takes special notice of zero-day security. However, if Malwarebytes wants to be recognized among its competition, we'd argue that it needs to submit its apps to the same rigorous standards as the competition, even if those standards can create perception issues.
Bottom Line
Now that Malwarebytes appears to have fixed its stability issues in version 3.2, the user experience is rounded out nicely. However, we'd like to see Malwarebytes go through the gauntlets set up by AV-Comparatives and AV-Test to get a better picture of how it stacks up against the competition.
Russian Military Apparently Using Cell Tower Spoofers To Send Propaganda Directly To Ukrainian Soldiers' Phones
from the phrase-'phone's-blowing-up'-just-got-a-bit-darker dept
We've often discussed the darker side of the repurposed war tech that's made its way into the hands of local law enforcement. Much like backdoored encryption (something some in law enforcement would like to see), rebranded war surveillance gear like Stingrays may sound great when touted by good guys, but we should never forget bad guys have access to the same equipment.
The seldom-discussed capabilities of Stingray devices are on full display in other countries. So far, we haven't seen US law enforcement use Stingrays to intercept communications or purposefully disrupt them. (A lack of public evidence doesn't mean it hasn't happened, however.) The power is there, though. Stingrays act as faux cell towers and force all phones in the area to route their communications through them. This has the potential to be more than merely disruptive to cell service. The devices carry the capability to act as roving wiretaps. They also have the power to act as very frightening purveyors of government propaganda.
Television journalist Julia Kirienko was sheltering with Ukrainian soldiers and medics two miles (three kilometers) from the front when their cellphones began buzzing over the noise of the shelling. Everyone got the same text message at the same time. “Ukrainian soldiers,” it warned, “they'll find your bodies when the snow melts.” Text messages like the one Kirienko received have been sent periodically to Ukrainian forces fighting pro-Russian separatists in the eastern part of the country. The threats and disinformation represent a new form of information warfare, the 21st-century equivalent of dropping leaflets on the battlefield.
The messages -- sent to cell phones presumably by Russian government operatives -- contain a mixture of propaganda and threats, warning recipients they're not much use to their children dead, or attempting to portray Ukrainian forces as being in disarray and on the run.
Multiple investigations have pinpointed the source of these communications: Russian LEER-3 electronic warfare systems feature drone-mounted cell site simulators launched from communications trucks for more effective cell communication interception/disruption. Russia is waging a mobile war of words with enemy combatants.
A 2015 article in Russia's Military Review magazine said the LEER-3 has a cell site simulator built into a drone that is capable of acting over a 6-kilometer-wide area and hijacking up to 2,000 cellphone connections at once. That makes it a “pretty plausible” source for the rogue texts in Ukraine, said Hardman, the former signals analyst.
What isn't mentioned in the AP story is this: if the Russian military is dropping propaganda text bombs on opposing forces, it's definitely intercepting their communications as well. The devices do both and the nearby communications truck provides a mobile base for harvesting, snooping, and analysis. That this version is still on the battlefield rather than in the hands of Russian police (although it's surely there as well) doesn't offer much comfort to citizens not currently in war zones but still likely considered to be "enemies" by other governments.
The devices are also scary cheap -- at least in terms of cost/benefit ratio. A half-million dollar gives governments the power to disrupt communications in multiple ways. It can spew propaganda directly into captive phones, pick up communications from these phones on the fly, track cell phone users, and, if nothing else, simply make it impossible for anyone to communicate with anyone else in the immediate area.

Helmet-cams are always imperfect — mounted a few inches above or to the side of a driver's eyes. Lucas di Grassi drove with one eye covered by a camera to let you see exactly what he sees driving an F1 car.
Moreover, he's driving around the high-speed curves of Spa-Francorchamps, and he's in the wet. The last time he tried this, Lucas explained why we'll only see this on test runs.
"I had to drive with only one eye open as the camera was blocking my other eye, quite tricky.
We haven't seen the camera set-up from the outside, but we can assume it's more high-tech than when Bruno Senna drove around Spa holding up his Blackberry.

Bob Weir has gathered up the Campfire band for another stint of shows this spring before he hits the road this summer with Dead and Company. The Campfire band includes Aaron Dessner, Bryan Devendorf and Scott Devendorf of The National along with Jon Shaw, Josh Kaufman and Steve Kimock.To open the show, as he had done in Campfire gigs before, Bobby sang three solo acoustic songs. Is there a better way to open a show than with a Bob Weir acoustic version of Dylan's “When I Paint My Masterpiece”? Weir's howling on the classic tune will give you chills.The rest of the band joined Weir for a set of Blue Mountain tunes. The second set was the Dead set. Bobby and his band ran through Grateful Dead originals and common covers like “Althea,” “Friend of the Devil,” “Standing on the Moon” and more. Dallas was then treated to a “Ripple” encore along with one of Bobby's originals off his new album, “Ki-Yi Bossie.”Set 1introPaint My MasterpieceEasy To SlipBlue MountainOnly a RiverDarkest HourLay My Lily DownGallop on the RunBig RiverGonesvilleSet 2:introEl PasoDeep Elem BluesFriend of the DevilAltheaCassidyTruckin'Standing on the MoonGoin' Down the Road Feeling BadEncore:Ki-Yi BossieRippleThanks to nakguy for the recording Photo credit: moksha_photography
When writing high performance code, we are careful to avoid cache misses when possible. When discussing cache misses, however, we are usually content with counting the number of cache misses. In this post I will explain why this is not sufficient, as data dependency also make a huge difference.
Consider for example a vector<unique_ptr<int>> . If the vector is large, iterating over the integers will typically incur a cache miss per element, because they are stored at arbitrary locations in memory. If we have a list<int> , iteration will also incur a cache miss for each element, because the nodes of the list are stored at arbitrary locations.
This could lead us to believe that cache misses have the same effect on performance for both of the above cases. That assumption is what I wanted to put to the test in this post.
Setup
To avoid the peculiarities of the memory system, or making my own allocator, I have simplified the linked list structure used for the experiment. The data type I use for iteration is a simple vector<pair<int, int>> . Each element consists of an index and a payload. The indices point to the next element in a linked list of all the elements in the vector . The data is generated by this code:
vector < pair < int , int >> create_random_data ( int N ) { mt19937 mt ; vector < int > sequence ( N ); std :: iota ( sequence . begin (), sequence . end (), 0 ); shuffle ( sequence . begin (), sequence . end (), mt ); vector < pair < int , int >> ret ; generate_n ( back_inserter ( ret ), N , [ & ]{ return pair < int , int > { 0 , mt () }; }); for ( int i = 0 ; i < N ; ++ i ) { auto next_i = ( i + 1 ) % N ; ret [ sequence [ i ]]. first = sequence [ next_i ]; } return ret ; }
Iterating over the linked list is done by the following code (to write to volatile is done to guard aginst optimizing away the loop):
volatile int volatile_sum ; void iterate_linked_list ( const vector < pair < int , int >>& data ) { int sum = 0 ; int idx = 0 ; do { sum += data [ idx ]. second ; idx = data [ idx ]. first ; } while ( idx != 0 ); volatile_sum = sum ; }
Iterating over a vector of pointers is approximated by simply reading the payload of the next element in the chain, but otherwise going through the vector in normal order:
void iterate_pointers ( const vector < pair < int , int >>& data ) { int sum = 0 ; for ( const auto & d : data ) { sum += data [ d . first ]. second ; } volatile_sum = sum ; }
And finally, we also compare with a simple iteration over the vector, where we expect almost zero cache misses:
void iterate_simple ( const vector < pair < int , int >>& data ) { int sum = 0 ; for ( const auto & d : data ) { sum += d . second ; } volatile_sum = sum ; }
For each , the operations are run 100 times and the median time is reported. The code is compiled with MSVC 2015 Update 2, with optimization level /O2 . Running on an Intel i7-4600U @2.1 GHz.
Results
We can see clear jumps in the run times when the data set grows out of the various cache levels. Furthermore, we see that the effect of cache misses is much worse for the linked list. I have also verified with gcc and perf that the cache miss count is roughly equal for the pointer iteration and linked list iteration.
Iteration (ns/elem) N simple pointers linked list 1000 0.76 0.76 3.041 2000 0.38 0.3805 2.0905 4000 0.66525 0.76025 2.0905 8000 0.427625 0.617625 4.70375 16000 0.570125 1.069 6.48531 32000 0.570125 0.867094 10.0843 64000 0.587969 1.78763 13.3745 128000 0.602805 2.1024 17.4635 256000 0.439484 1.68815 17.7352 512000 0.521887 3.58936 32.6628 1024000 0.579792 10.2269 74.1561 2048000 0.639181 15.2082 84.6611 4096000 0.655699 18.2579 89.6222 8192000 0.668737 21.606 94.0833
Why do we see this large difference? The answer is simply data dependency. When you are iterating over a range of pointers, the CPU can start reading in several values a same time, and then add them to the sum as they come in from the memory system. With the linked list structure, we can't continue to the next node until the current node is fully read from memory, because we don't know where to go next. This means we can't have many reads in flight at the same time. Put simply, the pointer iteration is more dependent on memory throughput, the linked list iteration is more dependent on memory latency.
Update: Thanks to @matt_dz for running some performance counter measurements on the above experiments, results can be seen in his gist. Among other things, the results show that cache miss counts are fairly similar for vector of pointers iteration and linked list, and that the benefit of vector of pointers is not due to hardware prefetching.
Conclusion
I hope I have made the argument that all cache misses are not equal, and that considering data dependency between the reads can be just as important as counting cache misses.
Edit: As some people have pointed out, the statement “all cache misses are not equal” is a bit misleading. The cache misses themselves are the same and have the same latency for both workloads. The difference is how many cache misses that can be in flight concurrently. So while the the cache misses are equal in that sense, they do not have an equal effect on latency of the whole iteration, which is what I tend to care about.

Cardiologists are doctors who specialize in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of conditions related to the heart and blood vessels.
A patient may be referred to a cardiologist if he experiences symptoms like chest pains, shortness of breath, dizziness, or high blood pressure. The physician will then evaluate your symptoms, take your health and family history and your weight. The cardiologist may order additional diagnostic tests, such as an echocardiogram, X-ray or blood tests. If necessary, the cardiologist may also call for a cardiac catheterization - a procedure in which a small tube is inserted into or near the heart that can take pictures of the heart's activity, or relieve blockage.
Once determining whether there is a heart condition, a cardiologist will treat a patient through cholesterol management, cardiac rehabilitation, and fitness. If surgical intervention is required, like open-heart surgery, a cardiologist will make that determination, but a cardiothoracic surgeon will perform the procedure.
At an army checkpoint near the occupied city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Lt. Col. Natalia Semeniuk approached a convoy of two minibuses that had just arrived from Kiev. Slung over her shoulder was an AK-47 assault rifle. Clumps of long, brown hair poked out from beneath the beanie she wore to guard against the cold, which had dropped to about minus-20 degrees Fahrenheit.
Colonel Semeniuk was meeting with Anna Sandalova, a former public relations executive and a founder of Help the Army of Ukraine, a foundation that uses Facebook to raise money to buy equipment for Ukraine's desperately underfunded army. Ms. Sandalova has become something of a star in her country, especially to its soldiers. She supplies them with everything from body armor to night-vision goggles, to sleeping bags and food. Since her group was established in March, it has raised over $1.3 million, Ms. Sandalova told me, for the fight against the pro-Russian separatists who have occupied large parts of eastern Ukraine.
An overwhelming majority of the money is crowdfunded from the Ukrainian people through Facebook. The process is simple: Ms. Sandalova liaises with army divisions fighting in the field. They tell her what they need and she posts their requests to Facebook. People donate via bank transfer into the foundation's account, and Ms. Sandalova and her colleagues then drive the goods to eastern Ukraine personally.
That day, the minibuses were filled to bursting. Clad in body armor and a helmet, Ms. Sandalova followed Colonel Semeniuk to a Ukrainian Army camp in the forest near Donetsk to make her first delivery. Canvas tents dotted the area, erected among thickets of trees covered with snow. Soldiers huddled together, talking and smoking. Some helped unload several mobile shower units.
The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board has launched its first swimsuit donation drive in hopes of making bathing suits available to low-income families and children of color.
The Park Board is accepting new or gently used adult and children's swimsuits and burkinis at its headquarters and all of its recreational centers until Labor Day. North Commons, Webber and Jim Lupient water parks will also accept donations. Labeled bins will be at each rec center. Park Board staff will launder the swimsuits before handing them out.
The donated swimsuits will be given to low-income families and children in need as they are available.
Mimi Kalb, the Park Board's director of aquatics, athletics and ice arenas, said park staff noticed kids coming to the pool without proper swimwear.
“It's our hope that it helps low-income, diverse families, new immigrants to the city,” she said. “The goal obviously is to reduce the drowning rate overall.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, children of color are at the highest risk of fatal drowning.
In March, the Park Board took a step to reduce the drowning rate in communities of color when it broke ground at its first public pool at Phillips Community Aquatics Center in south Minneapolis. The aquatics center is expected to open by early 2018.
To boost participation before then, Kalb said, swimming lessons will be available for $5 for children who get free and reduced-price school lunch. Interested families should contact the Park Board's aquatics department for registration.
Diff Files Across Salt Minions
Simple file management in Salt is trivial with the file.managed function, and it can quickly get extended with some Jinja templating. Say, for instance, each collection of minions for a given data center has its own NTP server it needs to hit, then you might like a way to check that each minion's NTP config file is identical without having to run a high state. Of course templating abstracts problems like this away, but in environments where it's possible for manual changes to sneak in, this becomes useful.
Seeing a single file's contents from many minions is trivial with:
salt 'web*' cmd.run 'cat /etc/ntp.conf'
Now, to quickly get a diff across each of those files, use:
salt-run survey.diff 'web*' cmd.run 'cat /etc/ntp.conf'
The survey runner will take the results of the selected execution module, cmd.run in this case, and will aggregate the results into pools of the unique results.
The only limitation I ran into is that this runner only supports globbing on targets, so targeting by grains, pillar data, or node groups isn't really straightforward. Check the SaltStack documentation for more information on how the survey runner works.

If Peyton Manning wants to play in the NFL in 2015, the Denver Broncos want him back, says John Elway.
Manning's struggles in Sunday's 24-13 loss to the Indianapolis Colts came just one day before Coach John Fox departed the franchise, and those two factors led to much speculation as to whether or not Manning, 38, would want to return to the team next season.
“The bottom line is we want him back. It's gonna come down to what he wants to do,” Elway said of Manning in his season-ending address.
Elway and Manning met with each other on Monday, but Elway said he told Manning he didn't want to discuss Manning's future at that time, wanting to give the future Hall of Fame quarterback time to sort out what his future will be.
“I did have a great conversation with Peyton yesterday. We sat and talked about game,” Elway said. “I told him ...we're not gonna talk about your future (today). He needs to get away. The last thing I want to do is talk about your future. … In four or five weeks, we'll get back together and see where he is.”
As for why Fox departed as head coach, Elway indicated that he and Fox had different ideas of what it would take for the Broncos to take the next step as an organization. Elway indicated that he had not spoken yet with any of the potential candidates.
Elway did say that Manning would be involved in the decision to hire a new coach.
As for whether or not Manning is healthy enough to play at the level he has performed at for most of his career, Elway said that decision would be strictly up to Manning.
“I can't speak for Peyton, and I won't speak for Peyton. Only Peyton knows how his body feels and what is going on inside his body,” Elway said. Elway added he believes Manning can still have another productive season if he returns.
“Ladies and gentlemen” no longer means damas y caballeros in Mexico. At least not when preceded by a hash tag.
This year has seen politicians and the rich dubbed “ladies” or “gentlemen” for behavior that would classify them as anything but. From #LadyProfeco – the woman who had a trendy Mexico City restaurant temporarily shuttered after she was denied a table – to the #GentlemanDeIxtapaluca, a public servant whose drunken tirade against the police was caught on video this week: Mexicans are catching their public servants misbehaving and getting the word out via social networks and traditional media.
It's a recourse for public shaming that carries on a long Mexican tradition of poking fun of the powerful, say observers. And in the face of pervasive impunity, the airing of politicians' less than ladylike or gentlemanly behavior is having modest results. In a country where legal avenues for fighting abuses of power often fall short it is knocking the powerful down a notch or two.
“It's a cultural question,” says Hector Castillo Berthier, who directs the youth division of the Institute for Social Research at the National Autonomous University. “We opt for mockery, for the snub, for contempt. What's at the bottom of it? Social inequality.” A recent study by the national statistics agency divides Mexicans into three classes: 59 percent fall into the lower category, 39 percent in the middle, and just 1.7 percent in upper class.
He notes that one of Mexico's most iconic images – the skeletal catrina with a wide-brimmed hat covered in flowers that has come to symbolize the Day of the Dead – was originally created by José Guadalupe Posada to make fun of the upper class during the regime of Porfirio Díaz in the late 19th century.
Another kind of protest
This week, Brazilians have taken to the streets by the hundreds of thousands in protest of what started as a small bus fare hike but has erupted into mass anger about the poor quality of public services and high taxes – complaints that a rising middle class, in a country still plagued by inequality, feels empowered to make. Such frustrations aren't unfamiliar to Mexicans.
A growing Mexican middle class has become less willing to tolerate abuses by the rich or lawmakers who believe they are above the law, says Helena Varela Guinot, director of the Universidad Iberoamericana department of social sciences and politics. And an expanding civil society is demanding greater accountability from government officials.
The shaming in the media and on social networks of politicians who behave badly “helps to control the out-of-control ambition of the political class,” Ms. Varela Guinot says, but “for accountability to be truly viable, it's not enough to expose them. Legal consequences depend on rule of law. Unfortunately, we don't have that in Mexico.”
When Andrea Benítez was denied the table she wanted at a popular bistro in April, she pulled strings at the consumer protection agency known as Profeco, which is led by her father. She threatened the owner and, within hours, Profeco inspectors shut down the place. The scandal that erupted grew until President Enrique Peña Nieto abruptly fired her father, Humberto Benítez, from his post.
Ms. Benítez may be the most notorious Mexican “lady,” but many others have emerged. Senator Luz María Beristain – “Lady Senadora” – made a ruckus when she arrived late for a flight and the airline refused to check her in. The video of her insulting an employee went viral. After the incident, the airline promptly launched a tongue-in-cheek advertising campaign announcing low fares for “Damas y Caballeros (and not ladies and gentlemen, which is not the same)."

The “gentlemen” have fared no better. The “Gentleman of Ixtapaluca,” Francisco Javier Romo, resigned from the conservative National Action Party to which he belonged after the embarrassing video of him swearing at a police officer emerged this month. However, he didn't resign his post as a local councilman in a town in Mexico state.
“In the political class, the recovery [from public shame] is usually rapid,” says Varela Guinot. “We'll soon have them back on the political scene as if nothing had ever happened.”
New concept art has surfaced which suggests that Next Level Games, the developer behind Punch-Out!! for Wii and Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, was working on a Metroid game for the 3DS.
The concept art, which includes one image of protagonist Samus Aran in her iconic suit and several boss characters, appear on an online portfolio belonging to artists Nelson "Dedos" Garcia and Xochitl. Their portfolio also has concept art for Next Level's Punch-Out!!, which they worked on as well from 2007 to 2009.
An unnamed source related to the project told Destructoid that it was real, and that it was shelved in favor Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, another 3DS game Next Level and Nintendo released last year. "It was about as bare-bones as it gets, but it was still pretty fun," the source said.
The most recent game in the Metroid series was 2010's Metroid: Other M, the Team Ninja-developed action game for Wii that many fans bemoaned for its treatment of Samus' character.
"We have the Prime style of Metroid game and we have the more traditional style of Metroid game," Nintendo's Shinya Takahashi said back in June. "We feel that we do need to take care of both of these styles of play. And the hope is that at some point in the near future we'll be able to share something about them."
IRVING, Texas -- Last week Dallas Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said Rolando McClain was dealing with a family matter in missing the organized team activities but the linebacker was expected to return this week.
The Cowboys opened up their second week of OTAs on Tuesday and McClain was not in attendance, according to sources. The Cowboys will practice Wednesday and Thursday this week. They conclude their OTAs next week and have their mandatory minicamp June 14-16.
The offseason practices are voluntary, so McClain is not subject to any penalty. The Cowboys hoped that a full offseason of work would be beneficial to McClain, who signed a one-year deal worth up to $5 million in March.
In 2014 he was acquired in a trade from the Baltimore Ravens in July after the offseason program ended. He missed most of the offseason program in 2015 because of knee surgery, choosing to rehab away from the team. He showed up for the mandatory minicamp in June but did not take part in a training camp practice in Oxnard, California.
After missing the first four games in 2015 because of a suspension, McClain played in 11 games and was credited by the coaches with 97 tackles, two sacks, nine tackles for loss, 10 quarterback pressures, one interception and three pass deflections.
The Cowboys signed McClain to a one-year deal in March that included a $750,000 signing bonus and $1.25 million base salary. For every week he is on the Cowboys' 46-man roster, he can earn an extra $125,000, maxing out at $2 million. He can also earn up to $1 million in incentives.
Aston Villa Owner Randy Lerner: We Are Aiming For The Champions League Next Season
Chairman's desire is 'as alive as ever'
However, the amiable American also stressed that spending vast amounts of money, similar to Manchester City, is not the answer.
Villa were pressing for a top four spot this season until two defeats in the final two games condemned them to sixth.
"The ambition and appetite to compete for the top four spot and qualify for Europe is as alive and well as it's ever been,” Lerner told the official Aston Villa website.
"Exactly how to do that is a little bit more of an open question than simply spend to get there.
"I think from an anecdotal perspective, if it was simply spend to get there then the composition of the top four might actually be slightly different.
"I think there are other strengths that yield likelihoods of getting there - continuity of the manager, being able to target a player, bring him along and be acknowledged as Young Player of the Year, anecdotally-speaking.
"I guess it's my way to try and say that yes, the appetite and ambition to get there is very real and exactly what the path is and whether it's as brutally raw to spend there and get there is an open question in my mind.”
Yet, despite talks of Villa boss Martin O'Neill working under a sell-before-you-buy policy this summer, Lerner will back his manager if the opportunity to bring in players of the required quality arises.
"There' a sell-to-buy policy in nearly every organisation on the planet. It's good business to try to sell to buy,” continued Lerner.
"On the other hand, if opportunities arise in which the net number of sell-to-buy doesn't equal what is required to take advantage of an opportunity, then you may spend the money."

This new space film called “Cinema Space Tribute” combines visions from several sci-fi franchises to show us what space exploration could look like. Will we gracefully explore the moons of Jupiter and far space? Or is it more a reality where we fear the death that lurks behind every action?
Max Shiskin pulls together an impressive list of franchises to show us some fictional versions of space exploration. Backdropped by the soundtrack for Interstellar, you see quick glimpses of ships from Star Trek and Battlestar: Galactica and Star Wars and many more. He even throws in some you might not think of right away, like Man of Steel and Transformers: Dark of the Moon.
There are some neat synergies between the franchises, including a seeming obsession with circles, that Shiskin also shows off in the video. It's definitely worth four minutes of your time to watch.
As the summer continues, our offices have the best airconditioners in Norway and Poland, so our developers have been in them, working to bring you Opera 17 Developer stream. This stream is our bleeding edge development; features will be piloted, and may be shelved, taken back to the drawing board, or taken forward to the Opera Next stream – feature complete, but potentially buggy. Once the bugs have been ironed out, the features are released as stable, and once every few weeks the streams are all refreshed. You can follow all three if you want, but please note that you shouldn't entrust valuable data to anything other than the released stable stream.

Happy testing!
The Metro line fiasco has turned into an ominously dark cloud over our otherwise bright and hopeful city.
The City Auditor's report, if you haven't read it yet, details terrible management of a major project that is supposed to be a major piece of our LRT future.
One thing that's important to keep in mind when looking at this report is the role Thales, the signalling contractor, has to play in all this. There is plenty of blame to go around in terms of the City's role in this project, but Thales has missed major milestones throughout this project. They've contributed to this project delay in a big way, and there are many issues to be resolved with them as we seek to bring the line to completion. I say this not to detract from the City's role - we've got a lot of work to do.
A lot has been said about why things played out the way they did, about who is responsible, and what the City should do to fix the problems and make sure the same mistakes are never repeated. The Auditor's report provides three critical recommendations. When coupled with improvements already made since our new Transportation General Manager came aboard in 2013, I think the dark cloud can begin to dissipate.
Council's Benchmarks
But I don't think this cloud will ever be completely gone unless three things occur. These are things the City Manager, under City Council's clear direction must fiercely seek to accomplish:
1.) The opening of the Metro line to the full service we expected when we signed the contracts as soon as possible.
2.) The complete implementation of the Auditor's recommendations and new practices of transparent reporting for all partners, from Project Managers, to Project Owners, to General Managers, to the City Manager, and to Council on all major infrastructure projects (i.e LRT, Bridges, Arenas, Recreation Centres, etc).
3.) Meaningful accountability for those staff who were here when these misjudgments related to lack of communication were made. The onus must be on the City Manager to convince Council that those staff add more value to Edmonton's future than they have subtracted from it by being responsible in whatever way they were for this mess. If he can't convince us of that, then the people responsible who are still with the city today, shouldn't be tomorrow.
The Auditor's Report
As for the Auditor's report, it identified a number of ‘lessons learned' that will be critical for the Transportation department to apply to upcoming projects and the remainder of the work on the Metro Line project. Quoted from the City Auditor's report on the Metro Line, the lessons are as follows:
• Project management roles and responsibilities need to be clearly defined and understood.
• Realistic project completion dates need to be established and if necessary revised in a timely manner.
• Senior Management should be provided with formal written status reports that identify major issues.
• Council should be notified on a timely basis of any event or issue that has the potential to generate negative publicity.
• Contract management practices need to be reviewed to ensure the City receives best value.
Conclusions and Recommendations
The Auditor's report also identified a number of conclusions and recommendations for the City to consider:
Conclusions:
1.) The report found that procurement practices for the Communications Based Train Control (CBTC) system designed to control the signals for the train contract complied with the City's procurement directive and associated procedures.
2.) Project management practices for the Metro Line project were not effective in 3 of the 13 project management knowledge areas.
3.) Time/Schedule – Neither the CBTC contractor nor the civil construction contractor met the originally-scheduled full-service opening date of April 2014. As of the date of the Auditor's report, a commissioning letter stating that the CBTC system is ready for first stage of revenue service on the Metro Line has not been received.
4.) Human Resource – Overall Metro Line project roles and responsibilities were not clearly defined and understood by the entire Metro Line project team resulting in ineffective leadership.
5.) Communications – Failure to define roles and responsibilities also resulted in poor communication within the Metro Line project team and to senior management and Council
6.) Based on the review, there are opportunities to improve due diligence for contract management.
Recommendations:
1.) The report recommends that the General Manager of Transportation Services ensure that for all major projects consistent principles and methodologies of adhere to quality assurance principles for contract management, meaning that every contract we sign should be well thought out and airtight in terms of expectations and repercussions. Action Taken: Transportation is completing a gap analysis of all capital projects by December 2015, and expect to have completed filling any gaps by next year.
2.) The report recommends that the General Manager of Transportation Services ensure that project roles, responsibilities, lines of communication, management of working relationships, and decision authority levels are clearly defined, assigned, and communicated for all major projects. Action Taken: The Transportation department has committed to enhancing project rigor, to include communications in their risk management plan, and to ensure that all projects will be evaluated by risk principles.
3.) The auditor's report recommends that the General Manager of Transportation Services in conjunction with Financial Services and Utilities' and the Corporate Centre for Project Management staff develop a standard reporting methodology, so that there is never any question about how should be reporting what and when. Action Taken: Transportation has committed to completing a scan of best practices for project reporting, and will continue to work with Financial Services and Utilities and the Corporate Centre for Project Management on developing the methodology.
I'm hopeful the day comes that we can move on from this debacle. Administration has accepted responsibility and is committing to implementation of all of the Auditor's recommendations. 70% of the relevant leadership in the Transportation Department has turned over since the darkest days of this colossal mismanagement. Some left of their own accord, some retired, and yes, some made unwilling exits.
When asked at Audit Committee today, the General Manager of Transportation assured us that he has full confidence that the individuals currently on his team are fully on board with the changes to the department, and that they will be able to avoid these pitfalls in the future, particularly when it comes to the Valley Line.
Additional Steps
In addition to improvements to be made as result of the lessons learned, in early 2013, the City put in place the:
Corporate Centre for Project Management
Corporate Project Management Reference Guide
Project Management for Construction Projects Administrative Procedure
Project Management Business Process Stewardship Committee
Standard Corporate Reporting Practices
All of these changes should help prevent the problems that the City has encountered with the Metro line project delivery.
Additionally, Council, earlier this year, approved an Enterprise Risk Management Framework which allows us to understand a range of organizational risks associated with policy changes. In the case of the Metro Line, the Risk Management Framework would have involved an investigation of the policy that led to the track placement, which compelled the project managers to pursue a complex signalling system, and the splitting of the contracts for the signalling system, which as I mentioned in one of my previous blogs, was one of the principal faults in the projects.
Earning Back Some Trust
It will take time to get the trust of the public back when it comes to our ability to manage these large projects. But earning back your trust will be based on our actions and performance from this day forward. I believe the actions we have taken are very important steps in ensuring that our staff on future projects do not make the same mistakes and that Council has the ability to see the investments we make with your tax dollars deliver the projects the city asked for.
If there is a silver lining in this stormy Metro Line cloud, it's that the processes and procedures for the Transportation department have undergone a serious overhaul, one that by all accounts was sorely needed. Only time will tell if these changes are enough to restore the public's confidence in the City's ability to manage large capital projects. But for certain we as a council must pay very close attention to ensuring the recommendations from the Auditor are taken very seriously and implemented expeditiously.
Iraqis walk past a poster of Ahmed Hassan, an Iraqi Shiite fighter who was killed in Syria as he was protecting Sayida Zeinab shrine. Some Iraqi Shiites fighters have traveled to Syria claiming that their aim is to defend the shrine, which marks what is believed to be the grave of the granddaughter of the Prophet Mohammad. They say that they want to stop attacks by Sunni extremists on the shrine. (Karim Kadim/AP)
The Iraqi fighters in the video shoulder assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades as they walk down a highway lined with cypress trees. Grinning, some hold up cellphones and camcorders to capture the moment — the aftermath of a victorious battle to secure the Aleppo airport from Syrian rebels who had attempted to take it.
“You are the sons of Iraq and the sons of Islam!” shouts one of their commanders. The men cheer.
Weeks later in Baghdad, Abu Sajad, the nom de guerre of an Iraqi militia commander who appears in the video, proudly displayed it as proof that Iraqi Shiites are playing a critical role supporting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in what has become an increasingly sectarian and regional war. It was impossible to verify the location in the video or the circumstances.
Until recently, the involvement of Iraqi Shiites in Syria's war was cloaked in secrecy here in Iraq, whose Shiite-led government has denied any role in the conflict. But recent interviews with militants, analysts, Arab government officials and residents of Shiite cities across Iraq reveal a trend that is growing increasingly open as Iraqi fighters come to view their participation as part of a regional struggle to defeat al-Qaeda and what they say is a broad effort by the region's dominant Sunnis to wipe out Shiites.
At the center of the Shiite mobilization is Iran, which analysts and intelligence officials say is seeking to preserve its regional influence by funding and supplying an expanding Shiite network of armed support for the Syrian government, which is dominated by Assad's Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. In addition to combatants from Iranian security forces and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, pro-Assad proxy fighters include Iraqis drawn largely from militant groups known to be backed by Iran.
The role of Iraqi Shiite fighters in Syria raises questions about the possible complicity of the Iraqi government, which U.S. officials have recently criticized for allowing Iran to use Iraqi airspace for flights that allegedly transport weapons, troops and supplies to the Assad government. Iraqi officials say they have agreed to U.S. requests for inspections of the Iranian overflights. Eight recent random inspections have found “nothing illegal,” said Kareem Nouri, a Transportation Ministry spokesman.
“We support neither the opposition nor the regime in Syria, and we will not make Iraq a part of the fight in Syria,” he said.
But Iraqi officials have warned repeatedly that Assad's fall would spell disaster for Iraq, and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki told the Associated Press in February that a rebel victory in Syria would revive Iraq's sectarian war. In an interview, Sami al-Askari, a Shiite lawmaker close to Maliki, said the government “turns a blind eye” to the flow of Shiite fighters to Syria, as it does in the case of Iraqi Sunnis who help Syrian rebels.
Analysts and Shiite militia leaders say it is unclear how many Iraqi Shiites have gone to fight in Syria, but Abu Sajad put the number at about 200 and said the ranks were growing quickly. He said Shiite fighters had been particularly motivated by an April statement by al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who glorified the Syrian opposition in what he depicted as its fight against Assad and Iran, and by the Syrian Islamist rebel group Jabhat al-Nusra's recent pledge of fealty to al-Qaeda.
“Now it has become very common for people to say, ‘I'm going to Syria to fight,' ” Abu Sajad said. “Why can Zawahiri say it publicly and we have to keep it a secret?”
Highly organized missions
In an interview in Baghdad, Abu Sajad and another Iraqi Shiite militia commander, Abu Aya, refused to say how they traveled to Syria or comment on Iran's role in the process. But they said some of their operations helped tip the scale in favor of the Assad government, which has recently made gains against rebels.
Abu Sajad described his two-month mission this spring as extremely organized. He said that he took along 10 fighters, all highly skilled from years spent battling U.S. forces in Iraq, and that the Syrian army provided them with arms, vehicles and supplies.
“The Iraqi groups are only doing special missions,” he said. “We fight, and when we free a place . . . then the Syrian army comes in and sets up a base.”
The men said they were members of a Shiite militia but declined to say which one. Other Shiites who know them from Baghdad's Sadr City neighborhood identified them as members of Asaib Ahl al-Haq, a group responsible for most attacks against U.S. forces in the final years of the Iraq war.
Residents and journalists in Baghdad and several Shiite cities in Iraq's south said the group is leading a shadowy effort to recruit and dispatch fighters to Syria.
Publicly, militia leaders, government officials and Shiite clerics in Baghdad and Tehran say Iraqi Shiites are going to Syria exclusively to protect the Shiite Sayeda Zeinab shrine south of Damascus. Massoud Jazayeri, a spokesman for Iran's armed forces general staff, told the Lebanese al-Manar news channel last week that “many measures have taken place” to form forces to protect Syria's Shiite shrines.
But a growing number of news media reports about bodies that have been returned to Iraq from Syria and funerals for fighters slain there indicate that Iraqi Shiites are active in battles far beyond the Sayeda Zeinab district, where the level of combat is low, said Will Fulton, an Iran analyst at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington who co-authored a recent report on Iran's strategy in Syria.
Abu Sajad and Abu Aya said there had been battles between Iraqi militants and anti-Assad rebels across Syria, including in Damascus, Aleppo, Homs and the strategic Qusair region along the border with Lebanon.
Iraqis, Hezbollah at the front
Residents of southern Iraqi Shiite cities said that fighters are mobilized in meetings with Shiite political parties and militias and that they often travel via Iran.
“Every day here, there are two or three funerals for martyrs killed in Syria,” said a journalist in Najaf who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid attracting the attention of the militias. He said about “90 percent” of the fighters had been mobilized by Asaib Ahl al-Haq and another ­Iranian-funded militia, Kataib Hezbollah.
Abu Sajad and Abu Aya said that in many instances, specialized paramilitary units of well-trained Iraqi Shiites and Lebanese Hezbollah fighters led offensives against rebel forces because Syrian army regiments were too afraid to do so.
The two men showed more than a dozen cellphone videos that they said Abu Sajad and his fighters shot during battles in Syria. Several other videos that purportedly show Iraqis fighting in Syria have surfaced on the Internet in the past two months.
One of Abu Sajad's videos purports to show Iraqi fighters in green fatigues preparing for an assault on rebel forces in the Damascus suburb of Jobar.
“Look, that's the Syrian army doing nothing because they're scared,” Abu Sajad proclaimed, pointing to a cluster of men in half the frame. “And there's me.”
Abu Sajad said his unit had helped deliver crushing defeats to the Syrian rebels, capture suspected spies and “liberate” Aleppo's strategic airport from the threat of shelling.
By the end of his first mission in Jobar, Abu Sajad said, his unit — with the help of regular radio communications with Hezbollah — had pushed deep into a rebel-held territory and killed “a lot” of people.
Before proceeding with the offensive, he recalled, he told a Syrian army commander: “Now you will see what the Iraqis can do.”
When they were done, he said, they handed the area over to the Syrian army and moved on to the next mission.
Joby Warrick in Dubai, an Iraqi employee of The Washington Post in Baghdad, Sharaf al-Hourani in Cairo and Ahmed Ramadan in Beirut contributed to this report.
Drinking of alcohol by Russians has dropped by one-quarter over the past three years, according to a leading health official.
MOSCOW, October 17 (RIA Novosti) – Drinking of alcohol by Russians has dropped by one-quarter over the past three years, according to a leading health official.
The Health Ministry's substance abuse specialist, Yevgeny Bryun, said alcohol consumption per capita currently stands at 13.5 liters of pure ethyl alcohol equivalent, down from 18 liters in 2010.
The 2010 figure was more than twice the level considered dangerous by the World Health Organization.
“I don't think that Russians drink more than Europeans or Americans. But we drink in the wrong way,” Bryun said. “We drink strong alcohol and we drink it in shots, combining it with the wrong consumption of food.”
The fall appears to be outcome of a government anti-alcohol campaign aimed at halving consumption by 2020 and rooting out illegal production and sales.
A report by the Russian Public Chamber in 2009 said that about 500,000 Russians die annually from alcohol-related causes.
Cow blowing,[1] Kuhblasen,[2] phooka, or doom dev,[3] is a process used in many countries according to ethnographers, in which forceful blowing of air into a cow's vagina (or sometimes anus) is applied to induce her to produce more milk.
Cow blowing was the reason why Gandhi abjured cow milk, saying that "since I had come to know that the cow and the buffalo were subjected to the process of phooka, I had conceived a strong disgust for milk."[4]
Cow blow, of the tribes of Khoikhoi to induce production of milk. Drawing of unknown author around 1700–1740

Tottenham Hotspur has unveiled their updated designs and plans for the Northumberland Development Project, which will be submitted to the London Borough of Haringey in the coming weeks. The scheme includes a new Populous-designed stadium that will be the first of its kind in the world as well as a hotel and visitor attractions.
Described by Club Chairman Daniel Levy as “visually dramatic” and a “landmark building for Tottenham,” the new stadium will be truly perfect for both elite football (soccer) and NFL, with a state-of-the-art retractable pitch.
Senior Principal of Populous, Christopher Lee, spoke about the stadium as the design was launched: “The new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium marks a new generation of stadia design: stadia that provide an unparalleled experience for all fans, that are civic in their nature and hold community at their heart but above all else create the most intense and atmospheric place to watch football.
“The seating bowl is designed to create an intimate relationship between player and spectator, its 17,000 capacity single tier end stand, a tribute to traditional English football grounds, will be the largest in the UK and will be the engine that drives the intensity and atmosphere in the new Spurs stadium. It will be like no other,” Lee said.
Christopher Lee continued, “Populous has always been a pioneer of new technologies. Moving pitches in stadia such as the University of Phoenix (NFL) stadium or the moving roof over centre court at Wimbledon have provided the critical experience to allow us to design a stadium that is perfect for both English football and American football. In a world first, the stadium will include a retractable natural turf surface for English football, with an astroturf pitch for American football underneath. This combination allows each sport to play on its own dedicated pitch and provides perfect sightlines for their fans.”
Key elements of the overall scheme are:
• A visually dramatic new stadium design – A landmark building for Tottenham and London, focussed towards the ‘Home End', improved sightlines for all spectators and modern technology integral to the design from the outset to enhance the fan experience.
• An increased capacity stadium – up from 56,250 to 61,000 seats, featuring the largest single tier stand in the UK, now increased to 17,000 seats, with an unrivalled spectator experience throughout and spectators closer to the pitch than at any other comparable size stadium in the UK.
• Dedicated facilities for the NFL – including a fully retractable pitch revealing a second playing surface, compliant to NFL standard and capable of hosting a range of other events whilst protecting the integrity of the playing surface.
• An architecturally stunning new terrace on the High Road to host ‘The Tottenham Experience' – a permanent Visitors Centre and Arrivals Hub including an interactive Museum to celebrate Club history and local heritage, a Cinema, the Club Megastore, Ticket Office and Café.
• A permanent viable use for the Grade II listed Warmington House – incorporated as part of The Tottenham Experience to house the new Museum, blending old architecture with new.
• Improved crowd management arrangements along the High Road – with the removal of three buildings that currently create a pinch point along Tottenham High Road where the pavement is just two metres wide – resulting in people walking in the bus lane and the road – allowing instead for a much wider pavement to cope with large crowds.
• Enhanced public open space – comparable in area to Trafalgar Square, includes a multi-use games area, high quality landscaping, cafes, dedicated events and community programmes managed by the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation, and the ability to walk uninterrupted all the way round the stadium.
• A new 180 bedroom hotel with a dedicated training programme for the hospitality industry – providing high quality accommodation in Tottenham and opening up new career opportunities for local people. 49 serviced apartments will occupy the upper floors.
• A fantastic new building to host Extreme Sports – bringing people to Tottenham on a daily basis with activities for all ages, including the tallest indoor climbing wall in the world.
• A spectacular ‘Skywalk' –an adrenaline-filled experience and attraction for all ages walking on top of the stadium with spectacular views across London.
• 579 new homes, including affordable housing (designed by Allies and Morrison) – up from 285 homes in the current permission, meeting a key need for more homes in London. Set out across four new residential buildings, every apartment will enjoy access to a private balcony in addition to communal gardens and child play areas.
• A new community health centre – serving existing and new residents to the area, improving access to GPs and health screening.
The design team comprises Populous in respect of the stadium design, the hotel and the visitor attractions; Allies & Morrison for the new homes; and Donald Insall Associates as heritage architects.

Reading this article, I found many things about it that are misleading for VPN consumers. While the article does make some valid points, a vast majority of the arguments presented are misinformed, biased, and simply not true.
Myth #1 There Isn't a Good VPN out There
Ken Hawkins, the author, says he can't pick a good VPN since most lists of good VPNs out there are riddled with affiliate links, and most information from websites can't be verified. Unfortunately, this author also name drops a popular Reddit user to verify his claims.
Additionally, placing your trust in a VPN chart that is injected with one person's personal views is not smart. This individual who runs the chart is not public, kept anonymously, so we can't trust his agendas or even hold him accountable.
At times, from observing his behavior on Reddit, ThatOnePrivacyGuy (this is the owner of the linked VPN chart) seems more worried about taking down affiliates or revealing VPNs sneaky marketing campaigns instead of helping users choose VPNs like we do. If you're looking for a subreddit that can help you choose a VPN without censorship or harsh rules, check out reddit.com/r/virtualprivatenetwork.
Just like VPN websites that falsely advertise, he can put data and change it as he chooses (or not update data–after all, he's one guy managing hundreds of VPN data). We have found a fair amount of information in this chart to be inaccurate. Most recently, to prove this, we found that HotSpot Shield has five simultaneous connections available while the chart only says 2.
Choosing one VPN over another just because they donate to some nonprofit organization is not sound reasoning. Is that supposed to make it less likely to be a honey pot? If the NSA was covertly running a VPN, I would assume they would intentionally donate money to various organizations just to dispel suspicion.
Mentioning other lists and their affiliate links–how is that relevant? What, so you can't use other lists to create your own? You shouldn't be anyway; you should be testing VPNs out yourself–and not relying on some chart either.
Firstly, information can be verified by testing a VPN. I have personally identified encryption rates, speeds, and multiple aspects from a VPN provider–features and specifications that can separate good from bad.
Simply said, it's quite easy to rank VPNs from a user standpoint. It's also easy to tell if a VPN is logging, and how, even if their site claims otherwise. You can tell if your IP address is kept in user homepage panels, or from reading their privacy policy carefully.
Another way to tell if your VPN is logging is if they forward you regular DMCA notices. In this case, they are most certainly logging user activity. Many VPNs like Hidemyass and IPvanish have done this in the past although they may have changed this policy recently.
Myth #2 VPNs Aren't for Anonymity
This section of the article is just confused. On one hand it suggests VPNs are not good for anonymity, then it says that they are, and you should use them in conjunction with a Tor Browser.
The article cites this quote “using public VPNs for anonymity is foolish and potentially dangerous, no matter how securely it's configured, just because the technology was not designed at all for anonymity. VPN services require that you trust them, which is a property that anonymity systems do not have.”
So what, we are just supposed to use nothing? Or put all of our trust in a free Tor Browser? Again this section of the article seems confused in that it provides a quote saying how VPNs are useless, but then it just says to use them with a tor browser.
Furthermore, the article even admits that there have been “malicious Tor exit nodes in Russia that have been modifying binaries” but it still recommends Tor over VPN by saying that “engineers work incredibly quickly to patch security vulnerabilities. The same may not be true for all VPNs.”
No matter how fast Tor vulnerabilities are fixed there seem to be new ones popping up every year. From compromised Tor websites, honeypot Tor nodes and even an incident where a particular government agency paid off University researchers $1 million dollars to gain access to the Tor onion routing network.
So what? VPN teams and companies are not run by paid individuals with their customer's security in mind? Isn't Tor ran by volunteers? Wouldn't you rather your service be run with people who make money (and thus stay invested) than by people who aren't paid to keep consistent updates?
Overall, Tor is not encrypted, slower than your mom's AOL dial-up, and had numerous security issues over the years.
Myth#3 VPNs Are Not Safe for Torrenting
The article starts off by saying that some VPNs don't support torrents. Well, don't use these, or don't include them in your list?
Then the article cites an author saying that “there's no way for users to verify what VPN providers say,” Campbell said. “They must judge providers by reputation, relying on news reports, discussion in online forums, and so on.”
Actually, there is, you can check if your IP address is encrypted and changed. This means you can't be tracked down, and you are much better off than using an encrypted IP.
Also, saying something isn't “necessarily safe” is just misleading. Sure, no one said all VPNs are equal. But that doesn't mean there aren't good VPNs to use for torrenting. Again and again, it just seems like the author hasn't done enough testing and research, and is just blaming all VPNs for the problems of the few.
Myth #4 VPNs Don't Protect from Ads
So? Most don't claim to do so. You should always be using additional tools with a VPN to protect your online security. In fact, a lot of VPN websites have blog posts detailing supplemental security tools or some even design more like encrypted email.
Some VPNs like TorGuard, Spotflux, and even Cryptostorm now offer ad blocking and known malware blocking included in the VPN package.
A VPN is not an end-all security tool, and you shouldn't be thinking of them that way, but they are still an incredibly useful tool for masking one's IP address and encrypting all of your web traffic.
Myth #5 VPNs Put You At Risk
The main argument in this section is that using a bad VPN could put you at a security risk. That's like saying you shouldn't use virus protection since you might accidentally download a virus / malware.
With some research and careful consideration, using a VPN WILL never put you at risk.
Myth #6 VPNs are Not Secure
In this article, the author makes a particular point to mention how VPNs don't provide good security and are easily breached. He makes a large claim about IPsec vulnerabilities simply by quoting another researcher that failed to provide any proof of concept:
“If I know the preshared key for your [ipsec] VPN and I am somebody who has control of the Wi-Fi access point, and you're using a preshared key with a VPN I know, then I can basically man-in-the-middle attack and decrypt everything you're doing,” said White. “The security you get that kind of attacker when the preshared key is known is not very strong.” – Kenn White
First, if a hacker has full control of your Wifi router's access point then the IPsec preshared key is the least of your worries. It's probably too late for a VPN to protect you anyway.
In the seconds prior to VPN authentication any open applications that talk to the web could certainly be intercepted by an attacker, just by connecting to the wifi. Remember, you haven't even turned on the VPN yet.
Perhaps the best takeaway from this is when connecting to an unknown or compromised wifi AP you should first close any active web apps, and USE OPENVPN! Did we mention you should use OpenVPN only? Check out this article we made that lists the differences between the various protocol options available.
While this is a potential MITMA attack (man in the middle attack), the pre-shared key is used for authentication of the IPSec VPN–not the encryption/decryption process. So, Kenn's statement that he can “decrypt everything you're doing” is not exactly right.
Additionally, this type of attack is extremely difficult to pull off, even for the most seasoned attacker. So, let's say Kenn White was sitting outside your house in a white van and had gained FULL access to your internet gateway / wifi router. Assuming he had obtained necessary access to the router without breaking into your house, he would first have to spoof an IP address to authenticate the connection, which involves injecting fake BGP routes. This is something that is easier said than done – even for the most experienced hacker.
What the ArsTechnica article failed to point out is that most of the trusted VPN providers in business today, including TorGuard, ExpressVPN and PIA strictly use OpenVPN in all of their VPN software. So, as long as you are using the “stock” OpenVPN app that your provider gives you then this type of attack is completely useless.
Myth #7 All VPNs Use Weak Protocols
This point includes information that some VPNs use outdated protocols. That is true, but once again, the best VPNs use OpenVPN. We've reviewed VPNs that have bad protocol support, and ranked them accordingly.
But just because some offer these protocols, doesn't mean the provider is flawed or insecure. In fact, it's actually better when VPN providers support these protocols.These protocols can be useful in specific instances where security isn't top priority, like streaming Netflix, or gaming.
For example, TorGuard VPN, PIA, and ExpressVPN (our top rated VPN) exclusively use OpenVPN in their VPN software applications. This is highly regarded as the most secure VPN option available.
Just because PPTP and L2TP/IPSec is not as secure as OpenVPN does not make it completely useless. These options often require smaller resources and thus run faster on slower DSL lines. This can be very useful when streaming Netflix in a region that does not have fast cable internet access. While PPTP, L2TP, and socks5 proxies are not nearly as secure as OpenVPN encryption, they can be very useful for IP masking in certain situations. When running on your secure home wifi network this can be relatively safe.
Different levels of privacy call for various levels of operational security. Remember, not all VPN users are hiding from government agencies – some of them just want to download and stream last night's show as fast as possible.
Myth #8 All VPNs Keep Logs
This point of the article is that a lot of VPNs collect information, and that is true. A lot of VPNs do have bad log policies, and VPNs do require information to run their services–but that doesn't make them not worth using. Giving VPN companies a small amount of data to encrypt more of your data is a worthy sacrifice.
The VPNs we recommend have been vetted by the community and proven themselves as non-logging services.
This point in the article also mentions that VPNs can't necessarily protect you if you are criminal–especially depending on the location. That is true if you are a criminal doing high stakes crimes getting attention, and some law agency manages to track you down, you might get in trouble.
However, since good VPNs give out shared IP addresses, and don't log data, it's hard to isolate users. That, and a lot of good VPNs also don't let criminals use their accounts, whether due to fraud, or going against their TOS.
I wouldn't worry about this unless you are some terrorist or pedo.
Myth #9 All VPNs Leak Information
This part of the article focuses on some research that was done on top VPN providers in Google. Some of our best VPNs that we've ranked are actually on this list, and we can confirm that
TorGuard uses internal DNS, which is not possible to hijack, even if the research claims otherwise. TorGuard forces user's DNS requests through each VPN server connection to ensure it is not feasible for an attacker to hijack any DNS requests.
Also, TorGuard also was noted for being protected through IPv6 leaks. If anything, this research just proves that our site has done due diligence in ranking TorGuard as our top rated VPN.
Other VPNs on this list have had security problems in the past, and we've noted them, but the article does mention that they don't know if they've made improvements, but we've seen some–especially from ExpressVPN in the past few months.
Again, conducting research, testing VPNs, and understanding the technology can go a long way–picking the best VPN, or VPNs isn't easy, but it's possible.
Myth#10 All VPNs are Marketing Devils
This section is true to an extent, but again, just because there are so many bad VPNs out there, doesn't mean there aren't good ones.
The article says that if a VPN claims to offer everything, be suspicious, and rightfully so. We've tested a lot of VPNs that claim it all, but we've also tested some that do claim it all and have it all. It's not easy to do, and maintaining a VPN is a continuous process that some companies can't handle on every front.
The website attempts to put websites like us down since we are an affiliate of these sites, but we illustrate just as many examples as they do. We don't recommend Hola or VPNs that have poor policies and bad applications.
That's why our rating system exists! In fact, you'll find that in many of our reviews we explain that services claim to have it all–while we remain skeptical.
Why Best10VPN can help you choose a VPN:

Female victims are often the focus of initiatives against domestic abuse. But according to a 2010 report from the Centers for Disease Control, more than one in four men in the U.S. experience rape, physical violence and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime, and one in seven men experience severe physical violence from an intimate partner. Justin Nutt, founder of Acts of Random Kindness and survivor of domestic abuse, shared his story recently on HuffPost Live.
Nutt, who was was nearly a foot taller and 70 pounds heavier than his ex-wife, said he had a mentality of invincibility. "It was one of those things -- I was a man you know, I couldn't be abused," he explained to host Abby Huntsman.
"It escalated to a point where the police were called when she tried to stab me, after we had been out and she had done things in a bar with a guy, and [then said] that was my fault," Nutt said. "It took two years before I could really say it wasn't that I didn't love her well enough or I didn't try hard enough. It was a long time before I was able to say, 'yeah I was abused.'"
Part of the problem with admitting that he was abused, Nutt said, was that there is a stigma surrounding male domestic abuse victims.
"It's still one of those things where it's not the easiest thing to say, because you know I'm a guy, and I'm a redneck--I don't look like it in a suit but I am--and it's one of those things where, you know, guys are not abused. And that's a huge stereotype, I think, that needs to be broken down."

Well, it's official! Alien: Covenant, the Prometheus-sequel/Alien-prequel, has finished filming, allowing it to move into the post-production phase.
As part of the celebration, a photo of Katherine Waterston on set has been released and many are comparing her look to that of Sigourney Weaver's “Ellen Ripley”. I can kinda see where people are coming from as Ripley wore a sleeveless shirt at the end of both Alien and Aliens. Additionally, Ripley has more than a few times had a weapon slung across her chest.

Ridley Scott returns to the universe he created in ‘Alien' with ‘Alien: Covenant', the second chapter in a prequel trilogy that began with ‘Prometheus' — and connects directly to Scott's 1979 seminal work of science fiction. Bound for a remote planet on the far side of the galaxy, the crew of the colony ship Covenant discovers what they think is an uncharted paradise, but is actually a dark, dangerous world — whose sole inhabitant is the “synthetic” David (Michael Fassbender), survivor of the doomed Prometheus expedition.
Alien: Covenant will come to theaters on August 4th, 2017.

The shooting at the National War Memorial and Parliament building in Ottawa, Canada, Wednesday has led to considerable discussion of the country's gun laws — albeit, oddly enough, mostly in US publications rather than Canadian ones.
Canada's laws are meaningfully stricter than those in the US. To wit:
All gun owners have to be licensed, and all handguns and most semiautomatic weapons have to be registered.
Handguns can't be carried out of the home, either concealed or openly, except with a specific license, which is usually only given to people who need guns for work.
Licenses require training in gun safety and an extensive background check.
Guns have to be kept locked and unloaded.
Here's a more detailed rundown of how Canada and the US's gun control regimes differ. Much of the information on Canada comes from the Library of Congress's Tariq Ahmad, whose analysis is worth reading in full.
Legal v. illegal guns
Canada: Guns are classified into three categories:
Non-restricted: regular shotguns and rifles, and some military-style rifles and shotguns.
Prohibited: most handguns that either have a short (less than 105 milimeters) barrel or are 32 or 25 calibers, full automatic weapons, guns with sawed-off barrels, and certain military rifles like the AK-47.
Restricted: non-prohibited handguns, some semi-automatic rifles, and certain non-semi rifles as well.
All three kinds of guns can be purchased and owned legally (even "prohibited" ones) but the requirements for owning restricted and prohibited guns are much, much stricter, as elaborated in the licensing and carry sections to follow.
United States: Fully automatic weapons are legal, but only if made before 1986; as a result, manufacturing new automatic weapons for civilian use is effectively illegal. Purchasing automatic weapons requires "submitting fingerprints and photographs to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), going through an FBI criminal background check, and paying a $200 tax, among other requirements"; all automatic weapons must be registered with the ATF, which also generally does not allow interstate sales.
Owning semi-automatic and non-automatic guns is generally legal. Seven states and the District of Columbia ban assault weapons, eight and DC ban high-capacity magazines, California and DC ban 50 caliber rifles, and LA, Oakland, and San Francisco all ban "ultra-compact" handguns. DC formerly banned handguns before the Supreme Court ruled that ban unconstitutional, and a national assault weapons ban lapsed in 2004.
Gun licensing
Canada: All people need a license to own or buy firearms or ammunition. Those applying for a license to own a non-restricted firearm must pass a series of firearms safety tests, and those applying for licensing covering restricted or prohibited firearms must pass another set of tests as well. One must be 18 to get a license, though minors aged 12-17 can possess nonrestricted weapons if a licensed adult is responsible for them.
Generally, restricted and prohibited firearms cannot be carried either concealed or openly, absent a license usually issued when someone needs such weapons for their job. They must be kept in the home and cannot be transported outside it except under very specific circumstances, such as for target practice.
Prohibited weapons are generally only allowed if the person "had one registered in their name when it became prohibited, and they have continuously held a valid registration certificate for that type of prohibited firearm from December 1, 1998, onward" and can only be acquired if they are "in the same categories as the ones currently registered to them, and only if the firearms they wish to acquire were registered in Canada on December 1, 1998."
United States: You don't need a license to own any kind of gun in most states. Massachusetts and Illinois require all firearm owners to obtain a "license to own" their guns, while California, Connecticut, Hawaii, and New Jersey require all prospective gun owners to obtain "permits to purchase" before buying guns. Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Nebraska, North Carolina, and Rhode Island require permits to purchase handguns, and New York requires a license to own handguns. DC requires all guns to be registered, which functions as a licensing requirement.
California, Connecticut, DC, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island require safety training or testing for licensing, while Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, and North Carolina don't. Hawaii requires it for handgun applicants but not rifle or shotgun owners. States also vary in how many guns you're allowed to buy with a permit to purchase.
Registration
Canada: All restricted and prohibited firearms must be registered with Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Before 2012, all firearms had to be registered, but legislation from Stephen Harper's government got rid of the requirement for non-restricted weapons. Quebec is fighting to be able to preserve its own registry.
United States: Most states have no registration requirements for any type of gun. DC and Hawaii require the registration of all firearms, and New York requires the registration of handguns; DC's registration process involves extensive screening and background checks, so it doubles as a licensing process of sorts. California requires new residents to report their firearms, while Maryland requires new residents to report any handguns and assault weapons they own. Six states require the registration of assault weapons, assault pistols, and 50 caliber rifles that were grandfathered in before those states' bans. Meanwhile, eight states specifically ban the establishment of firearm registries.
Background checks
Canada: Applicants for gun licenses "must pass background checks which consider criminal, mental, addiction and domestic violence records." In addition to criminal checks, this involves establishing that they were not treated for a mental illness "associated with violence or threatened or attempted violence," or had a "history of behavior that includes violence or threatened or attempted violence on the part of the person against any person," within the past five years. Additionally, "third party character references for each gun license applicant are required."
United States: Federally licensed gun dealers have to conduct background checks, but that requirement has many holes in it. Reporting on criminal, mental health, drug, and domestic violence records is incomplete, and sales by unlicensed sellers don't require background checks.
21 states conduct their own background checks for at least some types of guns, which tend to be more thorough and have more data to draw upon. Seven states require background checks for all sales by unlicensed sellers, with another two requiring them for sales of handguns; eight states require permits for purchasers who buy from unlicensed sellers, at least for some guns, which function as a background check requirement for those purchases. Colorado, Connecticut, New York, and Oregon require background checks at gun shows as well; the former three simply require background checks regardless of purchase type.
Concealed carry
Canada: Restricted or prohibited firearms generally can't be carried either concealed or openly. In rare cases, one can get a permit "for use in connection with his or her lawful profession or occupation," such as for work in wilderness areas with dangerous wild animals, or in defending armored cars with cash. In very rare occasions they are issued for "protection of life," usually when there is a "an active police file and a verifiable threat as well as police confirmation that they cannot provide adequate protection for that person."
Since most concealed and open carrying involves handguns, and all handguns are either restricted or prohibited, this effectively outlaws most concealed carrying by most people.
United States: The federal government guarantees the right of qualified police officers, including retired ones, to carry concealed weapons. Four states allow people to carry concealed weapons without a permit, 37 require the issuance of permits to qualified people, and 9 give authorities wide discretion in deciding who to grant permits to. No state bans concealed carry entirely; DC's ban was struck down by a federal court. States vary on where specifically concealed carry is allowed, and some require applicants to give a reason for why they need to carry a concealed weapon.
Six states and DC ban open carry of guns in public, thirteen require a permit to do so, and 31 allow open carry without any license or permit at all.
Gun safety requirements
Canada: Non-restricted weapons must be stored with a trigger or cable lock or locked in a room, compartment, or container that is "difficult to break into." Restricted and prohibited weapons must be both trigger/cable locked and locked in a larger room or container, or else locked in a "vault, safe or room that was built or modified specifically to store firearms safely." For automatic weapons, any removable bolts must be removed. All guns must be unloaded when stored or transported, and put in a lockable compartment (if available) when left unattended in a car.
United States: Federal law requires licensed sellers to provide secure storage or safety devices with any handguns they sell or transfer. 11 states have additional requirements; Massachusetts is the only one to require that firearms always be kept locked. 28 states and DC have laws regulating children's access to firearms, ranging from ones merely banning adults from directly providing certain types of firearms to minors, to ones imposing criminal liability when a child "is likely to" or "may" gain access to a firearm because of negligent storage.
Stephen Hawking is a misogynist; and also, quite possibly, a narcissist. You wouldn't know it from watching The Theory Of Everything, the new biopic from Working Title, in which you are invited only to weep when he discovers he has motor neurone disease at 21, and then marvel at his achievements in physics. It goes wild on the obvious cognitive dissonance of Hawking's life and work — trapped in his body, yet transported in his mind to the stars.
I cried as Eddie Redmayne — as Hawking — falls, rises and is redeemed with medals too numerous to type; he is very good, but he only goes where the script allows him. But I do not like being manipulated by cinema, unless I know I am being manipulated; and Working Title is usually Steven Spielberg transported to the UK — all sudsy soap and sticky emotion. I am still angry that The Imitation Game, which was supposed to honour the mathematician Alan Turing, managed instead to call him a traitor. It stuck a Soviet spy in his hut, made him blackmail Turing, and he went along with it for fear of being outed as homosexual; less tribute than fiction.
So I read the book this film was based on. It is a memoir by Jane Wilde, Hawking's wife of 30 years, and it is called Travelling to Infinity. (‘Infinity', in this case, means ‘divorce'.) She wrote an earlier, angrier memoir, Music to Move the Stars; but this is now ‘revised'. Hawking too has written a memoir — My Brief History. This would never make a film, because it is too brief. It is almost an absence. So the film-makers turned to Jane for their story. They have used her shoddily.
Jane knew Hawking might not live long when they married in 1965. The original prognosis was two years. Even so, they made a home, they travelled to conferences abroad, they had three children. She abandoned her scholarly ambitions — the medieval lyric poetry of the Iberian peninsula, if you care, and he didn't — to support his. Her sacrifice deserves thanks, but no thanks came; when he became the youngest fellow of the Royal Society at 32, he made a speech, but he did not mention his wife. And why would he? She had become ‘chauffeur, nurse, valet, cup-bearer, and interpreter, as well as companion wife'; that common ghost that haunts university cities — ‘a physics widow'. (Jane notes that Albert Einstein's first wife, Mileva, named ‘physics' as the co-respondent in her divorce proceedings.) In Cambridge in the 1960s, she writes, ‘The role of a wife — and possibly a mother — was a one-way ticket to outer darkness.' The talents of the women around her had been ‘spurned by a system that refused to acknowledge that wives and mothers might be capable of an intellectual identity of their own'. This is the hinterland in which a disabled man became a master of the universe; and that is why I call Hawking a misogynist. He may be a talented, or even extraordinary, physicist, but he was a very ordinary husband of his own space and time. He repeatedly refused Jane's requests for more assistance caring for him. Would he have done more for her, if he could? I doubt it.
Eddie Redmayne stars as Stephen Hawking
Jane began to ‘lose her identity', although she tried not to. She continued her studies; she sang in a choir; she cared for their children. It was essential, she says, not to abandon them for their father, who used his oldest son, Robert, as nurse and helpmeet from the age of nine; she insists that they are a family and no person is more important than another, even if Hawking yearned for ‘a pedestal' and wanted her to travel everywhere with him, which she would not do, because she would not leave the children. Hawking resented this; why could he not be a king in his family, when strangers — especially after the publication of his bestseller A Brief History of Time in 1988 — were so adoring? Things became worse after he became world-famous, because people believed he had ‘beaten' motor neurone disease and the family lived without struggle. This denial extended to his own parents, who would not help Jane; any plea for assistance, she writes, was interpreted as ‘disloyalty'.
The cruellest thing was his refusal to discuss his illness. ‘It was,' she writes, ‘the very lack of communication that was hardest to bear.' He insisted on ‘a facade of normality'; yet if he could not acknowledge his own suffering — he ‘never' talked about the illness — how could he acknowledge hers? He was ‘a child possessed of a massive and fractious ego', surrounded by a growing entourage of acolytes. Husband and wife became ‘master' and ‘slave'. They famously fought about religion — he is an atheist, she is a Christian, but this feels like a proxy argument. It was the illness that had become ‘a barrier of anguish between us'.
Her revenge on her ‘master', the ‘all-powerful emperor', was typical of the voiceless, in that it was passive-aggressive and unanswerable; she fell in love with an organist called Jonathan Jones, and invited him, apparently with her husband's consent, to spend time with the family. (The relationship was, she insists, initially chaste; they are now married.) Hawking responded by further immersing himself in an entourage that worshipped him and reduced his family to ‘second-class' citizens. He left Jane in February 1990; the next day he telephoned to invite her to be photographed to publicise the film of A Brief History of Time. He married his chief acolyte, his nurse Elaine Mason; later he divorced her.
Stephen Hawking and his former wife Jane attends the premiere of ‘The Theory of Everything'
Early in her book, Jane says Hawking identified with the hero of Wagner's The Flying Dutchman, ‘cursed to roam the seas through storm and wind until he could find someone who would sacrifice herself for love of him'. And that was Jane Hawking's experience of marriage; except she didn't let herself drown. This is a story about disability and the wounds it cuts, although it is not the story you will see in The Theory of Everything.
I do not write to insult Professor Hawking. I wouldn't have written this article at all, but Hawking has endorsed The Theory of Everything, so he must like the portrait of himself that it presents — and torn from his own wife's furious memoir! To call the disabled saintly when they are not is as prejudiced as calling them sinful; and he of all people should know it. A genius Professor Hawking may be — what do I know of physics? — but he was, if you believe his wife, and I do — a very bad husband indeed.

Cannabis should be legalised – for medical use at least. I had a friend with MS who got great relief from muscle spasms by smoking grass – but she was forced to get her supply from a drug dealer.
I thought at the time it was a ­scandal that she should have to resort to an illegal source to get relief.
The first recorded use of cannabis was in ancient China. Queen Victoria's personal physician, Russell Reynolds, said in medical journal The Lancet in 1890: “Indian hemp, when pure and administered carefully, is one of the most valuable medicines we possess.”
Calls have come from UK politicians to reconsider the role of cannabis in society. Two recently told The British Medical Journal: “We have heard testimonies from patients… that cannabis has given them their life back.”
Plus, the international position on cannabis as a medicine has changed.
Many international agencies and governments are relaxing their ­prohibitionist position. Internationally, there's been an important shift away from prohibitionism, allowing cannabis to be used for both medical and recreational purposes.
There are many possible legal ­positions for cannabis ranging from complete prohibition to regulated legal supply in the same way as alcohol.
For strictly pharmaceutical use it could be licensed like any other ­medicine. Cannabis is now available for medical uses in 29 states in the US, while Canada, the Czech Republic and Israel take a progressive view.
Decriminalisation allows doctors to discuss the risks and benefits of use in much the same way as they might for any other medicine.
A report by the US National ­Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine sets out the social, legal and potential medical benefits of cannabis and its derivatives and makes several recommendations.
For the purposes of using cannabis as a medication these can be ­summarised as “do more research” and “change the law”.
The report stresses the need for “research grade cannabis products,” different enough from each other to look at individual psychoactive ­ingredients and their effects.
I believe the place of cannabis as a prohibited and purely harmful ­psychoactive substance should be questioned. Then there's plenty of evidence to support the kind of reform already occurring in US states and internationally.
The UK is lagging behind.
Doctors should be free to provide advice on the benefits and harms of medicinal cannabinoids.
Then cannabis should follow the standard regulatory route and be licensed as a medicine.
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Israel on Monday won an election to chair the United Nations' legal committee, the first time that it will head one of the world body's six permanent committees since joining the U.N. in 1949.

While it is a largely symbolic and procedural role, chairing the committee will give Israel a chance to have a higher profile in routine affairs at the United Nations.
The so-called Legal Committee, or Sixth Committee, oversees issues related to international law. The General Assembly has six standing committees that report to it, on: disarmament, economic and financial issues, human rights, decolonization, the U.N. budget, and legal issues.
“I am proud to be the first Israeli elected to this position,” Israel U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon said in a statement.
“Israel is a world leader in international law and in fighting terrorism,” he added. “We are pleased to have the opportunity to share our knowledge with the countries of the world.”
Israel was a candidate for the regional Western European and Others Group (WEOG) and received a comfortable majority of votes - 109 out of 175 valid votes cast in the 193-nation assembly. Sweden was runner-up with 10 votes.
Normally committee heads are elected by consensus without a vote. Opponents to the Israeli candidacy called for a vote, prompting a sharp reaction from the deputy U.S. ambassador to the U.N., David Pressman.
“Even a chair from (former leader Muammar) Gaddafi's Libya was elected by acclamation,” he said in a statement. “A vote should not have been called today.”
“We need a United Nations that includes Israel, that brings Israel closer, not one that systematically pushes Israel away,” he added.
Israel was originally part of the Asia-Pacific Group along with other Middle Eastern and Asian nations, the majority of which are cool or openly hostile toward the Israeli state. Its transfer to WEOG gave it a chance to get elected to leadership posts and play a more active role at the U.N.
The chief Palestinian delegate at the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, complained about the results of the election, saying Arab and Muslim countries had tried to prevent an Israeli victory.
Speaking to reporters, Mansour described Israel as “the biggest violator of international law” and predicted that Danon's election was “threatening the work of the Sixth Committee.”
He said the Arab League and 57 member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation had opposed Israel's election.
Everyone continues to be mum on David Fincher's Living On Video, which is yet to be acknowledged by HBO, but I've learned that the period comedy quietly has been picked up to series by the network. I had heard that the project filmed two episodes in lieu of a pilot, and the network has ordered 8 more for a 10-episode first-season run. HBO declined comment.
Set in 1983 Los Angeles, Living On Video revolves around the players of the then-exploding music video industry — directors, record executives and crew members, many of them dabbling in drugs — through the eyes of a newcomer, Robby (Charlie Rowe). Robby is a wide-eyed guy who drops out of college and drives to Hollywood with dreams of directing a sci-fi epic and lands a job as a PA for a company making music videos. Believed to be co-starring in the secret project are Sam Page, Jason Flemyng, Corbin Bernsen, Kerry Condon and Elizabeth Lail.
Fincher, who directed the first episodes, is revisiting his music video director roots with the comedy, written by Rich Wilkes (xXx) and Bob Stephenson, a friend of Fincher's from his music video days, based on an idea by Fincher.
Living On Video gives The Social Network and Gone Girl director Fincher a second on-air series. He is also executive produces and directed the first two episodes of Netflix drama House of Cards.
The Rangers had to wait a day to land this summer's biggest free agent, but it was likely worth the wait.
Center Brad Richards, a one-time Stanley Cup champion and Conn Smythe winner with 716 points in 772 career games, reportedly agreed to a nine-year, $60 million contract Saturday morning with the Rangers. Richards, 31, spent Friday listening to offers from the Toronto Maple Leafs, Calgary Flames and Los Angeles Kings, but he decided to sign a deal with the Rangers that will take him to the age of 40.
Richards and the Rangers seemed like a perfect match going all the way back to the trade deadline. The Rangers needed a No. 1 center who could run their first-unit power play, but choose not to acquire the 31-year-old from the Dallas Stars, instead adding defenseman Bryan McCabe from the Florida Panthers.
Richards said last week he wanted to play in a hockey market with a team that can contend for the Stanley Cup. Madison Square Garden is routinely sold out, and while the Yankees, Mets, Knicks, Jets and Giants might grab the back page of the tabloids more often, there's no doubting New York has some of the most passionate and loyal fans in hockey.
But are the Rangers a Stanley Cup contender? They are coming off a first-round loss to the Washington Capitals and a season where the Rangers finished 18th in the League in points with 93 points. There's no doubting the Rangers have a strong, young core with a lot of promise and the addition of Richards makes them better, but whether this move makes them contenders in the East remains to be seen.

• The then-business secretary allowed filmmaker Hannah Rothschild to shadow him for eight months leading up to May • Guardian has exclusive footage
A fly-on-the-wall documentary about Peter Mandelson, filmed in the dying days of the Labour government, is expected to cause a political sensation when it is screened later this month.
The Guardian has been given an exclusive preview of the film, which includes remarkably candid footage of sensitive meetings with Labour's high command as the election campaign unravelled, as well as private telephone calls with Gordon Brown and the editor of the Times, James Harding.
Mandelson allowed the filmmaker Hannah Rothschild – sister of financier Nathaniel Rothschild – to film his inner circle in the eight months leading up to the general election in May.
Mandelson ran into controversy in 2008 when he stayed in Corfu on the yacht of Russian aluminium tycoon Oleg Deripaska as a guest of Nathaniel Rothschild.
On the same holiday Mandelson was accused of dripping "pure poison" into George Osborne's ear about Brown.
Hannah Rothschild's access was unfettered: Mandelson is shown at home in his dressing gown, wrestling with his dog, Jack, and standing in his underpants in his office as he hurriedly tries to change into a tuxedo.
The documentary captures an acidic confrontation between Mandelson and Osborne, who is now the chancellor, and Labour's frenzied attempt to manage the fallout from Brown's unguarded comments about the Rochdale pensioner Gillian Duffy.
Several Downing Street aides and most of the cabinet make what seem to be unwitting appearances in the documentary, but only one senior Labour figure – Alastair Campbell – questions exactly what Rothschild was doing shadowing Mandelson with a camera.
Rothschild, who makes films about music and art, wrote to Mandelson in October last year asking if he would be the subject of an observational film. Although she had met Mandelson several times socially through her brother she was surprised when he told her to begin filming immediately.
"I would never have given such access to a political or current affairs documentary maker," Mandelson said last night. "I would not have trusted them to do it without their own spin or prejudice. Hannah came to it with an open mind."
He added: "I was busy all the time or in a rush or under pressure and after a while I forgot she was there."
Whether by accident or design, Mandelson allowed Rothschild to accumulate over 200 hours of revealing footage from the election campaign. Her film, Mandelson – The Real PM?, premiers at the London film festival this month and will be broadcast by the BBC in November.
The film, exclusive clips of which are being broadcast by the Guardian, is likely to ruffle feathers in the Westminster establishment.
The documentary opens with the then-business secretary in his ministerial car, speaking to an unidentified official over the phone. "How is the eye?" he asks, in an apparent reference to Brown's faulty eyesight. "Is he worried about going out with it?"
Mandelson is later shown speaking to the prime minister over the phone, reassuring him about his performance in the first televised debate. "There are certain adjustments you can make – tone, style or whatever – and all those can be programmed in," he tells the then prime minister.
Another scene likely to irk Brown reveals concern among his advisers about his unpopularity with the electorate. In one strategy meeting at which Brown was not present, David Muir, his director of political strategy, says the public sees the prime minister as "beaten up and lacking in confidence".
"We can't construct a campaign which on paper gives him definition – as a brand – if it actually saps his energy and saps his confidence," he said.
Mandelson replied that the public "don't like him terribly" and "certainly wouldn't like to go down the pub with him".
"He can have his braininess – he can be as brainy as he likes," Mandelson adds, "but what I also want him to be is sufficiently relaxed and approachable that people can conclude that he is a human being."
During another meeting – less than a month before election day – the senior Downing Street adviser Patrick Diamond confides in Mandelson that the party's manifesto spending plans "don't add up".
"Personally I think we are in a real mess over social care," Diamond said. "We've now discovered that we need £1.5bn to fund the next parliament, but we've discovered since a £3.8bn black hole in the funding for maintaining the current level of social care provision."
The film repeatedly shows Mandelson's famed ability at managing journalists, including a bruising encounter with Harding. Angry over a critical editorial in the newspaper, Mandelson calls the Times editor and rebukes him over the phone.
"I mean I thought it would be a brilliant idea if you actually heard what my views are, and my policies and my ideas, from me, before slamming me for what I don't think, and I'm not doing, for motives I don't possess," he told the editor.
Perhaps the most revealing insight into the modus operandi of the so-called Prince of Darkness comes from his encounters with Osborne, at that time shadow chancellor. The pair have had a fraught relationship since their 2008 encounter in Corfu.
In the film Mandelson is shown theatrically mocking Osborne in front of journalists in the "spin room" during the first televised debate.
Spotting the shadow chancellor in private conversation with the Daily Telegraph's deputy editor, Benedict Brogan, Mandelson shouts across the room: "Is he the only person you have to talk to, George? Come on – this isn't fair!"
In a more private moment after the third debate, the two men are seen sitting together waiting to be interviewed by the BBC. Osborne sarcastically asks: "When are we going to see your film, Peter? June? July?"
Speaking in almost a whisper, Mandelson replies: "I have decided to extend it. We're taking it to Corfu."

Congress returns to work today, and for the first time since the Affordable Care Act was signed, Republicans are in the majority. It's no secret that the GOP dislikes the law. In the nearly five years since the passage of President Obama's signature healthcare reform, House Republicans have voted to defund the law more than 50 times. This fall, GOP leaders Mitch McConnell and John Boehner renewed their commitment to repeal the ACA.
With Republicans calling the shots in Congress, could the ACA be in serious danger? Could legal challenges, including a pending Supreme Court case strip millions of coverage? To get answers, Transmission reached out to Michael Sparer, PhD, JD, chair of the Mailman School's department of Health Policy and Management, and longtime observer of the political and legal football around the law.
What is the Republican critique of the ACA?
The Republicans argue that the ACA represents too much government regulation of healthcare markets. They point to mandates that individuals must have health insurance and employers of a certain size must provide it, as well as regulation of the insurance industry and new taxes. These, they say, are an unwarranted intrusion into the private sector healthcare system.
Can the new Congress repeal the law?
The House of Representatives in very symbolic form has voted time after time to repeal the law. But the law is not in jeopardy in that sense, even with the new Congress. Republicans know that President Obama would veto any effort to fully repeal the law. Also, millions of people now benefiting from the law and many Republicans would be hesitant to pull the plug. These days, the most important challenges to the ACA are taking place in the courts and in the states.
What issues are now before the courts?
There are several, but probably the most important is a case being considered by the Supreme Court on the issue of subsidies. The background is that the ACA encourages states to create insurance exchanges so people can shop for low-cost private coverage. The law also provides federal subsidies to persons below a certain income who buy through the exchange. Turns out, however, that only 16 states decided to create such an exchange, which meant that the feds had to do so for the rest of the country. In the lawsuit I mentioned, the challengers argue that federal subsidies are available only to persons who buy through one of the 16 state-based exchanges. The government argues that the clear intent of the law is to provide subsidies to buyers in all of the exchanges, including the federal one.
Odds are the Supreme Court will agree with the latter interpretation. But it could go the other way since on this issue the ACA is poorly drafted. I was surprised by the Court's 2012 decision that struck down the requirement that all states expand their Medicaid program and I could be surprised again.
What happens if the subsidies for federal exchanges are struck down? Could the ACA survive?
Two-thirds of the states have federal exchanges and about 85 percent of people who buy insurance through these exchanges are eligible for subsides. If the Supreme Court rules against subsidies, it will be a major blow to the ACA. Millions of people might lose their health insurance because they lose their subsidies and will no longer be able to afford health insurance.
There would be a major scramble in a number of states to avoid the devastating implication of the decision. Politically, it's one thing to oppose the granting of a new benefit to a population. It's much more risky to have given people health insurance to people and then take it away.
The ACA is almost five years old now. Will the GOP ever move on?
As more people have gotten coverage, the fervor of the opposition to the ACA has receded. It will recede more over time. The longer a law is in place, the more entrenched it becomes, and the more difficult it will be to maintain strong opposition to it. Ten million people have health insurance now who didn't have it previously and that number will rise significantly in 2015. And that's a very good thing.

The Vermont Supreme Court ruled recently on a long-running noise dispute between the Town of Williston and the North Country Sportsman's Club in a decision the gun club characterized as a victory.
In a statement on Thursday, gun club President Bob Otty said the ruling affirmed state law protecting existing shooting ranges from "regulatory overreach" by municipalities. The town issued two citations to the gun club for noise ordinance violations in 2015, prompting the club to sue.
Otty said the Supreme Court ruled that a town cannot use noise "as a justification for other regulatory mechanisms." Otty also interprets the ruling to say a town cannot require a shooting range to enter into an agreement about operating hours.
Town Manager Rick McGuire said Thursday the ruling leaves the situation "a little murky."
"Right now we have an ordinance that still calls for a written agreement," McGuire said. "We're going to have to do some sort of modification to the ordinance. I don't know what that would look like."
RELATED:
Attorney Hans Heussy, who represents the gun club, agreed the June 2 Supreme Court ruling "could be clearer."
The club and the town had a written agreement specifying operating hours beginning in 2004, McGuire said, but the club let the agreement lapse about two years later because it was unhappy with requirements the town wanted concerning "special events" held on Saturdays.

The court said the town does not have the authority to "prohibit, reduce or limit" shooting at the range that falls within the club's historical use. The club has hosted skeet shooting for more than 50 years.
According to the ruling, the town can, however, "attempt" to apply its noise ordinance to shooting at the range that exceeds historical use, unless there's a "voluntary" agreement between the town and the club expanding hours of operation.
"We're happy," Heussy said. "We're going to operate as we see fit within the guidelines established by the Supreme Court going forward."
The court ruling cites a baseline for hours of operation established in 2006 as the definition of historical use. Heussy said that baseline is in the range of 15 to 25 hours per week of shooting on Wednesday and Sunday, plus an occasional special event on Saturday.
Heussy's interpretation of the Supreme Court ruling is that the club doesn't need a written agreement with the town as long as it doesn't do anything inconsistent with the 2006 baseline.
"We don't believe we have to restrict ourselves to anything but hours of shooting," he said. "If we want to have special events on Friday we can — as to what day they're on, that's our decision."
McGuire, the town manager, has a different take. McGuire said the club received an exclusion from the town's noise ordinance passed in 2004 as long as there was a written agreement between the two parties defining hours of operation.

He said the agreement specified hours for shooting on Wednesdays and Sundays, plus special events on Saturdays. What constituted a special event was never defined.
McGuire said around 2006 the gun club increased its activities, holding a special event every Saturday.
"I called the president and said, 'You know, we don't have a definition, but this doesn't feel like a special event to me, every single Saturday,'" McGuire said.
The gun club cut back after that, according to McGuire, but neighbors found out the written agreement had expired and complained to police in May 2015, leading to the citations that sparked the lawsuit.
Heussy said the gun club disputes McGuire's contention that its activity increased over historical norms.
"They don't feel terribly welcome in the town," Heussy said of the gun club.

“They're not made to put up with a full-grown adult going down a hill with rocks.” That's Matt Myrick talking, and he might be the winningest racer in a motor-sport you've probably never heard of: Extreme Barbie Jeep Racing. It started around 2008 as the “wheeling equivalent of Showtime After Dark.” Under the cover of night, people would ride Barbie's parts hard. Now, it's a regular sideshow—in the daylight—at various off-road events in Alabama and Arkansas, and it's popping up at other spots around the nation, too. Seems everyone's starting to do it Barbie-style.
The Carnage is the Struggle
Matt, who is also owner of Busted Knuckle Films (bustedknucklefilms.com), the purveyor of the videos from these events that will suck you in for hours, said his first time as a racer wasn't graceful—he mistakenly kept putting his feet on the ground to try and slow down on the steep hill—but he still managed to win.
Matt's worst crash came in 2014. “I got mostly to the bottom, and the steering wheel came off in my hands,” he says. “And then the tires turned on their own, and I started flipping forward a couple times.” But only bruises and scrapes have saddled him; he wears a full compression suit and helmet, similar to a downhill mountain biker. However, that does no good for the other hazards, such as the violent, vision-blinding shaking from no suspension travel and those hard, plastic tires slamming—and ripping off—on rough terrain and at speeds upward of 30 mph.
How It Works
Typically, two drivers race at the same time, and competitors are chosen a lot like how it went down in P.E. in grade school: People pick each other and fling smack talk.
The vehicle must be something you can sit in, and it must begin with a steering wheel and plastic tires. No model outperforms; Barbie Jeeps do as well as—or suck as badly as—John Deere Gators, and it's hit or miss with small versus full-size. Once someone even built a custom ride out of a 2×4 frame, but it was a fail on the course.
Races are single elimination. First to the bottom wins. The required steering wheel and plastic tires from the start, however, aren't necessarily needed at the finish line. A good chunk of the vehicle must remain intact—but that can still mean you're on
foot.
Unlike sanctioned motorsports, there aren't a bunch of rules. In fact, not all ORV parks allow it because it's considered dangerous and rife with insurance issues. It differs from sanctioned motorsports in another big way: It's cheap. “There's no barrier to this racing,” Matt says. “If you want to do any kind of motorsports racing, it's crazy expensive. But here, you just pick up one of these things on the side of the road for free or for $10 at a yard sale, then take the motor out so it will free spin, get a helmet, and you're ready to go.”
About 20 racers (ages 15 to 40) and 150 spectators is normal.
Tell 'Em What They've Won
The rewards for Barbie racing aren't exactly lucrative. Matt's in it for the adrenaline, which is obvious when you learn his first win netted him $10 and a fast-food gift card, plus whatever else the participants had in their pockets. But a more recent win scored him a brand-name cooler. Your results may vary.
RISKY BUSINESS
Participants race two at a time and must wear helmets, but no other safety gear is required. Brakes? Ha, no. That's what feet are for.

Our life has been wildly full the last couple of years. And while in many senses I thrive on having lots to do, I also don't enjoy being busy to the point of feeling frazzled and totally stressed out. Because when I become too busy, I start losing that sense of peace and joy that is key to helping me live life well. And then I start feeling irritable, edgy and grumpy, which obviously makes it hard to be a good wife and mom!
I'm still learning how to not get totally overwhelmed during the busy seasons of life, but I've gradually learned a few things that have definitely helped me stay more calm even when life is wildly busy!
6 Tips to Keep Your Sanity when You Feel Overwhelmed
1. Realize You Can't Do It All
No one can do it all. No one. We sometimes like to think we can and it's easy to look at other and think that they are, but trust me: it's simply not true! Getting this basic truth settled deep down in the soul of your being is so key to staying sane during busy seasons of life.
2. Know Your Priorities
I used to feel like I should go to every event that I was invited to and say yes to any request that was asked of me. But doing that pretty much guarantees that you're going to live feeling continually stressed out- at least if you are in a busy season of life.
Once I took some time to figure out what my priorities are right now, it really freed me up to have a better of idea of what I should focus on doing. It doesn't always totally solve the dilemma of what I should do, but it has helped immensely.
Need help figuring out what your priorities should be? Here are several great resources!
* How to Set Your Priorities
* Intentional Living- Setting Priorites
3. Figure Out What Makes You Feel Successful
What are the top two things that make you feel like you had a successful day if they get accomplished? What absolutely drives you nuts if it doesn't get done? Make those things a priority every day. That way, if you feel like you did nothing else, you'll still be able to feel some measure of success!
For instance, I like to do my laundry throughout the week. So, getting at least one load of laundry done each day is a relatively easy way to make me feel like I accomplished something! I have also discovered that if I do the simple thing of making my bed, I immediately feel more at peace because that one easy task makes our bedroom look more neat and tidy.
4. Learn to Say No
This is often a hard one, but if you want to stay sane in our fast paced world, learning to say no to requests that you simply don't have the time or energy to do is a must. And remember what I said about priorities? Well, knowing what yours are, makes saying no a lot easier!
There's a good chance that some people won't understand why you need to cut things from your schedule and say no. That's okay! Prepare yourself for their questions and be gracious when answering them. At the same time, you're going to probably need to accept the fact that you'll likely frequently be misunderstood. For myself, it is helps if I can remember that while I'm responsible to care for those around me and engage in their lives, I'm ultimately more responsible to care for the needs of my own family. So, if I'm saying no to a request because it means that I'll be able to be a happier, more engaged mom and wife, then it helps me be okay with any criticism that I receive.
I feel like I should clarify that I'm not advocating that you never sacrifice or never give of yourself in ways that stretch you and make you feel uncomfortable. Because there are plenty of times where that is good and necessary! (Things like taking a meal to someone who experienced a tragedy, babysitting last minute for a friend who discovers she has a doctor appointment she totally forgot about, etc.) Rather, I'm talking about times where you find yourself continually saying yes to things out of guilt or because you feel like you should do them, even though you know it's going to make you feel stressed in unhealthy ways.
5. Be Okay with Imperfection
Simply letting things go a bit, can be so freeing! My husband sometimes jokes with me that the world isn't going to end if a certain thing doesn't get done. And that is so true! Life will go on, and sometimes we need to intentionally relax about things in order to keep from being overwhelmed and stressed.
As a bit of a perfectionist, learning to be okay with imperfection hasn't been easy for me. I'm someone who loves having a clean house and I immediately feel more restful when things are cleaned up. But I'm slowly discovering that it's okay if my house doesn't get cleaned thoroughly every week. A quick round with the duster and vacuum will still make things feel less dirty on those weeks that I simply don't have time to do a better job. And as much as I hate waking up to dishes in the sink, I've learned that sometimes it's more important to spend quality time with my family or get a decent night's sleep instead of getting that pile of dishes washed up. Because, really, life truly will go on.
6. Pray
Turning to God always has a calming affect on me. And the neat thing about praying is that you can do it anytime, anywhere!

The build-up of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere may worsen western droughts in the future, but it is not the principal driver of historic drought afflicting the entire state of California right now, says a major NOAA report released today.
“Natural oceanic and atmospheric patterns” are to blame for the drought, the 42-page report says. Specifically, it highlights a persistent area of high pressure off the West Coast that has blocked rain-bearing storms from coming ashore – which some have dubbed the “ridiculously resilient ridge.”
The pattern of sea surface temperatures also contributed to the drought, the study says.
The NOAA-sponsored study was developed by eight authors from NOAA, NASA, Columbia University, and the International Research Institute for Climate and Society. It comprehensively examines the drivers of rainy season (November-April) precipitation during the previous three years (2011-2012 to 2013-14). The study compares observations with a large set of model simulations to detect the relevant natural and manmade contributions to the drought.
The drought was likely set off by La Nina – a pattern of cooler than normal ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific – which has historically been linked to reduced precipitation in the West, the study says. But even after the La Nina broke down, a pattern of warm ocean temperatures in the western Pacific set up a storm track that arched northeastward through the Pacific, away from the Golden State.
This series of atmospheric and ocean events led to three straight very dry years, though the study stressed the lack of rain and snow was not uncommon.
“Multi-year droughts appear regularly in the state's climate record, and it's a safe bet that a similar event will happen again,” said Richard Seager, report lead author and a professor at Columbia.
The report comes on the heels of an independent study published last week by the American Geophysical Union (AGU) that found the California drought was unprecedented in the last 1,200 years. Despite an apparent contradiction between this study and the NOAA report – which concludes the drought is not outside the range of recent climate variability – the authors of the AGU study insist the results are complementary.
Related: Study: California drought is the most severe in at least 1,200 years
The AGU study authors, Daniel Griffin (of the University of Minnesota) and Kevin Anchukaitis (of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute), explained the apparent difference in the study's conclusions about how unusual the drought was reflects differences in how drought was defined and in the areas analyzed (the NOAA study examined all of California, whereas the AGU study examined just central and southern California).
“I want to emphasize that I think the [NOAA report] is really important and is moving our understanding forward,” said Anchukaitis.
Kevin Trenberth, a researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, praised some of the modeling techniques employed in the NOAA report but found the results unsurprising and incomplete.
“I would contend that all droughts are largely natural in the sense that they arise from internal variability in the atmosphere-ocean systems,” Trenberth said. “But this study completely fails to consider what climate change is doing to water in California.”
He continued: “[The report] completely misses any discussion of evapotranspiration and the increased drying associated with global warming. In a drought, where there is an absence of precipitation, it is easily demonstrated that the extra heat from global warming – the increasing heating from increased greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide – enhances drying, increases risk of heat waves, and greatly increases risk of wild fire to a significant degree.”
Supporting Trenberth's claim, the previously-mentioned AGU study found record warm temperatures intensified the California drought substantially.
“One simple modeling exercise in our study indicates that the record high temperatures could have exacerbated the 2012-2014 drought by approximately 36 percent,” said Griffin. But Griffin's co-author Anchukaitis emphasized their study did not evaluate whether the record warmth was linked to the build-up of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere.
While dismissing much of a role for global warming in the present, NOAA's report does indicate rising temperatures may worsen future California droughts.
“Future California hydroclimate may … experience a reduction in surface moisture as a projected increase in evapotranspiration is larger than the projected increase in precipitation,” the report says.
Chosen destroyer of America
June 12, 2014
By Laurie Roth America and her future are at a critical crossroads in history. Will we lead, achieve, and serve or be pressed into the ash heap of fallen empires – Rome, Greece, Persia, USA. It kind of has a ring to it – kind of like a fossil "rat pack" of fame and power gone wrong.What is Obama's dream? Transform the U.S. to what?Obama doesn't have a dream to destroy America and make her disappear, but rather to enslave, control, and manipulate the people and all our assets. All those who resist his agenda will be destroyed. His stated views written and spoken for his whole "fake out" career have been to be the leader of an international movement and control the entire world with international laws.Step one is to seize and redistribute all wealth, make America a mass of amorality, and crush real morality inspired by the God of the Holy Bible. Obama is a radical Communist/Islamist and has always hated what the real America represents. Christians, conservatives, and patriots must go, so must her spirit and real history of greatness.Obama intends to make this transformation happen through clear and thought-out methodology. He has never just had a dream or philosophy he operates from, but detailed plans and international Islamic support. He has always mysteriously had billions of dollars in backing. It is most clear that Obama, from birth, was the chosen destroyer of America. Believe what you want, but the large sea of facts support this, from the massive millions spent to hide all Obama's documents – falsifying his birth records, use of false social security cards, and hiding college records. Think about it a second. Have you ever heard of any U.S. president ever spending millions to hide every detail of his life from the people?We see Obama organizing and enforcing a tectonic shift through the Islamic lead caliphate, with the goal of controlling the entire world one day. We have watched Obama side with Islamic dictator after dictator – exposing again and again his real faith in Allah and Muhammad, not the Holy Bible and Jesus Christ. Think of the endless amount of corrupt and criminal dictators and terrorist groups he has boldly backed – Zelaya, Morsi, giving aid, and comfort to the Taliban, employing Muslim Brotherhood members through out his staff on and on it goes. He always sides against the Christians and Jews and for Islamic radicals.Scandals of destruction and corruption collect around Obama like snowflakes in a snowstorm. Now, we get to wade through his complete violation and betrayal of our vets with the Veterans Administration horror show and his illegal exchange of five top ranking Taliban commanders for a known Islamic radical and deserter. Naturally, Obama committed another crime by bypassing Congress and not giving them 30 days to respond. Now, we shall see if Congress has already been bought and paid for or will stand for the law and the people. This latest crime of Obama is serious enough that if Congress will act, Obama could be facing huge prison time.So, what is it to be, people...tyranny and control or freedom and achievement? Obama has already decided, but what will Congress, the 2014 and 2016 elections, and the people decide?Join me each day on my national radio show from 7-10 pm PAC at www.therothshow.com © Laurie Roth
Cameroon's military is heavily deployed in the country's English-speaking regions and few people are on the streets after 17 people were killed over the weekend in protests in support of independence for some Anglophone regions.
Tens of thousands of English-speaking Cameroonians hoisted flags Sunday to show they want independence from the country's French-speaking majority, defying security forces and bans for gathering in some areas.
Security forces shot dead 17 people in Cameroon during gatherings on the 56th anniversary of the incorporation of Anglophone regions into Cameroon, according to Amnesty International. The group expressed worry over the government's "ongoing campaign to silence any form of dissent." The Northwest province on Friday banned meetings and travel for 72 hours.
The rights group called on security forces to cease unnecessary violence and called on protesters to be peaceful.
"The worrying escalation witnessed over the weekend has now reached a crisis point. The use of excessive force to silence protests in the west and southwest regions of Cameroon are not the solution," said Ilaria Allegrozzi, Amnesty International's Lake Chad researcher. "All deaths related to these protests must be promptly and effectively investigated."
Local media had reported at least a dozen people killed in the English-speaking northwest and southwest regions, some shot by military helicopters, while at least 40 others were arrested, according to local media. Six soldiers were attacked and severely wounded, reports said.
No declarations were made by separatists, but protests have been ongoing since late last year with the country's English-speaking population saying it is discriminated against by the majority French-speaking population.
Social media platforms such as WhatsApp have been blocked in the English-speaking regions and residents express fear about restrictions imposed by the government.
In Yaounde and all major towns in the French-speaking regions, political parties, lawmakers and the government organized rallies denouncing the separatist groups.
Lawmaker Tabe Tando from Cameroon's English-speaking southwest region read a declaration at a mass rally organized by Cameroon's senate and national assembly in Yaounde.
"The members of parliament condemn outright any action aimed at destabilizing our beloved and beautiful country. Reaffirm their attachment to a Cameroon which is one and indivisible as enshrined in the constitution. Express their brotherly solidarity to the populations of the northwest and southwest regions, victims of the unscrupulous acts of enemies of the fatherland and peace," it said.
Some experts called for dialogue to avoid ongoing tensions.
Schools have been closed in the northwest and southwest since November when lawyers and teachers called for a strike to stop what they believe is the overuse of the French language. Violence erupted when separatists joined in and started asking for complete independence.
President Paul Biya has made clear he is not open for any negotiations on separate states.
CUERNAVACA
A dos años de ser presentada una denuncia por abuso sexual en contra de un menor de 12 años, la Fiscalía General del Estado de Morelos, a través de agentes de la Policía de Investigación Criminal adscritos a la Fiscalía Regional Metropolitana, ejecutó una orden de aprehensión en contra del sacerdote Omar "N" por el delito de violación.
En marzo de 2014, el menor, de quien se omitió el nombre, intentó suicidarse al colgarse de una soga; pero la rápida reacción de sus familiares evitó que muriera por asfixia, además de que al ser trasladado al Hospital General de Cuautla, se le estabilizó.
Consternados por el proceder del menor, sus padres y familiares trataron de averiguar los motivos que lo llevaron a pensar en quitarse la vida. Según declaración del progenitor de la víctima:
Se platicó con él… temeroso confesó (el abuso sexual que sufrió) a sus tías, (dijo) que se había quedado callado porque no le iban a creer… el pequeño confesó que el sacerdote Omar “N” lo había violado”.
Procedieron a levantar una denuncia, por la cual se inició la Carpeta de Investigación JA/UIDD-A/357/2014. En ella se estableció que en marzo del 2009, el imputado convocó a sus feligreses al aseo de la Iglesia de Tepalcingo, ya que se aproximaba la fiesta del pueblo. Alrededor de las ocho de la noche de ese día, el padre Omar llevó al menor al área del coro, donde lo golpeó y abusó sexualmente de él, para luego amenazarlo para que no denunciara los hechos.
LA INVESTIGACIÓN POR VIOLACIÓN
El comunicado de la Fiscalía General del Estado de Morelos detalló el proceso sobre la causa penal 007/2015; se indicó que el aseguramiento del imputado se dio en la colonia San Gaspar, municipio de Jiutepec, en atención al mandamiento del juez mixto de primera instancia del VII Distrito Judicial.
Agentes de la Policía de Investigación Criminal adscritos a la Fiscalía Regional Metropolitana cumplimentaron la orden de aprehensión luego de dos años de pesquisas.
TAMBIÉN LO EVIDENCIAN POR ROBO
En otro orden, vecinos de Tepalcingo acusaron al cura Omar “N” de robo de arte sacro, por el faltante de una pieza valuada en varios millones de pesos, sin que hasta el momento el Obispo de Cuernavaca, Ramón Castro Castro, ni ninguna otra autoridad judicial haya procedido en su contra.
La Parroquía de Señor de Tepalcingo es señalada por ser una de las más importantes del país, ya que en las fiestas patronales recibe a poco más de dos millones de feligreses, quienes acuden en procesión procedentes de Puebla, el Estado de México, Oaxaca y Guerrero.
