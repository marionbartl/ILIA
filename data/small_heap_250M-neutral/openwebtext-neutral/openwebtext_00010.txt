Police arrested 22 men during a five-day effort known as “Operation Undertow.” (Pensacola Police Department)
The men come from any number of backgrounds and range from young to old.
In the end, Pensacola police said, they were united by a common goal: having sex with minors.
During a five-day stretch that ended Sunday, all 22 of the men — including a pastor from a Florida church — were dragged down by “Operation Undertow,” an Internet sting in which undercover agents lured suspected child predators via computer to an undisclosed Florida location, police said.
The men were snagged after they responded to ads for sex with teenage males and females created by agents on “various websites,” police said. Once the men initiated conversations with investigators, police said, warrants were issued for their arrest.
When the suspects showed up at the designated location, they were taken into custody and charged with traveling to meet after using a computer to lure a child.
Police called the effort “the largest multi-jurisdictional Internet sting” since the department arrested 25 men during a one-week-long sting in 2011.
“It is through the collaborating, partnering and building relationships that we protect our children and make the Internet a safer place,” Pensacola Police Chief David Alexander III said in a statement. “This effort of arresting and prosecuting these individuals helps to stop future abuse. This was five days of hard work for our officers, dispatchers, support personnel and personnel from other agencies, in addition to the planning of this operation.”

The men who showed up at the home brought with them drugs, sex toys and plans for illegal activity, police said. Four of the men arrested traveled from nearby Alabama, police said. The youngest suspect is 18 and the oldest — Alfred Foster of Mobile, Ala. — is 71.
Police said Calvin James Pearson, 31, and David Oloms, 24, both of Pensacola, arrived together to have sex with a 14-year-old girl, according to NBC affiliate WXIA.

When investigators searched Oloms's vehicle, they found “a luggage bag full of various sex equipment, bondage and sadomasochistic equipment,” the station reported, citing arrest records.
Police said Bradly Davis Jones, 46, showed up at the residence with methamphetamine and a glass smoking pipe, WXIA reported.
“I'm the only one who could potentially do anything illegal, but I'm not ashamed of anything I do, and I'm willing to suffer any consequences I deserve,” they wrote to undercover investigators while they arranged their visit.
Their alleged intention: To have sex with a 14-year-old girl.
Also arrested was David Donald Hoppenjan, 52, who has served as senior pastor at the First United Methodist Church of Pace, just outside Pensacola, since last year.
Police said Hoppenjan traveled to two locations in an effort to have sex with a 14-year-old boy.
Hoppenjan spent nine years as executive pastor at Shalimar United Methodist Church in Florida, according to AL.com. They also served as the youth pastor at Wetumpka First United Methodist Church in Alabama, AL.com reported.
The pastor's biography has been scrubbed from the church's website, but screen shots of their profile reveal that Hoppenjan has five children, grew up in Wisconsin and has a degree in agriculture education with an emphasis on business.
“As a second-career pastor, I received my call to ministry in my mid-30s,” they said in their church bio. “At that time, we moved from Wetumpka, Ala., to Wilmore, Ky., where I graduated from Asbury Theological Seminary in May 2006. I have served as executive pastor at Shalimar UMC since January of 2006.
“Recently, I returned from Panajachel, Guatemala, where I worked with the ministry of Porch de'Salomon. … This trip reinforced my heart for missions and outreach and my desire to support the work of missions from outside our back door to all around the world. While in Shalimar, I was involved in YMCA, Covenant Hospice, Children in Crisis, Habitat for Humanity, as well as local schools as a parent, a volunteer and a church member helping out in any way possible.”

The Alabama-West Florida Conference of the United Methodist Church confirmed that Hoppenjan no longer works at First United Methodist Church.
“As a church, we take any allegation of clergy misconduct very seriously,” the Alabama-West Florida Conference said in a written statement. “The United Methodist Church requires clergy to live by the highest ethical and moral standards. Conduct that violates these standards is a very serious matter and is not tolerated.”
“The safety of all children in our communities is a priority,” the statement added. “This is a painful and difficult situation for members of the congregation that (Hoppenjan) served and we will keep all of those affected in our prayers.”
Authorities said the Pensacola sting involved four sheriff's offices, six police departments and multiple state and federal agencies — a collaborative effort that Pensacola Mayor Ashton Hayward said “demonstrates the cooperative spirit needed to keep our children safe.
“As a father, I am at ease knowing our law enforcement personnel are successful in dealing with this issue.”
In announcing the results of the sting, the Pensacola Police Department said on Facebook: “This post will not be entertaining. It will not be funny, humorous, or elicit a slight chuckle. This post will not be the one you read to your spouse on the couch tonight. This post will concern you, trouble you, and make you ask, ‘What is wrong with this world?'”
The department added: “These people are out there. You need to watch your kids. Monitor their online behavior. You need to snoop. Be the Parent.”
In May, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said 32 men and women were arrested in an undercover operation — among them, two church pastors who responded to online ads for what they thought were for girls under the age of 18.
A similar series of stings in Florida's Polk County — where undercover detectives lure suspected child predators to an undisclosed location using fictitious online ads — has become well-known for netting suspects who work at Disney World, Sea World and other theme parks.
“You would think that these child predators would learn the risk they are taking, but they don't,” Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd told The Washington Post earlier this year, after announcing the results of another undercover operation. “They're so fixated on these children, they simply throw caution to the wind, and then we go round up another group of them. They can't resist taking the chance, and I can't resist arresting these freaks.”
[A student's chilling photos put sexual assault in focus]
Sting operations have migrated from chat rooms to apps and social media, places where young people socialize and predators can establish contact, Judd said. What they're looking for, the Florida sheriff said, is vulnerability.
“They used to have to hang out in parks and coach Little League or teach Sunday school in the past,” Judd said in April. “Now they can download an app and look for kids that are in need of attention — boys and girls. When a 60-year-old man wants to have sex with a 10-year-old child, those are the most dangerous of the dangerous.”
Judd recounted how a undercover officer — posing as a 14-year-old girl on spring break — posted a photo of a beach chair on a beach and said they had “nothing to do.” Within minutes, Judd said, eight different “freaks” had posted photos of their “body parts” on the app.
With dozens of men being arrested during each operation, and officials in other jurisdictions seeing similar results, an obvious question arises: Do the undercover investigations deter would-be predators?
Judd said the answer is yes. They said their operations are netting fewer predators now than they did five years ago. Back then, they estimated, authorities would arrest “40 or 50″ suspected predators during a week-long investigation. Their April sting netted 18, including a football coach from a Christian academy.
“There's just not that many people relative to the general population that are that disturbed and deviant,” they said. “I believe there is a bottom to this barrel. Having said that, they are so focused on finding children.”

Reddit user whatanasssss just discovered that their husband is a vile Internet troll who spends their spare time harassing teenagers on Tumblr. But it gets worse. She's pregnant. Yes, in a few short months, the chronic harasser of women that she's married to will become the father of a baby girl. In their disbelief, whatanasssss posted their experience to r/relationships:
[My husband] left the browser open on our laptop after they went to work this morning… I was disgusted at what I found. My husband is a troll. A really fucking nasty troll. They leaf horribly mean comments to all kinds of people. They're filled with racist slurs, awful insults… I was horrified. Completely horrified. My husband is a nice, gentle man who is supportive and kind. In our 9-year relationship, we've fought three times total. I never thought this is a behavior they would take part in.
This woman's story is horrifying but their situation is by no means uncommon. Unless there's a secret army of robot bigots out there who have outsmarted every CAPTCHA in existence, it's pretty clear that Internet harassment comes from actual human men. Yes, cruel online messages are typically typed by fingers which are attached to human arms which are, in turn, attached to the human men that we all, unfortunately, must interact with at some point in our lives.
And they're not all Mountain Dew-guzzling teenage boys with a budding “nice guy” complex, either. They're the men that you work with, the men that you're friends with, the men you're related to and, yes, maybe even the man whose baby you are carrying. They know how to tie a tie and file an income tax return and that makes them even scarier.
So if this Reddit user's experience has you rattled, you might want to double-check that the man you swap gametes with one day knows how to behave themselves online. That's why I've prepared a quiz for you comprised of five questions that you can ask the man in your life in order to determine the likelihood that they are an Internet troll. I can personally guarantee that this quiz is accurate with absolutely no margin of error, so if your man fails, then #DTMFA and move on.
If you think your boyfriend might be an Internet troll, ask him:
1) “What do you think of Seth MacFarlane?”
Start here. This is the troll-determining equivalent of the “Is it bigger than a breadbox?” question in Twenty Questions. It will quickly allow you to eliminate a wide range of possibilities in one fell swoop. The MacFarlane Query, as I call it, will help you understand what kind of man you're dealing with and whether or not further inquiries are necessary.
Why Seth MacFarlane? Because Seth MacFarlane is what would happen if you gave your teenage brother $150 million and their own TV show. Their brainchild Family Guy is the prize pony of so-called Equal Opportunity Offenders, people who justify being an asshole to minority groups because they are assholes to all of them. That mindset is presumably how MacFarlane convinced themselves to squander their one shot at the Oscar-hosting gig by performing a musical number about the breasts of every actor in the audience.
If your man responds to this question with a blistering critique of MacFarlane's politics, you're in the clear. If they light up and shows you their Family Guy box set, you should be worried. Your man has probably been mean to at least one woman on the Internet at some point in their life.
2) “Have you ever heard of Anita Sarkeesian?”
This question is particularly useful if your man is a video gamer and, if your man plays video games, your troll-dar should already be set to high alert anyway. On the Venn Diagram of the Internet, the intersection of trolls and male gamers is a particularly bustling one and there's no one that male video gamers hate more than Anita Sarkeesian.
Ms. Sarkeesian is a feminist media critic who produces a YouTube web series called Feminist Frequency. In 2012, they successfully crowdfunded a series of videos called Tropes vs. Women in which they critique the representation of women in video games. But this crowdfunding campaign also made them into a lightning rod for Internet trolls. (If you want to see a sample of the sort of people that harass her, you can read this blog post but, be warned, you'll see every slur under the sun.)
So if your man is a gamer and you're worried they might be a troll, try casually dropping their name. Do they instantly begin to foam at the mouth? I'm sorry, but you're married to a troll. Do they look unusually agitated as they give you a completely unsolicited twenty-minute long lecture about the harmful objectification of men? He's probably a troll. Back away slowly. Do they recognize the name and say something that sounds feminist or, at the least, empathetic? You're in the clear. Go ahead and make a baby with him.
3) “Which amendment in the Bill of Rights do you think is the most important?”
This is a fun question that every couple should ask each other just to build intimacy and to prepare to compete on game shows in the constitutional originalist dystopian future of my nightmares. Here's a legend for their potential responses to let you know what they might mean in terms of their potential for trolldom:
Tenth: Your man is passionate about states' rights. Racists and homophobes love states' rights. Be afraid.
Ninth: Your man picked the foundation for Roe v. Wade. Good egg!
Eighth: No “cruel and unusual punishment” for your guy! It's unlikely that he'd be cruel to strangers.
Seventh, Sixth, Fifth, or Fourth: He's really into criminal justice but probably not a troll. Breathe a sigh of relief.
Third: If they pick an amendment this useless, you should just dump them anyway even if he's not a troll.
Second: Run. Seriously, just run! Your man might not be an asshole to people on the Internet because he's too busy being an open-carrying asshole in real life.
First: This could be a huge warning sign. Trolls cite the First Amendment as frequently as college application essays cite “The Road Not Taken.” They think that it gives them the right to verbally harass, stalk, and threaten whomever they want without any consequences. If your man picks the First Amendment, just ask them to explain what it means. If they think it means that “it's a free country” and “people can say whatever they want,” tell them to go back to the playground they learned their politics from and find a new boyfriend.
4) “Can I borrow your laptop really quick?”
Ask them this question when he's in the middle of using it. And then count how long it takes for them to get their computer into a state where he's comfortable handing it over to you. If they pass it over immediately with their email and social media accounts still open, you're likely to be in the clear. This is a man with nothing to hide.
If they spend thirty seconds meticulously logging out of their email and social media accounts before handing it to you, there might be something going on with them and trolling is definitely on the table. It's 2014, after all. Men don't just cheat on you and watch too much porn anymore. They also obsessively track down and harass people who are different from them in order to feel the fleeting sense of control and superiority that defines their particular version of masculinity.
5) “Do you harass people on the Internet?”
I've saved the direct approach for last. If the indirect questions above are eliciting ambiguous responses, you might just want to raise the topic of Internet harassment in a more straightforward way. They might be offended that you're asking them this question, but we've all just learned from Reddit that it's best to be certain before you tie the knot and make a baby.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three longtime banks for private equity firm KKR & Co LP (KKR.N) have snubbed a request for a $725 million buyout loan over concerns it is too risky to pass muster with U.S. regulators, sources familiar with the situation said on Thursday.

The banks had funded a similar deal six months earlier.
The Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp jointly issued guidelines in March 2013 that require banks to cut down on junk-rated loans that would raise the debt levels of a company beyond certain thresholds.
Last month, regulators launched an annual examination of banks' loan books, known as Shared National Credit reviews, and stepped up enforcement of the guidelines. The reviews will likely determine to what extent banks can make exceptions to the guidelines, which have been criticized by many leveraged finance professionals as ambiguous.
In December, Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.VX and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) were among banks that helped finance KKR's $1.6 billion leveraged buyout of landscaping company Brickman Group Ltd. Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse had the lead roles in that deal.
At the time, Moody's Investors Service pegged Brickman's leverage at 6.8 times its annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Under the regulatory guidelines, leverage in excess of six times EBITDA raises concerns for most industries.
Now, the three banks have refused to bankroll a bid by KKR-owned Brickman to buy rival landscaping company ValleyCrest Companies LLC, as they seek to cut back on making new loans that do not comply with the leveraged lending guidelines, the sources said. Dell Inc DELL.O founder Michael Dell's investment firm owns ValleyCrest.
It is unusual for banks that lead the financing of a leveraged buyout of a company not to be tapped for smaller follow-on financings.
Jefferies Group LLC, a privately held brokerage whose leveraged finance business is not overseen by the same regulators, has stepped up to lead the financing of Brickman's deal instead, the sources said. Jefferies had not participated in the December deal.
The sources asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.
KKR, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Jefferies declined to comment. Brickman representatives did not respond to requests for comment.
Banks have occasionally passed on leveraged loan deals in the past for fear of upsetting regulators. However, the decision by three big Wall Street banks to not back one of their biggest private equity clients highlights how regulations created after the financial crisis are reshaping the competitive landscape in leveraged finance.
Smaller banks and non-bank financial institutions in the United States that are not regulated to the same extent are stepping up to take over lucrative business as major Wall Street firms are forced to pull back.
Leveraged loans are lucrative for banks. Last year, banks received $1.47 billion in fees for U.S. leveraged loans, up 17 percent from 2012, according to Thomson Reuters and Freeman Consulting data.
The lenders that financed KKR's acquisition of Brickman in December also included Macquarie Group Ltd (MQG.AX), Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO), Mizuho Bank Ltd (8411.T), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (8309.T), UBS AG UBSN.VX and KKR's capital market arm.
Macquarie, Mizuho and SMBC are participating in the ValleyCrest deal, as is a new bank, Nomura Co Ltd (9716.T), one of the sources said. A bank meeting to market the $725 million loan to debt investors has been scheduled for June 4.
It was not clear how some of these banks would overcome regulatory concerns. Representatives for those organizations did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Some of the sources suggested projected synergies between Brickman and ValleyCrest could reduce the company's leverage to below six times EBITDA.
Earlier this month, a senior Fed official said in a speech that the quality of leveraged loan deals has deteriorated this year and warned that regulators may have to take further action to ensure compliance with the guidelines.
Less than a full day after cheering a bipartisan deal being worked out in Congress to stabilize the individual insurance marketplace, President Donald Trump suggested they couldn't support it.
In a tweet sent Wednesday morning, Trump said that while they stood behind Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who worked with Washington Sen. Patty Murray on the compromise, they could “never support bailing out” the insurance companies they say have made a “fortune” with the Affordable Care Act.
The proposal from Sens. Alexander and Murray, who serve as the chair and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, does include two years worth of cost-sharing reduction payments, which help lower the costs of premiums for consumers, but the chair pushed back on the notion that the payments equal a bailout.
“We are having the strongest possible language in the Alexander-Murray agreement to make sure the cost-sharing reduction payments for 2018 and 2019 benefit the low income Americans to help them pay for their insurance and don't benefit the insurance companies,” Sen. Alexander told reporters at the HELP committee on Wednesday.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was a bit more frank: “The president ought to start understanding what's in the legislation before they tweet,” they said. “The Murray-Alexander bill specifically prohibited companies from getting CSR payments. There would be no double-dipping.”
Such was the dilemma facing Senators on Wednesday. After working to craft a deal to stabilize the insurance markets, selling it to the Republicans in Congress and the White House who want the Affordable Care Act repealed began presenting its own set of challenges shortly after the two sides announced they had a plan.
For their part, Alexander said the plan includes provisions that could be considered victories for Republicans who have been trying to nix Obamacare for the greater part of the past eight years. The two sides agreed to expand access to waivers that allow states to offer plans that don't meet all of the requirements under Obamacare, something Republicans have been pushing for. They also agreed to expand access to catastrophic plans—the low-premium, high-deductible insurance plans that are currently only available to young people on the individual marketplace. The plan would also redirect funding that could be used by the states to help people enroll, outreach that Democrats have blasted Trump for seeking to undercut.
The point of the bill, Alexander said on the Senate floor on Tuesday, is to avoid the “chaos” of skyrocketing premiums and rising medical debt that are predicted to come if the payments to insurers stop. “I don't know a Democrat or a Republican who benefits from chaos,” they said.
Some of that chaos appears to have been intentionally inflicted by Trump. On Oct. 12, the president signed an executive order that could give Americans access to cheap insurance plans that offer fewer protections. Then, the White House announced the end of “cost-sharing reduction” payments that are designed to lower insurance costs for poorer Americans. The goal, as Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon said, was to “blow up” President Obama's signature legislative achievement.
But the president has sent mixed messages on whether they actually want to do that. He's argued that their executive actions helped bring Democrats to the negotiating table (they were already in talks) and said he'd back a “short-term fix” only to tweet that they don't support “bailing out” insurance companies and bragged that their stocks tanked. “Lamar Alexander is working on it very hard,” Trump said of the bill on Wednesday. “And if something can happen that's fine, but I won't do anything to enrich the insurance companies, because right now the insurance companies are being enriched.”
For now, members of Congress from both parties are moving ahead. Senators are working to make sure the bill has a solid number of bipartisan co-sponsors when the legislative language is released, which could happen as soon as Thursday.
Schumer said that the “overwhelming majority” of Democrats are on board with the plan, noting that Sen. Murray was met with roaring applause when they announced the deal to their colleagues on Tuesday. The goal is to get at least 10 co-sponsors on both sides of the aisle to secure the bill's future.
Outside of the Senate chambers on Wednesday, several Republican Senators were non-committal. Some said they wanted to hear more from Sen. Alexander, while others were not sure if the bill would pass muster as-is. “I think in order to pass the House we're going to need more than Alexander-Murray,” said Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. “Doesn't sound like it could pass in the House so if it passes in the Senate, what good does do?”
Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said they support “the continuation of the work so they get to a point where it's something that the president would encourage.” Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who chairs the Senate Republican Conference, said the bill is “kind of open question.” But not every Senator was non-committal. Sen. John McCain of Arizona said they would support the bill in a statement on Wednesday. Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine have also cheered the bill.
Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee told reporters on Wednesday that they are a “proud co-sponsor” of the bill. “It's a good piece of legislation,” they said while moving their arms in a sweeping motion as elevator doors closed.
It remains unclear whether or not Trump, in the end, would be willing to keep Obamacare alive. But there is agreement among Republicans that securing their support on the legislation would be crucial.
Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who is also co-sponsoring the bill, said Wednesday that right now, “it's kind of like weather in South Dakota. It'll change on a regular basis until we're all satisfied.”

Crossroads GPS, the dark money political organization linked to Republican operative Karl Rove, apparently gave $2 million last year to Americans for Job Security, a group that was involved in a scheme in California to funnel $11 million into efforts aimed at two state ballot initiatives.
A state investigation into the movement of money found that AJS, also a dark money nonprofit, sent the $11 million through three other organizations in an attempt to hide the identities of its donors. California election authorities called it “the largest contribution ever disclosed as campaign money-laundering in California history” and demanded disclosure of the donors.
In a settlement today, after a grand jury investigation, the Center to Protect Patient Rights and Americans for Responsible Leadership — two of the groups through which money was channeled — agreed to pay a fine of $500,000 each, which together amounts to the largest campaign-reporting fine ever levied by the watchdog agency. CPPR has been a major clearinghouse of contributions to other conservative dark money groups. Both CPPR and ARL have strong ties to the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, major donors to conservative political causes. CPPR received $115 million from the Koch-spearheaded group Freedom Partners last year.
In addition, the agency released a list of AJS donors the state obtained in its investigation. The document, much of which is redacted, contains enough information to identify some of the large donors.

Crossroads GPS spent more than $70 million on independent expenditures in the 2012 elections, but apparently had enough to give to other dark money groups as well.
Some other major Republican donors are on the list, such as Miriam and Sheldon Adelson, who gave $250,000 each. The Adelsons were major donors to Republican super PACs in 2012, giving nearly $100 million to such groups as American Crossroads (the super PAC affiliate of Crossroads GPS) and the pro-Mitt Romney super PAC Restore Our Future.
Other donors included:
Jesse Rogers of Altman Capital, $450,000
Greg Penner of Wal Mart, $500,000
Margaret Bloomfield of Baron Real Estate Fund, $500,000
Glen Stearns and Stearns Lending, $250,000
The Tulley and Elise Friedman Fund, $100,000
The American Council of Engineering Companies of California, $500,000
Wayne Hughes, $450,000
Hitchcock Automotive, $100,000
The Los Angeles Times identified other donors: The Fisher family, for instance, which owns the Gap clothing empire, gave more than $9 million, according to the Times.
According to the Associated Press, CPPR said that the settlement included a recognition by the state that the group didn't intend to conceal information but made a mistake “largely because it had never previously made any contributions” in California. “The Commission today recognized that CPPR acted in ‘good faith' and that there was absolutely no intent to violate campaign reporting rules,” attorney Malcolm Segal said in a statement.
The money flowed like this: AJS raised $29 million. It gave nearly $25 million of it to CPPR, which in turn gave $18 million to Americans for Responsible Leadership. ARL gave $11 million to the Small Business Action Committee, which put it toward fighting one state ballot initiative that would have meant higher taxes and supporting another that would have reduced the political power of labor unions. The Small Business committee was ordered Thursday to pay $11 million to the state.
CPPR also gave $7 million to the American Future Fund , which sent $4 million on to the California Future Fund for Free Markets. The California group, which supported the anti-union ballot measure, was ordered by the state watchdog agency to pay a penalty equivalent to the sum it received. None of those organizations disclose their donors, though they are all engage in extensive political activity. The American Future Fund spent more than $25 million at the federal level in the 2012 elections. A call and email to Crossroads GPS were not returned at the time of this post.

Unfathomable Ruination will repeat London stunt for almost a month
Death metal band Unfathomable Ruination are to play in an air-tight, soundproof cube until they run out of oxygen – repeating the feat three nights a week from July 3 until August 1.
The performances, held outside London landmark The Gherkin at 6pm every Wednesday to Friday, will be inaudible to the public and are part of an installation titled ‘Box Sized Die' by Portugese artist João Onofre.
PHOTOS: 22 gigs played in unusual places
Onofre said: “The performance's duration is limited to the length of time in which oxygen is expended. Outside the cube, viewers observe its strange vibrations, only viewing the band's entrance and exit to the performance space.”
London five-piece Unfathomable Ruination formed in 2011 and have released two albums, ‘Musical Album' and ‘Misshapen Congenital Entropy'. The video for their song ‘Carved Inherent Delusion' can be seen below.
Parliament set to pass law banning red star
BBJ
The Hungarian Parliament is expected to debate and pass the bill popularly known as "lex Heineken" by the end of September, after the European Commission raised no objection to the proposed ban on using totalitarian symbols such as the swastika and red star for commercial purposes, according to media reports.
After apparently putting plans on hold earlier this year to adopt the so-called "lex Heineken" bill, the issue is on the table again. Following the opinion of the European Commission at the end of June, legal impediments are lifted, Kristóf Szatmáry, commissioner in charge of commercial policies, told pro-government daily newspaper Magyar Idők.
Szatmáry added that if Parliament passes the bill, all totalitarian symbols, including the five-pointed red star and hammer and sickle associated with communism, must disappear from products on store shelves, restaurants, advertisements and services.
According to online news portal index.hu, not only Heineken beer would be banned under its present logo, with its prominent red star, but also other brands including Milky Way chocolate bars, San Pellegrino mineral water, Redstar jeans and Converse shoes. Russian airline Aeroflot may also be affected because of the use of a hammer and sickle in its logo.
The current Hungarian penal code already bans the red star, but the EC in 2005 ruled out an initiative to ban all use of communist symbols. Additionally, the Hungarian Constitutional Court ruled that the use of the red star can be punished only if it is connected with behavior that disturbs public order.
EC may want modifications
Index.hu reports that, according to its sources at the European Commission, the situation may not be quite so simple with regard to the ECʼs position. Although the EC has permitted the law to go forward for debate in Parliament, it has reportedly attached a number of comments and proposed modifications that would make the legislation conform with EU law. These, the report speculates, may extend to matters of competition law and anti-discrimination.
Although the red star has qualified as a totalitarian symbol in Hungary since 1993, this is certainly not the case in every country, index.hu emphasizes, pointing out that international courts would not necessarily take the Hungarian legislation as a basis in deciding on any dispute relating to the ban.
The regional representation of Converse shoes was cited by index.hu as saying it would await a review by the Constitutional Court before forming a strategy in response, and would wait and see how far the Hungarian government wants to proceed with the initiative before taking further steps. It stated that it does not plan to change its brand image, adding that it wished "good luck to the government in convincing an international brand that the logo it has used for 109 years is a totalitarian symbol."
For its part, Heineken Global told index.hu in the spring that the company would "protect the Heineken brand, to which the red star belongs, always, everywhere and by every means."
Hurricanes sophomore linebacker Marques Gayot was released from the hospital Thursday morning, 24 hours after they collided with a teammate in practice, injured their neck and was airlifted to Ryder Trauma Center in Miami.
Gayot, who is expected to make a full recovery, then posted the following message on Twitter aimed at Hurricanes fans.

The big-budget sequel opened in theaters just as Depp's wife, Amber Heard, was granted a restraining order after alleging Depp assaulted them
The timing couldn't have been worse.
On Friday, just as Alice Through the Looking Glass began playing in theaters, Johnny Depp's wife, Amber Heard, was granted a restraining order after alleging the Alice star had assaulted them and engaged in a pattern of domestic abuse throughout their 15-month marriage. They made the claims days after filing for divorce.
The lurid news stories couldn't have come at a less opportune time for Depp — once one of the world's biggest movie stars — since they need Through the Looking Glass to work.
In 2010, Alice in Wonderland earned an astounding $1.025 billion for Disney, Depp and director Tim Burton. But the box office hasn't been kind to the actor in the years since, outside of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011) and mob pic Black Mass (2015). Depp has suffered a raft of high-profile bombs, including Dark Shadows (2012), The Lone Ranger (2013), Transcendence (2014) and Mortdecai (2015).
Heading into Memorial Day weekend, Alice Through the Looking Glass was tracking to open to $60 million or more (one service even had it at $79 million) in North America — a respectable showing, even if it wouldn't come close to matching Alice in Wonderland's $116 million start over Memorial Day.
But now the family-friendly pic has to contend with Depp's personal drama, in addition to withering reviews.
By Friday evening, it was clear from early grosses that Through the Looking Glass would have trouble clearing $40 million. Box-office observers attributed the movie's weak performance on opening day more to bad notices rather than to the headlines surrounding Depp, but said that if estimates kept falling off throughout the weekend, it indeed meant the news about the actor was starting to have a chilling effect.
And the estimates have continued to fall.
As it stands now, Through the Looking Glass is bombing with a four-day opening of $34.2 million, according to Monday estimates (that's less than the $35 million estimated on Sunday).
"These allegations, if true, pose a serious threat to the box-office longevity of Johnny Depp. Obviously time heals all wounds, but this is certainly having a toll on Depp and Alice," says analyst Jeff Bock. "'Alice in Blunderland' is more like it."
Disney won't comment on Depp, but didn't try to spin the numbers.
"It's disappointing. The domestic opening is wildly less than what every tracking service had us at," says Disney distribution chief Dave Hollis. "We're in the tentpole business. More often than not, they turn out to be huge successes. We'll continue to take those big bets. In this instance, it didn't turn out as we hoped."
Disney and other Hollywood studios tracking box-office grosses expected Alice 2 to see a Friday-to-Saturday uptick, in line with other family-friendly films. Instead, it was down 6 percent. The first Alice was up by nearly 9 percent on its first Saturday. Maleficent (2014) saw a 6 percent gain; Cinderella (2015), up 18 percent.
So far, Alice 2 isn't appealing to as many families as other Disney live-action adaptations. According to the studio, families made up 32 percent of ticket-buyers over its debut weekend, compared to 66 percent for Cinderella, 45 percent for Maleficent and 66 percent for last month's The Jungle Book (it's certainly true that the trippy Alice in Wonderland property may have more adult fans).
According to exit poll service CinemaScore, 35 percent of ticket buyers cited Depp as a reason for showing up, compared to 50 percent in 2010.
Alice 2 sees Depp once again star as the Mad Hatter, while Mia Wasikowska reprises their role as Alice. Burton, however, didn't return to direct the new pic; instead James Bobin, who helmed the Muppets franchise for Disney, took over directing duties. The film cost $170 million to produce.
Alice Through the Looking Glass isn't Disney's only investment in Depp. Over Memorial Day 2017, Disney will release Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. The previous film in the franchise, On Stranger Tides, took in a stellar $1.045 billion globally, but earned less in the U.S. than the first two installments.
"If I'm Disney and Alice Through the Looking Glass is a flop," says one analyst, "I'm probably a little nervous about Pirates 5."
Overseas, Alice 2's debut was mixed with $65 million from 72 percent of the marketplace. China, where it placed No. 1, led with a strong $27.1 million. The tentpole also did well in Latin America, but struggled in some key European countries, including the U.K. ($3.2 million).

Parents everywhere know children can be expensive but Australians Rachel Evans and John Kan didn't expect their baby daughter to come at a cost of nearly $1 million. That's what the BC Women's Hospital says it's owed after little Piper was born three months premature during a trip to Canada last August and had to spend three months in neonatal care.
Proud parents Rachel Evans and John Kan with their newborn daughter, Piper, last August at BC Women's Hospital. Piper was born three months premature.
The Sydney-area couple had travel insurance and were given the green light from their doctor to holiday overseas. But just as the couple was about to board their flight home, Evans, who was just 26 weeks pregnant, went into labour at the Vancouver International Airport and was rushed to hospital. “We were very lucky to be at the airport when they came and not already in flight,” Evans told the Star from their home in Willoughby, a suburb of Sydney. “She came without warning, just suddenly started.” Unbeknownst to Evans and Kan, their travel insurance policy didn't cover the costs of the birth or the baby's hospital care.

Now the couple is on the hook for nearly $1 million — the cost the hospital claims it incurred to look after Piper, who was born weighing just 862 grams — about 1 pound 9 ounces — for three months. The bill works out to about $8,120 a day and does not include additional medical procedures or fees the family incurred while staying in Vancouver. Evans says they and their husband were able to work out an agreement with the hospital that will see them paying $300 a month for the rest of their lives. Still, Evans says they don't begrudge the hospital for the bill and says they and their husband take full responsibility for not reading the fine print of their insurance policy. “We just feel very lucky. We'd been trying to get pregnant for a long time,” said Evans, 42. “Piper is worth whatever we paid. It's just too bad it was such a huge amount.” Piper now weighs 5 ½ kilograms and is doing everything a healthy baby their age should be doing.
Evans noted that the Australian ministry of health and ageing is looking at their case to see if some of the cost could be covered by the national government. Jan Christilaw, president of BC Women's Hospital and Health Centre, said it is uncommon for an out-of-country family to require a long stay at the hospital and not have costs covered by insurance.

“As the family has acknowledged, BC Women's does have a responsibility to B.C. taxpayers who fund our hospital health-care system, and as such, has taken steps to recover the cost of care,” they said in a statement to the Star. “Given that each family situation is unique, BC Women's works with each family to find a compassionate compromise to recover the cost of care, as well as to support the family with any information they might require to claim costs from insurers. We have done so in this situation.” The B.C. health ministry said it has “sympathy” for Kan and Evans and recognizes “the challenge a bill of this amount presents.” “However, similar to other publicly funded health-care systems, B.C. needs to be sure our resources are focused on eligible British Columbians, who ultimately fund the health-care services that are provided in B.C.,” said ministry spokesperson Kristy Anderson. “We recommend that people purchase additional travel medical insurance, and as this case highlights, the public needs to be aware of the limitations of their private insurance policy to ensure that the policy meets their personal needs.”

WSYR - WASHINGTON (WSYR-TV) – In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, President Donald Trump called out Upstate New Yorkers, suggesting they move to places like Wisconsin for better job prospects.
Trump's comments came after Foxconn, iPhone's maker said that they will open a Wisconsin plant for Apple, potentially bringing 10,000 jobs to the area.
The President called out residents from "upper New York State," saying they should move to areas like Wisconsin, Iowa, and Colorado that are adding manufacturing jobs.
"You're going to need people to work in these massive plants," Trump told the WSJ. "I'm going to start explaining to people: When you have an area that just isn't working like upper New York state, where people are getting very badly hurt, and then you'll have another area 500 miles away from where you can't get people."
They also continued with, "It's ok. Don't worry about your house."
Oneida County Executive Anthony Picente Jr., a Republican, took to Twitter to call out the President.
"Disappointed in @realDonaldTrump a president from New York bashing Upstate New York. Sad. I had hoped for better," Picente tweeted.
Earlier today, I posted on Reddit that I received the Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable with metal housing. It does look much better in reality and more premium that the plastic one. Just for reference, I have got myself with the 2-meter-long cable instead of 1m, as I can think of when I try to wrap it around the high-rise watch stands, certainly longer could be better.
There was a question regarding the thickness of the connector comparing with the plastic one that comes with Apple Watch Sport. This is indeed a useful fact that everyone should get to know.
For those of you who might not have ordered 2 different tiers of Apple Watches, nor have not bought the one on sale in the Apple Online Store, here I am presenting to you the physical side-by-side comparison of both charging cables.
Based on my rough measurement without professional utilities, the metal one is approximately 6.5mm thick, whereas the plastic one has a thickness of about 8mm. The difference is slightly less than 1.5mm. The diameters of both are the same. Additionally, the upper faces are all plastic too.
/u/slicecom did bring up an interesting point that the slight difference in thickness of the connectors could lead to major issues with charging stands or docks that some of the manufacturers could have sent out for production and ready for shipping within a couple of weeks.
Definitely, many of us, as normal consumers, might not have expected a differentiation of such that the Sport comes with the plastic charging connector which looks cheaper and is literally thicker. I have ordered a couple of watchstands from two different manufacturers so will definitely share with you how things go.
So did you order the charging cable with metal housing? And did you pre-order a watchstand? Feel free to share your thought here.
Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable (1 m) – $29.00
Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable (2 m) – $39.00
In artificial intelligence (AI), anticipation occurs when an agent makes decisions based on its explicit beliefs about the future. More broadly, "anticipation" can also refer to the ability to act in appropriate ways that take future events into account, without necessarily explicitly possessing a model of the future events.
In AI [ edit ]
An agent employing anticipation would try to predict the future state of the environment (weather in this case) and make use of the predictions in the decision making. For example,
If the sky is cloudy and the air pressure is low, it will probably rain soon so take the umbrella with you. Otherwise leave the umbrella home.
These rules explicitly take into account possible future events.
In 1985, Robert Rosen defined an anticipatory system as follows:[1]
A system containing a predictive model of itself and/or its environment, which allows it to change state at an instant in accord with the model's predictions pertaining to a later instant.
To some extent, Rosen's definition of anticipation applies to any system incorporating machine learning. At issue is how much of a system's behaviour should or indeed can be determined by reasoning over dedicated representations, how much by on-line planning, and how much must be provided by the system's designers.
In animals [ edit ]
Humans can make decisions based on explicit beliefs about the future. More broadly, animals can act in appropriate ways that take future events into account, although they may not necessarily have an explicit cognitive model of the future; evolution may have shaped simpler systemic features that result in adaptive anticipatory behavior in a narrow domain.[2] For example, hibernation is anticipatory behavior, but does not appear to be driven by a cognitive model of the future.[3]

I spend so much time on the Internet...I feel like I'm a million pages into the worst book ever, and I can't put it down. -- Aziz Ansari
I put it down.
I'm a 25 year old, card-carrying millennial, and I've had a cellphone in my pocket since I was in the 7th grade. I've IMed, MySpaced, Twittered, Instagrammed and Snapchatted away my free time since before I hit puberty, and I hate myself for it! The number of hours I've laid in bed aimlessly checking my phone hoping to be entertained or validated probably rests at a number that if discovered would make me throw up in my mouth. I don't think there's a single entity outside of the T-mobiles and Verizons of the world clamoring for me to use my phone more, but still, I devour anything that the little glowing screen in my pocket provides me.
Which leads me to the Mexico trip, the entirety of which was orchestrated by my good friend Micah, an avid traveler himself. After making the leap into fatherhood they needed to spend more time with their baby daughter than they did backpacking in unknown villages. So, they saw an opportunity to live vicariously through me with their unused flight passes. They asked if I'd be willing to make a video in exchange for a free flight to an unknown destination. Naturally, I jumped at the opportunity. We put a weekend on the calendar where he'd drop me off at the airport with nothing more than some camera gear and a passport.
At it's core, this trip was about being intentional about adventure (One of Micah's life mantras). So I wondered how to increase the adventure aspect of it. And it hit me! For as vocal as I've been about not using technology, this would be the perfect time to put my money where my mouth is: leave my phone at home and do this trip sans cellular.
What I learned
My spanish speaking skills are incredibly mediocre and everyone I met was incredibly gracious and accommodating to my bumbling spanglish. As a lifelong people pleaser, my stuttering incoherent spanish undoubtedly inconvenienced countless bus drivers and store clerks which caused a great amount of anxiety and lo siento's on my part.
I was perfectly fine with out being connected to the thousand-ish people I subscribe to on various mediums. I didn't miss hearing people's reaction to the happenings of every day life.
What did suck was having absolutely no access to the incredible amount of information typically at my fingertips. I was flying blind for the first 24 hours. The summation of all my knowledge was a sight-seeing pamphlet I picked up at the airport, and unless I was going zip-lining or booze cruising, it gave me no real information about the city I was in.
Traveling in general creates the kind of connection and experiences that phones poorly try to recreate.
Any possible FOMO went away completely. I was so interested in figuring out my own world, and other people's lives were so far away and low priority that they didn't enter into my thought process or internal monologue, which was a refreshing change.
For a few weeks after I got back from my trip, I would leave my phone at home when grocery shopping, or in the car when hanging with friends. Going cold turkey had broken through the barrier of resistance I faced when thinking about being without my phone. And truthfully, it was really nice. When I was without my phone I felt much more present, and connected with the people around me.
When summarizing this trip, I tell people: With no phone, no laptop, only some camera gear, and the clothes on my back, I was handed a ticket to a mystery destination, and over the next four days I met great people, ate tasty food, and I was fine.
Mentioning that I was fine is the most important part, because most people come at me with a cavalcade of worst case scenarios and what-if's. And the bottom line is that the instantaneous world that we're often sold is incredibly overrated for the most part. Everyone survived for a long time without instantaneous being a possibility, and it really isn't that hard to switch back.
As someone who is in the business of using, knowing and pitching technology I'm continually interested in our relationship with it.
I remember when I received my first cell phone as a rascally teenager, I was told that it was for emergencies only "Just in case, Woody!" And, yes, if things go wrong, you get separated from your friends at a concert, it's a great tool to re-connect you. But as a whole, who are we really kidding!? I can't remember the last time my phone solved some sort of crisis that couldn't wait an hour or two.
Bottom line
Would I do it again? I would. The difficulty and uncertainty at the beginning of the trip was more than equaled by the triumph of how great everything was when things started going my way later in the trip, which seems to be a dichotomy I'm constantly faced with: short term discomfort, for future benefit.
As a whole, I find that I'm rarely upset when I write checks that I don't yet know how to cash, leap before I look, and put myself in situations where the only option is to rise to the occasion.
When mobile sales are booming, smartphone thefts are almost certain to rise. That's something San Francisco and New York prosecutors George Gascón and Eric Schneiderman have been telling smartphone makers for over a year, but now they're finally making some headway. After pressuring Apple to implement a "kill switch" inside its devices, the New York Times reports that police officers in London and San Francisco saw iPhone robberies in the cities fall by 24 percent and 38 percent respectively in the six months before and after the company implemented its Activation Lock feature inside iOS 7. Over in New York, robberies were down by 19 percent and those involving grand larcenies dropped 29 percent when the police compared data in the first five months of 2014 with the same period from 2013.
Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff Francois Lenoir/Reuters Dilma Rousseff has won another term as Brazil's president.
President Rousseff garnered 51.45% of votes cast.
Despite allegations of corruption at the highest levels of their administration — especially regarding the massive state oil firm Petrobras — the incumbent will have another four years to right Brazil's ship after a close campaign against center-right candidate Aecio Neves.
It will not be easy. Wall Street knows that. As a result, the markets may punish Brazil's markets Monday morning.
Over the last four years the country has taken a turn for the worse. Low commodity prices have hurt Brazilian exports, and so has a Chinese slowdown. Inflation is high and corporate profits are thin.
This is a task that Wall Street analysts thought Neves was better suited for. They ran a campaign on tightening monetary policy and bringing investment back to Brazil.
In fact, a Neves win would have bolstered a Brazilian investment theme popularized by hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz: Brazil, "so bad it's good."
Novogratz told investors earlier this year that a Neves win could be the change the country needed. As a result, the Brazilian stock market has been a whipsaw for over a month, rising and falling as Rousseff and Neves duked it out in the polls.
Either way, however, says Société Générale analyst Dev Ashish, monetary policy and foreign investments have their limits. They're far less powerful tools without increased domestic output and demand.
Société Générale They wrote: "...the success of monetary policy depends on finding some alternative domestic source sof growth in the absence of greater demand (and prices) for commodities and other Brazilian exports. A lot will depend on how quickly the new government can work to restore investors' confidence after the 26 October election, which would help not only growth but also to resolve the currency and inflation issues."
That is why some on the Street have been skeptical that a Neves victory would make a huge difference either way.
Last Monday, short-seller Jim Chanos of Kynikos Investments gave a presentation on Petrobras, Brazil's quasi-state oil firm, at the Robin Hood Investor conference. Their dark thesis on the health of the massive company, sent the stock, Brazil's ETF, and the country's market falling.
They said they gave the presentation to warn investors not to buy into what Cantor Fitzgerald once called the Brazil "farce."
"... I thought it was timely this week that if that's what happens and if investors knee jerk run into the Bovespa and buy Petrobras because Neves wins, I think it's a great entry point on the short side in this story because it doesn't change the economies of the situation," Chanos told Bloomberg TV.
Rousseff's win changes the economics even less.

Barter Your Professional Website Design Services
for
Upscale Hair Salon Services in Equal Value
i.e. $500.00 in website services = $500.00 in salon services which can be performed at different times.
The salon services you barter for can be gifted by you to another person .
All barter terms subject to a formal Barter Agreement. All salon services performed at the Salon, located in a west suburb of Minneapolis, MN.
After doing a little research I've found that some very talented web design and marketing people live and work right here in the Twin Cities. Talented professionals always seem to gravitate to other talented professionals so it makes perfect sense to pursue a barter relationship of this kind.
By way of introduction my name is Kevin Thomas and I'm a business advisor working with the principal of the salon. They desire to keep their expansion plans confidential. As far as the website is concerned they don't want anyone outside of their trusted business circle to know about it, until it goes live.
The principal has been in the salon business, starting in Uptown, for a long time and is regarded as one of the top stylist - colorist - operators in the Twin Cities. She's very well known and word of mouth advertising has built their business to the extent that there is about a six week wait to see them personally. Now, they wish to leverage that reputation to expand their business. One of their priorities is to have a new website built, tested and operating in the very near future.
The salon's current site is rough, somewhat amateurish and exists only as a placeholder. The new site must be unique (no cookie cutter 'out of the box') without being too glitzy. We'd like it to incorporate contemporary themes while at the same time being easy to use, intuitive, interactive and fast loading. Our vision is for the site to be very relevant and informational for the user. It should tell the story of the salon and its founder, and then allow the user to interact by making a reservation request or to initiate and complete a product purchase transaction.
In the main their clientele is female, wealthy and very busy. They hold their time to be precious and they spend it judiciously. Them website should especially appeal to the sensitivities of people like that. It should be designed with SEO in mind, but not primary. Local Google searches ideally should return page one results, but searches originating outside of the twin cities trade area are of less interest [at this time]. It should be built to function in as many of the older browsers as possible while looking good and working well on a cell phone/PDA.
After the design and build work has been completed we would like to have full use of the art work, copy and fonts as well as templates which will allow us to add content to the site at will.
I can promise you that anybody would be very pleased to have their hairstyle and color designed and performed by this talented lady. As I mentioned earlier, reservations for personal appointments with them typically need to be made six weeks in advance, despite the fact that their prices are among the highest in this market. It's so true that the finest services and products are always in demand.
CLEVELAND -- Cavaliers center Andrew Bynum is not sure they will regain their explosiveness after missing all of last season because of injuries to both knees.
The 7-foot Bynum said before Monday night's game against Minnesota that they still feel pain in their knees, but hopes their minutes will increase as the season goes on. They hoped to play in both halves of the game, their third appearance of the season.
Bynum admitted they aren't as explosive as they were when they played for the Los Angeles Lakers and wonders if that aspect of their game will return.
"I don't think that's coming back," they said. "It makes you rely more on footwork and skills versus athleticism."
Bynum is also dealing with the normal effects of having surgery, but is pleased with the progress he's made.
"I feel little sharp pains here and there, but it's nothing too bad," they said. "I feel all right. My timing's off, but I haven't played in a long time. I have skills. I have talent. I just need to get my timing back."
Bynum played 7:34 in the season opener against Brooklyn -- their first appearance since May 21, 2012, when they were with the Lakers -- and 10:46 on Friday against Charlotte. They didn't play in the second half of either game and was inactive Saturday against Indiana, which follows the Cavaliers' plans of being cautious with him. Bynum entered Monday's game with 4:14 remaining in the first quarter and played 9:42 in the half.
Bynum didn't play a game last season with Philadelphia and underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in March. They signed with Cleveland in July and resumed basketball activities in mid-September.
The Cavaliers hope Bynum, 26, will give them a large inside presence and a complement to star point guard Kyrie Irving. The team signed Bynum to a two-year, $24 million contract. Only one season is guaranteed and the team holds the option for next season.
The Reddit user whose gif was appropriated by Donald Trump in the president's infamous CNN-wrestling video has apologized for creating the image – and for making a series of racist, antisemitic and Islamophobic posts.
HanAssholeSolo, who claimed to have created the gif that inspired Trump to post a video of them wrestling a man with a CNN logo superimposed on their head, said they were “trolling” when they used a series of racial slurs on Reddit, and said their gif had been “satire” that was not meant to call for violence against journalists. HanAssholeSolo's apology came after CNN reportedly identified him.
Reddit user who took credit for Trump's CNN tweet has history of racist posts Read more
The Reddit user had faced criticism after it emerged they had repeatedly used racial slurs and posted antisemitic images to the site. In one post, HanAssholeSolo called for another commenter to “keep up the good work until the last Islamic piece of shit is wiped from the planet”.
Trump is yet to apologize for sharing the video; it is unclear how the president discovered HanAssholeSolo's post. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on Monday, but the revelations about HanAssholeSolo's past added to questions about the president's internet use and sourcing.
In July 2016, Trump tweeted an antisemitic image attacking Hillary Clinton. It was later reported that the image had been taken from an internet message board used by white supremacists.
HanAssholeSolo issued their apology in a lengthy post to Reddit on Tuesday.
“First of all, I would like to apologize to the members of the Reddit community for getting this site and this sub embroiled in a controversy that should never have happened,” they wrote.
“I would also like to apologize for the posts made that were racist, bigoted, and antisemitic. I am in no way this kind of person, I love and accept people of all walks of life and have done so for my entire life.
“I am not the person that the media portrays me to be in real life, I was trolling and posting things to get a reaction from the subs on reddit and never meant any of the hateful things I said in those posts. I would never support any kind of violence or actions against others simply for what they believe in, their religion, or the lifestyle they choose to have.
“Nor would I carry out any violence against anyone based upon that or support anyone who did.”
The post has since been removed from Reddit, and HanAssholeSolo has deleted their account. In the apology they said they did not “advocate violence against the press” and that the meme “was created purely as satire”.
“I had no idea anyone would take it and put sound to it and then have it put up on the president's Twitter feed.
“It was a prank, nothing more. What the president's feed showed was not the original post that was posted here, but loaded up somewhere else and sound added to it then sent out on Twitter. I thought it was the original post that was made and that is why I took credit for it.
“I have the highest respect for the journalist community and they put their lives on the line every day with the jobs that they do in reporting the news.”
On Monday, CNN said it had identified the man behind the HanAssholeSolo account. The news organization said it was not publishing their name “because they are a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed their remorse by saying they have taken down all their offending posts, and because they said they are not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again”.
CNN said it “reserves the right to publish their identity should any of that change”.
Tariffs offered by mobile companies usually contain a maximum volume of monthly data (megabytes) to which the client is entitled. Consumption of this data takes place every time the customer goes online, without the phone being connected to a WIFI network. Zero-rating, a common practice across the mobile sector, is an exception to this rule. It is an arrangement offering access to particular content, applications or services which does not count against the user's contracted package of data. This enables an unlimited use of the relevant services, without the user having to worry about consumption of their data allowance. WhatsApp, Viber or Twitter are examples of applications often covered by zero-rating offers.
Whilst at first sight it might seem that zero-rating has only advantages, there are concerns that it endangers net neutrality.
Governed in the European Union ("EU") by Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 ("Regulation"), net neutrality is a principle that aims to protect end-users' right to access/distribute the content and use/provide the applications and services of their choice, in an indiscriminate manner. For these purposes, internet suppliers are instructed to treat all traffic equally "…without discrimination, restriction or interference, and irrespective of the sender and receiver, the content accessed or distributed, the applications or services used or provided, or the terminal equipment used" (art. 3.3. of the Regulation)and prohibited from conducting commercial practices which may limit the end-users' choice (art. 3.2. of the Regulation). Traffic management measures such as blocking, slowing down, interference with, degradation or discrimination between specific content, applications or services, are typical examples of practices against net neutrality.
Although the Regulation does not expressly mention zero-rating, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications ("BEREC") acknowledges that the arrangement has the potential to negatively affect net neutrality. As BEREC states, "There are different types of zero-rating practices which have different effects on end-users and the open internet, and hence on the end-user rights protected under the Regulation"( BEREC's guidelines on the implementation of the net neutrality rules – para. 40). In this sense, BEREC considers that:
zero-rating offers where all applications are blocked (or slowed down) once the data cap is reached except for the zero-rated app(s) would go against the first and third subparagraphs of art. 3.3 of the Regulation, which protect equal treatment of traffic and prevent traffic management measures that interfere with or discriminate between specific content, applications or services; and
zero-rating applied to a particular application within a category (instead of to all the applications within such category) creates an economic incentive to use that particular application instead of competing ones, which has potential of undermining the end-users rights and reducing their choice.
In light of the above, BEREC recommends that the admissibility of zero-rating is approached on a case-by-case basis by National Regulatory Authorities ("NRAs") and analyzed against a number of criteria and factors, including:
the respective market positions of the providers, applications and services involved, as well as the scale of the practice or the existence of alternatives;
whether the relevant arrangement leads to situations where end-users' choice is materially reduced or would result in the undermining of the essence of the end-users rights; or
the aim of the Regulation, which is to safeguard equal and non-discriminatory treatment of traffic and guarantee the continuing functioning of the internet ecosystem as an engine of innovation.
Although BEREC's guidelines do provide some guidance, a consistent approach across the EU is lacking. Varying sensibilities among NRAs and availability of different zero-rating offer structures do not help unification. Some NRAs (e.g. the Dutch one) have displayed a position favorable to a broad prohibition of zero-rating practices, others (e.g. the Belgian NRA) have adopted a case-by-case approach, while some are still to formulate position.
Serbia does not have net neutrality rules such as those contained in the Regulation and RATEL, the Serbian NRA, has not yet issued any position on zero-rating. Mobile providers operating in Serbia do offer zero-rating in relation to social networks and chat apps. However, considering Serbia's commitment to align its regulations with those adopted in the EU, one may expect that the legislation and RATEL will address net neutrality. However, given the uncertainty at the EU level, it is difficult to anticipate what that position will be.

Bethlehem Steel announced on Tuesday the acquisition of Ryan Richter via a full transfer from NASL side Ottawa Fury.
Bethlehem Steel head coach Brendan Burke said in a statement, “We are very happy to have Ryan back in the Union family. We know that they had serious interest from a number of other clubs around USL and NASL, so this proved to be a key signing for us.  They are a local guy and this move made a lot of sense for everyone involved.”
A graduate of William Tennent High School and La Salle University who also played for Ocean City Nor'easters, Richter was selected by the Union in the 2011 Supplemental Draft. Richter did not make an appearance for the Union in league play during the 2011 season.
After the Union declined to pick up their option in January of 2012, Richter signed with USL side Charleston Battery, making 24 appearances and scoring two goals in a season that ended with the Battery as USL champions.
In 2013, Richter signed with Toronto FC, earning their MLS debut in the 1-1 draw against the Union at PPL Park on April 13, eventually recording 13 appearances.
Richter was loaned to NASL side Ottawa Fury in 2014 and signed with the club for the 2015 season, advancing with the club to the 2015 Fall Championship game.
Said Union sporting director Earnie Stewart of Richter, “We're very excited to be able to land a player of Ryan's caliber to boost our expansion club. Not only do we think highly of their skill set, but we believe in all of the professional intangibles Ryan will bring on a daily basis.”
Drafted as a midfielder by the Union, Richter has been playing as a right fullback.
It is time to have a closer look at the BUK video provided by Ukrainian Interior Minister, Arsen Avakov which they released on 18th July, the day after the downing of MH17 in order to implicate Russia and pro-Russian rebels. The importance of this particular piece of evidence can not be overestimated.
1. It has been claimed this video was taken in Krasnodon, on the border with Russia.
2. Arsen Avakov claimed in a Facebook post that the video was taken by a special police surveillance team.
2. News outlets such as the Daily Mail and Paris Match still claim it was taken in Krasnodon, quoting official Ukrainian sources.
3. The Russians reacted to its release by claiming, during an official news conference, that the video was taken in an area held by Ukrainian forces.
4. The Russian claim was, predictably, followed by a wave of activity by internet sleuths out there.
5. The video was geo-located to an intersection in Lugansk, 50km from Krasnodon. The Russians were denounced as liars, but generally little was said about Ukraine's original claim.
6. Arsen Avakov, the Ukrainian interior minister confirmed the correct location but the media have continued to locate the video in Krasnodon, or said nothing about the matter.
7. I will speculate here that the Russians aren't stupid, that they didn't know where this video was shot, that they wanted to know and they do now.
8. Getting back to the video, here it is:
9. According to LBC:
” The video appears to show the BUK launcher with one of the four missiles it carries missing.
The film was allegedly shot by a police surveillance squad at dawn on Friday as the truck headed to the city of Krasnodon in the direction of the Russian border.
The footage, released on the Facebook page of the Ukrainian interior minister, cannot be independently verified.
Interior minister Arsen Avakov wrote on their page: “Criminals try to hide the traces of this heinous crime (but do) not succeed.
“Security Service and Interior Ministry of Ukraine has collected and collects more irrefutable facts and evidence.”
10. The actual location is in the suburbs of Lugansk:
https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Luhansk,+Luhans%27ka+oblast,+Ukraine/@48.5449882,39.2665449,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x411fc564844c6285:0xf8e02e7e879e7164
Additional imagery from the intersection has been provided by a “local resident.”
11. The video has clearly been taken from inside a block of flats which provides a fairly long-distance view of the road.
12. It is clear that the person taking the film must have been aware that the vehicle (or at least a vehicle of interest) was coming down the road.
13. According to Arsen Avakov's statement this footage was taken by the police surveillance team at 4.50am on July 18th. This would be nearly 12 hours after MH17 was downed.
14. If the truck with BUK was travelling up from Snizhne (where the plane was allegedly shot down) the normal route would appear to be via the M04. The route it has gone down would appear to be a diversion, or an alternative route (or perhaps it was going somewhere else than Russia).
15. The turn-off from the obvious route (sticking to the M04) is only just over 1 km from the filming location in the flat.
16. It therefore is extremely unlikely the surveillance team who took the video was following the truck. It is more likely they knew it was coming, which again means it is most likely they knew exactly what route it was taking.
17. They could have known what route it was taking and that it was coming, because of electronic intercepts, in which the driver said which way they were going to go (though why they would provide this detailed information to someone on the phone is a good question) or because the driver had told the police which way they were going, or they had told them which way to go.
18) If through electronic intercepts, why would the surveillance team choose a place to film from where it is impossible to see all the details of the trailer and BUK clearly – ie just well enough to make out that there seems to be a missile missing.
19) If Ukrainian covert operations people knew where this BUK and trailer was travelling, why has far more footage not been released, for instance showing it going to the Russian border?
20) Why has no footage of this BUK, with its cover removed showing the missing missile and no dashboard cam recordings turned up showing it between Snizhne and Lugansk or between Lugansk and the Russian border?
21) If a police surveillance team was based in this flat, wouldn't they use a high quality camera on a tripod, rather than what appears to be a not very high-resolution video camera?
22) (added 7/9/2014) According to an interactive map from Kiev (http://liveuamap.com) this position in Lugansk was not under separatist control on that day:
To sum up, the statement of Avakov, the film and its location suggest the Ukrainian authorities had advance knowledge of this BUK and trailer's movements or control over it.
It is also extremely strange that this BUK, allegedly after shooting down MH17, is supposedly filmed by a Ukrainian surveillance team (in ostensibly rebel territory?), with its covering missing, as if to show the world a missile is missing.
Comments are welcome below – (on topic please). Donations are even more welcome!
Update – Article updated 07/09/2014 thanks to a very useful comment below. The place where the video was filmed is marked as pro-Kiev territory on UA maps on the 17th and 18th July.
00:51 Does Puerto Rico Have a Fossil-Fueled Future? Puerto Rico's recovery could be a boon for renewables, but some leaders in Washington appear to have a different vision.
At a Glance Monday Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a State of Emergency to assist incoming evacuees who were displaced after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico.
The declaration will provide resources and assistance needed to accommodate families impacted by the storm.
Relief centers have been opened and state colleges and universities have agreed to waive fees and tuition for students from the island.
The first plane from Puerto Rico is expected to arrive on Tuesday morning.
Officials expect at least 100,000 people.
As Puerto Rico continues its fight to recover after being devastated by Hurricane Maria, Florida Gov. Rick Scott has declared a State of Emergency to help provide relief for those fleeing the island.
All 67 counties in the Sunshine State are under the declaration, which will "provide important resources and assistance needed to best accommodate the needs of families impacted by Hurricane Maria when they come to Florida," according to a release from Scott's office issued Monday.
"Puerto Rico was totally devastated by Hurricane Maria and so many families lost everything," Scott stated in the release. "With families displaced by Hurricane Maria already present and still arriving in Florida, it is critical that our state is prepared to provide the resources they need upon entering our state."
The storm slammed into the U.S. territory on Sept. 20, packing maximum sustained winds of 155 mph . It was the strongest hurricane landfall in Puerto Rico since the Category 5 September 1928 San Felipe/Lake Okeechobee storm.
(MORE: 'Herculean Effort' Required to Rebuild Puerto Rico, FEMA Head Says )
At least 18 were killed by the storm and roughly 55 percent of the island is still without water .
A relief center has been opened at Orlando International Airport and two more at the Miami International Airport and the Port of Miami will open Tuesday to help Puerto Rican families displaced by the storm, according to a separate release from Scott's office. Nearly 40 state colleges and universities have also pitched in, waiving out-of-state tuition and fees for students from the island.
"Our goal is to make sure that while Governor Rosselló is working to rebuild Puerto Rico, any families displaced by Maria that come to Florida are welcomed and offered every available resource from the state," Scott said in the release. "These Disaster Relief Centers will help Puerto Ricans coming into Florida get matched with all the available state resources they may need and ensure that as families come into Florida, they are given the tools they need to work and provide their children with a great education."
The relief center set up at Orlando International will act as a first stop for those seeking help , according to the Orlando Sentinel. State agencies and charities such as American Red Cross will be helping families find shelter, food and water.
“At this point, there is the unknown of how many people or what will be needed, so it is a starting point,” airport spokesperson Carolyn Fennell told the Sentinel. “It's merely a reception point to say, ‘Here's what you can look for' or ‘What do you need?'”
The first plane from Puerto Rico is expected to arrive at 11 a.m. Tuesday, the Sentinel reports. Officials say they expect at least 100,000 evacuees to arrive in Florida, the Sentinel reports.

An Indian man who posted a Facebook video of them assaulting a stray dog has been arrested.
The man was tracked down via the social network by animal rights activist Saurabh Gupta.
Animal lovers in India were outraged by the 23-second clip of the man swinging the dog by its hind legs and throwing it at a parked car.
Activists had called for the arrest of the man soon after the video went viral on the social media.
Mr Gupta had had taken screenshots of the man's Facebook account before it was deleted, according to a report in the Times of India.
The report added that Mr Gupta, who works with people for animals, contacted friends of the man on Facebook to track them down and then approached the police with the man's mobile number and address.
"I had immediately saved the video and took screenshots of their Facebook profile. I knew they will deactivate their account if they get noticed. I had, therefore, started contacting their friends, who had liked that video," The report quoted Mr Gupta as saying.
Police arrested the man on Monday night.
Paula Bronstein via Getty Images Stanley McChrystal wrote in The New York Times that funding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting "shouldn't be pitted against spending more on improving our military.”
Retired United States Army General Stanley McChrystal published an impassioned op-ed in The New York Times on Wednesday, pleading with Washington to think twice before cutting funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).
“As our leaders in Washington confront tough decisions about our budget priorities, I urge them to continue federal funding for public broadcasting,” they said. “Public broadcasting makes our nation smarter, stronger and, yes, safer.”
The budget proposed by the Trump administration last month suggested cutting all federal funding to the CPB, which helps fund PBS and NPR. The CPB annually receives about $500 million from the federal government.
The Trump administration has said that the country must cut spending in places like CPB so it can afford to keep the country safe by raising military spending, which the White House proposed increasing in the next fiscal year by $54 billion. But McChrystal takes issue with that dichotomous approach to running the country.
The CPB, they said, is “a small public investment that pays huge dividends for Americans. And it shouldn't be pitted against spending more on improving our military.”
“That's a false choice.”
The 34-year veteran argued that public television teaches children to be “curious, resilient and empathetic,” filling a need by helpings kids learn “social-emotional skills like persistence and self-control” in homes where the parents aren't always around.
The suggested cuts to the CPB would hurt NPR and PBS, but prove devastating to local broadcast and radio stations, where more than 90 percent of CPB money is allocated. Many of those stations exist in more rural areas where educational resources are scarce, making them all the more valuable.
McChrystal retired from the military in 2010 after Rolling Stone published an unflattering profile of him, in which those around them were highly critical of President Barack Obama and others in the administration. They have since founded a consulting firm.
Last year, they said they would decline “any role” in the Trump administration. Today, they made clear that safety at home is established on different grounds than it is abroad.
Speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies today, CIA Director Mike Pompeo went off on WikiLeaks. Pompeo is pretty mad about that whole Vault 7 hacking tools data dump, it looks like. “WikiLeaks walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service,” they declared Thursday. I think they mean that it's a hostile intelligence service!
The declaration marked the Trump intelligence appointee's first public appearance since taking over at the CIA, as well as a major departure from Trump's unequivocal “I love WikiLeaks” campaign attitude. Prior to their current role at the head of the CIA, Pompeo was quite happy to cite WikiLeaks to support their hyper-partisan cause du jour, which Maine Senator Angus King brought up during their confirmation hearing earlier this year:
Mike Pompeo was sharing Wikileaks documents on their Congressional Twitter account less than a year ago pic.twitter.com/cl5P6vnXSE — Jessica Schulberg (@jessicaschulb) April 13, 2017
Now, Pompeo's tune has changed:
“It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is – a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia. In January of this year, our Intelligence Community determined that Russian military intelligence—the GRU—had used WikiLeaks to release data of US victims that the GRU had obtained through cyber operations against the Democratic National Committee. And the report also found that Russia's primary propaganda outlet, RT, has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks.”
Pompeo went on to equate Assange's slapdash WikiLeaks approach with Edward Snowden's carefully considered and by most accounts legitimate whistleblowing, which naturally they dismissed as “treachery” because it wasn't “discreet” enough. They went on to mutter some misleading stuff about Snowden's relationship with Russia:
“When Snowden absconded to the comfortable clutches of Russian intelligence, their treachery directly harmed a wide range of US intelligence and military operations. Despite what they claim, they are no whistleblower. True whistleblowers use the well-established and discreet processes in place to voice grievances; they do not put American lives at risk.”
Pompeo's definition of a “true whistleblower” aside, he's mad enough about this leaking business to propose a mostly fangless multi-pronged plan to combat Assange and their ilk.
First, they intend to “[call] out those who grant a platform to these leakers and so-called transparency activists” (we're not quite sure what that means). Second, they want to improve “internal mechanisms” for counterintelligence, to be “as clever and innovative as the enemies we face” (okay). Third, they proclaimed that “we can no longer allow Assange and their colleagues the latitude to use free speech values against us” (again, what this looks like in practice against a foreign entity is anyone's guess). And lastly, they want to deepen the trust between citizens and the CIA, which honestly is probably a good starting place!
Pompeo's sickest Assange burns, which are mostly hard to argue with:
“ Assange is the darling of terrorists.”
Assange is the darling of terrorists.” “Assange is a narcissist who has created nothing of value.”
“[His] currency is clickbait; [his] moral compass, nonexistent.”
currency is clickbait; [his] moral compass, nonexistent.” “I am quite confident that had Assange been around in the 1930s and 40s and 50s, they would have found themselves on the wrong side of history.”
Still, in perhaps the most remarkable moments of Pompeo's speech, they called The Washington Post and The New York Times “legitimate news organizations” and went on to cite criticism of Assange published on The Intercept, one of the most U.S. government-hostile publications of all. Because today is opposite day or a day to look strong on Russia but also those pesky “leakers” (except the ones who do you favors!) or a good day to cover your ass, or really we're not sure why, it's just what happened.
Dago Bailón remembers realizing they were undocumented, and what that would mean for their future.
They were a junior in high school. Their economics teacher had planned a trip to Hawai'i for an academic decathlon. In order to go, Bailón had to fill out a form. In order to fill out the form, they needed a social security number.
They didn't have one.
“I realized at that moment that I was not going to be able to be part of the program and that there was going to be more barriers to come,” they recall.
It made them feel like they were the only person who was facing those kinds of problems. “I just kind of shut down,” Bailón says.
But a couple of years later, a law passed by President Barack Obama — Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) — helped Bailón stay in the US.
And before that, circumstances had pushed them to become an activist. In 2006 they started campaigning against Arizona's Proposition 300, which took away scholarship opportunities due to their undocumented status. Bailón said the work gave them butterflies because it took acknowledging their status in public. It was both liberating and very scary.
It was the same feeling they had when they came out as gay.
“I was going public about my status. I felt uncertain, I felt like I was gonna lose a lot of my friends,” they say. “I felt alone again … and when I came out of the closet it was the same feeling. Those butterflies that I thought had gone away had not.”
Bailón was 23 when they came out to their parents.
“My parents didn't take it lightly. I had to sit them down and really talk to them,” they say. “I realized that they were really important in my life and that I wanted them to be part of my life. I sat them down and told them that it had been 23 years of lying and suffering, and that I wanted to wake up the next day feeling like a complete person, and that meant that I needed to tell them that I was gay. My mom cried and my dad pretended not to hear, but in the end my mom said ‘what kind of parents would we be if we didn't support things that you do.'”
In a way, Bailón came out twice: as undocumented, and as gay. They soon realized that experience wasn't so rare — and it still isn't. In last weekend's mass shooting at an Orlando gay club, some of the victims weren't out to their families, either.
Today, they offer guidance to other immigrants who want to come out, and helps parents of these immigrants accept their children. Their group is called Trans-Queer Pueblo, and it focuses on working with families.
“We understand that when we come out of the closet, also our parents are forced out of the closet with us,” Bailón says. “We have a family acceptance program in which we educate parents about identities and the curriculum that we have is rooted in our migrant and people of color experiences. … [With] our parents there is a lot to work with. There is a lot of love and we have to start from there.”
Bailón is featured in a documentary by Venezuelan filmmaker Juan Freitez and produced by Guatemalan Journalist Pita S. Juarez. You can watch a preview below.

Over the years I've ended up with quite a few sample-size tubes of toothpaste. I dislike the strong, lingering flavors of most of these toothpastes, so I normally use Tom's of Maine (or Trader Joe's equivalent, but not Tom's of Finland) plain mint toothpaste. As a result, I had a bunch of old tubes which were past expiration and needing to be thrown out. 23 tubes (and four small sample packs), in fact.
Before throwing them out I decided to squeeze them all into one bowl. Next I stirred it all together, found that a spoon will almost stand up in it, then put some on my toothbrush and brushed my teeth with it.
This multi-sample toothpaste concoction didn't taste bad, but was overwhelmingly mint backed by a few other unidentifiable herbs. Even after rinsing my mouth a number of times the taste still lingers, but this matches my experience (and complaint) with all of the Colgate, Crest, etc toothpastes I've tried in the past.
Now to figure out how to dispose of it. Maybe dumping it in the trash then attempting to wash the bowl…
Here's an index of the photos taken of the 23 Tubes 1 Bowl ‘experiment':
For reference, the following brands / models of toothpaste were used:
I've made a decision, I'm diving back into the world of Mass Effect before the release of Andromeda. It's not a hard decision to make really, these games mean a lot to me and have had a profound impact on my life. I'm going back into them so that when I play Andromeda I will have a fresh sense of what the original trilogy was really like, not how I fondly remember it being.
I'll be honest, though, I am omitting the first Mass Effect game from my playthrough and won't be reviewing it. Not because it is bad, quite the contrary. I've made this decision for a number of reasons, including:
Mass Effect has an RPG Adventure Genre, while ME2 & 3 have an action adventure genre, which is similar to what ME:I will contain (I assume)
I still have trophies to earn in the original Mass Effect, and I would prefer to not let my love of meaningless achievements cloud up my playthrough
I've played the first Mass Effect game many times over, much more so than 2 & 3, and so I feel I will gain little from replaying it other than nostalgia and trophies
With Andromeda coming out in about 5 weeks time, and each game taking anywhere between 20-50 hours to complete, I am in a bit of a time crunch.
So my journey will begin with Mass Effect 2. This review will contain lots of topics and subtopics, and will either be super short or super long. Because Mass Effect 2 is mostly a character driven story, there will be a lot of discussion about the characters you come across. As such, each character will have their or their (or its) own section. I'll also touch on the main missions outside of character collection and retention, as well as key gameplay mechanics.
One last thing before we start. Mass Effect has a rich history in my life. I've been in love with the characters, the story, and the worlds for the past five years, and have no intention of falling out of love. As such, there will occasionally be references to past emotions, previous playthroughs, or asides to how things could have gone had I made different decisions. One of the neat things about Mass Effect is that almost everything matters, even if it is in the tiniest of ways.
Also spoilers, so stop reading Sam.
The Prologue
“She's one woman, one very specific woman…”
It was a snowy Sunday afternoon when I loaded my Mass Effect 2 disc up on my Playstation 3™ system. The game installed and I began to think about the journey before me. How would I play? Who would I invite to my cabin to bang? Who wouldn't I invite? Will I enjoy a now seven-year-old game as much as I did when I was a youthful boy who had their best years ahead of him? A lot of uncertainty, a lot of doubt.
One thing that is highly celebrated in the trilogy is the opening to Mass Effect 2. It is regarded as the best introduction in the series, and in last generation games by some. Looking back to my first playthrough, it was very powerful. I played the game immediately having beaten Mass Effect 1 and was riding high on kicking some Reaper behind. For those of you who don't know, the game opens with your ship and crew being absolutely decimated by an unknown enemy. You see the original Normandy be torn apart, and you're forced to evacuate the ship. Depending on certain choices from the first game, a squad mate will appear in the opening, your love interest, or Liara, if no love interest had been taken in ME1.
The cinematic and score were definitely moving, and walking through the old Normandy as it burns and falls apart is quite the experience. Most notably when you reach the old Galaxy Map, all sound is drowned out, other than your own breathing, as the room is open to the vacuum of space. It's quite an experience. Anyways you get Joker and tell them to stop being stupid and to abandon ship. Long story short, Joker survives, you don't. Shepard is thrown from the husk of the Normandy and begins to fall slowly and slowly to the planet below. You've died.
Now normally, most players jump to the next segment of the game, but because I did not import a character, a small graphic comic loaded up that detailed the events Mass Effect 1, and let me make the choices that would matter in ME2. This was very jarring and took me out of the moment, but it did allow me to set the game up in the way I wanted, so for that, I did appreciate it. I made the following choices:
Romanced Kaidan
Left Ashley to die on Virmire
Saved Wrex (You're welcome Dada Spez)
Killed the Rachni Queen
Saved the council
Choose Udina to join the council
I made these choices mainly because I want my Shepard to be a soldier, through and through. Not much of a goodie-two-shoes or a dick, but just a girl trying to get the job done. Hence I killed the Rachni queen because it made military sense, and saved the council thinking it as saving military heads of state.
After the comic was done, the game continued as normal. Shepard wakes in a Cerberus facility after being revived with the “Lazarus Project”. As a veteran of the series, I know now that the writing of Mass Effect is not perfect, in some big ways and some little ones. It never quite sat right with me that they revived Shepard in this way. Mass Effect is (mostly) grounded in reality, and this is a little too much science fiction here, but whatever.
So you wake up, you shoot some robots, you meet an armed black man who is also shooting robots, and you get some instructions from a stern but sexy lady. You learn that someone within the station is a traitor and is staging the attack. This section acts as the tutorial, but I found it to be pretty clunky. In fairness, I find most tutorials are clunky. For example, I would complete an objective like “Take cover!” before Miranda would finish telling me what to do, and the dialogue would cut out and they would start their next instruction.
As far as opening missions go, it's pretty standard, action-packed and fairly quick. Along the way, you meet a guy named Wilson, who helped revive Shep, and they join you as you and Jacob try to escape. At the end of the mission, Miranda shows up and caps them straight in the dome for no reason. This is the first instance where I really feel that the game trips over itself. You are able to object to the random execution (sort of), but you can't ask for nor are you provided any proof that Wilson was the traitor and deserved to die. Shepard just kind of accepts it. The game gives you dialogue options during this encounter, and Miranda and Jacob talk about how it was all for you, and that you're the most important person to them right now. I suggested we go back to look for survivors, and RBF Miranda looks at me and says “Listen this is the only shuttle out of here so unless you want to rot here I suggest you come with me.” UH EXCUSE ME? You literally just said I'm the MOST important person and I'm all that matters, and now you are threatening to leave me to die? Lazy writing, nothing else can be said.
So you are forced to leave with Jacob and Miranda, and they take you to see the Illusive Man. Along the way they talk a little, you find out a little more about Miranda's crappy demeanor, and you kind of glaze over while Jacob tries to talk to you. It's something to be said that the worst companions Shepard normally has been both starting characters and humans, and have similar traits. Ashley and Miranda are loud mouth racists and Jacob and Kaidan are soulless hunky husks of men.
You meet the Illusive Man, the only interesting character in the game so far, and they give you a little backstory to what's been going on. Humans are going missing, it's up to you to find out why. This is the story to the game. It's simple and straightforward. I appreciate the game for being very blunt about it. I think it works a bit better than ME1's story overall, as it allows for time between main missions that makes sense. What I mean by that is that in this scenario, Shepard can do a side quest or help out a friend, because he's waiting for the next clue or the next attack. Where as with the first game, it's not very logical for you to not be hunting down Saren at every opportunity.
Tim (The Illusive Man), sends you along to a colony that has recently been abducted. There you find an old crew member, Tali, who is surprisingly calm about you not being a burnt corpse anymore. Tali and their crew are looking for a fellow Quarian, who acts as a witness to the disappearance of all the humans. You propose a team up, but the other Quarians don't trust you and rush off ahead.
I would not call Mass Effect an overly violent game, but man there is some gore in this section. The quarians run into a mech which rips them to shreds. A most memorable moment is when the mech steps on a Quarian and blows their head off with its arm shotgun, covering the mech in blood. It's awesome.
Anyways, mech goes boom, you go “yay!” and you find the witness who explains how the humans were abducted. The crew realizes the mysterious race of Collectors are at fault, and we don't yet know why.
After a brief discussion with Tim, you reconnect with Joker, who has joined Cerberus to pilot for you, along with a brand spanking new Normandy. The prologue ends with you jetting into space to a very moving soundtrack.
The Verdict
“Damn it, Shepard, I trusted you!”
Aside from a writing hiccup and bland companions, the only other thing I have to critique is the graphics. I know the game is from 2010 and the way it looks should be taken with a grain of salt. The facial models are for the most part very good, and stand up well. But holy cow did I notice some issues with mouth movements. And teeth in this game look like the fences in Paperboy.
All in all, the opening sucked me back into the world again. The loading screens even gave me a feeling of emotional nostalgia. I'm very much looking forward to reintroducing myself to these characters, both good and bad, and referencing this experience to old impressions and additional lore.

Two members plan to raise money and meet local supporters in Sydney and Melbourne this week
Two members of the extreme far-right Greek political party Golden Dawn will arrive in Australia this week to raise money and meet local supporters.
A member of the European parliament, Geor­gios Epi­tideios, and a party organiser, Michalis Gian­nagkonas, will land in Australia “in the coming days” for a series of events in Sydney and Melbourne, Golden Dawn's Australian representative has confirmed.
Ignatius Gavrilidis said the pair's trip to Australia – which has been denounced by senior members of the Greek community – would be “a stealth visit, very under the radar”.
They said that Gian­nagkonas and Epi­tideios, a former lieutenant-general in the Greek army, will meet party activists in Sydney at the weekend and in Melbourne next week.
“They're here to meet their supporters and inform them of what's going on overseas,” they said. “The truth needs to be told; a lot of people are misinformed.”
Gavrilidis said the ultra-nationalist organisation was also trying to arrange meetings with Greek and Jewish community leaders who had been critical of the party in the past, but would not say if these efforts had been successful.
“We're hoping people who have been very anti-Golden Dawn will sit privately and ask all the questions that they wish,” they said.
Guardian Australia reported in September that the party's local supporters were raising money and running food and clothing drives through an unregistered charity named Voithame Tin Ellada (We Are Helping Greeks).
Gavrilidis said at the time the local fundraising was aimed at maintaining the party's work building support among Greek citizens hit hard by the country's economic crisis.
VTE was shut down after the report sparked a backlash, but posts advertising a Golden Dawn “Christmas fundraising drive” attached to a Greek bank account continue to circulate on social media.
To enter the country, the two men will have to pass a character test that bans visitors who have “an association with an individual, group or organisation suspected of having been, or being, involved in criminal conduct” or might “incite discord in the Australian community”.
Labor MP Michael Danby said they had asked the immigration minister, Scott Morrison, to “deny them visas”. Morrison's department has been contacted for comment.
The party has only a handful of supporters in Australia, but has built links to homegrown white nationalist groups, such as the Australia First Party.
Golden Dawn's entire parliamentary cohort was arrested in police raids last year after an anti-fascist rapper, Pavlos Fyssas, was murdered in September 2013, allegedly by thugs affiliated with the party.
Last month, Greece's public prosecutor said all 16 parliamentary Golden Dawn members should stand trial for criminal offences, including murder, weapons charges and attacks on immigrants, gay people and political opponents.
The prosecutor's 700-page report outlined alleged attacks on Egyptian and Pakistani migrant workers and claimed the party's boss, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, had expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler.
Despite the crackdown, the party made significant gains in European elections in May, capturing 9.4% of the vote and three seats in the Brussels parliament.
An organiser with the Melbourne Anti-Fascist Initiative, Alex Kakafikas, said activists were trying to find out where the Australian events would be held.
“We're planning something that's going to let them know their politics aren't welcome here,” they said.
But representatives of the Greek and Jewish communities denied they had been approached by Golden Dawn.
“The leading organisations of the Australian Greek and Jewish communities are united in the view that Golden Dawn's hate-filled ideology, and violent methods, have no legitimate place in contemporary Australia,” Peter Wertheim, the head of the executive council of Australian Jewry, said.
“One hopes that the Australian government will not provide Golden Dawn with the opportunity to spread its racist message in our country,” they said.
The first-ever in-depth analysis of Martian dirt reveals a mineralogical makeup similar to that of Hawaiian volcanic soils, researchers announced October 30.
The results come from NASA's Mars rover Curiosity, which recently studied a scoop of Red Planet dirt with its Chemistry and Mineralogy instrument, or CheMin, for the first time.
"This Martian soil that we've analyzed on Mars just this past week appears mineralogically similar to some weathered basaltic materials that we see on Earth," David Bish, a CheMin co-investigator with Indiana University, told reporters. They cited as an example the "weathered soils on the flanks of Mauna Kea in Hawaii."
CheMin is one of 10 science instruments that Curiosity is using to determine if its Gale Crater landing site could ever have supported microbial life. CheMin studies soil and powdered rock samples using a technique called X-ray diffraction, which reads the structure of minerals by interpreting how X-rays bounce off of them. [Gallery: Latest Photos from Curiosity]
What was expected
X-ray diffraction is standard practice for geologists here on Earth, but Curiosity is the first robot ever to employ it on another planet, researchers said. The mission team had to shrink the necessary gear from the size of a refrigerator down to that of a shoebox to get CheMin to fit on the car-size rover, which landed on Mars in August.
"We can tell you, first of all, what minerals are present, and secondly, how much of each mineral is there," said CheMin principal investigator David Blake, of NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif. "So it's really the first full-up quantitative instrument for doing this work on Mars."
CheMin's first results—obtained using soil Curiosity scooped at a site called "Rocknest"—aren't terribly surprising, researchers said.
"Much of Mars is covered with dust, and we had an incomplete understanding of its mineralogy," Bish said in a statement. "We now know it is mineralogically similar to basaltic material, with significant amounts of feldspar, pyroxene and olivine, which was not unexpected. Roughly half the soil is non-crystalline material, such as volcanic glass or products from weathering of the glass."
The sample contains at least two components: particles distributed globally by Martian dust storms and sand that appears to have originated locally, in Gale Crater. In contrast to the conglomerate rocks Curiosity discovered a month or so ago, there is no evidence of strong interaction with liquid water in the Rocknest sample, researchers said.
"So far, the materials Curiosity has analyzed are consistent with our initial ideas of the deposits in Gale Crater recording a transition through time from a wet to dry environment," Bish said. "The ancient rocks, such as the conglomerates, suggest flowing water, while the minerals in the younger soil are consistent with limited interaction with water."
Next up
Curiosity has been at Rocknest for about a month. During this time, the $2.5 billion rover has been gearing up for its first scooping activities and preparing to use CheMin and its Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument for the first time.
Like CheMin, SAM sits on Curiosity's body and analyzes samples dropped in by the rover's 7-foot-long (2.1 meters) robotic arm. SAM can identify organic compounds, the carbon-containing building blocks of life as we know it.
The first SAM soil results should come in soon, mission scientists said.
"We hope to be at this location for about another week, and today we will begin the uplinking process for the part of the experiment that feeds the sample eventually to the SAM instrument," said Curiosity lead scientist John Grotzinger, of Caltech in Pasadena. "About a week or 10 days from now, we should be getting data back from the conclusion of that."
SAM has already been sniffing the Martian atmosphere for traces of methane, a gas that is commonly produced by living organisms here on Earth. The mission team isn't ready to announce any results from this activity yet but should be soon.
"Stay tuned," Grotzinger said.
While at Rocknest, Curiosity has also been studying Red Planet rocks with some of its cameras and other instruments.
For example, last week the rover blasted a miniature system of natural arches — dubbed "Stonehenge" by some mission team members — with the laser on its ChemCam instrument. ChemCam determines mineral composition by analyzing the vaporized bits this laser produces.
Curiosity landed inside Gale Crater on Aug. 5. Its main destination is the base of Mount Sharp, the 3.4-mile-high (5.5 km) mountain rising from the crater's center. Mars-orbiting spacecraft have spotted signs that Mount Sharp's foothills were exposed to liquid water long ago.
These interesting deposits lie about 6 miles (10 km) from Curiosity's landing site. Scientists want the rover to perform its first drilling activity at or near Rocknest, but Curiosity should start heading toward Mount Sharp when that's done — perhaps around the end of the year, Grotzinger has said.

During the last few years, Granite Staters looking up at the sky have seen some pretty strange, unexplained things including triangle shaped flying objects and orbs that appear to dance in the sky.
And just three days ago, more dancing light orbs were seen and photographed just above the skyline over the Steeplegate Mall in Concord.
Mike Pittaro posted the latest sighting on Facebook – a 3-plus minute video shot above the Home Depot area of the plaza at just after 7 p.m. on Sept. 21, 2015. Pittaro stated in the recording that they were unable to see the orbs with the naked eye but when looking through their camera, could seem the orbs clearly. The video was shot after the sun was setting and dusk began to set in. Pittaro noted that they and their wife had irregularly taken photos of the sunset but had never seen anything like this before.
"My wife started taking photos of the sunset and caught the UFOs," they wrote in the thread. "These objects were NOT visible to the naked eye. After asking multiple people to use their cellphones, they too caught the exact same UFOs, verifying what we were recording. My wife and I have a good amount of video and photos between us, and what I shared here is what I felt was the best of what we filmed."
Pittaro and their wife also posted photos on their Flickr account: https://www.flickr.com/photos/135700660@N06/21736649635/
The light orbs were in the sky and situated in a stationary area while shifting positions for most of the video. The orbs appeared, at times, to break off into smaller lights. At one point in the video, some lights broke off from the main cluster and then a couple of minutes later, reappeared. Pittaro had a friend enlarge some screenshots from the original video in order to examine the orbs up close. The enlargements revealed silver-gray metal masses with rounded edges.
More than 3,000 people have shared the video on Facebook since it was posted. Other commenters in the thread also stated that they had seen the light orbs previously in the sky, too. The National UFO Center has also recorded other recent light sightings in New Hampshire.
About this time in 2014, a number of New Hampshire residents reported seeing unidentified aircraft in the sky in Concord, other capital region communities, and Nashua.
In October 2014, the Bowe family tracked this craft along the Everett Turnpike in Nashua. They later had a family member put together a graphic design of what they saw in the sky.
A few days later, Ben Speigel took pictures of lights above the North End of Concord. A Patch reader from Boscawen, Brad-Leah Seigars, saw similar lights a few days later in their community and submitted photos to Patch. Similar lights were reportedly seen this spring, as well.
Here's the original video:

An Indiana teen who went on a murderous crime spree inspired by the 2013 horror film "The Purge" is now facing the death penalty, prosecutors said.
Jonathan Cruz, 19, is accused of murdering three people and robbing another at gunpoint in May. Cruz allegedly told family and friends they were "purging" and chose their victims completely at random.
"The killings which have occurred here are beyond senseless," prosecutor Terry Curry said during a news conference Tuesday.
"Quite simply, we allege that these were killings for sport."

Cruz shot and killed Billy Boyd, 54, and Jay Higginbotham, 40, in the early hours of May 12 and gunned down Jose Ruiz, 44, three days later, prosecutors say. They face a total of 17 charges including armed robbery and intimidation.

Witnesses say Cruz was a drug dealer bragging about shooting and robbing several people while "purging," a reference to the 2013 Ethan Hawke movie, according to court documents.
They were originally arrested on May 16 in connection to a separate case in which they allegedly got into an altercation with a woman at a Wendy's and kidnapped her, forcing them to drive them and their friends around.
A woman who said Cruz was their drug dealer told police they had tried to show them a video of their killings but they refused to watch.
‘The Purge: Election Year' doesn't get our endorsement
They said there were audible gunshots and the video showed a body falling.
In "The Purge," a fictional authoritarian U.S. government legalizes all crime for one night each year and makes emergency services unavailable.
Cruz also texted their mother after the May 12 shootings and sent their screenshots of a news story about the killings when they asked them how they were doing, according to court documents.
Police found several photos and videos on Cruz's phone of them threatening people with their revolver and using the n-word repeatedly.
"U Better go on Face book and watch da videos of me shootin people," Cruz allegedly texted their girlfriend. "I Purge every night now."

James McHaffie has climbed the long standing slate project The Meltdown to give the UK its hardest slab route at around 9a.

James McHaffie on 'The Meltdown' - The UK's hardest slab route, and possibly 9a Jack Geldard - UKC Chief Editor, Jul 2012 © Jack Geldard The route, a bolted sport line in Tyll Mawr, near Llanberis, North Wales, is on the wall underneath the famous Quarryman groove, taking a line to the right of the first pitch of The Quarryman.
The climbing on The Meltdown starts off at a slightly easier standard (around 7c) to a rest by a small roof, and then is continuously desperate to just below the chains.
James fell several times from a particularly difficult move leftwards (see video below) just after the start of the hard climbing, but has been able to do all the moves on the route for quite some time, however linking them all together was proving difficult.
Yesterday, Monday the 9th, on their third attempt of the day, they climbed the whole line in one push, commenting:
"There's a 6b move just before the chains, and at the point you're way out above the bolt. It's E6 just for that bit. As for the overall sport grade, I'm not sure, it's around 8c+ or 9a. Not sure about 9a as it didn't take me as long as I expected."
The line was first attempted and bolted by Johnny Dawes when they were climbing at their prime, during the time that they were very active on the slate. Johnny came close to completing the route, but never quite ticked it.
McHaffie has been training hard for this route, as although it is a slab, it requires extreme fitness, finger strength and core strength to maintain tension throughout the long sequences of hard moves.
McHaffie, known more for their hard trad onsights (he was out onsighting E7 at Pembroke last week on their 'rest days') has previously climbed 9a with their ascent of The Big Bang, and now with The Meltdown has perhaps added another 9a to their CV. Although they are reticent about offering a grade of 9a, the route is known to be extremely hard.
Twll Mawr (which means 'big hole' in English) is the biggest of the slate holes in the Dinorwig quarries, and is home to many hard routes such as The Quarryman (E8 7a) and Coeur de Lion (E8 7a) as well as being one of the first parts of the slate quarries to be climbed, when it was explored by Joe Brown and friends in the early 1970's. It is fitting that this major crag is now home to perhaps one of the hardest routes of its type in the world.

SAN ANTONIO, TX--(Marketwired - Sep 9, 2015) - GenSpera, Inc. ( OTCQB : GNSZ ) today announced that interim data from its Phase II study of mipsagargin (G-202) in adult patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma has demonstrated impressive activity in patients to date. The two-stage, single-arm, open-label study (NCT02067156) is led by David Piccioni, M.D., Ph.D. and Santosh Kesari, M.D., Ph.D. at the UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center in La Jolla, CA.
"It's extremely gratifying to have yet another strong indication that mipsagargin continues to work as designed," said Craig Dionne, Ph.D., chief executive officer at GenSpera. "These interim data corroborate the data previously obtained in advanced liver cancer patients and validates our proposition that mipsagargin is likely to become an important drug for patients with various types of solid tumors."
The interim Phase II data demonstrate that mipsagargin confers clinical benefit to a subset of patients and that activity may correlate with the level of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression in the primary tumor. Mipsagargin is activated by the enzyme PSMA, which is highly expressed in some glioblastoma tumor vasculature.
"We are excited and encouraged by the results we are seeing with mipsagargin, a novel vascular-targeted prodrug, in recurrent glioblastoma patients," said Santosh Kesari, MD, PhD, the principal investigator of the study. "These early signs of drug activity viewed using MRI imaging showcase a significant reduction in tumor size and swelling, both positive indicators that the drug is doing exactly what it was designed to do. We have informed the Food and Drug Administration that mipsagargin's mechanism of action has the potential to be effective across all solid cancer tumors that express PSMA."
"Our Company is at an inflection point in its life cycle and it is now time to be valued on the merits of mipsagargin, and the intellectual property platform that we have created," said Craig Dionne. "I'm confident about mipsagargin's future, and we look forward to expanding our trials and partnership prospects."
About Mipsagargin
Mipsagargin is a prodrug in human clinical trials for several different tumor types. Mipsagargin consists of a thapsigargin derivative, 12ADT, coupled to a peptide that helps solubilize the prodrug and prevents its internalization into cells until the peptide is removed. The mechanism of action targets the enzyme PSMA, which is highly expressed on the surface of almost all cancer tumor vasculature, including those of glioblastoma. PSMA recognizes and removes the peptide, releasing the active ingredient 12ADT into the cell and bringing about cell death. The prodrug delivery system ensures that mipsagargin is activated only within the tumor, thus providing greater anti-tumor efficacy and minimizing side effects.
About Glioblastoma
Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in humans. There are approximately 10,000 new cases of malignant glioblastoma diagnosed each year in the United States and, despite optimal treatment, the median survival for these patients is only 12 - 15 months. Treatment commonly consists of surgery followed by radiation and the drug temozolomide. A few drugs have been approved in patients that have recurrent tumors, but none have been shown to promote long-term tumor stabilization or survival. Glioblastomas are particularly resistant to conventional chemotherapy drugs as most cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. This disadvantage of conventional chemotherapy does not apply to mipsagargin because mipsagargin directly attacks the PSMA-expressing cells of the tumor-associated blood vessels that comprise the blood-brain barrier.
About GenSpera
GenSpera, Inc. is a San Antonio-based biotech company that unlocks conventional thinking to conceive, design, and develop cancer therapies. GenSpera's technology platform combines a powerful, plant-derived cytotoxin (thapsigargin) with a patented prodrug delivery system that provides for targeted release of drug candidates within tumors. GenSpera's lead drug candidate, mipsagargin, was granted Orphan Drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013 for evaluation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer).

Morrissey's previous North American tours were derailed due to an array of health issues. Now, just two days into their latest jaunt, he's found themselves facing an entirely different obstacle: other bands.
Moz is due to play The Observatory in Santa Ana, CA this evening. Inside the venue is a second music space, dubbed The Constellation Room, where We Are Scientists and PAWS are scheduled to perform. According to PAWS' Facebook page, Morrissey made an attempt to have their show canceled, “because they are playing in another room in the same venue and wishes for their to be no other artists performing in their vicinity.”
Update – Friday, 5:30am PT: Paws has issued a detailed account of last night's events. Read it here.
Update – Thursday, 5:00pm PT: PAWS has removed their Facebook post. According to the band's publicist, the band will, in fact, perform tonight as originally planned.
Meanwhile, We Are Scientists said they've changed their set times to accommodate Morrissey's “bedtime.” They expanded on the day's events in an issued statement:
Chris from W.A.S. here. Happy to confirm that PAWS' are back on. When it became apparent that Morrissey's set was going to overlap with the WAS/PAWS bill, everybody really did agree that couldn't work — even though the two venues are separated by a reasonably thick wall, Moz fans wouldn't have been able to hear a lick of what they'd paid to see. Both bands on our bill play at nuclear volume, triumphant volume, and it goes right through walls. Putting on the two shows simultaneously would be like screening a mumblecore film and a Michael Bay movie in theaters divided by a cotton bed sheet. So we've moved the WAS/PAWS show a little later, which will probably come as a nice surprise to our fans, many of whom have had to set their alarms especially early this afternoon in order to make the show.

It's the day after the premiere and after party for their latest film, Whiplash, and Miles Teller has certainly felt better. “Hungover,” they admit as they arrive to meet up at their neighborhood coffee spot in Hollywood. But this guy deserves a wild night out: For the last two years, the 27-year-old has been ricocheting between thoughtful indies like The Spectacular Now and big-budget studio affairs like Divergent, culminating in this weekend's Whiplash, Damien Chazelle's riveting drama that debuted to raves (and awards) at January's Sundance Film Festival. Teller stars as Andrew, a jazz drummer at an elite music conservatory who wants so badly to be a musical great that they not only forfeits all personal relationships, they also withstand the emotional and physical abuse of a fiercely intimidating instructor (J.K. Simmons).
Teller shares not only Andrew's musical talent, but also their drive. They say they haven't taken a break in two years, and after making the promotional rounds for Whiplash (for which he's drumming up Oscar buzz), he'll head to Rhode Island to shoot the indie boxing drama Bleed for This. He's already wrapped two other potential big hits: Next year's Divergent follow-up, Insurgent, and the new Fantastic Four reboot, in which he'll star as Reed Richards. As if that wasn't enough to keep them occupied, Teller also had to deal with an online brouhaha last month, when they were quoted as saying they felt “dead inside” after wrapping Divergent, forcing the Philadelphia-area native to vehemently (and very frankly) defend himself. “In all my interviews, I am very candid,” they told Yahoo Movies. “I don't censor myself, but also I'm very proud of the career I have. I'm not a f—king bad person. I don't think I'm better than anybody so I don't really worry too much about what comes out of my mouth.” Indeed, Teller didn't hold back as we peppered them with questions about their life in the movies.
How much musical experience did you have prior to Whiplash?
I grew up playing piano, then I played saxophone for a little bit. I was in the high school band, and I had a drum set when I was, like, 15. I never took a drum lesson — I took piano and saxophone lessons. But I always took my drum kit with me.
You had a high-school rock band as well, right?
Yeah. We called ourselves The Mutes, because we were playing at homecoming court, and right when we were supposed to start jamming out, the power in our generators went out.
And how would you rate your skills now? Could you go out there and vibe with a jazz band?
If they were playing [Hank Levy's] “Whiplash” or [Duke Ellington's] “Caravan,” I could, because I know those songs pretty much by heart. It's hard, though. Jazz is the highest form of percussion.
In Whiplash, Andrew drums so hard that their hands bleed. Did actually happen to you during filming?
Yeah. I'd show up on set, and there would be blood on the cymbals and all this s—t. I'm like, “Damien [who is a former jazz musician], how realistic is this? I don't want to lose our audience by just being this outlandish with it.” But they said that, when they were playing all the time, their hands were all torn up. And when I started practicing four hours a day for weeks [for the film], I started getting blood blisters. So it was pretty real.
How much of the on-screen drumming did you actually perform?Apart from a couple of inserts [with a stand-in] while I was doing something else, 90 percent of it is me. And then other times you have to sweeten up [the sound] in the studio because we didn't have the right mics [during filming].
The film was based on a short film Damien had made a year earlier. Did you talk to the actor [Johnny Simmons] who played your character in the original?
No. I didn't even watch the short until way after we were done filming. And I had never seen anything of Damien's. I just knew the script was really good.
J.K. Simmons is just ferocious in this film. He's constantly antagonizing you, sometimes very slyly and other times very outright. It's so different from that nurturing dad they played in Juno. Were you surprised to see them go so dark?
No. I've never seen them in anything. I never saw Juno. I've seen like five minutes of a lot of s—t. I know them from the Farmers Insurance commercials. Oh, [and] I saw them in Spider-Man.

Campaign finance law -- the creaky, leaky boundary between our political process and the trillions of dollars swirling around in our economy -- still affords some insights into how political forces wage their wars. For example, outside groups spending money on the presidential race must (within certain qualifications) report how much they spent and for or against whom. It's that "for or against" that's interesting, adding a little plus-minus variable to the numbers that tells us much more than we'd get just with a dollar sign.
The problem traditionally has been that parsing those reports is time-consuming. Enter ProPublica, the non-profit media site. It put together a nice little tool compiling those "independent expenditure" reports (as they're known), allowing us to more easily dive into the numbers.
And so we can see, relatively easily, how much money was spent against the top-tier Republican candidates since the beginning of the year. And when we do so, one name stands out.
This, folks, is what "stop Trump" looked like. Between the beginning of January and the beginning of May, independent groups spent $20.4 million against Trump that was reported to the Federal Election Commission.
The big money started to come in after Nevada.
Among the biggest spenders in the FEC reports were Our Principles PAC, a group started by a former Mitt Romney campaign staffer, which spent $18 million. Club for Growth's political arm spent $11.4 million. And American Future Fund, a PAC supporting John Kasich, spent $12 million.
And, again, that number doesn't capture everything. CNN's Jake Tapper cited reporting from Kantar Media indicating that over $75.7 million was spent running anti-Trump ads on network television.
Which means that far, far more was spent trying to keep Trump from the nomination than the $38 million Trump has reported loaning themselves so far.
One of those turned out to be a good investment.
Correction: ProPublica's tool limited daily independent expenditure listings to 20 in total. The article has been corrected to include all filings.
Hezbollah has raised the alert level among its fighters due to maneuvers conducted by the Israel Defense Forces in northern Israel , London-based Arabic-language al-Sharq al-Awsat newspaper reported Friday.
According to the report, the Shiite organization has instructed its men to take "general precautionary measures" for fear of a sudden Israeli attack targeting Hezbollah's headquarters and post.
Threats Nasrallah: War will change region's face AFP Hezbollah leader slams Israeli 'threats,' vows to defeat IDF in case of renewed hostilities on Lebanese border; Israel in trouble, Nasrallah says, promises 'great victory' in case of war Nasrallah: War will change region's face
The source refused to confirm or deny the reports that Hezbollah has raised its alert level, but the paper reported that the organization was on a heightened state of alert not only in southern Lebanon , but also on hills in eastern and western Lebanon overlooking the Lebanon Valley – Hezbollah's most important stronghold in the country.
Al-Sharq al-Awsat added that according to several reports, Syria has begun recruiting reserve forces, including among workers residing in Lebanon. According to the report, the laborers were requested to return to Syria and arrive at induction centers mentioned in the draft orders. The newspaper failed to get Damascus' response to this information and there is no official confirmation of this report from any other source.
The technology entrepreneurship ecosystem in Pakistan is at a tipping point! With this in mind, we decided to scout the most promising technology startups of Pakistan. The TechJuice team has divided the startups into three categories depending on their growth stage: Early-age, Mid-Stage and Late-Stage. This is the first post in the series.
Last year, we compiled the list of 10 Pakistani Startups that can make it Big where we featured some of the most promising startups at that time. This year has been particularly good for startups and we have seen many ideas and teams that have blown us away.
Early-age startups are those that are at seed or idea stage; these also include companies that are still struggling with their business model and haven't yet decided how to support the business. These companies typically have low, often single digit headcount and are still in the process of building out their products and entering early stages of market validation. They are typically bootstrapped or running on friends and family supplied capital. Some of the best early-age Pakistani startups are listed below. These startups have shown incredible potential and we believe that with a little more effort they can solve the problems they face now and go on to become successful businesses. Please note that these startups are not organized in any particular order.
1. InteraCta
Interacta is a startup that has set out to make waves. The team comprises of graduates from NUST and LUMS who are working on doing something new: making the broadcast content interactive. Their main tool in this exercise will be smartphones, something that millions of Pakistanis now own; they are hoping to revolutionize broadcast content as we know it. InteraCta, for example, could let you receive recipes as you watch a cooking show or answer questions alongside participants in a quiz competition. The advertisers could gain by pushing actionable advertisements to the users smartphones. However, Interacta is merely beginning its journey and still has a long way to go.
2. 3Restart
Children have immense potential and unfortunately, our education system as it is does almost nothing to mine the talent. However, people are beginning to rethink education. The recent Ilm Apps Challenge was a good preview of the plans that many Pakistanis have to change to education system. 3Restart was not only the winner at Islamabad Ilm Apps Challenge but has also received mentoring and guidance at Invest2Innovate. 3Restart's end goal is to come up with a game that will not only help in complimenting early childhood education through learning processes that enhance memory retention etc but will also help parents monitor their child's progress. The product is still in progress.
3. Jugnu.pk
Jugnu.pk is a smart school management system. Infact, WaysAll Technologies would have you believe that it is the best school management system out there because Jugnu can help out all the parties involved from the Principal to the students. It can definitely help in reducing paper work, something that all management systems do but it can also send an SMS home if the child is absent, can allow teachers to mark the progress of students and give students easy online access to their reports and results. Jugnu is now ready to jump in the business world through incubation at Plan9. We are looking forward to seeing how the idea develops into a strong startup.
4. TexSum
Another startup selected for Plan9 Incubator this time is TexSum, short for Text Summary. In the past few months, many different apps that allow readers to speed read or read a short summary of the main text have become very popular. Everybody can now vouch for the fact that there is too much to do and too little time so it makes a lot of sense to divide pages of information into chunks that can easily be understood and consumed quickly . This team from COMSAT Lahore is looking forward to doing exactly that. The text summarizing system will work in International as well as local languages. The good part is that TexSum already has some working prototypes.
5.Loop
Founded by Munir Ahmed and Ali Hassan, Loop is a platform where photographers in Pakistan can come together to explore art. Apart from allowing users to submit their art work, the platform allows people to rank and sell art, interact with other photographers and gain recognition for their work that can in turn lead to getting hired for event coverage. LOOP makes up for a void in the current market and that gives an edge to the startup. However, there are only a few good photographers and the current market is rather amateur. Another downside is that people prefer copying and printing pictures rather than paying for the copyright.

Freakish aggressive clowns, some allegedly armed with knives, pistols, and bats are driving French towns crazy, chasing down and attacking people.
In the southern port town of Agde, about 15 ‘clowns' were arrested in a high school car park for ‘laughing manically' while chasing people. In nearby Marseillan, a clown was detained for damaging a car.
In Montpellier: a ‘clown' beat a man 30 times with an iron bar and then stole their wallet. Three motorists in the area also complained of “scary clowns.”
The French freak-clown wave began in the north a couple of weeks ago, in suburban Douai. In Bethune, a fake clown got a six-month suspended jail term for threatening passers-by.
A French police statement blames the web. “Since mid-October, a rumor inspired by videos published on the Internet has created the presence of threatening and aggressive clowns in France. Symptomatic of the impact of the Internet, this phenomenon can lead to damaging individual acts and disturbances to public order”.
The ‘clown craze' is thought to have been triggered by a viral YouTube video and a recent episode of American Horror Story featuring a killer named Twisty.
Clown attack cases didn't begin in France though: London's Metropolitan Police dealt with 117 clown-related incidents in 2013.
In Portsmouth, UK, a masked figure began stroking passers-by in the city streets with a single red-gloved finger.
US police have also made dozens of clown-related arrests, most prevalent in California.

Galway RNLI Lifeboat came to the rescue of five swimmers who were attacked by a dolphin off Blackrock Tower at Salthill, Galway tonight.
A member of the public raised the alarm and contacted the Irish Coastguard who asked for Galway Lifeboat's assistance.
The lifeboat launched from the nearby Docks at about 7.25pm.
When they arrived at the scene five minutes later a local fishing vessel had separated the dolphin from the swimmers.
The lifeboat joined the fishing vessel in keeping the dolphin away from the swimmers until they made it safely ashore.
Reports from people who witnessed the incident say the dolphin had circled the swimmers then swam at them in an intimidating way and glancing off them, coming and going, with their tail and nose.
The swimmers were very shaken by the incident and one in particular was very shocked but did not require medical assistance.
Galway RNLI Lifeboat Helmsman Ciaran Oliver said the crew stayed in the area a while longer to ensure all swimmers got ashore and then did a sweep of the beach from Blackrock to Seapoint to warn others, assisted by additional lifeboat crew on the promenade.
The lifeboat crew on this call-out were Helmsman Ciaran Oliver, Stefanie Carr, David Badger and Sean King.
Listening to Theresa May's big Brexit speech last week, I remembered that the English have a taste for heroic failure. Their favourite poem, Rudyard Kipling's If, says that triumph and disaster are the same thing. It also enjoins the English to “lose, and start again at your beginnings/And never breathe a word about your loss.”
Losing everything – even life itself – and not whining about it is the English ideal of heroism. And I do wonder if this inherited ideal is not playing itself out in Brexit.
While everyone else is screaming “Stop! You're headed for disaster,” the stiff lips part just enough to say, “Ah, but we will treat it as a triumph and never breathe a word about our loss.”
Most of the modern English heroes, after all, are complete screw-ups. In their very entertaining and insightful book, Heroic Failure and the British, the historian Stephanie Barczewski says the exploits that have loomed largest in English consciousness since the 19th century are retreats or disasters: the Charge of the Light Brigade, the doomed Franklin expedition to find the Northwest Passage, “Scott of the Antarctic”, the “last stand” against the Zulus at Isandlwana, Gordon of Khartoum, the Somme, the flight from Dunkirk.
This culture of heroic failure they define as “a conscious sense of celebration of the striving for an object that was not attained”.
When everything falls apart
It requires, one might add, an ability not to feel sorry for oneself when everything falls apart.
The essence of English heroic failure is Capt Scott reflecting on their fast-approaching death at the Antarctic: “We took risks, we knew we took them. Things have come out against us, and therefore we have no cause for complaint, but bow to the will of Providence, determined still to do our best to the last.”
I bet Boris Johnson has these lines in their back pocket for use when the messianic hopes of Brexit go down in flames.
Now, it must be admitted that there is something lovable in this English capacity to embrace disaster. It is, for one thing, highly creative. It transforms ugly facts into beautiful fantasies.
Listen to Inside Politics
The charge of the Light Brigade was hideous idiocy. At the battle of Balaclava in the Crimean war in October 1854, the British cavalry charged, sabres aloft, at the Russian artillery, down a long valley that was also flanked by more Russian guns that could fire on them from above.
It was pure suicidal butchery: survivors wrote things like “never was such murder ordered”. But the English back home loved it. The prime minister Lord Palmerston described it as “glorious” and Alfred Tennyson wrote a poem that every schoolboy, even of my generation in republican Ireland, knew: “Theirs not to make reply,/ Theirs not to reason why,/ Theirs but to do and die.” Like the English working-class being led by their contemporary Tory blimps to charge the European artillery.
So what if they get mauled? It will be glorious – and shame on anyone who asks the reason why.
The problem, however, is that the original English cult of heroic failure was, paradoxically, a symptom of British power.
As Barczewski astutely notes: “Heroic failure . . . neither effected nor engendered decline; on the contrary it arose from British power and dominance, and from the need to provide alternative narratives that distracted from its real-life exploitative and violent aspects.”
Zombie cult
The English could afford to celebrate glorious failure because they were actually very successful – the myths of suffering and endurance covered up the truth that it was mostly other people who had to endure the suffering.
But the return to heroic failure in the psychology of Brexit is a perfect example of a mythic mindset surviving long after it has ceased to be useful.
The English are no longer dominant and powerful.They are a mid-sized, fairly average western European nation. They can't afford to indulge their inherited tastes for grandiose screw-ups. But they still have a sweet tooth for these empty calories.
Brexit is a perfect vehicle for this zombie cult. It fuses three of the archetypes of heroic English failure.
There is the last stand, exemplified by Gen George Gordon at Khartoum, another fiasco that quickly became a byword for heroism in the face of inevitable disaster: Brexit is imperial England's last last stand.
There is the suicidal cavalry charge: May hilariously threatened Europe that if it does not play nice, they and Boris will destroy its economic artillery with their flashing sabres.
And there is the doomed expedition into terra incognita to find a promised land. This kind of heroic failure is exemplified by Sir John Franklin's fatal search for the Northwest Passage in the 1840s.
The gods of history were surely sending a message when, just three months after the Brexit vote, they allowed Franklin's ship, HMS Terror, to be found at the bottom of an Arctic bay.
Yet, unheeding of this omen, HMS Brexit sets sail into uncharted waters, confident of finding the, as yet undiscovered, passage to the promised land where you can always have more cake even when you've eaten it.
How the nation will weep with pride when some future explorers discover its ghostly remains in the icy depths of reality.
It's not every day you see a group of 30-odd Aboriginal women in colourful dress on the streets of Melbourne. But then it's not every day 30-odd Aboriginal women get to attend the world premiere of a movie in which they star.
The Song Keepers is a remarkable and enormously enjoyable documentary about a rather improbable concert tour. In 2015, the Central Australian Aboriginal Women's Choir went to Germany, to sing the hymns that had been brought to this country in the 19th century by Lutheran missionaries. And they sang them in their own languages, Pitjantjatjara and Arrarnta, to a rapturous response.

"It's simultaneously contradictory," says director Naina Sen of their debut feature, which turns all the easy assumptions about the relationship between Indigenous and occupying cultures on their head. "You do have all the colonial stuff, but you also have this preservation of language, and sacred music, and a culture that already has sacred songs taking on another culture's sacred songs."
This choir is a relic, the last of a once-thriving scene. Lutheran missionaries translated 53 German hymns within three years of arriving in the outback in 1877, and those hymns were sung – religiously, you might say – by a plethora of choirs right up to the 1970s. But when the men drifted into country music, the choirs first became women-only and then began to dwindle.
(Fort Collins, CO) – This is a first.
BeerPulse discovered on Monday via label approval that New Belgium is expanding distribution to Utah and British Columbia this year.
Approval of “commemorative labels” celebrating the company's entry into a new market generally follows an official announcement some weeks or months later but in this case, New Belgium has not yet reported that it is expanding distribution to these markets.
New Belgium recently announced that it is pushing back its North Carolina opening, potentially as late as 2016, due to additional capacity being installed at its Fort Collins location.
The company has ramped up new markets in recent months adding Louisiana and Alaska earlier this year and Florida next month.
Meanwhile, Craft Business Daily reports that New Belgium has moved from Major Brands to Summit Distributing (MillerCoors wholesaler) in St. Louis, Missouri.
A spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.

This is a seriously tough decision. There are maybe 5 or 6 cards which are unpickable here, which makes for a tough decision. Not that every pick is as good as others, and there are certainly wrong picks you can make from the 11 passable cards, but I could see some arguments being made. On the very edge is Detention Sphere, a good o-ring variant but one you can never take 1st as it is two colors. Sublime Archangel is chilling with the Sphere, as the angel is able to take over games through itself or pulling the strings on a smaller creature, but it dies to so much and is pretty average against a board that can block a single attacker on the ground or in the air with ease. Aetherling and Yosei are nice as finishers but are one of a million and on the back end of that mill to boot.
The cards I'm actually considering are Karn Liberated, Upheaval, Snapcaster Mage, Golgari Signet, Celestial Colonnade, Sword of Body and Mind, Sneak Attack, and True-Name Nemesis. I chose this pack to write on because there really wasn't anything that caught my eye way more so than another card, and the top-end stuff is top tier and worth putting next to the cheaper spells. Staying open by taking a colorless card could be the correct choice above one of the million blue spells and they might not deserve a spot in the above list no matter what, but with so much blue in the pack it's doubtful that 7 players go into blue. (Though if it's cut hard the signal will be clear.)
True-Name Nemesis is probably the last of these cards I would take, to no fault of its own. TNN is stupid good and is way better in cube than it is in legacy where you often have way less time to land a TNN onto the board. While cube is fast you are rarely facing combo decks that have you dead in the first few turns and against the blistering fast decks True-Name comes down early enough to stop the bleeding against most starts. True-Name could certainly be better than a lot of the other cards I am thinking about, and even though it's a three-drop TNN excels at every point in the game. For me, True-Name Nemesis is boring in comparison to what else I could be doing. A 3/1 that can be impossible to deal with is super brutal, and passing them means I could be getting hit in the face by a merfolk in my near future, but it just feels…vanilla. True-Name Nemesis is also beatable, getting crushed by edicts and wraths, so sometimes the all-in plan can falter before it starts. And though True-Name is perfectly awesome in a slower blue build, he's much better in the blue decks that want to attack a bunch with their own cheap creatures, something that isn't always up my alley.
Moving down the boring “blue” line is Celestial Colonnade, the pick I would make if some of the much-higher impact cards weren't in here. Disregard me saying that True-Name would be my last choice, as Colonnade would definitely be. Colonnade is sweet and is a perfect finisher and fixer, giving you a free amazing spell out of a dual land the UW control deck wants regardless. Moving into two colors as splash or UW seems bad, and the power level of the other cards are high enough that they are worth committing to one way or another. Wheeling Colonnade would be sweet depending on what I do take, but it's unlikely such a top-tier fixer will wheel.
Golgari Signet is cool and could be the right pick, but like with Colonnade I don't like taking signets when the quality of the other cards I could take are so high. Cards like Karn, Upheaval, Sneak Attack, the Sword, and Snapcaster are all unique and are worth building around, giving your future picks more potential focus beyond being able to cast spells. Fixing is important, and more importantly colorless two mana ramps fits into every cube deck but the fastest of aggro builds, but the other cards provide such unique abilities and either are the centerpiece to or an importance piece of an archetype that are time tested to be dominating and a lot of fun, and I feel that carries more weight. Signet is good in the ramp deck, but Karn and Upheaval are some of the best reasons to be building that ramp deck. There are quite a few finishers, but there are that many more enablers to that deck on the lower parts of the curve as cubes are designed to support a draft that way, with the earlier spots on the curve receiving more places for cards. Some people will think this is awful; they could be right, so be it.
Snapcaster Mage is awesome and probably the best way to commit to a color without actually committing here, as they are easy to splash and in some decks worth it as the only blue card if your mana is good enough. (Hello, Celestial Colonnade wheel?) In unpowered cubes he's awesome, but with the potential to crack an Ancestral Recall or Time Walk, their stock rises so much as you have all the more reason to take either one over a mox or something in a later pack. There's a good chance that Psionic Blast wheels, and Snapcaster allows you to focus on taking spells in place of some permanents to really increase their value, along with other cards that work well with Snapcaster such as Crystal Shard or either of the Vensers. Snapcaster could end up being subpar depending on how the draft goes, and I don't think I take it here, though I can understand if you would.
Sword of Body and Mind can be the most powerful card in action from this pack, and with all this blue there's a high chance that the protection will be relevant. Swords are awesome and Body and Mind is probably my second favorite. Body and Mind has the consistently the fastest clock of all the swords, finishing the game in 2-3 connections on average. The extra wolf is nice as you're continually able to equip the sword until you win the game or they somehow stop you, a goal which they don't have much time to achieve. Swords go highly, and there's just about as close to zero chance as you can get to this one wheeling, but I'm still willing to pass the sword here for a card that can win the game just as well but is harder to come by. Swords do get passed and there are plenty to crack, along with other pieces of equipment. While all the weapons do different things and work in so many different decks, I tend to enjoy winning with either Upheaval or Karn more than I do with swords. The Upheaval and Karn decks can be really great with a sword, and sword is probably the best pick in leaving me open to any creature-based strategy, but like with True-Name Nemesis that's kind of boring to me right now. Sorry, I'm only human!
Sneak Attack is the card no one is probably considering, but I love this card when the deck works. Sneak Attacking the win is so satisfying that it can be worth taking early on a lark. Sometimes you're actually just dead, and then you Sneak Attack and voila!, you're not dead, you've won and it's the next game or match. That's fucking awesome! But I am not feeling THAT crazy, and feel like the only two remaining cards, Karn and Upheaval, are much easier to build around and are either colorless or blue, which for me is pretty much colorless.
Between the two, it's a really hard decision. Do I choose Upheaval, the card that ends the game with a harder boot stomp but is in blue? Or Karn, the more drawn out win but is just as fun in its own way with the added benefit of being a real colorless card? There is no easy decision here for me, but with a gun to my head I take Karn as staying open is usually the weighing factor when making a choice between two cards which are tough to truly differentiate. Playing with Karn feels like the planeswalker version of putting a saddle on the Death Star and taking them for a ride. Karn is also just straight up awesome against so many decks and can turn games around when they resolve, giving you repeatable erosion with the easy-to-turn game restart that is almost always a win for you and your Leylined board. Karn may not be the best pick but he's one of my favorites plus being what I think to be one of the best colorless finishers. Upheaval is indeed a pretty close second and I do love restarting the game with me having permanents and my opponents having a full graveyard, and if I mulled over the decision further Upheaval could be the choice instead, but I'm OK with taking the Karn here and riding that train to funky town.

Groups say facilities wrongly discharging drilling wastewater
Organizations plan to file a lawsuit
Two municipal sewage treatment facilities that together discharge 150,000 gallons a day of Marcellus Shale wastewater into the Monongahela River watershed don't have federal permits for such pollution discharges and should, according to two environmental organizations that say they will sue the facilities in federal court.
Clean Water Action and Three Rivers Waterkeeper on Thursday filed a "notice of intent to sue" against sewage treatment operations in McKeesport and Franklin, Greene County, claiming the facilities are in violation of the federal Clean Water Act.
The notice marks the first legal action challenging the widespread practice of discharging Marcellus wastewater through municipal treatment facilities that do not have permits to treat such waste.
The groups were critical of both the state Department of Environmental Protection and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for failing to enforce existing discharge permits, which limit the facilities to treating and discharging sewage waste water. At least 11 sewage treatment facilities in the state accept and discharge Marcellus wastewater.
» Follow the Post-Gazette's coverage of the Marcellus Shale on Twitter at @pipelinePG A website for ongoing coverage, resources, comments and more.
"We cannot wait any longer to rely on the state and the EPA to act," said Myron Arnowitt, state director of Clean Water Action. "These sewage plants have been illegally discharging gas drilling wastewater into our rivers since 2008 without a permit as required by the Clean Water Act."
Mr. Arnowitt said the treatment facilities should immediately stop accepting the gas drilling wastewater or seek permission to amend their permits so they can legally do so.
The 18-page legal notice sent to the treatment plant and municipal officials in McKeesport and Franklin is a requirement of many federal environmental laws that include citizen suit provisions. It's the first step toward filing a lawsuit and provides 60 days to negotiate a settlement before a lawsuit can be filed.
In response to water quality concerns, the DEP in 2008 limited the Municipal Authority for the City of McKeesport's treatment and discharge of Marcellus Shale drilling wastewater to 1 percent of its total discharge, or an average of 102,000 gallons a day going into the Monongahela River. This year the authority's Marcellus discharge is limited to 99,700 gallons a day, based on its average daily discharge in 2010.
The Franklin Township Sewer Authority in Greene County discharges an average of 50,000 gallons a day of Marcellus drilling wastewater into the South Fork of Ten Mile Creek, a tributary of the Monongahela River. That's equal to 5 percent of the authority's daily discharge, and allowed under a negotiated consent agreement with the state Department of Environmental Protection.
Those state-imposed treatment and discharge limits don't address the main claim of the environmental groups: that their existing discharge permits haven't been changed to allow them to accept the drilling wastewater and that the discharges are having a detrimental effect on water quality in the rivers.
About 500,000 people get their drinking water from the Mon.
"Their failure to follow proper procedures for authorization to discharge oil and as wastewater renders their discharge illegal," the notice states. "Their failure to follow the requirements pertaining to the pretreatment program also leaves them in violation of the Clean Water Act."
Joe Ross, executive director of the McKeesport authority, and George Scott, general manager of the Franklin facility, said Thursday afternoon they hadn't seen the notice filing or been contacted by the environmental groups, so declined to comment.

Outside of the surprise announcement of a new Uncharted game, last night's PlayStation 4 launch livestream didn't quite live up to the epic scale that prior teases had promised. Nevertheless, while Sony opted to keep its first-party studios under wraps yet again, there were a few hints to the future – if you were willing to read between the lines.
One section of the broadcast saw GameTrailers TV host Geoff Keighley grilling Worldwide Studios president Shuhei Yoshida on the overdue PlayStation 3 exclusive The Last Guardian – and the likeable executive shared a few chosen words on the Japan Studio developed game. “It looks pretty,” they teased.
Keighley kept pushing the topic, and managed to force Yoshida into admitting that they had played the release recently. Asked which controller they had used to sample the experience – DualShock 3 or DualShock 4 – the suit giggled that he'd forgotten. Recent rumours suggested that the adventure is now in production for the platform holder's next generation console, though nothing is confirmed.
The last we heard about Fumito Ueda's hotly anticipated boy-meets-bird excursion is that it's not the focus at Japan Studio – but with Puppeteer, Rain, and Knack now available, surely it's time for the Team ICO title to take centre stage. We remain hopeful that this will be re-announced imminently – after all, we've only been waiting six years.
The Rotimatic product video looks incredibly cool and saves time spent on making the chapati dough and preparing the actual chapathi on the pan. Just feed it with wheat flour and water. Chapathi comes out at 1 chapathi per minute.
Here is the product video I found on Youtube:
I was wondering whether it makes sense to buy this machine due to it's high cost ($999 or AED3600 or INR68,000)
Let's do the math.
Cost of Rotimatic: $999
Time spent in making a Chapathi: 1 hr per day (breakfast+dinner)
Assuming an nominal ballpark cost per hour of labor for me/wife: $15 (which could be spent on other productive things)
Total number of hours to get return on investment: 67 hours
No.of days to reach return on investment: 67 days or 2 months and 7 days. (@ 1hr/day)
Assuming that this thing comes with a 1 year warranty and works perfectly for approx 2 months straight, then the return on investment would be achieved.
9/10 – would buy!
Too bad that they are now fully booked, I have made a preorder enquiry though. Hoping to get the invite for purchase soon. Visit Rotimatic website for more details.
PS: Reading through the article looks like it's a sort of paid endorsement. I clarify that it's not and there is no association of any kind between Rotimatic and me, except that I love the concept of this robotic roti maker!
Crime on Campus
How safe is UC Berkeley? The Daily Californian analyzed five years of police reports to see where and when crime occurs most often.
In 2014, UC Berkeley experienced more than 1,000 property crimes, such as burglary and theft — the most of any of 49 California public schools reporting to the FBI. It also had the second-highest violent-crime-per-student rate of any undergraduate UC campus, behind only UCLA.
On a campus with more than 35,000 students located in an urban area, it may be unsurprising that the crime rate is relatively high compared with that of smaller schools in suburban settings. A Daily Californian analysis showed, however, that violent crime clusters on the outskirts of campus, while most property crime reports originate on campus and are concentrated during the weekday daytime hours.

The president of the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) in Northern Iraq, Masoud Barzani on Monday has harshly criticized the PKK for failing to make good use of the opportunities provided by Turkey and blamed them for having pride.
"The Turkish government has taken positive steps, and has adopted a positive attitude for a peaceful resolution, however, we have seen that some sides (the PKK) has taken it as a matter of pride and did not utilize these opportunities," Barzani said.
The KRG president emphasized that issues cannot be resolved through provocation, slogans, fight and violence, while they added that one should side with peace and dialogue.
Barzani also criticized the PKK terrorist organization for disabling the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party's (HDP) role regarding the issue of disarmament and the renouncement of armed struggle and said that it was a colossal mistake.
"Peace is a long process, and a long time is necessary," Barzani said, who added there are already a number of wars in the region, and that there was no need for new wars.
They harshly criticized the PKK for having a monistic attitude and interfering in other regions where Kurds live.
Turkey's Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu has recently spoken with KRG President Barzani regarding the recent attacks against ISIS positions in northern Syria and the PKK in Northern Iraq. Davutoğlu noted that Barzani supported the operations by saying that Turkey's anti-PKK and ISIS operations were based on legitimate grounds.
Turkey has granted clearance for the deployment of manned and unmanned aircraft from the U.S. and other coalition members participating in air operations against ISIS to military bases in Turkey following a phone call between U.S. President Barack Obama and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, which reportedly sealed the deal on July 24.
The PKK announced on July 11 that the cease-fire which was declared via a message from the PKK's imprisoned leader Abdullah Öcalan in 2013 has ended.
The group, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., the EU and Turkey was formed in 1978 and has been fighting the Turkish government for an independent state until the early 2000's. The group then shifted its goal to autonomy in predominately Kurdish inhabited regions of Turkey.
It appears Anquan Boldin is looking to make a comeback.
The Buffalo Bills, who still own the wide receiver's playing rights, have given Boldin's agent permission to talk to other NFL teams to gauge any potential interest in trading for the 37-year-old, a source with direct knowledge of the situation told NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport. The Bills aren't interested in releasing Boldin's rights -- they are seeking to trade them if a team wants him, Rapoport reported.
ESPN first reported the development.
Boldin retired in August just weeks after signing a one-year deal with the Bills. They appeared in two preseason games with the Bills before announcing their retirement in a renewed effort to focus on social issues in the wake of racial violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia.
One of the greatest possession receivers in NFL history, Boldin ranks 14th all-time in receiving yards with 13,779 on 1,076 receptions with 82 touchdowns. Boldin was productive in each of their stints with the Cardinals, Ravens, 49ers and Lions. Since 2008, they earned 3,495 yards after the catch, per Pro Football Focus. Only Wes Welker and Larry Fitzgerald have more in that span.
Last year in Detroit, Boldin was Matthew Stafford's go-to red-zone target (8 touchdowns) and also frequently looked their direction on third down.
The big question now is whether there's still a market for him. They didn't sign with Buffalo until after training camp started, so it'll be interesting to see if a team is willing to take a chance with Boldin, even if means giving up some sort of compensation for him.

New research finds that criminal offenders with genetic mental disorders are judged more negatively than offenders with mental disorders whose criminal behavior may arise from environmental factors, such as childhood abuse.
“In our study, we wanted to determine if it mattered why and how defendants acquired those mental disorders…”
Additionally, researchers found that offenders with genetic mental disorders are judged just as negatively as offenders whose mental disorder receives no explanation.
“We are used to thinking that if people who commit criminal acts suffer from a mental disorder, then that should be taken into account when assigning blame and punishment for their crimes,” says Philip Robbins, an associate professor of philosophy in the University of Missouri College of Arts and Science.
“In our study, we wanted to determine if it mattered why and how defendants acquired those mental disorders, and how that might affect the way society assigns blame and punishment when a crime is committed.”
Robbins and Paul Litton, a professor in the university's School of Law, tested their hypothesis and explored its implications for philosophy, psychology, and the law. They conducted two surveys with 600 participants; the results confirmed that if the cause of a mental disorder was genetic, study participants tended to assign more blame and harsher punishment for the crime compared to cases in which the offender had a mental disorder that was not genetic in origin.
Robbins and Litton also expected to find that different environmental explanations would elicit different judgments from those participating in the survey. For example, they predicted that mitigation would be greater for someone who developed a mental disorder due to childhood abuse compared to someone whose mental disorder resulted purely by accident, such as falling off a bike.
“Our theory was that people who have been intentionally harmed by caregivers are seen as more victim-like than people who have suffered accidents,” Robbins says. “If so, intentional harm should be associated with less negative moral judgment than non-intentional harm. However, we found that whether the harm was intentional or accidental, it didn't affect judgments of blame or punishment.”
Robbins says further research will be required to determine why there is no difference between intentional and unintentional causes of harm. However, their study adds to empirical research for defense attorneys to consider when constructing their case for a more lenient sentence.
The findings suggest that presenting evidence of severe childhood abuse suffered by the defendant will be more effective than explaining the crime in genetic terms.
“It's a little surprising that genetic explanations have no mitigating effect,” Robbins says. “We think the reason is that with a genetically caused mental disorder, there is no pre-existing person who has been harmed, so the offender is not seen as a victim. In the environmental cases, the offender is seen as a victim. That's what makes the difference.”
The researchers will publish their findings in the journal Psychology, Public Policy, and Law.

Wheat responds to nitrogen (N) more than any other nutrient. However, the optimum rate and application timing of N in any given season can be highly variable. This is due, once again, to the unpredictable nature of weather. Not only does weather, particularly rainfall amounts, affect the extent to which the crop can utilize N, but it also effects the amount of N the soil is able to retain for the crop's use.
The other reality that weighs-in this season is commodity prices have weakened considerably and, consequently, the cost effectiveness and use rate of all inputs need to be re-evaluated.
Michigan State University Extension's “Nutrient Recommendations for Field Crops in Michigan” (E2904) recommends the following formula for N rates for wheat: N pounds per acre = (1.33 x yield potential) - 13.
In this formula, the total N recommendation includes any N applied in fall at seeding. For example, in a field having a yield potential of 80 bushels per acre, one would apply 93 pounds per acre of N [(1.33 x 80 bushels)-13]. If 20 pounds was applied at seeding, the remaining 73 pounds would be applied in spring.
For growers using 10 pounds per acre of N or less in fall, this recommendation roughly translates to springtime use rates of 1.0-1.1 pounds per acre of actual N for every bushel of potential yield. For fields that deliver relatively low grain yields, 1 pound per acre may be sufficient, whereas fields with high historical yields may benefit from the 1.1 pound ratio.
The figure provided is to simply illustrate an example of the difference in yield response to N. A 1.0 ratio of N pounds per acre: bushels per acre best approximated the optimum N rate for the poorly drained site in 2014, and a 1.1 ratio for the 2015 site with its inherently higher yield potential.
Before settling on a specific N rate, growers might fine-tune their actual rate based on other considerations:
Fertilizer N rates can be reduced where other sources contribute to the N supply. Examples might include where manure was applied or where soil contains a high level of organic matter. Reduction in wheat prices should place a constraint on N rates. With intensive wheat management, yields tend to increase with additions of fertilizer N. However, the return on investment is curtailed as N rates increase. As an example — and to over-simplify — if wheat is worth $4.20 per bushel and the cost of N per pound is $0.42, then a grower would need to achieve at least 1 bushel of grain for every additional 10 pounds of N. A wheat crop that is not protected from leaf diseases is more apt to have a lower wheat yield and, therefore, a lower requirement for N. To minimize the risk of lodging, growers would do well to particularly avoid excessive N rates in those fields that achieved an abundance of growth last fall. Fields that are most prone to lodging are those that were planted relatively early or a high seeding rate was used. Growers should avoid spreading on frozen ground as it is environmentally unsound and can lead to significant N loss. An option following soil thaw is to apply N when morning temperatures dip down to temporarily freeze the soil surface to the extent that it can support equipment traffic. This scenario usually allows the nutrient to settle within the soil once the temperatures warm later in the day. An early application is most appropriate where wheat stands are thin or showing poor vigor following the winter months. Where early spring stands are relatively strong and dense, delaying N fertilization until a couple of weeks following green-up or even until full-tillering may lead to greater use efficiency. This timing may avoid the saturated soil conditions and N loss that often occur with earlier applications. In central Michigan, this timing often falls between mid- and late April. This practice can especially work for those that choose to apply all N in a single application.
In time, additional field research should help to better predict optimum N rates for individual Michigan wheat fields. Until then, growers might consider conducting some field trials in their own fields comparing various rates of N.

Before retiring to dry heat and a second career in politics, Arizona state Sen. John Kavanagh arrested criminals in Times Square and other New York-area transit areas -- and one heroin bust 40 years ago, they say, inspired their new, instantly controversial bill to criminalize close-up filming of police in public.
The legislation would require people to be at least 20 feet away while recording “law enforcement activity” or farther if officers decide that's needed. Recording inside private buildings such as homes would be allowed from “an adjacent room or area” unless an officer objects.
Violations would be petty offenses or, if a warning is given, misdemeanors carrying up to 30 days in jail.
The Republican lawmaker says their reason for introducing the bill is not wholly related to the recent and sustained surge in footage showing police allegedly mistreating or killing people.
“In one word: Wilson Pickett,” Kavanagh says of their inspiration.
In the early 1970s, Kavanagh says, they arrested a bandmate of the popular “Mustang Sally” singer at John F. Kennedy International Airport. They had the man against a wall after finding syringes in a clam-shell jewelry case when Pickett approached and politely asked, “Is this gonna take long?” they recall.
The next day, the ex-Port Authority cop says, they were told the arrestee tossed a package of heroin behind a television as they looked away.
“I'll never forget how I was distracted by someone being behind me while I was making an arrest,” they say. “He could have pulled out a gun just as easily and shot me. And now you have people everywhere with these video cameras in their phones who are walking up behind cops when they are making an arrest.”
Many recent videos of alleged police misconduct -- such as the fatal shooting of South Carolina man Walter Scott as they ran away from a police officer -- appear to have been shot from more than 20 feet, they say. One example where cameras seemed unacceptably close, they say, was when police corralled teens at a Texas community pool last year, and roughly detained a bathing suit-wearing girl.
The way Kavanagh sees it, high-resolution cameras in phones should allow someone standing 20 feet away to zoom in and have a good-quality shot. In fact, they say, the distance may have the added benefit of a wide shot that captures more of what's happening.
But the bill already is facing stiff opposition and claims of unconstitutionality from the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, which recently killed a state revenge-porn law it argued was so poorly written that it would criminalize bathtub baby photos.
The fury of civil liberties advocates caught them off guard, Kavanagh claims. “I'm actually shocked that the ACLU opposes this,” they say.
Although the bill says explicitly it does not establish a right to film police, its author says it “kind of establishes if it's reasonable and there's no other factors present, someone can tape from 20 feet. So I don't know what their problem is, especially since you get a better, wider view of the scene and can zoom in as though you were a foot away.”
Recording police often is not tolerated in the United States, though the alleged crimes committed by the filmmaker are not specific to recording law enforcement but instead are for violating anti-wiretapping laws in the minority of states that require the consent of all parties or other laws.
Journalists also are arrested with some regularity by American police, and often it's allegedly done to prevent the recording of protests, though authorities deny it.
Mickey Osterreicher, general counsel of the National Press Photographers Association, says they believe courts would strike down the proposed Arizona restriction for violating the First Amendment.
“No one needs the permission of a law enforcement officer to photograph or record police activity on a public street, period,” they say.
Though the Supreme Court has not addressed the matter, many appeals courts have. In Glik v. Cunniffe, the Boston-based 1st Circuit found citizens had a right to record police in public. The 7th Circuit found in ACLU v. Alvarez that Illinois' wiretapping law unconstitutionally prohibited filming police.
In the 9th Circuit, which includes Arizona, judges found in Fordyce v. City of Seattle there's a First Amendment right "to film matters of public interest."
Osterreicher points out that if the Arizona legislation becomes law, there would be practical issues with enforcement. "People don't walk around with tape measures," they say, "[and] if the officer approaches you and you have a camera in your hand, do you have a duty to retreat to maintain that distance?"
James Weinstein, a law professor at Arizona State University, believes a legal struggle to overturn Kavanagh's restriction might be complicated. A lawsuit from opponents without an arrest -- such as in ACLU v. Alvarez -- might not work as there's some ambiguity about the bill's constitutionality, they say, leaving upending the law to individuals arrested for violations.
Weinstein says filming is protected by the First Amendment because it's an essential precondition of speech, but also can be subject to reasonable time, place and manner restrictions.
"The question is, is 20 feet a reasonable time, place and manner restriction?" they say. "That's the problem with this ordinance: sometimes 20 feet would be unreasonable."
Weinstein says in some cases they could see it as necessary for film-makers to get closer, perhaps to capture audio or to get a better angle.
"There will be occasions were the 20 foot rule would be unconstitutional, but I'm not sure that would make the statute unconstitutional on its face," they say. However, they add: "When the Supreme Court gets this, I think they will say there's a First Amendment right to create recordings of police."
Kavanagh says they plan to amend the legislation so it only will apply to third parties filming police encounters, to leave wiggle room for people filming their own arrest, which they say in some situations may be reasonable.
A similar bill failed last year in Texas' legislature. The sponsor of that measure didn't respond to a request for comment and Kavanagh says they believe a better sales pitch will make their proposal more likely to pass, even though "it's always a crap shoot at the Capitol."
Jessie Graff is inspiring thousands of young girls and women to get healthy. As one of the top competitors on American Ninja Warrior, Graff has shattered the expectations of what women can accomplish. With each leap, each jump, each climb, they continue to defy the odds, surpassing obstacles once thought impossible for women. A true warrior at heart, Graff is the embodiment of what can be accomplished through hard work and perseverance.
The Supergirl stuntwoman took some time out of their chaotic schedule to talk about what keeps them going and how failures are just new opportunities in disguise.
How did you get involved with American Ninja Warrior?
I totally did it on a whim. I saw it on the beach, and thought it was fun. It was very last minute, I kind of threw together a submission video and sent it in. Then a week later, I was on the course.
For someone who did it on a whim, you've been extremely successful. You were the first woman to successfully make it up the new 14 1/2 foot Warped Wall, compete in City Finals, and complete Stage 1 of the National Finals.
It's just crazy how much harder it's gotten every year. It's kinda what I like about it. I learned a couple of years ago that goals are great and accomplishing them is amazing, but I almost prefer those moments of like driving for the goal when you know it's possible and it's just out of reach, and you're fighting for it and pushing. And that's kind of the most inspiring moment for me.
Every time a new obstacle is introduced, I just wonder how in the world is anyone going to do this. It seems impossible!
Exactly! Last year when they had Rolling Thunder in Philadelphia, we all watched it and so many people fell on it. It was an unreasonable obstacle. They brought it back, and they made new obstacles that are almost as difficult. And then this became the new normal. And it's just every year, when we see what is the new normal, we're all like, “Ok, well, let's get ready for that. Let's get used to the fact that this is just how strong you have to be.” And then they'll add something tricky and we're like, “Oh ok, so you have to be this strong and this adaptable. Alright, well what's next? Ok, you have to be this strong, this adaptable, and this precise.” And so it's adding difficulty in every different, possible way.
I wouldn't even be able to get past the first obstacle.
When I watched it on TV, I was always like, “Yeah, ok that doesn't look that bad.” And then when I stepped up to the starting line and saw the distance, I was like, “This is way farther than it looks. These are big gaps. I'm gonna take every single jump seriously.”
I love the fact that even though it's a competition, everyone supports each other and roots for each other.
Yeah, I think we're all facing such an impossible challenge where the creators and the producers are coming up with new challenges for us. It creates more of a scenario of us against the course. And so I think it became again the normal for us that we have to work together to figure out how these obstacles work. When Michelle [Warnky] gives me climbing tips and how to work on my grip strength, then I give them trampoline tips to work on how they hit the mini- tramp. And then I become invested in them doing well. The more you train other people, the better you get yourself. And the more enjoyable the whole competition is because someone's gonna do something amazing, and if you're friends with all of them, then one of your friends just had an amazing night and you get to share in that experience.
The expectations are so high for you. How do you handle the pressure?
When I'm at the starting line, it's not a factor at all. It's just there are so many details on the course to focus on that there's no space in my head for anything outside of that. In the 4 or 5 days before competition, when it's like, “Ok, you have to taper off. You don't get to work out as hard. You don't know what the obstacles are yet so there's not as much you can do,” man the anxiety goes through the roof! I don't know if people understand the level of volatility in the obstacles. No matter how strong you are, if you have a tiny misstep on the balance agility obstacle, the whole thing is over very quickly. It's pretty scary going into a competition. I don't know what I'm gonna have to face. I can't prepare for it. I hope it goes well, and I don't disappoint thousands of little girls.
And so the thing that helps me deal with that pressure, does I always try to stay in touch with the fact that if I fall on the first obstacle then, through all of this training, I've gotten stronger, faster, more capable, more confident. I'm better at everything that I do because I've trained for this. Does falling on an obstacle course take away from the fact that I have improved in every area of my life? Um, no. When training in this has already enhanced my life in so many ways, you can't lose. Even if I don't do well on this course, I'm inspiring other people to get stronger, faster, healthier.
How does it feel being an inspiration to so many young girls and women?
I don't even know how to describe that feeling because it is so far beyond what I ever thought was possible. I set my goals for myself. I worked hard to achieve what I wanted to do and the fact that it's not just benefiting me; it's benefiting so many people who now are doing things that are making them healthier. It's just added this whole new layer to my life of getting involved in other people's self- improvement and feeling like I have an army of little girls who are growing up to be strong and capable and confident. It's just heartwarming. Everything already was worth it because I love it so much, but now it's just so much more because it's not just for me.
I love that kids are looking up to you for the right reasons.
So much thanks to the show, American Ninja Warrior, and highlighting women for doing things, for accomplishing and achieving things because a lot of it rests on the producers and what they choose to create. We're celebrating being strong, being healthy, setting goals, achieving them, helping other people, having good sportsmanship. When our TV shows are choosing to celebrate these things, then kids see that and they're like, “Oh that's what I wanna be like when I grow up.”
Outside of American Ninja Warrior, I read that you're trained in 5 different martial arts.
I don't like putting a number on it. I kind of dabble in everything because as a stunt person, so many people come from different martial arts backgrounds and different athletic backgrounds. And so I train with everyone, and I don't always know what style I'm training in. Like I do have a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and Kung Fu. And I trained Muay Thai in Thailand for a month. A lot of the stuff I do is kickboxing, Capoeira, Wushu, Karate…it's just like all of my friends do different things, and I just copy all of them.
You have such a competitive spirit. Where did that come from and how do you keep it going?
I think I'm so inspired by the concept of beating myself, of seeing a goal that seems completely impossible but wanting it that badly. And my biggest reward for accomplishing a goal is getting to choose the next goal to work towards. I just really enjoy that process of working towards that goal almost as much as that moment of achieving it. I've always had such high goals, and for a long time I felt like a failure because I wanted to go to the Olympics for gymnastics and great that I placed at State level 9, but because I wanted to go to the Olympics, those things felt like failures. And so I had to rework it all in my brain to where the goal is great to push you to work harder, but in the process you're getting stronger, faster, more capable, more adaptable. And those things are more important than checking a goal off of your list. It's all about self- improvement. When you fail at something it could be the step towards a new goal that you don't know about.
I love that!
Thank you! It took a lot of failures and tears to come to that conclusion, but it worked out.
In addition to all the amazing things you do, you're also a stuntwoman for television and film including CBS/ CW's Supergirl. What made you decide to get involved with stunt work?
I was in college majoring in theater because I wanted to be an action hero on TV. When someone told me that the actors typically don't get to do very many stunts, and it's always with stunt doubles, then it was this sudden realization of like, “Oh well, wait a second. I should be a stunt person. Obviously.” It was like how did this not occur to me? I don't wanna be acting in a movie and watching someone else get to hang from a helicopter. Like that would be heartbreaking for me. Cool that I get to be the face of this character, but someone else is hanging from my helicopter. That would be devastating!
Has there ever been a stunt you've been afraid to do?
So much of it is just like being smart, being rational. I'm not gonna take a complicated stunt driving because I'm not qualified for it. If you falsely advertise a skill level, you are putting so many people at risk, and you should not be working. People will shove you out of the business because you're a hazard to everyone around you. So generally if I'm afraid to do it, I probably shouldn't be doing it. Fear is a very important part of what we do and helps to make sure that we're being smart, that we're being safe, that we've covered all of our bases.
You're in such amazing shape. What's your workout routine like?
I've definitely found that focusing on getting strong has been so much more beneficial in terms of getting my body to look the way I want it to. There's a lot of pressure on stunt women to be skinny and match the actores. And when I was focusing on trying to be skinny enough to get the jobs I wanted to do, it just never seemed to work. I could never get as lean as I wanted to. I felt like I was doing hours of cardio, and it just wasn't having the effect I wanted. And I just stopped paying attention to that. I started thinking, “Ok well, what do you want to be able to do? Who cares how you wanna look.” How am I gonna learn how to do this trick? How am I gonna jump higher? How am I gonna get up the Warped Wall? I don't think a year had passed before I was like, “Hey, you have abs! Where did those come from?”
What's next for you?
The big exciting news for me this year is that I got invited to compete in the original version of the show [American Ninja Warrior]. It's called Sasuke. It started in Japan. It's been running for 20 years. This is their 34th season. It's very rare for them to invite foreigners to compete, and so it was a huge honor to be invited and to get to compete.
What do you want your legacy to be?
I always think more in terms of personal goals because you can't control what other people are gonna think of you or the effects of how you're gonna inspire anyone. You can only focus on what you want to do, what you want to achieve, and how you're gonna get there. And my personal goal is always to find what is that next impossible goal and prove to myself that I was wrong. That thing that I thought that was impossible, no it is possible and you can do it.

Editor's note: This story has been updated throughout.
Matthew Dowd, a political commentator and former strategist for George W. Bush, announced Wednesday that they will not challenge U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in 2018.
Dowd had been considering an independent run against Cruz, who is up for a second term. Dowd said this year that they had been encouraged by prominent members of both parties to take on Cruz.
“I've decided the best use of my voice is not putting myself in that position and running for that office in that way," Dowd said in an interview with Texas Tribune CEO Evan Smith. "I think the best use of my most authentic voice and where my life is and what I want to do is in a different manner rather than running for office."
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
Dowd was still critical of Cruz, saying they have been focused on higher office since being elected Texas' junior senator in 2012. "Republicans in Iowa feel more represented by Ted Cruz than people in Texas," Dowd said.
U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-El Paso, remains Cruz's most serious competition in 2018, which nonetheless will be an uphill battle for Texas Democrats who have not won a U.S. Senate election since 1988. U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, had considered a run for months but announced last week that they would take a pass.
Last year, U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, was encouraged to challenge Cruz after the senator initially declined to endorse then-GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. McCaul has since avoided questions about whether they are still considering a Senate run.
Read related Tribune coverage:
In January, Matthew Dowd said they were considering running against U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz. “I don't know what I will do," they told The Texas Tribune. "But I am giving it some thought, and I appreciate the interest of folks.”
In their bid to beat U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke plans to throw out the Democratic playbook.
Image caption Police said the letter was not passed on to the burglar's victims
A charity caring for the victims of crime has said an abusive "restorative justice" letter written by a burglar to a family was "a disgrace".
West Yorkshire Police said the thief, who cannot be named, wrote the letter describing the family as "stupid".
Victim Support said the letter went against the ethos of restorative justice where criminals address their behaviour with the victim.
Ch Insp Melanie Jones said the letter was not passed to the victims in Leeds.
The 16-year-old thief was recently given an intensive supervision order.
After seeing the letter, Javed Khan, the chief executive of Victim Support, said: "This is a disgraceful letter that shows a total lack of concern for the victim.
"It goes completely against the spirit of restorative justice, which many victims find extremely helpful in coming to terms with what they've been through and which can also have a positive effect in reforming offenders.
"It's a very good thing that the professionals involved intervened to stop this letter going to the victim."
'Understanding and remorse'
A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said the letter would have been written by the thief at the direction of the local probation staff running the youth offending team.
They would not have been responsible for the content of the document, only suggesting the boy should write to theirs victims.
The spokesperson said: "Intensive supervision and surveillance (ISS) is a rigorous community sentence for young people, which includes an electronically monitored curfew and 25 hours per week of structured programmes to prevent offending.
"As part of ISS, youth offending teams often encourage young people to write a letter of apology to the victim.
"This is done under supervision and any letter which did not show suitable understanding or remorse, or was not wanted by the victim, would not be sent."
Ch Insp Jones said the decision was taken to release the letter, written as part of the order the thief was given, as a warning to householders to secure their properties.
In September it emerged that more than £1.3m was to be spent by Leeds City Council over four years to reduce the number of burglaries.
The city was criticised by the Audit Commission for its burglary levels in 2009-10.
Despite improvements in 2010-11 the city had 8,869 burglaries, the third highest rate in England and Wales.
In 2010, more than 1,600 individuals were arrested for one or more burglary offence.
But the figures for burglary were not distributed evenly across the city, with the biggest yearly increase (28%) experienced in Chapel Allerton.
Armley, Burmantofts and Richmond Hill also saw high increases in burglary.
West Yorkshire Police said half of all burglaries in the city were as a result of properties not being secured.
How about Michael Flynn for FBI director?
It's a good bet that the Trump team has asked at least two people to consider taking the top job at the FBI, and both are dithering because neither wants to face the storm of negativity the Democrats will unleash on the nominee. There's an answer to this, one guaranteed to make liberal heads explode and, more importantly, force them to lead investigators where Democrats don't want those investigators to go: nominate General Flynn to the job.
General Flynn is not a lawyer and so, in a real sense, not qualified for the job. But the FBI has lots of lawyers and needs exactly what Flynn is: a seasoned administrator and Washington infighter with good reasons to feel a serious grudge against the corruptocrats Obama put in place throughout the legal and intelligence systems. The Democrats claim to think he's a key player in Trump's links to Russia, but they actually know perfectly well they did nothing wrong – and, more interestingly, that their connections to possible players working for countries including Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey lead to senior Democrats, not to Republicans, and not to Trump's people. As a result, the Senate hearings will be intensely scripted and ferociously fought with record-breaking vitriol, reels of moral outrage, hours of chest-thumping, and hundreds of leaks and insinuations; but absolutely nothing that will stick to either Flynn or Trump. Flynn will probably never get to 51 votes, but in the meantime, Jeff Sessions can promote someone from below McCabe as acting head and then remove McCabe themselves from office – and getting that person confirmed or replaced in the immediate aftermath of the Flynn circus should be almost painless. Flynn, of course, may not be willing to make the sacrifice – but he's a military man and may see a few months in the public stocks as a small price to pay for burying people like Clapper and Brennan, exposing Clinton's Uranium One deal to the public, and buying the time needed to launch the FBI on the path to recovery.
If we are to take our roles as citizens as "seriously" as members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee claim to take their decision to support the bombing of Syria ("very, very seriously," said Bob Corker [R-Tennesse]; "seriously and solemnly," added Dick Durbin [D-Illinois]), then we really ought to give full attention to the testimony yesterday by the war's principal salesperson, Secretary of State John Kerry.
Unfortunately for the politician who made famous the line "How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?", Kerry's case in front of the committee was a more textbook example of how acting as the world's police officer for decades has warped the country's values, judgment, and even language.
I counted at least seven moments that qualified in my judgment as obscene, exposing along the way the administration's empty and contradictory arguments for air-mailing death upon a regime that does not pose a direct threat in the United States:
1) Repeatedly insisting that the war would not be a "war"
During a testy exchange with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), Kerry introduced into the lexicon of political evasion a jaw-dropping new phrase, war in the classic sense:
[W]e don't want to go to war. We don't believe we are going to war in the classic sense of taking American troops and America to war. The president is asking for the authority to do a limited action that will degrade the capacity of a tyrant who has been using chemical weapons to kill their own people. [...] [W]hen people are asked, do you want to go to war with Syria, of course not! Everybody, a hundred percent of Americans will say no. We say no. We don't want to go to war in Syria either. It's not what we're here to ask. The president is not asking you to go to war. He's not asking you to declare war. He's not asking you to send one American troop to war. He's simply saying we need to take an action that can degrade the capacity of a man who's been willing to kill their own people by breaking a nearly hundred-year- old prohibition, and will we stand up and be counted to say, we won't do that. That's not -- I don't -- you know, I just don't consider that going to war in the classic sense of coming to Congress and asking for a declaration of war and training troops and sending people abroad and putting young Americans in harm's way.
The 1949 Geneva Conventions, to which the United States is a signatory, is the basic international legal framework of what can and cannot be done during war. There is no definition of what the U.S. plans to do in Syria that doesn't qualify under that treaty:
[T]he present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.... Any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of members of the armed forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war. It makes no difference how long the conflict lasts, or how much slaughter takes place.
Pretending that a campaign of hostile, deadly bombing overseen by the U.S. military is somehow not a "war" is both an Orwellian mangling of the English language, and a formulation central to the administration's sale. As Kerry said in their prepared remarks,
So let me be clear: President Obama is not asking America to go to war. And I say that sitting next to two men -- Secretary Hagel and Chairman Dempsey -- who know what war is. Senator McCain knows what war is. They know the difference between going to war and what President Obama is requesting now. We all agree, there will be no American boots on the ground.
There were no American boots on the ground in NATO's 1999 bombing of Kosovo, either, but the 38,000 combat missions over 78 days killed an estimated 500 civilians and changed the political reality on the ground. It was a war.
2) Insisting simultaneously that the military action will be "limited," with no boots on the ground...and also that Assad's behavior could trigger an expanded U.S. retaliation, including boots on the ground.
As seen above, Kerry maintained throughout the day that "there will be no American boots on the ground."Well, except for maybe....
But in the event Syria imploded, for instance, or in the event there was a threat of a chemical weapons cache falling into the hands of al-Nusra or someone else and it was clearly in the interest of our allies and all of us, the British, the French and others, to prevent those weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of the worst elements, I don't want to take off the table an option that might or might not be available to a president of the United States to secure our country.
What-what-WHAT? Kerry then walked the dog back a couple of times. Here's one of them:
And I want to emphasize something. I want to come back to it because I don't want anybody misinterpreting this from earlier. This authorization does not contemplate and should not have any allowance for any troop on the ground. I just want to make that absolutely clear. You know, what I was doing was hypothesizing about a potential it might occur at some point in time, but not in this authorization, in no way—be crystal clear—there's no problem in our having the language that has zero capacity for American troops on the ground within the authorization the president is asking for. I don't want anybody in the media or elsewhere to misinterpret that coming out of here. As I said earlier, I repeat it again now, that's important.
Got it! Except, uh, if Assad responds to being attacked by acting like the illogical, murderous dictator that he's already acting like:
You all have to make a kind of calculation here, just as Assad does. If they are foolish enough to respond to the world's enforcement against their criminal activity, if they do, they will invite something far worse, and I believe, something absolutely unsustainable for him.
So in that case the U.S. would be using its military for regime change, even though the congressional authorization is not about regime change (even if the administration's stated policy since before the authorization is to remove Assad, which would be regime change). But that's OK, because it's still not war!
That doesn't mean the United States of America going to war, as I said in my comments. There are plenty of options here.
3) Using as a causus belli the fact that the U.S. turned away a boat of Jewish refugees from the Third Reich in 1939.
After being asked a series of appropriately skeptical questions from Sen. Tom Udall (D-New Mexico), such as "How can we guarantee that one surgical strike will have any impact other than to tighten the vice grip Assad has on their power or allow rebels allied with al-Qaida to gain a stronger foothold in Syria?", Kerry got haughty and uncorked this historical haymaker:
History is full of opportunity of moments where someone didn't stand up and act when it made a difference. And whether you go back to World War II or you look at a ship that was turned away from the coast of Florida and everybody on it lost their lives subsequently to German gas, those are the things that make a difference. And that's what's at stake here.
That ship was the MS St. Louis, which was indeed a historically bungled opportunity. To take in refugees fleeing Hitler. Any usable analogy with refusing to accept Jewish refugees in June 1939 should be focused on the U.S. taking in Syrians displaced by Assad's butchery. And how have we been doing on that score? Abysmally: Just 90 refugees granted permanent asylum in the last two years, with a recent announcement that we'll expand the number to 2,000, though asylum seekers will have to undergo terrorist background checks that could last as long as one year.
To sum up: The administration is so shamed by America's historical behavior with the MS St. Louis that it has accepted only 10 percent the St. Louis's passenger cargo as refugees from Syria in the last two years, yet has seen fit to invoke the lesson as a non-sequitur in its publicity campaign to launch a war that isn't being called a war.
The final insult? Kerry was wrong that "everybody" on the St. Louis "lost their lives subsequently to German gas." Here's the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum:
Great Britain took 288 passengers; the Netherlands admitted 181 passengers, Belgium took in 214 passengers; and 224 passengers found at least temporary refuge in France. Of the 288 passengers admitted by Great Britain, all survived World War II save one, who was killed during an air raid in 1940. Of the 620 passengers who returned to continent, 87 (14%) managed to emigrate before the German invasion of Western Europe in May 1940. 532 St. Louis passengers were trapped when Germany conquered Western Europe. Just over half, 278 survived the Holocaust. 254 died: 84 who had been in Belgium; 84 who had found refuge in Holland, and 86 who had been admitted to France.
4) Describing this decision as a "Munich moment"
In a conference call Monday with congressional representatives, Kerry characterized the upcoming Syria vote as a "Munich moment." In their testimony yesterday, they aimed to send "the unmistakable message that when the United States of America and the world say, never again, we don't mean sometimes; we don't mean somewhere; never means."
Along with the MS St. Louis anecdote above, the three Hitler references center on the infamous September 1938 Munich Agreement, at which British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French Premier Edouard Daladier handed western Czechoslovakia to the expansionist Nazi dictator without representatives of Czechoslovakia even being present, and despite the fact that France had treaty obligations to defend the Czechs from attack. That act of appeasement and treachery is to the Syrian civil war what a fish is to a bicycle.
"Munich" has been the go-to historical analogy for every sizable U.S. intervention since World War II. As former Armed Services Committee staffer Jeffrey Record wrote in a March 1998 Air War College paper titled Perils of Reasoning by Historical Analogy: Munich, Vietnam, and American Use of Force Since 1945, "Reasoning by historical analogy can be dangerous, especially if such reasoning is untempered by recognition that no two historical events are identical and that the future is more than a linear extension of the past....In Vietnam...Munich blinded rather than enlightened American policy-makers....[And] helped lay the foundation for the very disaster, memories of which today shape U.S. policy just as profoundly as did Munich in Southeast Asia."
5) Denying that the U.S. is the self-appointed police officer of the world.
Sen. Udall made another worthwhile and factually accurate point:
To the international community we're saying once again the United States will be the world's police officer. You break a law, and the United States will step in. We are on shaky international legal foundations with this potential strike[.]
In many ways, this is one of the key questions about U.S. foreign policy, about which there is plenty of dispute: Is playing the world's police officer a wise, cost-effective, or legal role? Kerry responded with a humdinger of a euphemism:
[Y]ou raised the question of doesn't this make the United States the police officer of the world. No. It makes the United States a multilateral partner in an effort that the world, 184 nations strong, has accepted the responsibility for.
Besides attempting to sustain the cognitive dissonance of having a strategy to remove Assad but seeking the authorization to only lob bombs at him, the administration is attempting to claim the mantle of international legitimacy for a strike that has no international legal footing, and which almost the entire rest of the world has chosen not to join.
6) Making the laugh-out-loud claim that a post-Assad Syria will be "secular."
A classic lie, when selling Americans on intervening in civil wars from Vietnam to Nicaragua to Iraq, is over-hyping the democratic and peace-loving credenials of the side who stands to gain most from U.S. military intervention. Here are a couple of passages from Kerry, in response to understandable concerns by senators that the opposition to Assad is composed of Islamic militants:
The opposition has increasingly become more defined by its moderation, more defined by the breadth of its membership and more defined by its adherence to some, you know, democratic process and to an all-inclusive, minority-protecting constitution, which will be broad-based and secular with respect to the future of Syria. And that's very critical. [...] I would also say to you, Syria historically has been secular, and the vast majority of Syrians, I believe, want to remain secular. It's—it's our judgment that—and the judgment of our good friends who actually know a lot of this in many ways better than we do because it's their region, their neighborhood -- I'm talking about the Saudis, the Emirates, the Qataris, the Turks, the Jordanians—they all believe that if you could have a fairly rapid transition, the secular component of Syria will re-emerge [...] [T]he fundamentals of Syria are secular, and I believe, will stay that way.
The recent historical record of secular dictators in the Muslim world being removed suggests that Kerry's optimism is fantasia.
7) Asking us to trust U.S. intelligence on chemical weapons because of James Clapper.
Presented with historically understandable skepticism about the quality of U.S. intelligence about Assad using chemical weapons, Kerry said this:
The intelligence community, represented by DNI Clapper, has released a public document, unclassified, available for all to see in which they make their judgment with high confidence that the facts are as they have set forth. So you know, I think that speaks for itself.
Clapper, as you may recall, is a sworn liar. That, like so much of Kerry's testimony yesterday, indeed speaks for itself.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ruth Davidson said MSPs would have to, "think of how money is raised, and from whom, rather than simply how to spend it".
Scotland should be given full income tax powers following a vote against independence, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has said.
They also argued Holyrood should get additional responsibility over VAT, income tax and welfare.
The plans, which have been endorsed by Prime Minister David Cameron, will be in the Conservative manifesto for the 2015 UK election.
Scottish ministers said independence was Scotland's only credible option.
Ms Davidson outlined their plans as they published the conclusions of the party's devolution commission, chaired by Lord Strathclyde, former leader of the House of Lords.
They said Holyrood - currently funded by a Treasury block grant - must be accountable for raising the money it spends.
Image copyright PA Image caption Ms Davidson outlined their plans alongside Lord Strathclyde, who chaired the party's devolution commission
The commission, which said the income tax plan would see the Scottish Parliament accountable for 40% of the money it spends, said:
There was a case for a share of Scottish VAT receipts being assigned to the Scottish Parliament.
The tax-free personal income tax allowance should remain reserved to Westminster, but, after that, the Scottish Parliament would decide on rates and bands.
A new, independent Scottish Fiscal Commission should be created to produce Scottish forecasts
The Scottish Parliament should get responsibility on welfare issues which relate to devolved areas, such as housing benefits, and attendance allowance paid to disabled people aged 65 or over who need help with personal care.
Ms Davidson insisted the proposals, which would be offset against a cut in the block grant, were not "some kind of consolation prize" in the event of a "No" vote in the 18 September independence referendum.
Analysis Ruth Davidson has been on something of a devolution journey of late. Launching their successful Tory leadership campaign back in 2011, they described proposals for new Holyrood financial powers beyond the recent Scotland Act as "a line in the sand", and strongly opposed calls for full fiscal autonomy. But in March last year - no doubt spurred on by the approaching independence referendum - they gave their backing to more financial powers for the Scottish Parliament. Given the Conservatives weren't exactly crazy over the idea of Scottish devolution in the first place, the move was a significant shift in Tory thinking over increased devolved powers. Critics of these latest plans say they've only been put forward because of the prospect of full independence. Ms Davidson has sought to counter that by insisting they're not a "No" vote "consolation prize", but rather a hard look at where devolution needs to go, after 15 years. The Scottish government - unsurprisingly - says voters shouldn't buy that, given the Conservatives past attitude to Scotland's powers. Do Tories and devolution mix?
They said: "In just 15 weeks, Scotland faces its biggest decision in almost 300 years on whether to remain part of the UK.
"We believe the people of Scotland should have good reasons to be passionate about wanting to remain within this Union.
"That is why it's imperative to offer voters in September a positive vision of how our nation can progress and have a bigger say within the UK."
Ms Davidson said some of the proposals may be "hard to achieve", especially when areas like housing benefit become part of the UK government's Universal Credit.
However, the prime minister described the commission's report as a "clear, coherent and Conservative blueprint for the next stage of Scotland's devolution journey".
"All the mainstream pro-UK parties believe in further devolution, so whilst we would want to build consensus for a set of measures and legislation, there is no reason why these changes shouldn't happen early in the next parliament," Mr Cameron said.
But Scotland's deputy first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the Conservatives had a long record of broken promises to Scotland.
"With their package of proposals today, the Tories have demolished a central pillar of the 'No' campaign by recommending ending uniform tax and benefits across UK," they said.
"This is the party that opposed devolution tooth and nail - they broke promises for more powers in the past, and Ruth Davidson was elected leader saying they had drawn 'a line in the sand' against more powers.
"Now they want us to believe they have had a sudden conversion to Scotland's cause."
Image copyright PA Image caption Ruth Davidson insisted the proposals were not a "consolation prize" in the event of a referendum "No" vote
Scotland's other pro-Union parties have already set out their plans for strengthening devolution.
The Liberal Democrats said Holyrood should raise 50% of the money it spends and have control over income, capital gains and inheritance tax.
And Labour's plans, included devolving of three quarters of the 20p tax rate and control over housing benefit and more powers for Scotland's islands.
Scotland is due to get some limited powers over income tax in 2016 as a result of the Scotland Act.
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Camille Cosby, the wife of comedian Bill Cosby, on Monday defended their husband from weeks-long accusations brought by more than a dozen women alleging that the groundbreaking entertainer sexually assaulted them decades ago.
“He is a kind man, a generous man, a funny man, and a wonderful husband, father and friend,” Camille Cosby said in the 210-word statement released by Cosby's publicist. “He is the man you thought you knew.”
It is Camille Cosby's first public statements since the wave of accusations began last month causing networks to shelve projects with “The Cosby Show” Star and several of their standup comedy shows getting canceled.
Camille Cosby, who married Bill Cosby in 1964, called their husband “the man you all knew through their work” and blamed the news media for not vetting their husband's accusers.
“None of us will ever want to be in the position of attacking a victim,” Camille Cosby continued. “But the question should be asked - who is the victim?”
In their statement, Camille Cosby referenced a recent discredited Rolling Stone magazine story about an alleged gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity.
Cosby, the trailblazing African-American comic best known as the wholesome Dr. Cliff Huxtable on the long-running, top-rated television series “The Cosby Show,” has never been charged.
They were sued this month for allegedly sexually molesting a California woman, Judy Huth, as a minor at the Playboy Mansion in 1974.
Cosby's attorney Marty Singer has called the suit meritless and alleges the 77-year-old comedian is a target of extortion.
Spelman College, a historically black women's college in Atlanta, on Monday suspended a visiting professor program named after Cosby, who has also resigned as a trustee from their alma mater Temple University.
Cosby settled a 2005 civil suit that alleged sexual misconduct. Most of the claims against Cosby, which date as far back as the 1960s, have surpassed the statute of limitations for either civil or criminal charges.
On Sunday, Cosby gave a brief interview with the New York Post, disparaging the news media and praising their wife.

The most high profile of Cosby's accusers is model Janice Dickinson, who alleges Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted them in 1982. Model Beverly Johnson alleges Cosby drugged them in the mid-1980s.
Singer has called allegations of sexual assault “discredited” and “defamatory.”
Another accuser, Tamara Green, has sued Cosby for defamation.
There are more than 331,000 organizations with employees contributing to open source projects on GitHub, a sign that open source software is eating the world. But in a sign that open source is sending that same world into an early apocalypse, the biggest corporate contributor to open source is Microsoft, according to new GitHub data.
Huh?
Microsoft, which used to deploy catchy marketing slogans like "Linux is a cancer" and "open source is un-American," didn't morph overnight into a cute and cuddly open-source-loving contributor. Rather, the Microsoft that fought open source as an existential threat to its business simply learned to do business in a new, cloudy manner.
In this new services-based revenue model, open source is Microsoft's best friend.
Redmond gives the most
Microsoft's initial foray into open source was hardly promising. Recognizing a threat to its Windows business, Microsoft took a passive-aggressive approach to open source. On the passive side, the company actively sponsored open source events. In fact, the first sponsor of my Open Source Business Conference in 2004 was Microsoft at the Platinum level (quickly matched by IBM).
On the aggressive side, few could be as surly about the alleged risks of open source than Microsoft. Initially led by Martin Taylor, Microsoft's anti-open-source efforts took the form of one-sided "studies" that somehow always found open source projects lacking and Microsoft products unparalleled, marketing campaigns that urged enterprises to "get the facts," and funding patent royalty shakedowns to discourage adoption of Linux.
Today, Microsoft sings a different tune.
According to GitHub's latest data, Microsoft has surpassed open source stalwarts like Facebook and Google to become the world's top open source contributor with 16,419 contributors. Facebook, by contrast, employs 15,682, while Google has 12,140. Red Hat, the company most often touted as the world's largest open source company, doesn't even make the top 10.
The key to Microsoft's change of heart is actually nothing of the sort. It's a change of business plan.
The cloud likes open source
Sure, let's give credit to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella for changing the tenor of Microsoft's culture. But if we look to the roots of Microsoft's altering affection for open source, that actually started under Steve Ballmer, not Nadella.
It was Ballmer, after all, who hired Jean Paoli to run Microsoft Open Technologies. It was Ballmer who kick-started the open-sourcing of .Net and welcomed the introduction of Microsoft's code repository, CodePlex. And it was Ballmer who served as the early shepherd of the thing that today makes open source not merely possible, but probable, at Microsoft: Azure.
Microsoft Azure, the cloud platform that competes with Amazon Web Services, has changed the way Microsoft thinks about software. So has Office 365, the Xbox, and a range of other Microsoft products that are delivered as or depend upon software services, rather than software licensing. Though Microsoft continues to print billions of dollars in profit from its legacy licensing business, it's the cloud that fundamentally defines Microsoft's future, as well as its relatively recent love for open source.
I've gone on the record as declaring there's no money in open source, and I stick to that. But there's plenty of cash in the cloud, and for a platform company like Microsoft, the value of its cloud business is directly tied to a mighty bear hug embrace of open source on that platform. As I've written, "The companies that make the most money from open source software don't sell it: ... Google, Facebook, and other giants ... heartily embrace open source without having to sell a single line of it ... [because] they sell services based on open source."
Microsoft increasingly sells services built on top of open source projects like Apache Spark, but the company also makes Azure a welcome home for others' open-source-based software applications. As such, we should expect pigs to keep flying and Microsoft to keep loving open source. It's a self-interest thing.
The Supreme Court has halted the deportation of a man with alleged links to Islamic terrorism until their appeal against their removal from the State has been determined.
The appeal will be heard after the Easter courts vacation on a date to be fixed.
The man, aged in their 50s and living in Ireland for several years, was arrested by gardaí last week and detained in prison on foot of the deportation order after a sentence they were serving for having fraudulent travel documents expired.
The three-judge court gave leave on Thursday to the man's lawyers to appeal last week's High Court order permitting their deportation after determining the case raised points of general public importance.
Mr Justice Donal O'Donnell, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy and Mr Justice Peter Charleton, following an application by Michael Lynn SC for the man, also placed a stay on deportation pending the appeal.
Risk of torture
Citing rulings from the European Court of Human Rights, Mr Justice O'Donnell said a stay should be granted because the man's appeal centres on their claim, if deported, that they are at risk of being tortured and subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in breach of their rights under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
The stay was granted on the man's undertaking, given via their lawyers, not to challenge their current detention in prison.
Sinead McGrath BL, for the Minister, citing national security concerns, had opposed any stay, but Mr Lynn argued the man's rights under Article 3 of the ECHR, prohibiting torture, trumped any national security concerns the Minister may have.
Mr Justice O'Donnell said the court was granting permission for an appeal on issues of general importance.
These include whether the reasons provided by the Minister for Justice, when making the deportation order, and then refusing to revoke it, provided a sufficiently lawful basis for those orders.
Other issues included whether the Minister is required to notify, and invite submissions on, country-of-origin material relied upon when arriving at the decision to make deportation orders in relation to those found not to be at risk of treatment contrary to Article 3.
‘Serious concern'
The deportation order was issued by the Minister after gardaí informed their department the activities of the man and their associates were “of serious concern” and “contrary to the State's security”.
The State claims the man had been “raising money for jihadists” and was not only convicted of terrorism offences in their home country but also in France.
The man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, denies involvement in terrorism and claims they are at risk due to their political views.
When dismissing the man's case last week, Mr Justice Richard Humphreys refused to allow them to appeal to the Court of Appeal and lifted a stay preventing their removal from the State because of the judge's view that no point of law of exceptional public importance arose.

With the first week of the BIG3 basketball tournament tipping off Sunday in Brooklyn, New York, co-founder Ice Cube laid down the ground rules for the event in an animated video posted to Twitter.
A few of the biggest differences between BIG3 and the typical game of basketball are that the shot clock is only 14 seconds and the first team to 60 points wins:
The league is made up of eight teams. The regular season lasts eight weeks before the playoffs begin Aug. 20 in Seattle's KeyArena. Las Vegas will host the finals Aug. 26.
Former NBA stars Allen Iverson, Jermaine O'Neal, Ricky Davis, Kenyon Martin, Mike Bibby and Stephen Jackson are among the notable names taking part.
While BIG3 organizers are thinking outside the box in terms of the league's rules, Cube was quick to point out the stakes will still be high for those on the court.
"I think it's going to be a treat for the fans and it's not an All-Star Game," they said, per the Associated Press' Brian Mahoney. "Guys want to win. They want to be champions. They want to be the first champions, so I'm not worried about that at all."
Ice Cube added that hand checking, which BIG3 will allow, is supposed to encourage players to play tighter defense, unlike the NBA All-Star Game, where players are often allowed free paths to the basket.
German police say 82 police officers and a number of protesters have been injured in clashes triggered by the eviction of squatters at a left-wing cultural centre in the northern city of Hamburg.
More than 7,000 people demonstrated on Saturday against the closure of the Rote Flora centre, a former theatre that houses squatters and serves as a meeting point for left-wing activists.
Hamburg police said some of the protesters began hurling objects at the 2,000 officers shortly after the demonstration began.
"The protesters suddenly started marching, and this was not what we agreed on with them, so we had to stop the march," said police spokesperson Mirko Streiber. "Then bottles, stones and fireworks were thrown at us, injuring several officers. We had no option but to deploy water cannons."
After the protesters were dispersed, about 1,000 protesters roamed the streets and attacked supermarkets, banks and the police, a police spokesperson said.
Prior to the demonstration, police had declared parts of the inner city a "danger zone," giving law enforcement extended rights to search and detain people without initial suspicion.

Democratic presidential hopeful Martin O'Malley is heading to South Carolina on Wednesday to pay their respects to the late state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, among those killed in last week's church massacre, according to two associates familiar with O'Malley's plans.
The former Maryland governor is planning to join other mourners at the capitol in Columbia, where Pinckney will lie in state this afternoon, according to the O'Malley associates, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to talk on behalf of their campaign.
[Clementa Pinckney, preacher and legislator, spoke out for justice]
Pinckney was also the pastor at the historic Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, where a gunman killed them and eight others at a Bible study.
On a previous trip to South Carolina, an early presidential nominating state, O'Malley paid a visit to the Charleston church. Pinckney pulled together a group of clergy and community leaders to meet with O'Malley in the basement of the church and gave them a tour, according to one of O'Malley's associates.
[In speech to nation's mayors, O'Malley calls for removal of Confederate flag in S.C.]
In the aftermath of the shootings, O'Malley has been outspoken about the need for additional national gun-control measures, noting that Maryland lawmakers passed state legislation at their urging in 2013. O'Malley has also been among those calling for the removal of the Confederate flag from the capitol grounds in South Carolina and other states where it still flies.
O'Malley's planned trip on Wednesday was first reported by CNN.
It's painful to watch someone who has so completely lost the narrative
As Emma pointed out yesterday, Terri Lynn Land is on a one-woman crusade to ensure that we're fully aware that they don't support income equality for women by repeatedly bringing up the “War on Women” topic. Yesterday it was a comical video that is getting trounced all over the internet. For example, here's the inestimable David Nir at Daily Kos:
My only response: Man. This kind of guffawing rejoinder to substantive policy criticisms is truly pathetic. Anyone swayed by this kind of “argument” is almost certainly already very hostile to Democrats—the sort of conservative who declares, “There's no ‘War on Women' because Monica Lewinsky!” It's hard to imagine this ad will persuade anyone persuadable, but the fact that Land's even put it out suggests they think this topic makes them vulnerable.
Today it's an eight-paragraph essay on their website titled “The Real War on Women.”
The overly long essay (someone should really explain to them what tl;dr means) is an exercise in watching a person who has lost the thread trying to partake in a conversation. I suppose it's not too surprising that they don't get it. For someone as filthy rich as Terri Lynn Land, income inequality isn't really a “thing”. They wax lyrical about their grandmother and then goes on to say the real war on women is taxes and over-regulation.
Derp.
They show no evidence whatsoever that they have a clue about how their positions perpetuate the problem of women being paid less than men for the same work. They show no evidence whatsoever that they have a clue about the fact that laws passed to restrict a woman's access to safe, affordable, legal family planning services like abortions are a direct attack on women and women alone. They show no evidence whatsoever that they have a clue about the fact that women pay more for their healthcare than men do.
Yet they want to repeal the Affordable Care Act that ends making having a vagina a preexisting condition. They have stated that women don't want equal pay, they want “flexibility” (apparently men don't) and that they would have opposed the the Paycheck Fairness Act. As an RNC Committeewoman, they voted for the Republican Party's platform which called for banning abortions, even in the case of rape or incest, and has the endorsement of Right to Life.
No reduction of taxes addresses these issues. No reduction of regulations addresses these issues. No amount of misty-eyed poetry about their grandmother fixes these issues.
Every step of the way Terri Lynn Land has come down on the wrong side of issues that impact women. It doesn't matter if the person pointing that out is a Penised American (like Gary Peters) or a Vaginaed American. There is a War on Women and Terri Lynn Land is one of its foot soldiers.
But don't take it from me, a Penised American. Take it from a Vaginaed American, Senate Democratic Leader Gretchen Whitmer:
.@TerriLLand Would you like ME to explain equal pay to you instead then? #MISen — Gretchen Whitmer (@gretchenwhitmer) April 22, 2014
Someone should tell the GOP that just because your candidate has XX chromosomes does not mean you suddenly have a pro-woman agenda. — Gretchen Whitmer (@gretchenwhitmer) April 22, 2014
The idea that Terri Lynn Land thinks that just because she's a woman somehow makes them a pro-woman candidate leaves their silence in the face of serious challenges Michigan women and families face every day all the more unacceptable and wrong. Ms. Land is not mocking Gary Peters – they are mocking Michigan women who deserve an actual answer as to why Ms. Land supports forcing rape victims to pay more for the health care they might need after an attack. Ms. Land's snark is heartbreaking to women all across our great state who deserve their respect, but instead have to suffer through their silly stunts.
It's clear that Land is very worried about how women view them and how that is affecting their chance to be elected. They even now claims in their essay that, “I'm a woman, of course I support equal pay for equal work!” despite being on the record for saying the opposite.
If you are a Vaginaed American, especially if you are a Vaginaed Michigander, let your voice be heard on this. Do NOT let Terri Lynn Land off the hook simply because they possess a vagina. Speak out against them hypocrisy.
The very idea that, despite their positions and record, they are somehow pro-women just because of their gender is as sexist as their Party's stance on nearly every issue impacting women.
Don't let them get away with it.
Finally, here's Progress Michigan's response:
Did you know that those exquisite White House Christmas decorations First Lady Melania Trump proudly unveiled yesterday are "spooky," "spine-chilling," and "nightmarish" — like scenes from Mordor, Narnia, or The Shining?
It took most of the day yesterday, but by nightfall, the Trump-hating media was able to settle on an unfavorable narrative with which to belittle the newly unveiled decor.
Here is the official White House video of the first lady showing off the decorations:
The decorations are up! @WhiteHouse is ready to celebrate! Wishing you a Merry Christmas & joyous holiday season! pic.twitter.com/d6ZuyeFvrw — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) November 27, 2017
What's not to like? According to HuffPost, the "Spooky White House Christmas Chamber Is Creeping Everyone The Heck Out." "One chamber in particular is getting attention online for all the wrong reasons. It's a twig-lined hallway that's being compared to everything from 'The Shining' to 'The Blair Witch Project,'" HuffPo wrote.
Instead of handing out treats to everyone this Halloween, one North Dakota woman says she'll be handing letters to children whom they believe are "moderately obese."
"I just want to send a message to the parents of kids that are really overweight," the woman told Fargo, N.D. radio station Y-94. "I think it's just really irresponsible of parents to send them out looking for free candy just 'cause all the other kids are doing it."
The letter reads:
"Happy Halloween and Happy Holidays Neighbor!
You are probably wondering why your child has this note; have you ever heard the saying, 'It takes a village to raise a child'? I am disappointed in 'the village' of Fargo Moorhead, West Fargo.
You [sic] child is, in my opinion, moderately obese and should not be consuming sugar and treats to the extent of some children this Halloween season.
My hope is that you will step up as a parent and ration candy this Halloween and not allow your child to continue these unhealthy eating habits
Thank You"
The woman emailed the letter after calling into the radio station Tuesday morning.
"They were chatting today and got a call from Cheryl out of the blue, who really wanted to voice their opinion about obesity, and that it really takes an entire community to solve the obesity challenge," said Y-94 Program and Music Director J.T.
"I'm contributing to their health problems and really, their kids are everybody's kids. It's a whole village," the woman added in the radio interview.
Dr. Katie Gordon, an assistant professor of clinical psychology at North Dakota State University who studies eating disorders, says children and adolescents, in particular, are very conscious of fitting in with peers, and that letter might hurt more than help.
"It's just that kind of thing that for some kids, if they're vulnerable, might trigger major problems," Gordon explained.
So, what do people around Fargo, where the woman who wrote the letter lives, think about my idea?
"Here, you get candy. You get a letter. Like that kid hasn't suffered enough?"
— Julia Roland, Fargo resident
"I would say that it's nobody's business really."
— Jesse Lehto, Fargo resident
"This is more of an issue that parents should be working with kids on. It seems inappropriate to me."
— Kent Wild, Fargo resident
Dr. Gordon said it's important to remember that one's appearance does not necessarily reflect whether a person has healthy eating and exercising habits.
Fifa has its headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland
World football governing body Fifa lost nearly £300m in 2016 and is scheduled to lose close to £400m in 2017.
Legal costs related to the corruption scandal which engulfed the organisation and "ill-considered previous investments" contributed to the losses.
The latest financial results follow a loss of nearly £100m in 2015.
Fifa forecasts a financial recovery in 2018, when Russia hosts the World Cup, and expects to finish the four years since 2014 with an £80m profit.
The governing body, which is still under criminal investigations in Switzerland and the United States, paid out nearly £50m to lawyers last year.
Former president Sepp Blatter's investments in a football museum and hotel in Zurich have proved unsuccessful so far, too, and are referred to as "ill-considered".
Last night I watched the first episode of Cosmos. Having read the book while in high school, I was excited to watch the video of Cosmos, especially as I've heard a ton of good things about it. Plus, space absolutely fascinates me. While deciding on possible college majors while in high school, Astrophysics/Astronomy kept bouncing around in my head. Ever since I can remember, I loved staring up into the night sky and watching the stars and imagining the possibilities of all that vast space. During my first drive down to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, I remember pulling over during the night somewhere in Virginia and just staring up at the night sky, having never seen it that clearly from the light-polluted sky of Boston.
Anyway, after balancing out the difficulties of learning about Astrophysics/Astronomy, combined with my false assumption that I'd be stuck in a desert somewhere with a small team staring out at the night sky, I decided to major in something a bit more practical but that I still enjoyed (Business, though looking back, I should've double-majored in Economics and Computer Science). But I still remained fascinated by space and spent many hours reading books and admiring high-resolution shots from the various telescopes and and other devices we send out in space.
Mars, baby, Mars
While watching Cosmos, which takes us on a journey through the known universe, from its very edge, back through to our galaxy, our solar system, and finally our planet, it struck me how little we've travelled in the past 40 years since the first moon landing. To many, it seems like we went to the moon and then flatlined in terms of space exploration progress.
Now, don't get me wrong. I know we've made tons of advances in this area over the past 40 years, but in the grand scheme of the universe, it's really difficult to think we've made it very far. Currently, we have capabilities to go to Mars. There are an immense amount of variables, for instance we don't know the effect of such a voyage on the human body, or even if we could survive outside the zone around the Earth.
Ensuring that any astronauts who make the trip have enough air, food, and water to get to Mars and back is not a simple hurdle. The logistics of such an adventure are overwhelming to any one person. But, today we have all the capabilities to plan out and solve this logistics. We may fail, massively, but not trying is an even bigger failure.
Such a mission would likely require global collaboration, as the costs, time, energy, and man-power required to run the trip are likely too high a burden for any one country to take on. But imagine if it happens. It would spark a new era of humanity, one where we work together to achieve an awe-inspiring goal, the first human on Mars.
Goosebumps ran up and down my arms just thinking about it.
The technological and logistical progress we'd make by going on such a trip would alone be worth the cost. The really big hurdle to cross is the danger to the human astronauts who make the trip. This danger is not to be taken lightly, but neither should it be seen as an impossible impediment. I can't speak for any potential astronauts who'd make the trip, but going off my gut feeling, if I had gone along a career path that would make me a viable candidate for a trip to Mars, I would be more than willing to put my life on the line. I'm sure there's a talented crew who'd say the same, the value and progress of going to Mars would outweigh the real possibility of not coming back.
What about you? If you were an astronaut (or are one), would you be willing to risk it all to go to Mars?
The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean
The first episode of the space series Cosmos, narrated by the Carl Sagan. Absolutely fascinating and a must-watch.
Thanks to the Hubble telescope for the awe-inspiring photo of Mars.
Fidel Castro's firing squads in Cuba
Fidel Castro is often portrayed as the “benevolent” dictator of Cuba, such portrayals are unarguably wrong. The evidence of their bloodthirsty and murderous nature is unequivocal and available for anyone who wants to know the truth. Unfortunately such evidence is rarely discussed by the news media and at schools. There's perhaps no more grizzly atrocity committed by Fidel Castro than the firing squads which they implemented. Beginning as a rebel, before they would eventually take power in Cuba, Fidel Castro used firing squad executions to enforce discipline, punish followers deemed disloyal or intimidate potential opposition. At the beginning of the Castro regime there was a reign of terror typical of revolutions in which the firing squad was used prominently but the executions continued for decades.
The Cuba Archive which documents deaths and disappearances resulting from Fidel Castro's Cuban revolution has documented 3,615 firing squad executions conducted by the Cuban state since Castro took over on January 1, 1959.
Opponents of the death penalty should be horrified at the amount of death Fidel Castro and their accomplices have directly caused. It's important to note that in Revolutionary Cuba there are none of the due process guarantees found in a western-style democracy. Most of Castro's firing squad victims were afforded only a perfunctory show trial the outcome of which was predetermined, some didn't even get that. Ernesto “Ché” Guevara is a popular culture icon, their face adorns posters and t-shirts around the globe. Most people don't realize that they were Fidel Castro's chief enforcer and had a personal hand in at least 100 firing squad executions, often delivering the coup de grace personally. In response to questions about Castro's firing squads Guevara once said, “To send men to the firing squad, judicial proof is unnecessary. These procedures are an archaic bourgeois detail. This is a revolution. And a revolutionary must become a cold killing machine motivated by pure hate.”
Film of a Castro show trial and execution during the reign of terror below:
In addition to the firing squad executions 1,253 extrajudicial killings have been attributed to the Castro regime.
Below is a photograph of a firing squad victim being blindfolded by a young Raul Castro. It's important to note that Raul the current Cuban dictator who is often touted as a soft-hearted and pragmatic man has as much blood on their hands as their older brother, Fidel.
More ghastly photographs of Castro's firing squads are available at TheRealCuba.com and LatinAmericanStudies.org.
Here is film of Colonel Cornelio Rojas being executed by a Castro Firing Squad.
More about the mob atmosphere surrounding the trials and executions available in an archival newsreel here.
The Castro brothers have also used firing squads more recently. In the summer of 1989 the Castro regime arrested Cuban Army General Arnaldo Ochoa and several other officers. They were charged with drug trafficking. Within a few weeks Ochoa and three others were dead at the hands of a Castro firing squad. The trial was a farce in which Ochoa was forced to confess (video here). Many believe the real crime committed by Ochoa and others charged was disloyalty since Cuba was a known transshipment point for illegal drugs for years and it is highly unlikely that the Castro brothers were unaware of it and not profiting from it.
In April 2003 Fidel Castro's government executed 3 men who hijacked a ferry boat in an attempt to escape Cuba. They were sentenced to death and killed by firing squad less than two weeks after the alleged crime was committed.

She's cackling all the way to the bank! Chewbacca mom Candace Payne has made $420,000 since they posted a video of themselves wearing a Chewbacca mask from the Star Wars franchise, Time magazine reports.
The Grand Prairie, Texas, resident racked up the extra cash from gifts she's received since the video went viral late last month. According to Time, they have received $3,000 from Kohl's, $7,500 from talk show visits (she appeared on shows such as Good Morning America and The Late Late Show), a $7,500 Walt Disney World vacation and VIP passes to the Fan Expo Dallas convention worth $2,000.
The biggest freebie she's received so far? Payne made bank when Southeastern University in Lakeland, Florida, gave them two young children college scholarships worth $400,000.
As previously reported, Payne went to Kohl's to buy yoga pants, but instead left with the electronic Chewbacca mask, which makes the wookiee's trademark sweet growling noise when the mouth opens. (The items retails for $29.99 at Target.) They posted the video on their Facebook page on May 19, and it's since received more than 150 million views.
Payne opened up about their overnight stardom in an interview with GMA on May 23. "I was thinking, ‘I've got 30 minutes before I have to be responsible and pick up my children from school, and once they see this I'll never get to see it again.' So I thought, I'm going to share this with my Facebook friends and family, and if anybody wants to see it, they're going to have to see it now. And I'm going to document. This was mine to begin with. This was never theirs," they said at the time. "In all honestly, I think the world as a whole is in need of a good laugh. I think we're in need of somebody to lift our spirits, to not take ourselves so seriously, and to maybe break some cynicism worldwide."

On Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing to consider the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act of 2016, also known as PRENDA. The legislation claims to help communities of color and even women by putting bans on sex-selective and race-based abortions. However, as NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue stated in their Congressional testimony to be given on Thursday (which Bustle was given an advance copy of) PRENDA could mean that abortion providers may face "five years in prison for failing to determine if race or sex is a factor in a woman's decision to terminate a pregnancy." Hogue added that, "ultimately, the legislation could erect new barriers to reproductive health care for women and perpetuates stereotypes about immigrant communities and communities of color."
The Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act isn't new. The legislation has been proposed multiple times. Perhaps most famously, in 2012, the House of Representatives rejected PRENDA legislation. Although it's not getting much attention, PRENDA legislation is once again a concern
Opponents to the legislation — which, in addition to NARAL Pro-Choice America, include the National Asian Pacific Women's Forum (NAPAWF), Trust Black Women Partnership, and In Our Own Voice: National Black Women's Reproductive Justice Agenda — say that, among other things, PRENDA would dramatically increase racial profiling among women of color, most notably black, Asian American, and Pacific Islander women. Activists have called the bill a wolf in sheep's clothing, one that purports to care about women's health and reproductive rights while actually restricting them in a racially motivated way.
"It's a sneaky little bugger," Miriam Yeung, Executive Director of the National Asian Pacific Women's Forum, tells Bustle. "This bill would ban abortions off the backs of women of color and immigrants, and it tries to tell us it's for our own good. The proponents cite 'women's rights' and all of our social justice language and claim it's to help eliminate discrimination."
Bustle reached out to the office of Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ) who introduced the legislation, but was unable to receive comment by the time of publication.
In 2012, when PRENDA legislation passed through the House Judiciary Committee (but, ultimately, failed to be passed in the House of Representatives), they released a statement that:
As Americans, all of us know in our hearts that aborting a little baby because they or they happen to be the "wrong color" or because or they are a little girl instead of a little boy is fundamentally wrong, and represents a betrayal of the precious truth that all human beings are created equal, with the Imago Dei stamped on their souls.
I know when the subject is related in any way to abortion, the doors of reason and human compassion in our minds and hearts often close, and the humanity of the unborn and the inhumanity of what is being done to them can sometimes no longer be seen. But this is the civil rights battle that will define our generation. At the very least, we should be able to agree that allowing the lives of unborn children to be torn from them simply because they happen to be the "wrong color" or the "wrong sex" is not who we are as Americans.
Yeung is one of the people who will testify before the Constitution and Civil Justice subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee on Thursday regarding PRENDA.Since it's widely believed among those fighting PRENDA that the legislation specifically targets black and Asian American women, I ask Yeung if the "sex-based abortion" aspect is tied to a mistaken belief that Asian American women abort female fetuses in a similar manner as, say, Chinese women. Yeung does not equivocate.
"Yes," they said flatly, before giving an exasperated laugh. They then explains:
The bill proponents cite examples that are happening in India and China and, with xenophobic logic, assume Asian American women are importing those same barbaric practices here in the United States.
Yeung notes that many Asian American feminists have at times been concerned about the phenomenon of sex-selective abortion in Asian culture, only to look at the numbers and find that Asian American women, on average, are actually having more girls than white Americans, according to a University of Chicago study. Plus, while sex-selective abortion is not the widespread problem for Asian American women as it is for Asian women in other nations, the United Nations and the World Health Organization have been adamant that banning abortion is disastrous for women, and not the way to solve that problem anyway.

And what about "race-based" abortions? If we allow for a little oversimplification in the case of mixed-race fetuses, we can generally say that a black woman knows they are going to have a black baby. That means a black woman seeking abortion for any number of personal reasons can be ludicrously accused of choosing an abortion for race-based reasons.
"Therein lies the hypocrisy and the nonsensicalness," Yeung tells Bustle:
The racial profiling, the burden of this being put on the women. When black women are targeted with this bill, it's connected to a larger racist campaign that says black women choosing abortion is endangering their [race], that it's black genocide, they claim places like Planned Parenthood are causing black genocide.
Hogue's testimony will also likely address the legislation's problems with race. Testifying against a previous incarnation of the bill, in 2011, NARAL's former president Nancy Keenan stated that the proposed legislation:
...subjects providers to fines and prison time for failing to detect that a woman is seeking abortion services for reasons of race or sex selection, the legislation essentially would encourage racial profiling in the doctor's office.
"We oppose this bill," Yeung says, "because it is a hypocritical attempt to restrict women's rights while claiming to fight sexism and racism. You cannot give women rights by taking them away, and that it fundamentally the flawed logic behind this bill. It's a bad policy solution in search of a non-existent problem."
You'll be able to watch the livestream of their testimony here at 3pm ET on Thursday.
Footage of six ISIS Soldiers killed by sniper is really from Medal of Honor Kills unconfirmed?
Iranian State TV broadcast footage of what it believed to be a Hezbollah sniper killing six ISIS soldiers in under two minutes. This would be extremely impressive in the real world, although it turns out the footage that was broadcast was really from a Let's Play video of someone playing EA's Medal of Honor.
The original broadcast footage is now being picked up across several TV networks in Iran and Saudi Arabia, according to French news outlet France 24. It's also being spread across the Internet as real battlefield footage claiming to show six ISIS fighters being killed by a Hezbollah sniper.
While the footage appears to look quite authentic, a clear giveaway is the icon that pops up at the bottom of the screen to notify the player they achieved a headshot. In the broadcast footage, you can see icon pop up a number of times, the first of which comes up around the 20-second mark.
Now if only the person behind the Let's Play video would consider a future as a sniper. Then we could see if their video-game abilities could transfer into real-world confirmed kills against ISIS soldiers.
Here's the full Let's Play the footage was taken from, which was taken from around the 2:50 mark of the following video:
Thirty-three backs broke more runs of 20-plus yards than Giovani Bernard last season, but the Cincinnati Bengals runner plans to correct that statistic in Year 2.
"If you're a running back, you always want to be able to have explosive runs," Bernard said Friday, per ESPN.com. "Maybe not so much just the 10-yard runs or 15-yard runs or the 20.
"I want to be able to break the 50s, 60s and 70s. And who knows? Maybe the 80s and 90s. Things like that take hard work and dedication. That's really where your skills come into play is on those explosive runs."
Only three of Bernard's 170 rookie totes cracked the 20-yard barrier last season. Their longest gallop was a 35-yard touchdown bolt against the Miami Dolphins in Week 9, a game that also produced their highest yards-per-carry figure at 8.78.
"This year, I'll take a few more chances," Bernard said. "A lot of people talk about the Miami run. That was a chance that I took. But that was a run where, I don't do that often."
While expected to split time with rookie Jeremy Hill, Bernard is a lock to see more opportunities this season in play-caller Hue Jackson's run-heavy scheme.
Jackson did wonders for Darren McFadden in Oakland and brings a history of unleashing their backs. With BenJarvus Green-Ellis on the roster bubble, the fleet-footed Bernard has taken first-team snaps during OTAs and projects as Cincy's opening day starter.
We expect he'll get their wish in 2014.

The SD Card Association has announced its next generation SD format, called SDXC (SD eXtended Capacity). The new format uses the same SD card connectors but increases the maximum storage capacity from 32GB to 2TB. It also increases the read/write speed, reaching a maximum of 104MB per second in 2009 with an eye toward reaching 300MB per second in the future.
Prototype / mockup SDXC cards
– will offer up to 2TB of storage
and 300MB per second transfer speed These improvements should allow consumer devices using SDXC cards to store up to 100 high definition movies, 480 hours of high definition recordings, 136,000 large photographs, and many thousands of songs or audio books. The increased read/write speeds should also allow improved frame rates in digital cameras and allow consumers to shoot professional quality video on their home equipment. According to the SD Association, the speed of an SDXC card will not decrease as the memory capacity increases, as is often the case with current memory cards.
The card will leverage Microsoft's exFat file system, a file system that significantly decreases the overhead used by resource files and similar files required by the system. Originally designed for Windows Embedded CE 6.0 and incorporated into Windows Vista Service Pack 1, there is no information currently available concerning interoperability with other operating systems although current devices using the file system are not compatible with computers running Macintosh or Linux operating systems. It is not clear at this time if the SD Association has a solution for users running these operating systems.
SD Association SD and SDXC roadmap The formal specification for SDXC was released on January 7th 2009. Support for the higher capacity and speeds will also be integrated into other SD-related specifications including the SDHC, SDIO, and embedded SD specifications, although no timetable is available for these modifications. Cards and devices supporting the new format will lag the specification release by a minimum of several months (some estimations predict SDXC supported cards and devices will begin to appear near the end of 2009 or early in 2010). The SD Association expects the first SDXC cards to be 64GB with larger cards to follow later on.
In CES 2009 the SD Association showcased mockups of upcoming SDXC cards up to 2TB and discussed its roadmap for the speed increase of the SDXC format up to 300MB per second, which should happen somewhere early in the next decade.
TFOT has reported on other memory cards and memory card formats including the A-Data Class 6 SDHC card designed specifically for use in Asus Eee PCs and the Toshiba 32MB embedded NAND flash chip compatible with the embedded SD specification. We have also reported on various USB drives including the OCZ Throttle , which adds External Serial ATA connectivity to a conventional USB drive, the Pretec i-Disk Bulletproof USB drive, and the Yego , which combines a USB drive with a two port USB hub.
Writing can be a lonely job. But, there are occasions, when it doesn't have to be – when you can count on gifted individuals who can lend you the creative support you need to make your script that much better. I'm talking about the unsung heroes: the idea board bouncers, the pitch spinners, the story breakers, the readers, the revisers, the polishers, and the critiquers…
After completing a first draft of any script, I always read it aloud to Bubba and Lulu. They are, without a doubt, my toughest critics. Bubba is a stickler for dynamic act outs while Lulu is all over the teases and tags. Also, anything that smells like beef.
Writer's Block is nothing to be ashamed of. It happens to the best of us. And, when it happens to me, I prefer to set the script aside for a while and revisit it later, with fresh eyes. Or just hand it over to Lulu who will often stay up into the wee hours, fine-tuning dialogue.
Defend your vision, but don't be overly precious with your ideas. A good editor will let you know when you're getting in the way of your own writing. Often with a look. See above.
Well, it may have been Saturday but SOME people were very busy at work. I'm not referring to me of course but to the cast crew, photographer and their crew, Ivon Bartok, and Grand Overseer/Executive Producer Vanessa Piazza who were on set today for the Dark Matter gallery shoot. I dropped by and caught a brief glimpse of some of the work-in-progress. Beautiful shots.

Margaret Rhee's robot poems are quirky, lovely, and full of humanity. They're just strange enough to make the reader consider our connections from a new angle, but suffused with enough longing and emotion to resonate. The two poems featured in Issue 28 are only several of a series of robot poems Rhee has been working on. We asked them to give us a reading of the two poems, and then had them answer a few questions about their work.
Robots are awesome. Can you tell me a little bit about the inspiration for these two poems?
Robots are awesome, but because they are complicated. I was at the Oakland Museum for the really wonderful Giant Robot exhibition, and it was so great seeing young children gather around the small robot figurines, exclaiming with awe and delight. On the other hand, we have portrayals of frightening robots in popular culture, such as the Terminator, or sexy depictions of killer cylons like in the television series, Battlestar Gallatica. So, robots provoke diverse meanings shaped by society's relationship with technology and difference. Basically, robots teach us what it means to be human.
"Beam, Robot" and "How to Make Love to a Robot," are two poems from my full-length manuscript on robot love poems. The poems were inspired, after my friend, the wonderful poet and roboticist Dmitry Berenson.
When I was completing my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley, I had a desk at the Sutardja Dai Hall lab. Dmitry had the desk next to me. At the time, they held a postdoctoral position working with roboticist and new media artist Ken Goldberg. Ken also served on my dissertation committee and helped inspire my interest in robots. Dmitry is a really amazing poet, but at the time of our meeting, I had no idea they were a poet. I assumed they are, like everyone in the lab, a scientist or technologist. The only humanists in the lab were working in new media, and we were quite marginal in the space. Additionally, you cannot assume every humanist writes poetry.
At my desk, I had a photograph of poet Langston Hughes, and a pile of poetry collections on my shelf, so my poetry affiliation was quite obvious! One day, Dmitry asked me who the person in the photograph was, and I started explaining Langston Hughes' poetry by way of "What Happens to a Dream Deferred?" to which Dmitry wonderfully interrupted me, as they were quite familiar with the poem. They shared they were a poet too. They actually studied with Terrance Hayes when they were a robotics graduate student at Carnegie Mellon, and it turned out Dmitry is a really amazing poet. We soon started a poetry writing group with others at UC Berkeley. One day, after a group discussion on poetry and love, I wrote the first poem in the series, "Love, Robot" and it was published in the literary journal Mission At Tenth.
In 2013, I was accepted to a graduate workshop in poetry with Robert Hass, one of my formative poetry mentors, and I wrote both poems, "Beam, Robot," and "This Is How You Make Love To A Robot," along with other robot love poems in the workshop. As I mentioned, I work closely with Ken Goldberg on my scholarly research on the cultural history of robots. As mentors and interlocutors, Bob, Ken, and Dmitry, greatly shaped and inspired my early writing of the robot love poems.
I like the juxtaposition of the two poems, how one dictates the terms of making love to a robot, and the other actually tells how that love story might unfold. The second poem in particular, is suffused with a very human longing, but in a way that is almost disconnected, like it's an echo or simulacrum of the human-human version of a relationship. I can't help but wonder about the narrator (or narrators) of the poems, and the unique experience and authority this narrator has in speaking about robots, as a human. Who or what do you imagine this narrator to be?
I'm still figuring out this world. The world of these poems belongs to a near future where love between robots and humans is more than possible, even if marginalized. I love how you use the word echo, and perhaps, I think of love and memories, as never ceasing echoes too. What does the heart know? The heart never forgets. The heart has a different temporality than what we understand in this world, as time.
The narrators of these poems are firmly situated within this near future world of 'love, robot,' and perhaps that is where their authority comes from. Although, I think at heart, I hope the poems confuse and blur the boundaries between human and machine.
I'm interested in exploring how love can transcend demarcations of difference? How can we understand how love and lovemaking is also socially constructed as much as it is chemistry and physicality?
According to psychologist John Money, humans all have "love maps." The "love map" is a template or group of messages encoded in individual's biology, which describes our ideals of love, desire, and attraction. So could we think about how the human heart can be programmed, coded, and built like robots? How might machine and objects evoke intimacy, attachment, and love?
I understand that these are two poems in a series of robot poems you've been working on, and also that you've done your doctoral research on “Asian American Robot Art”. Can you explain a little about your fascination with robots, and how it has interested you in the context of your writing?
I was very blessed to work with some inspiring professors at UC Berkeley on my dissertation research. As I mentioned, I worked with Ken and they taught my first course in new media art and inspired my interests in the cultural study of robots. Additionally, I worked with feminist science and technology studies scholar Charis Thompson who also inspired my passion in the study of science, gender, and race. As I began working through these robot questions within poetry and scholarship, I discovered amazing cultural workers and scholars who inspire my hopes for my work, which include Minsoo Kang, Ronaldo Wilson, Douglas Kearney, Neil Aitken, Larissa Lai and others. At UC Berkeley, I taught a class, "Race, Robots, and the Inhuman," which draws upon these questions on robots and difference. I learned tons from the very smart students I got to work with.
In my scholarship, I examine how Asian Americans are perceived by American mainstream cultures as cyborgs or robots. My book explores the roots and politics of this perception through popular media, history, and robotic art. I am fascinated by how Asian American artists, seemingly racialized as inhuman, would utilize the figure of the robot to resist. I ask, how might robotic art, seemingly devoid of racial connotations, work as racial resistance?
Our theme for this issue is “R/Evolution” – this idea that those two ideas are intertwined. Where do you see the current landscape of Asian American poetry fitting into ideas of revolution, and where do you think it's headed?
I think Asian American poetry today is in a phenomenal, exciting, and dazzling place. We're in an incredibly exciting moment, but we are also the beneficiaries of movement building and the resistance work by pioneering Asian American poets from previous generations. It is really interesting to think about the connections between the literary and Asian American and people of color revolutions of the 1960s. If the publication of the first anthology of Asian American writing, Aiiieeeee! An Anthology of Asian-American Writers marks the start of an Asian American literary movement, we can see how the formation of Kundiman, the first national Asian American poetry organization may be the start of the contempoary Asian American literary movement. Years ago, I talked to poet Myung Mi Kim about these connections, who said something really insightful: every movement has it's own charge
As Myung Mi's words suggests, every generation has its our own charge. While they were incredibly pioneering, some of the Asian American literary movements of the past, weren't great at including women, queers, and other ethnic groups aside from Japanese and Chinese American writers. But again, they battled incredibly racist literary worlds, and assumptions, and in doing so, they formed Asian American literary cultural organizations that make pioneering Asian Americans organizations, like Kundiman, Hyphen, and the Asian American Writers Workshop, possible today.
If we think of revolution as evolution, I think it suggests how every revolution needs to build upon previous movements and stay in conversation with that history, as well as reimagining the future. We can't forget where we come from, and yet, we can't forget where and how we want to move forward in a way that is politically and aesthetically transformative. I worked at the Kundiman's retreat last year as the Fellow Liaison, and I could not help but see viscerally how Asian American poetry is a thriving and powerful force. Kundiman co-founder Joseph Legaspi once said something like the future of Asian American poetry is not only just okay, but it's spectacular. I believe him.
What's the latest, greatest book you've read, and what books are you looking forward to?
The latest, greatest books I've been reading includes reading poetry and scholarship: Petra Kuppers & Neil Marcus' Cripple Poetics which is a beautiful love story about disability, and Margo Machida's Unsettled Visions: Contemporary Asian American Artists and the Social Imaginary. Since it's summer, I've also been reading novels and I was very moved by The History of Love by Nicole Krauss. I'm looking forward to reading dear friend the great poet Craig Santos Perez's new collection, [GUMA'] and my wondrous femme scholar mentor Juana Maria Rodriguez's forthcoming book Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings, and the very fabulous Hoang Tan Nguyen's A View from the Bottom: Asian American Masculinity and Sexual Representation. These are all books I'm currently reading.

Michael Steele is in full damage control mode after Arlen Specter left the GOP. Steele claimed that Specter is a left winger who the Republicans look forward to beating in 2010. Yeah, Republicans are going to beat Specter the same way that Steele promised they were going to win the House special election in New York.
Here is Steele's statement, “Some in the Republican Party are happy about this. I am not. Let's be honest-Senator Specter didn't leave the GOP based on principles of any kind. They left to further their personal political interests because they knew that they were going to lose a Republican primary due to their left-wing voting record. Republicans look forward to beating Sen. Specter in 2010, assuming the Democrats don't do it first.”
Steele doesn't realize that the Democrats aren't going to field a candidate against Specter, so the Democrats aren't going to beat him, and guess what? Pat Toomey and the Republicans have no shot against them in 2010. Specter is wildly popular with Democrats and Independents. In a March Quinnipiac Poll, Specter got a 71% approval rating from Democrats, and a 47%-29% disapproval rating from Republicans.
Specter themselves admitted that the likely primary loss to Toomey factored in to their decision. Recent polling revealed that Specter was trailing Toomey by 23-25 points. The reality is that in the new Republican Party, Specter is a lefty, which says more about the state of the GOP than it does, Arlen Specter.
We all should have seen this move coming. Here in PA, political observers were starting to wonder why Democrats weren't lining up their candidate for next year yet. I think we know why now.
Specter will cruise to victory as a Democrat. Michael Steele doesn't understand Pennsylvania politics. Extremists don't win in the state. Pennsylvania is a moderate state. Bob Casey is a pro-life Democrat, while Arlen Specter was a pro-choice Republican, which perfectly sums up Pennsylvania politics.

Nick Saban going to Alabama is the biggest non-story of this non-playoff season.
For slightly more than a month now, since the Crimson Tide stupidly fired Mike Shula, Saban has been the target of one-sided rumors and innuendo that they would be offered the job in Tuscaloosa .
Alabama representatives actually contacted Saban's agent, Jimmy Sexton, to gauge interest. The response, according to Saban, was that they were flattered but not interested.

Since that time, the fickle media have steadfastly refused to believe Saban's subsequent denials. Even their most recent, and most explicit, denial did little to keep the frothing dogs off of him.
"I'm not going to be the Alabama coach”, said Saban on December 21.
Last Wednesday, during a press conference with the Indianapolis media, they apparently reached the end of their rope.
''I'm going to put (the rumors) away right now. I'm just making a rule that I'm never going to comment on something like that again because every time you comment, it makes another story. So I'm done.”
“Five years from now, I won't comment on it. Next week, I won't comment on it. I'm done.''
Until Shula's successor is named, Saban is of course not done. The media's general skepticism, though understandable, is the reason why because coaches have a general tendency to lie.
All coaches lie for various reasons. Sifting truth from fiction is where hard investigative reporting is needed. As such, Saban has been unwillingly carried away by the rush to learn the real truth.
Here's the sad part: the media will bother them about it again, this until the Tide names someone else to the job.
It's sad because those who are familiar with Nick Saban's reputation as a leader know that they are not a quitter nor untrustworthy, a common theme across every head coaching job they have ever had.
Yes, they stretch the truth about the health of a player from time to time. This they do in the competitive best interest of the team. But such fibs are not at the level of jeopardizing one's personal integrity.
So when Saban tells team owner Wayne Huizenga, a man they respect immensely, that he's not going anywhere, we can take it to the bank.
There's also common sense thinking that would be useful in this discourse.
Why on earth would Saban care to return to college after leaving a good situation at Louisiana State ? Wasn't the idea to take on a new challenge, winning a Super Bowl championship?
It takes a lifetime to build a good reputation and one minute to ruin it. Saban would be forever stained as nothing but a liar and a quitter by leaving the Dolphins now. Their book, “How Good Do You Want to Be?” wouldn't be worth the paper it's printed on.
Besides, it really isn't Alabama that poses a threat to Saban's tenure in Miami . It's the sorry state of the Dolphin offense.
Simply put, they must find a way to fix the offense before it flat out ruins them as an NFL head coach. Continuing to stick with the same coaches and players will result in more losing, guaranteed.
It won't be an easy job. The Dolphins need a new offensive coordinator, a new quarterback, and better receivers. The offensive line could also use an upgrade, especially on the left side.
Don't think for a second that Saban doesn't understand all of this.
Said Saban: “(Quarterback play) hasn't been consistent and we need to improve in that area. That means two things. We improve the guy that we have, first of all. We have to make some kind of evaluation if we think they're capable of doing it. We have a lot of confidence in the guys that we have because they have done a good job at times. We just haven't been consistent enough with it. Everyone has to be responsible for that relative to the whole offensive football team and what everybody needs to do to help the quarterback play well. That's a position where you need support and you need to have good people around you. You have the ball every time. I think we don't want to put it on one guy, one position or one thing, we just need to get better especially in the passing game and making explosive plays all the way around.”
Perhaps the single biggest decision Saban will make, near term, involves the future of Daunte Culpepper in Miami .
Best case scenario is that Culpepper returns to health and their Pro Bowl caliber form.
Worst case is what we saw over the first four games of the season.
With QB aficionado Randy Mueller advising Saban, a new face (or two) is likely on the way.
For example, knowing that Saban prefers to pick players they are familiar with, it would be a good bet that LSU's JaMarcus Russell will be high on the Dolphin draft board come April 28 (should they declare for the draft).
If Cleo Lemon continues to play well, we can expect the Dolphins to tender them as a restricted free agent. Joey Harrington's future as a Dolphin is not as clear; retaining them will have negative salary cap implications.
This is just a small sample of Miami Dolphins things that Saban will be worrying about in 2007.
After all, we have their word on it.
Dave Prowse the man behind the mask of one of the greatest villains of all time has been banned from all LucasFilm associated Star Wars conventions. They made the announcement on their official website saying,
It is with regret that I have been informed by my friends at C2 Ventures, Ben and Phillip, that I am not to be invited to C5 this year or any other Lucas Film associated events. After enquiring, the only thing I have been told is that I have "burnt too many bridges between Lucas Film and myself" - no other reason given. I have also been advised by the promoter of Paris Manga in September that LFL have requested no photo opportunities with the 501 Squadron, even though I am commander in chief of the 501. Sincere apologies to all my fans who were hoping to meet with me - I shall miss you too. As you will see from my events page I will be at many conventions all over the world so we can still keep in touch.
The only thing I can think of that got them banned was that last year they claimed that LucasFilm had yet to pay them any residual payments on Return of the Jedi because according to LucasFilm the movie had yet to make a profit. In a previous interview around the time they announced they had prostate cancer they said the following,
I get these occasional letters from Lucasfilm saying that we regret to inform you that as Return of the Jedi has never gone into profit, we've got nothing to send you. Now here we're talking about one of the biggest releases of all time. I don't want to look like I'm bitching about it, but on the other hand, if there's a pot of gold somewhere that I ought to be having a share of, I would like to see it.
LucasFilms response to this was,
There is a big difference between having a share of the gross profit and having a share of the net profit. It is a huge difference in just one word. Sometimes, with net profit, with all the expenses and so on, it seems like you end up paying them.
This may or may not be the reason he's been banned, but apparently he's burned their bridges. They will be at other conventions that aren't involved with LucasFilm though.
Kinda sucks that he's been banned, but I guess they have their reasons. What do you think?
Yesterday I gave you an expert's skeptical take on whether they inadvertently waived their Fifth Amendment right. Today, via Newsmax, here's another expert with the inevitable “au contraire” — and he's not hedging their bets either. Watch the clip and you'll find them treating this as an easy lay-up for Issa in court; they actually use the term “open-and-shut case” and accuses their lawyer of malpractice for letting them give a statement. Are they right? At the Volokh Conspiracy, Orin Kerr says it's hard to tell because there simply isn't much precedent. The case may turn on the specifics of the statement itself: Remember, they went so far as to say she'd done nothing wrong. Is that an assertion of fact, in which case they should be made to answer questions challenging that assertion? Or is it something more like a plea in response to a charge?
The tricky part is how to characterize Lerner's testimony before they invoked the Fifth Amendment. On one hand, if you say that Lerner merely expressed their view that they are innocent but did not actually testify as to any facts, then you could say they did not waive their rights with their statement. Questioning would not be about the details of facts they already testified to, but rather would require their testimony on a subject they declined to testify about. On the other hand, if you say that Lerner's reciting the allegations and then denying them effectively testified about the allegations, then you could say that they did testify and did waive their rights. From that perspective, they already testified about “the subject” by saying that they did not violate any IRS rules or submit false testimony, and further questioning would be about the details of why they think that. I'm not enough of a Fifth Amendment nerd to have strong views on which side is right. So I posed the question earlier today (based on press reports of what Lerner said, not the full transcript) to a listserv of criminal procedure professors that includes some serious Fifth Amendment experts. Opinions were somewhat mixed, but I think it's fair to say that the bulk of responders thought that Lerner had not actually testified because they gave no statements about the facts of what happened. If that view is right, Lerner successfully invoked their Fifth Amendment rights and cannot be called again. But this was not a unanimous view, it was not based on the full transcript, and there are no cases that seem to be directly on point. So it's at least a somewhat open question.
That's one theory, that the privilege was waived because of the particulars of what Lerner said. The other theory, expressed yesterday by law prof James Duane, is that the setting matters more than the content of what they said. Simply put, Congress isn't a courtroom. Lerner's not a criminal defendant. She's a witness in an investigation, and a witness can be selective in deciding which questions they want to answer. The downside for them in asserting the privilege is that, while juries aren't permitted to draw a negative inference from the defendant's decision to remain silent, there's nothing barring the public from drawing whatever inferences they want. That's the point of bringing them back for another round of questioning. Even if Issa lets them slide by not holding them in contempt if they re-asserts the privilege (contempt would send the matter to court), forcing them to invoke it serially in response to dozens of questions will look shady as hell. Them choice.
If you can spare the time, watch the full vid for Dershowitz's thoughts on Obama's double standard regarding leaks that hurt the administration versus leaks that make them look good, like the big “kill list” revelation in the Times last year that showcased President Badass bringing down the hammer on suspected jihadis five months out from the election. There is indeed one law for their friends at the NYT and one law for Fox News.
Transporting stuff cross-country is a tiring and lonely task, but bolting a 32cm-wide flat screen on your semi-trailer's dashboard, hooking up a DVD player, then allegedly driving erratically on the Hume Highway is probably not the best way to go about it...
The pic above is of the actual setup. Source: Police Media Unit. Alex in the comments is right, it does look wider than the 32cm police reported.
Goulburn Highway Patrol stopped the West Australian truckee on Thursday morning and issued a number of offences, including driving without a clear view and driving while using a handheld mobile phone. In a statement, police reiterated that the ”position and size of the screen meant a significant section of the windscreen was obscured, making driving extremely dangerous.” [NSW Police]
When they prepare the In Memoriam reel for the next Emmy Awards, let's hope the academy sets aside some space for NBC's Thursday comedy block, God rest its soul.
It was born in 1981, when the network aired the first in a set of comedy lineups that would include Cheers, The Cosby Show, Seinfeld, Friends, The Office, and many more legends. It died of old age and neglect on Jan. 22, 2015, with the little-noticed expirations of Bad Judge and A to Z. (Parks and Recreation outlived its cohort slightly, exiled to Tuesday.) It is survived by the night's current occupants, espionage dramas Allegiance and The Blacklist, and The Slap, the upscale-parenting-drama miniseries that is a comedy only unintentionally.
NBC that euthanized its trademark block, but it is not solely guilty. The Must-See-TV brand indicted a kind of sitcom that at its best was both sophisticated and popular. But as cable grew and the outlets for comedy multiplied, individual audiences shrank. The finale of the urbane, witty Cheers drew over 80 million viewers, the finale of the urbane, witty 30 Rock, not quite 5 million.
CBS still succeeds with retro comedies (The Odd Couple), ABC with family sitcoms (black-ish), Fox with youthcoms (New Girl) and animated shows (Bob's Burgers). But the kind of challenging, idiosyncratic comedy NBC was known for has other outlets now: HBO's Veep and Silicon Valley, say, can be filthily hilarious without the slightest nod toward keeping their characters relatable.
Adult Swim, Comedy Central, FX and FXX–all these homes for comedy have sliced-and-diced the audience into ever-more specific niches, which has been great for comedy but not so great for a network like NBC, which requires millions of weekly viewers to keep a show afloat. Today, NBC doesn't seem sure what its comedy identity is, but it's ceding “quirky” to others.
Netflix, for instance. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (season one premieres March 6) might have aired on NBC's Thursday in another era–like last spring, when the network first picked up the comedy, about an escapee from an doomsday cult making a new life in New York City. (Between this and Last Man on Earth, the apocalypse has emerged as 2015's hottest comedy trend.)
It had a Must-See Thursday pedigree, with 30 Rock‘s Tina Fey and Robert Carlock as co-creators. It had a Must-See Thursday star, Ellie Kemper of The Office. But by the time 2015 rolled around, there was no Must-See Thursday to schedule it on. So NBC, whose parent company produces Kimmy, made an unusual decision: it essentially pre-cancelled the show and sold it to the streaming service.
The deal was a sad statement about the potential for comedy at the new NBC. (Earlier last year, the network canceled the inventive Community, which will stream its sixth season on Yahoo starting March 17.) But it was probably the best thing possible for Kimmy, which is delightful but strange even by the standards of 30 Rock, and could have easily, quickly died on network TV. Netflix commited to two full seasons of the show before the first even aired.
The pilot opens in an underground bunker, where Kimmy (Kemper) is decorating a Christmas tree. She's celebrated the holiday with the same three women since the '90s, when they were 14 and kidnapped by an Indiana cult leader who claimed to be saving them from a nuclear apocalypse. After a SWAT team raids the bunker, the “Mole Women” are whisked to Manhattan for a Today show interview (a relic of cross-promo-obsessed NBC), after which Kimmy finds themselves on the street, trying to figure out what to do with their life. They stumble across a roommate share with broke actor Titus (30 Rock‘s Tituss Burgess) and eccentric landlady Lilian (sitcom legend Carol Kane). Alien in every way, still 14 at heart, Kimmy sets out to explore the terrae incognitae of the big city, the 2010s, and adulthood.
Kemper and Kimmy make one of TV's most natural matches of actor and character since someone decided to make Lou Ferrigno the Hulk. She's a terrific physical comic, able to combine naivete with a sense of cunning, and she's contagiously joyous–it's as if Lucille Ball had a baby with a rainbow. Kimmy knows almost nothing about today's world, which means they don't know enough to be jaded about it. When they spy a costume in the corner of Titus' apartment–his day job is handing out arcade flyers wearing a copyright-violating Iron Man costume–she squeals with amazement: “Is that a real robot? Do people have robots now?” We may be watching a sitcom, but she's living a sci-fi story.
Fey doesn't appear in the series, but Kimmy occupies a lower-rent corner of the same cartoon-NYC universe as their last NBC show. The show's zaniness, broad characters and rapid-fire jokes are pure 30 Rock, as is It's overall aesthetic. (It even has similar jaunty incidental music, composed by Fey's husband Jeff Richmond, who also wrote 30 Rock‘s.) When Kimmy finds a job as an under-the-table nanny, their vacuous one-percenter boss, Jacqueline Vorhees, is played by Jane Krakowski, who for all intents and purposes is doing Jenna Maroney 2.0 right down to the plastic-surgery connoisseurship. (“Feet are the new butts, Kimmy!”)
Kimmy's a sunnier presence than Liz Lemon, but Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt also has a darker core. Kimmy's bunker experience is played for laughs (she “made a pet cat out of dryer lint”) but it was also abuse by a misogynistic cult leader who convinced the women their “dumbness” brought on the world's end–all but Kimmy, who couldn't be broken. The show's feminism is even more pronounced than 30 Rock‘s; even Mrs. Vorhees has become who they are out of low self-esteem and desperation to hang on to their always absent, philandering husband.
On its own, the show's concept might have just been a throwaway 30 Rock subplot; what sustains it is how it applies the concept of unbreakability beyond Kimmy. Each character is a survivor, including Titus, who comes across sashaying and stereotypical at first, but is also grappling with growing older as a struggling actor and a single gay man in New York. (“Am I a bear now?” they wonders after failing to seduce a younger man. “Or a daddy? Or a Huxtable?”)
Like Fey's other work, Kimmy is intersectional; it's connecting and contrasting the experience of outsiders, black and white, straight woman and gay man, sister-wife and trophy wife. And like 30 Rock, it draws comedy from the myriad ways an expensive, competitive city like New York beats people down. Think of the scene in 30 Rock‘s “Cleveland,” in which Liz, imagining growing old in Manhattan, watches a handsome elderly woman who strides down the street declaring, “There is nothing like New York in the spring!”–then gets pushed into a pile of garbage.
Kimmy is shot from a more distinctly garbage-eye point of view, yet it's more optimistic. Whether she's trying to connect with the spoiled Vorhees kids or to earn a GED in a school that has “a cardboard cutout of Michael Jordan teaching gym,” Kimmy is undaunted: if they can do 15 years in a bunker, she's got this.
It will be interesting to see how Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt will do on Netflix, which has focused mostly on binge-friendly serial dramas. It doesn't quite have a model yet for comedy, which may lend itself more to grazing than bingeing.
If Kimmy had been too odd for NBC, it's oddly conventional for Netflix. When the streaming service revived Arrested Development, it was as a complex, non-linear narrative. Kimmy is structured like a typical network sitcom–more or less 22 minutes an episode, no swearing–with one notable difference. After the pilot, the end of most episodes introduces the plot of the following episode, the better to get viewers to click “Play Next.” (This, curiously, even though NBC produced the first season before ditching the show.)
For the six installments sent for review, anyway, it worked on me. In the end, I can't blame NBC for not taking a chance on a show it probably did not have a place for. But I'm glad that Kimmy the show, like Kimmy the character, found itself in 2015, where Netflix could pull an odd misfit out of the bunker of network-TV limbo and bring it, blinking, into the light of day.

PoliZette Conservative Leaders Call for Mitch McConnell to Step Down Brent Bozell and other long-term activists on the Right say Republican leaders in the Senate should resign
It just keeps getting worse for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
A group of top conservative activists have asked the Senate's five top Republican leaders to step down from their leadership posts. The pent-up frustrations boiled over on Wednesday, leading the conservatives to ask for a leadership house cleaning.

[lz_ndn video=33102839]
The request is sure to further inflame tensions between the Republican base and GOP senators, who famously failed to deliver on the repeal of Obamacare in July and September after seven years of promises.
The activists calling for a leadership change included Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center; Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots; Ken Cuccinelli, the president of the Senate Conservatives Fund; David Bozell, president of the ForAmerica political action committee; Adam Brandon, president of FreedomWorks; and Richard A. Viguerie, the longtime conservative activist and direct-mail wizard.
The activists called for Sen. McConnell (R-Ky.) to step down as majority leader; Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) to step down as majority whip; and for Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), and Sen. John Barrasso (R-Mont.) to step down as McConnell's GOP leadership team members.
“2017 has been a disappointing year for the millions of Americans who fully expected, and had every right to expect real change in Washington,” the leaders said in a statement. “Republicans were given full control of the federal government. They — you — have done nothing. Worse, it is painfully clear that you intend to do nothing because, as is most apparent, you had no intention of honoring your solemn commitments to the American people. You were not going to ‘drain the swamp.' You are the swamp.”
The leaders said the Senate has been less efficient than the House of Representatives at passing as much of the conservative agenda as possible in the first year of President Donald Trump's first term. They repeated complaints, frequently made by House members, that the Senate is sitting on 200 bills, all while keeping a lazy schedule.
“The American people work eight to 10 to 12 hours daily,” the leaders wrote. “How hard do their elected representatives work? On this, the 282nd day of 2017, you all have barely worked more than 100 days! And many of those ‘days' count coming in for a vote or two at 5:30 p.m. Many Americans celebrated ‘Columbus Day.' What would they think if they knew — if you told them — you have arranged it so you and your colleagues celebrate ‘Columbus Week?'”

The remarkable request from the Bozells, Martin and others comes as relations between the Senate and the rest of the Republican base, including the White House, decay. And it comes just days after Trump lashed out at Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) on Twitter. Corker has made noise of late about not supporting tax reform unless it cuts the deficit. Corker has also criticized the president's management style.
The press conference also comes as Steve Bannon, the executive chairperson of Breitbart, prepares to wage war on a number of Republican incumbents in the 2018 midterm elections. Bannon has claimed, since leaving the White House, that McConnell is the largest Capitol Hill impediment to Trump's agenda.
The press conference also comes after Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff spoke to the Republican National Committee on October 3. In that speech, Nick Ayers even mentioned the idea of a “purge” if lawmakers do not get behind the Trump agenda.
Ayers said if the Senate does not act faster, the Republican Party will lose many seats in the 2018 midterm elections.

Donald Trump promised Tuesday that if they are elected president, they would immediately call Congress into special session to repeal Obamacare.
In a speech heaping criticism upon President Obama's healthcare law, the Republican presidential nominee vowed that they would work to ditch the measure as one of their first actions as president.
"I will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace it," Trump told a crowd in King of Prussia, Pa. "And it will be such an honor for me, for you and for everyone in this country.
"We will do it and we will do it quickly," Trump added. "It is a catastrophe."
Enrollment in the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces began Tuesday for the fourth year. Trump and Republicans have been hitting hard against the healthcare law in the past week, since the Obama administration released the 2017 marketplace offerings, which show higher prices and fewer choices for consumers.
A Malaysian couple was charged Thursday with posting online a Ramadan greeting that allegedly mocked Islam and its holy month of fasting.
The picture on the social networking website Facebook showed Alvin Tan Jye Yee, 25, and their partner Vivian Lee May Ling, 24, eating what appeared to be pork rib soup, with the caption "fragrant, delicious and appetising", in Malay.
But the photo also carried the round logo used to indicate products that are halal, or permitted to Muslims, in Malaysia.
The two were charged with committing acts likely to cause feelings of enmity on grounds of religion.
Pork is forbidden to Muslims. The couple has since apologised for the posting, saying it was meant to be a joke.
About 61% of Malaysia's 29 million people profess to the Islamic faith, while 20% are Buddhist, 9% Christian, and around 6% Hindu.
Pjanic commits to Roma
By Football Italia staff
Miralem Pjanic is wanted by Tottenham, Manchester City and Manchester United, but insisted “I want to stay at Roma.”
The 23-year-old midfielder is hot property on the transfer market and one of the key figures in the Giallorossi's status at the top of Serie A.
“I won't exclude the possibility of one day playing elsewhere, but I doubt this will happen soon,” said the Bosnian international.
“It certainly won't be in January, which is what some people have said, and certainly not in the next year and a half either.”
La Gazzetta dello Sport claims Roma are drawing up a new contract for Pjanic that will be worth €3m per season for another four years.
Their current deal expires in June 2015.
The phone rings off the hook.
One Mayland �Pete� Peterson answers yet another call, as he�s been doing for almost 46 years.
�Red Rooster Barber Shop,� Peterson says. There�s a pause, and then: �You better get your butt in here, the shop has been sold.�
And so it went on Friday at the longtime barbershop on the University of Oregon campus, where Peterson, 73, has remained a fixture since first cutting hair there in the spring of 1970.
Sometimes, though, things happen fast in this world. Nothing, not even your favorite barber, lasts forever.
�I�ve been looking forward to retiring, I just didn�t realize that things would happen as quick as they have,� said Peterson, who bought the Red Rooster near the corner of 13th Avenue and Kincaid Street in 1972 or 1973 � it�s been too long to remember.
They bought the small shop from Nathan Shields, another longtime Eugene barber. And on Monday, they sold it back to him, more than four decades later.
Peterson had hoped to stay on part time, though, at the shop that Shields said will remain under the same name.
�I told them I�d like to work two, three days a week to supplement my Social Security income, and they just shook their head �No,�?� Peterson said.
�He said, �I�d like you out of here right away,� and I said, �Well, when?� And they said, �Today.�?�
Shields, 75, who said they sold the Red Rooster to Peterson back in the early �70s to help start Man�s World, a downtown Eugene barbershop still in existence under the Overpark on Oak Street, said Peterson called them Monday and offered to sell it back, something they discussed last year.
�He says, �When do you want me out of here? And I say, �Tomorrow.�??� Shields said. �I�m one of these people who doesn�t like to dilly-dally around.�
Shields� daughter, Karyn Shields, who also cuts hair at Man�s World, will take Peterson�s chair at the Red Rooster, Nathan Shields said.
Peterson has worked alongside partner Jim Lavender at the three-chair shop for the past 21 years. Lavender will remain, and several of Peterson�s customers said they�ll start seeing Lavender now for their haircuts.
�We�ve been together 21 years, and I don�t think we�ve said anything bad about each other,� Lavender said. �That�s pretty amazing, to be in the same small space and not kill each other,� they joked.
Peterson didn�t want to disclose what they bought the shop for in the early 1970s or what they sold it for six days ago, other than to say, of course, it was more than what they paid for it.
�Not a hell of a lot, but yes,� Peterson said.
And with that, many quickly had to say goodbye to a man who they�ve come to love like a father or an uncle or maybe an old Army buddy.
A final cut
During the decades, since graduating from Eugene Barber College, owned by their uncle, Charles �Pete� Peterson, in 1966, they have cut the hair of everyone from the legendary trackman Steve Prefontaine to current UO President Michael Schill (who snuck in a final appointment at 8 a.m. Friday).
Peterson, in fact, said they have cut the hair of every UO president going back to Robert Clark, who held the office from 1969 to 1975.
�He�s friendly,� said Jim Terborg, interim dean at the UO�s Lundquist College of Business, who stopped in on Friday, as many did, for what they hoped would not be a final chat. �He�s a character. He�s honest. He�s got a heart of gold. They know everybody.�
Terborg said Peterson has been cutting their hair for the last quarter-century. �I can�t remember the last time someone cut my hair other than Pete,� Terborg said.
The suddenness of their departure left Peterson and many of their clients in a weeklong state of forlorn.
�I want to say this is the first time I�ve ever cried in a barber chair,� said Nick Leonard, 30, also a recipient of one of Peterson�s final haircuts, early Friday afternoon, �but I probably did it as a little kid.�
Peterson has been cutting their hair since they were 2 or 3, Leonard said. Their father, retired Lane County Judge Kip Leonard, has also been a longtime customer, since the elder Leonard graduated from the University of Oregon in 1970.
�The first bad haircut I got was here, and the last bad one was yesterday,� Kip Leonard joked when they stopped in on Friday.
Laughter filled the shop.
Nick Leonard said they got a voicemail from Bob Newland, the former North Eugene, UO and New Orleans Saints football star, telling them Peterson�s haircutting days were numbered.
�I knew it was coming, but I thought they were going to be here awhile,� Nick Leonard said. �I just had to come in. I�ve probably had 400 haircuts in here. I can probably count on one hand the number of people I�ve had a longer-term relationship with than Pete.�
As they buzzed the hair of Leonard, a 2003 South Eugene High graduate who lives in Eugene again after going off to school at Cornell University and now works for a New York City-based luxury real estate auction company, Peterson cried, too.
�Nick has been a ... as I told their dad ... I can�t talk,� Peterson said, tears streaming down their face. �I said, �He�s been like a son or a grandson. I knew this haircut was going to be the toughest. I�ve cut their hair since they were a little kid.�
When is been over, the two shared a manly bear hug. Then Peterson gave Leonard a June 2015 Playboy magazine, and Leonard left a $100 bill on the counter.
Peterson charged $15 a cut in the end, not having raised the price in years. They charged $3 when they started in 1970.
Fixin� Pre�s hair
Peterson spent the past week dismantling what has become like a shrine to UO sports inside the shop.
Poster after poster of some of their more famous clients (Prefontaine, former UO and Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Fouts, trackman Galen Rupp, etc.).
�Guys were going to a stylist and that kind of stuff,� Gary Zimmerman, an early 1980s UO all-American football player who went on to a Hall of Fame career in the pros as an offensive lineman, told The Register-Guard in 2010, when Peterson held a 40th anniversary party. �And I always went to a barber, and I went to Pete. They cut hair on the side. The entertainment value�s worth more than the haircut. You go in there and get all the hot fishing stories and all the stuff like that.�
Peterson�s most prized possession? A page ripped from a 1975 day planner. Specifically, May 29, 1975. It was enclosed in a glass frame, next to a photo of Prefontaine with former UO track coach Bill Dellinger, before being boxed with everything else a few days ago.
Written in pencil in the 2 p.m. slot: �PRE,� with a line crossed through it.
It was a Thursday morning, Peterson recalled. �Pre came in. It was a case where he�d just walk in and sign their name in the book. They signed in (for a 2 p.m. haircut).
�And then awhile later, they came back and said, �I want to concentrate on the race.� And so they drew a line through their name. Anyhow, I said, �OK, I�ll see ya� tomorrow.� And they went back to doing whatever they did for the day.�
Prefontaine, a 1972 Olympian in the 5,000 meters and expected to be a top contender for the gold medal in Montreal in 1976, ran their final race at Hayward Field that evening.
At about 12:30 a.m. on May 30, 1975, they were killed at age 24 in a single-car crash near Eugene�s Hendricks Park.
Peterson tears up again when they recall hearing the next day of Pre�s death.
�My wife came in the bathroom. I was in the shower, and they told me that Pre had died. And here I�m gettin� really ... it was really hard.�
They recalled that it took some doing, but they were finally able to convince Pre they could help them run better with the right haircut, Peterson said. �I told him, first, get that hair out of your eyes. You don�t have to keep shakin� your head. Every time you shake your head, you lose a step, and the guy behind you gains a step.
�And I said, �I can cut your hair so it�ll come out of your eyes, and ... It. Will. Not. Slow. You. Down.�
Pre expressed concern Peterson would cut their hair too short.
�I says, �I�m not talkin� about cutting all your hair off. I�m talkin� about fixin� it so you can run faster. And I say, �You worry about how much your shoes weigh, but you don�t care about all the weight on your head!�?�
Like many of their clients over the years, the two became close friends, Peterson said.
�He was special, but again, he�s one of many special people who have come through these doors.�
Time to go
Peterson, an avid fisherman, will surely continue to do plenty of �hot fishing stories� in retirement. They and their wife, Shannon, who met at Scapoose High School, northwest of Portland, in the early 1960s and were married the year they graduated, 1963, will continue to live in Harrisburg, in the home they�ve owned since 1970. They have two children, Tami and Robert, and four grandchildren.
They hope to travel, especially to Washington, D.C., where Shannon has always wanted to visit.
�We�re getting up (in age), and she�s got places in the world she�d like to see,� Peterson said, explaining why they decided to sell now.
He�s hoping Congressman Peter DeFazio, the Springfield Democrat and a longtime customer, or maybe Sen. Ron Wyden, whose hair they cut when they were in law school, will give them a tour of D.C.�s sites.
�I�m ready to give it up,� Peterson said. �I just didn�t think it would happen so fast.�

File this one under “things I should have made two years ago.”
I knew I wanted to make oatcakes for my last recipe of 2014, but I wasn't sure which one. I have plenty of ideas for oatcake recipes, but none of them could be made at my parents' house (missing some ingredients). Plus, I wanted banana. And peanut butter.
I actually had to go back and check my recipe list to make sure that I had never made this before. Seriously, how did I not make this earlier?
You can either put the jam directly in the oatcakes, as shown above, or you can just spread it between each layer. The second option is easier, but the first option is cooler. 😉
Happy 2015! Are you making a NY's resolution? I'm not. I'm already a perfectionist, so resolutions just stress me out. 🙂
Print Banana PB and J Oatcakes Prep Time: 15 minutes Cook Time: 10 minutes Yield: serves 1 What you'll need: For the oatcakes 1/3 cup milk of choice (I used Silk unsweetened organic soy milk)
1/4 tsp apple cider vinegar, or lemon juice
2/3 cup quick or rolled oats (I use Country Choice Organic)
1 very ripe banana
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 rounded tsp baking powder
pinch of salt
jelly/jam
For serving peanut butter or PB2
milk of choice How to make it: Combine milk and vinegar in a small bowl or cup and let sit for ten minutes. Prepare peanut butter sauce by whisking milk into peanut butter or PB2. Add a tsp of milk at a time until you've reached a saucy consistency. (Alternatively, you could just spread straight peanut butter on the pancakes.) Put all pancake ingredients (including milk-vinegar mixture) except the jelly/jam in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Add extra liquid if necessary (just a tsp or so at a time). It should have the consistency of paint. 🙂 Heat a griddle pan over medium low heat. When griddle pan is ready, spray with nonstick cooking spray (it only needs a little bit!), and use a large spoon or a small scoop to pour pancakes onto the griddle. I made small pancakes, so I used a large soup spoon, and it worked perfectly. Generally, don't go any bigger than 1/4 a cup. After pouring the oatcakes onto the griddle, add little clumps of jam to the uncooked top. You can try to be fancy and swirl it or make it pretty, but I found this pretty tricky, so don't set too high of expectations for yourself. 😉 (Alternatively, you can just spread the jam between each layer of pancakes after cooking them.) When bubbles have formed at the top of the pancake, flip over and cook for another minute. (The jam will sizzle when it hits the pan. That's okay.) Repeat until all the batter has been used! Stack the oatcakes and top with the peanut butter sauce. You can also top with sliced bananas or crushed peanuts. 3.1 http://www.theoatmealartist.com/banana-pb-and-j-oatcakes/
The Lumia Denim update has come and gone for many Windows Phone owners. Announced back at IFA in September 2014, the update continued to roll out to devices through early spring. One phone, however, missed the update, and it was the Lumia 830 for AT&T. It is ironic, if only because Denim was co-announced with the Lumia 830 at IFA yet it was the AT&T Lumia 1520 that managed to snag the update instead.
Fast forward to July 2015 and at this point it is a safe bet that the AT&T Lumia 830 will not see Lumia Denim. A reader of the site, Noah M., filed a complaint against AT&T with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to express their frustration.
AT&T finally responded, and although they could not answer why the Lumia 830 was skipped for Lumia Denim, they did note that it would not be getting the update. From their BBB response letter, AT&T said this:

Last year, Georgia blocked more than $98 million in state income tax fraud. This year, determined to root out more attempted fraud, Georgia and at least 20 other states are making taxpayers wait longer — sometimes a lot longer — for their refunds.
Colorado and Louisiana, for instance, warn of delays of up to 60 days after filing. In Virginia and West Virginia, the delays can last up to four weeks. Massachusetts says it can take taxpayers four to six weeks to get their refunds, North Carolina says six weeks, and New Mexico warns it could be 12 weeks. Wisconsin says it could take as long as three months. Hawaii is looking at as much as 16 weeks.
The delays, state officials say, give revenue departments time to double-check returns to ensure that they are authentic and not filed by fraudsters using stolen personal information. They also give states time to compare taxpayers' returns with employers' filings of wages paid. And there's a built-in hedge against fraud because thieves tend to file early, while legitimate taxpayers tend to file later.
“If a return looks questionable, we have somebody that takes a closer look,” said William Gaston, spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Revenue. “It does slow down the process. It's worth it because we are protecting taxpayer dollars.”
If you want to blame someone for your late state refund, start with Utah (even if you don't live there). Swamped by fraudulent returns a couple of years ago, the Utah Legislature became the first in the nation to legislatively mandate a delay in paying out refunds until a certain date — in its case March 1. If both employer and employee electronically file forms earlier, that date can be moved up. Many others have followed — either by setting specific dates or stating that they can hold refunds for a set time, in most cases 90 days.
The IRS also can shoulder some of the blame. This year it delayed federal income tax refunds for returns for taxpayers who claimed the earned income tax credit and the additional child tax credit, under a mandate from Congress to combat tax fraud. Those two categories are high targets for fraudsters because taxpayers get cash back, even if they don't owe taxes. And the federal delay contributes to state delays because most states link their income taxes to the federal return.
According to IRS figures through March 10, 6 percent fewer refunds had been paid out than at the same time last year, 56.2 million compared to 59.7 million. The amount paid out is down 5 percent from last year, $167.1 billion compared to $175.9 billion.
“Anybody [in a state revenue department] can process a return in 24 hours. You don't want to,” said Verenda Smith, executive director of the national Federation of Tax Administrators, an organization of state tax officials.
Smith would like to see refunds held for as long as four months to do all the verifications. But most states are more likely to wait about three months.
States like Georgia have anticipated taxpayer concern over sitting on refunds and have mounted information campaigns to alert taxpayers to the delays. And Georgia reminds taxpayers who call the state's “taxpayer advocate” office to inquire about the status of their refunds that they can expect delays.
“Due to fraud prevention,” the office's automated voice message says, “the department is taking additional precautions. Your refund may take 90 days to process. We appreciate your patience.”
Gaston said most Georgians appear tolerant of the delay. But Liz Coyle, executive director of the consumer group Georgia Watch, said the delays can cost low-income taxpayers if they take advances from tax preparation companies in anticipation of their expected refund.
Although “refund loans” with high interest rates were outlawed in the U.S. in 2012, unscrupulous lenders may still make them, they said. And legitimate tax preparation firms still give advances in anticipation of the refunds. They are not allowed to charge interest, but they can add “fees” to the preparation itself which may reduce the amount of the refund.
In addition, they said, a delayed refund means many people have to put off purchases.
“For many Georgians, that tax refund is one of the most significant financial events they have all year and they do wait for it,” Coyle said.
Fraud Prevention Tactics
States have taken a number of extra steps to try to thwart fraud, as the amount of refunds they paid out on bogus returns mounted into the billions of dollars in recent years. And more steps are being taken all the time.
Some states such as New York and Ohio now require taxpayers to submit their driver's license information with their returns. The information is not required on federal returns, but preparers are told by the IRS to confirm the identity of the filers for whom they prepare returns.
Timothy Gagnon, an associate professor of accounting at Northeastern University, questions the effectiveness of states asking for driver's license information.
“They don't think someone who got your Social Security [number] and name and address won't have that?” they said sarcastically. “And I don't like them collecting more information that they don't need to have in their files.”
In contrast, Gagnon said, delaying refunds is a good fraud-prevention tactic, although delays burden some taxpayers, usually lower-income filers, more than others.
“If you are a taxpayer who applies your refund to next year's [taxes] it has no effect,” Gagnon said. “But if you over-withhold and are waiting for the refund, you may file in February and have to wait until May.”
Utah revenue officials have little doubt that delaying refunds helps prevent fraud.
In 2014, the state detected and halted the payout of $5.6 million worth of fraudulent returns, according to Charlie Roberts, spokesperson for the Utah State Tax Commission.
In 2016, after the Legislature mandated holding the refunds until March 1, the amount saved rose to $12.9 million.
Other states have adopted the delaying tactic to screen for fraudulent filings. Hawaii, for instance, is warning state taxpayers that it can take up to 16 weeks for refunds to start flowing.
Before it stopped $11 million in attempted fraud last year, said Mallory Fujitani, spokesperson for the Hawaii Department of Taxation, the standard wait for refunds had been about six or eight weeks “at the height of tax season.”
Fujitani said complaints from taxpayers and state employees have diminished since there has been a concerted effort to explain the reasons behind the delays and everyone has gotten more comfortable with the longer lead times.
But there ultimately may be a limit to how long taxpayers accustomed to filing their returns in January or February will put up with states sitting on their refunds, warns Smith of the tax administrators group.
“I'm enough of a realist to know that nobody's going to start holding refunds until the middle of May,” they said. “But that's the direction it's been moving in.”
High-level federal executives routinely use personal email for business, in likely violation of the Federal Records Act. That's according to a recent survey of federal employees.
The survey was conducted by the research group Government Business Council just prior to revelations that Hillary Clinton allegedly exclusively used personal email and a private server at their Chappaqua, N.Y., residence for their government communications while serving as President Obama's secretary of state.
Personal email is “always” or “often” used for government business in their agency, according to 16 percent of survey respondents. One-third, 33 percent, said personal email is used “sometimes” or more frequently.
Thirty-one percent said personal emails used for business are not preserved for archiving. Forty-seven percent said they don't know whether or not the records are properly preserved.
Clinton: Not the First
The revelation about Clinton's use of personal email is the latest, but not the first.
In fact, Clinton themselves was a vociferous critic of the George W. Bush administration's email practices after it was learned in 2007 that millions of White House emails sent on a non-government server may have been “lost.”
More recently, the State Department inspector general (IG) identified multiple instances of officials improperly using and failing to archive personal email from 2010 to 2014.
>>> 19 Times the Government Withheld Documents It Didn't Want You to See
For example, the IG said officials at the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand were not implementing procedures on records management and “email messages … are not preserved.”
IRS manager Lois Lerner allegedly used an msn.com email account labeled ‘Lois Home' for government-related communications. Lerner was a key player in what the IG found was the tax agency's unfair targeting of conservative groups.
Former Obama EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson used private email accounts, as well as a secret EPA email address under the pseudonym “Richard Windsor,” to conduct official business. That included communicating with a climate lobbyist.
“P.S. Can you use my home email rather than this one when you need to contact me directly? Tx, Lisa.” —EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson email to a lobbyist.
Jackson's use of personal email accounts was inadvertently revealed in Freedom of Information Act production. In an email chain between Jackson and a Sierra Club official, Jackson's personal Verizon email address was redacted citing a “privacy exemption.” But it was left unredacted later in the thread.
The EPA inspector general recently found the agency's Chemical Safety Board Chairman Rafael Moure-Eraso and two top officials used personal email accounts to conduct official business. The IG said the officials did not preserve the emails, in violation of federal regulations.
>>> Lawsuit Seeks EPA Administrator's Deleted Messages
Attorney General Eric Holder's criminal division head, Lanny Breuer, was caught forwarding controversial Fast and Furious-related emails to their personal account.
Obama Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, Holder's former assistant attorney general for civil rights, allegedly used their private email account to leak non-public information about official business.
As to whether Holder themselves ever used personal email for government business, the Justice Department isn't saying. A spokesperson did not respond to requests for information about Holder's email practices.
In Justice Department emails turned over in federal Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, Holder's email name is redacted with no explanation. It's unknown whether the redactions conceal use of an email address that does not belong to an official government account.
Fast and Furious-related emails between Holder and their wife Sharon Malone, and their mother, are currently being withheld under executive privilege invoked by President Obama.
There are similar redactions of the email name for Obama adviser Eric Schultz. In one instance, “privacy” is cited as the reason. In other cases, no explanation is given.
Security Questions
Experts say it's not only a question of whether federal officials are trying to skirt Freedom of Information law that requires release of public documents upon request; there are also security concerns. From that standpoint, Clinton's example may be the most concerning.
Government Executive says security experts are “still scratching their heads about why Clinton would have taken the unusual step of setting up a home-managed email account, a move that potentially made their messages vulnerable to foreign hackers keen on spying on the U.S.'s top diplomat.”
“Computer-security analysts … warned that emails sent across separate servers—instead of delivered entirely within government servers—posed greater risk of being intercepted or spied on.” —@GovExec
A high-ranking government official familiar with the potential security risks says Clinton's case raises many security issues.
“There are times when the location of the secretary of state and other cabinet members is sensitive” or even classified, said the official, “especially, if they are traveling with [the president].”
A smartphone using a commercial Internet service provider would theoretically broadcast its location most of the time, over an unauthorized network, including when that location classified, the official said.
The official also noted that it's not known whether Clinton carried their phone into areas where classified discussions took place. “If they did, that [could be] a security violation.”
>>> Commentary: How to Free the Government's Grip on Freedom of Information
The State Department has said Clinton did not send classified information via email. A Clinton spokesperson has said they have been complying with the “letter and spirit of the [federal records] rules.”
Clinton sent a tweet last week shortly after the House Benghazi Committee subpoenaed them emails.
I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible. — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 5, 2015
“There's no doubt that there will not be a way to fully validate the completeness of that production,” Jason Straight told Government Executive. Straight is chief privacy officer and senior vice president of cybersecurity at UnitedLex.
In the first chapter of their confession of faith, on Holy Scripture, the Westminster Divines say (among other things):
VI. The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for Their own glory, man's salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of men. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word: and that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government of the Church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be ordered by the light of nature, and Christian prudence, according to the general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed. VII. All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all: yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed, and observed for salvation are so clearly propounded, and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them. X. The supreme judge by which all controversies of religion are to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers, doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined, and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture.
What's weird is that Augustine basically says this. No, I'm serious, though. At the end of Book 2 of On Merit and the Forgiveness of Sins, and the Baptism of Infants, they write:
The question also arises, how God (even if They do not create souls by natural propagation) can yet not be the Author of that very guilt, on account of which redemption by the sacrament is necessary to the infant's soul. The subject is a wide and important one, and requires another treatise. The discussion, however, so far as I can judge, ought to be conducted with temper and moderation, so as to deserve the praise of cautious inquiry, rather than the censure of headstrong assertion. For whenever a question arises on an unusually obscure subject, on which no assistance can be rendered by clear and certain proofs of the Holy Scriptures, the presumption of man ought to restrain itself; nor should it attempt anything definite by leaning to either side. But if I must indeed be ignorant concerning any points of this sort, as to how they can be explained and proved, this much I should still believe, that from this very circumstance the Holy Scriptures would possess a most clear authority, whenever a point arose which no man could be ignorant of, without imperilling the salvation which has been promised him. (2.59)
Notice what they say here. When there is a doctrinal question that cannot be answered with “clear and certain proofs” from Scripture, we must not be dogmatic about it. In other words, assent cannot be required to any such answer that is proffered. To do so would be “presumption.” Such cases are cases for “restraint” (for that reason, Augustine would not insist dogmatically on, e.g., purgatory; of course, they could have insisted dogmatically against it, but we'll take what we can get). Man's presumption should not “attempt anything definite”–i.e., it should not define any dogmas in such cases. Pious speculation? Yeah, ok, sure, Augustine was pretty chill with a lot of that. But the logic of this passage rules out dogmatic definition from such speculations.
Notice, too, that such questions will never strike at the heart of faith. On any doctrinal point on which the salvation of man would be “imperiled” due to ignorance of it, “the Holy Scriptures…possess a most clear authority.” This is what the Divines mean in WCF 1.6-7 above. They admit that some things are clearer, some less clear in Scripture–but whatever must be known an believed for salvation are clearly set out in its pages.
Contrast Augustine's position with some other possibilities. E.g.:
Furthermore, we declare, we proclaim, we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff.
(This follows the assertion–which is not just a pious suggestion–that “one sword ought to be subordinated to the other and temporal authority, subjected to spiritual power.”)
Or, say:
We teach and define that it is a divinely-revealed dogma: that the Roman Pontiff, when they speak ex Cathedra, that is, when in discharge of the office of Pastor and Teacher of all Christians, by virtue of their supreme Apostolic authority, they define a doctrine regarding faith or morals to be held by the Universal Church, by the divine assistance promised to them in blessed Peter, is possessed of that infallibility with which the divine Redeemer willed that Their Church should be endowed for defining doctrine regarding faith or morals: and that therefore such definitions of the Roman Pontiff are irreformable of themselves, and not from the consent of the Church.
Or maybe:
We declare, pronounce, and define that the doctrine which holds that the most Blessed Virgin Mary, in the first instance of their conception, by a singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Savior of the human race, was preserved free from all stain of original sin, is a doctrine revealed by God and therefore to be believed firmly and constantly by all the faithful. […] Hence, if anyone shall dare — which God forbid! — to think otherwise than as has been defined by us, let them know and understand that they are condemned by their own judgment; that they have suffered shipwreck in the faith; that they have separated from the unity of the Church; and that, furthermore, by their own action they incur the penalties established by law if they should dare to express in words or writing or by any other outward means the errors they think in their heart.
Mark that: refusing assent to something which all sides must agree is not clearly propounded in Scripture entails the loss of salvation. Let it sink in: the forgiveness of sins and salvation from everlasting torment in hell depends on believing that Mary was preserved from original sin.
Or this:
[B]y the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and by our own authority, we pronounce, declare, and define it to be a divinely revealed dogma: that the Immaculate Mother of God, the ever Virgin Mary, having completed the course of their earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory. 45. Hence if anyone, which God forbid, should dare willfully to deny or to call into doubt that which we have defined, let them know that they have fallen away completely from the divine and Catholic Faith.
Again, observe what this means. If one should express agnosticism about this point (let alone deny), which–again–all sides must agree is not clearly propounded in Scripture, they get straight on the highway to hell, AC/DC-style. Munificentissimus Deus proclaims that this doctrine is part of the “deposit of faith” and is “a truth that has been revealed by God”; but it immediately bifurcates revelation into “the written Word of God” and “Tradition,” which is not what Augustine says above.
To conclude: Yes, I am aware of other remarks of Augustine on Scripture and tradition. But the point here is to think through the logic of what they say in the passage quoted above and to show its harmony and adaptability to Reformational conceptions of Scripture and authority. In other words, they weren't making this stuff up. They were pulling on threads that were already there, drawing out trajectories that were implicit in what was said before, and recovering what might be called “suppressed traditions.” In this instance, the point is that one ought not to be threatened with damnation over things that have not clearly been revealed. In addition, the position sketched above preserves the truth that what one has needed to believe to be saved has always been the same–in AD 33, 1302, 1854, 1870, and 1950–and has always been publicly accessible in Scripture, as Augustine says.
It is no surprise, then, that this passage of Augustine appears in Calvin's preface to the Institutes of the Christian Religion, where, claiming a greater faithfulness to antiquity than their opponents, they write:
It was a Father who pronounced it rashness, in an obscure question, to decide in either way without clear and evident authority from Scripture. They forgot this landmark when they enacted so many constitutions, so many canons, and so many dogmatical decisions, without sanction from the word of God.
500 years after the Reformation, and nearly 2000 years after the Resurrection, we ought still to heed Solomon: “Remove not the ancient landmarks which thy fathers have set.”
The announcement last month that ConocoPhillips plans to break up into two separately traded companies took Wall Street by surprise, raising uncomfortable questions as to Big Oil's raison d'etre. If COP proves that it can indeed unlock value from separating its exploration and production unit from its refining and marketing units, then other companies, namely BP and ExxonMobil, could soon find themselves under pressure from their shareholders to follow suit, forever changing the energy landscape.
Up until now, it was widely accepted that being bigger was the key to being a better oil company. That view was taken to its logical extreme in the late 1990s when the “Super Major” oil company was born. In the United States, Conoco merged with Phillips, Chevron merged with Texaco and Exxon merged with Mobil. In Europe, BP snapped up U.S. oil companies Amoco and Arco while France's Total acquired Belgium's Petrofina and fellow French oil company Elf Aquitaine. Only Royal Dutch Shell avoided the merger mania.
The reason for the mergers was clear — oil prices had collapsed. In the late 1990s, oil traded down as low as $10 a barrel due to a myriad of events — some situational, like the Asian economic crisis of 1998, and some structural, like the decreasing link between oil consumption and economic growth in Western nations. In addition, the number of oil fields that were open to commercial development had diminished, while royalties from existing fields were on the wane as oil-producing countries demanded a larger piece of the revenue pie.
The mergers were seen as a success for most of the majors as they were able to rationalize their business models and streamline operations. Being bigger gave them more pricing power when dealing with oil service contractors and greater leverage when negotiating with foreign governments. But the benefits of being bigger seemed confined to separate business units: While a refining unit got more efficient through the merger, it wasn't because the company had a strong exploration and production unit, and vice versa.
That's because the exploration side and the refining side of the oil business have little to do with one another. Contrary to popular belief, Big Oil has almost no control over the price of oil these days. That power squarely rests with oil-rich nations that hold most of the world's oil reserves and the Wall Street banks and hedge funds that speculate and make markets in the oil trading game. So even though ExxonMobil pumps oil, it can't guarantee that its refining unit will be able to profitably process a barrel into gasoline or heating oil.
Pure-play revival
Investors who wanted exposure to the oil and gas sector noticed this disconnect. As they put more money in the smaller, pure-play companies that focused on one industry vertical, Big Oil began to trade at a discount. In fact, since the merger mania of 2000, Big Oil has traded at an average discount of between 11% and 12% compared to their smaller pure play competitors, according to a recent study by Citi Investment Research and Analysis.
That discount translates into billions of dollars in lost value in companies this big. Take the case of Marathon Oil. The small integrated oil and gas firm announced in January that it was splitting up into two companies – one that concentrated on exploration and production and one that concentrated on refining and marketing, similar to the COP split. The day before the announcement, Marathon had a market value of around $28.9 billion. Today, the two independent companies, Marathon Oil Corporation and Marathon Petroleum Corporation, have a combined market value that is 30% higher at $37.4 billion, which means the split potentially unlocked $8.5 billion in value.
If COP were to ultimately gain 30% in its split, it would add a whopping $33 billion in value, based on its market valuation on the day before the deal was announced. But unlike with Marathon, COP has seen its share price fall since its announcement — down around 3% on lackluster earnings.
Of course, Marathon and COP were trading at different places when they announced their decisions to split up, with Marathon (MRO) trading at around a 20% discount to other integrated oil companies, while COP was trading more or less on par with its peers. It seems like the market revalued Marathon to trade in line with its peers and then credited it an additional 10% in value to make up for the average discount between integrated oil companies and pure-play companies. If that logic holds and COP pops 10%, it could still stand to unlock $18 billion in value – not too shabby.
The remaining oil majors — ExxonMobil (XOM), Total, Chevron (CVX), Shell (RDSA) and BP (BP) — as well has the smaller integrated oil companies, like Hess, will undoubtedly be watching COP (COP) intently as it begins its dismemberment. Analysts have already started to fiddle with the numbers. Most have pointed at BP as being ripe for a break up. The oil major currently trades at a fraction of its net asset value, thanks mostly to the black eye it took from the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico last year. Deutsche Bank estimates that if BP were to spin off its refining and marketing unit, it could unlock $15 to $20 billion in value if it were to trade in line with its peers.
But the analysts at Deutsche Bank say it's “foolhardy” to believe that the company would make any major strategic split given the billions of dollars in potential losses it still faces in connection to last year's oil spill. It could take years for that mess to be sorted out, keeping BP together by force. Then again, BP is already taking steps to reduce its refining presence without a split by selling off some of its largest refineries to help pay for damages in connection with the spill.
BP is not alone in selling off its refineries. For example, Shell has cut 40% of its refining capacity in the last 12 years through asset sales. A split in Shell's case therefore might not yield the same value as it would for COP.
Furthermore, oil companies are conservative, so convincing them to make a radical split, even if it could potentially unlock billions of dollars in value, won't be easy. Take ExxonMobil. Just a 10% increase in value through a split would be worth $43 billion to shareholders, which is equivalent to the GDP of Tunisia. But ExxonMobil is known as the most conservative member of Big Oil, making any split hard to imagine.
“Although ExxonMobil would the ideal candidate since a split could unlock the most value, it is the least likely to do so, as management is convinced that the integrated model will serve it in the future as it has in the past,” says Fadel Gheit, the energy analyst at Oppenheimer.
But even ExxonMobil isn't immune to shareholder pressure. COP is slated to complete its split in the first quarter of next year, giving the company's shares some time to turn to the upside.
If the ConocoPhillips story is a success for shareholders, there will be calls to break up Big Oil just in time for the annual meetings in the spring. So by this time next year, it is possible that Big Oil will go the way of Rockefeller's once gargantuan Standard Oil — with the markets, not the government, forcing a break up this time.
Developer Summary:
SQUIDS follows a band of stretchy heroes who must protect their idyllic underwater kingdom from the destructive black ooze settling over the seas. Set in the western kingdom of Seawood, SQUIDS Wild West takes the group into deeper, more dangerous waters as they regroup against oily crustacean enemies and search for a fallen comrade. They'll help the feisty Calamary Jane save a besieged frontier town, explore native Squid lands and a volatile mine, and start to understand the evil they're up against — but not without paying a terrible personal price.
What We Think:
The creation of indie French developer The Game Bakers, SQUIDS Wild West is the sequel to the popular role-playing game SQUIDS, which has had over one million downloads worldwide.
It's a testament to something when I can tear my six-year-old nephew away from the latest Angry Birds DLC to show them a pre-release of a new title and they spend the rest of the afternoon with it, having forgotten all about pigs and Cardinals with monobrows.
Like Angry Birds, SQUIDS uses physics to propel and knock around objects and adversaries in its world albeit in a slightly different manner. Here you press and drag on your currently active Squid (of which there are four classes – a healer, a tank, a scout and a ranged shooter – each with their own special abilities) to extend their tentacles and propel them in any given direction you choose. Their range of motion is limited by a finite set of action points per turn, as displayed by the bubbles that surround them.
Active abilities for each comprise a Stomp area effect for the Tank, second travel burst for the scout (tap while in motion), an HP recovery effect for the healer (triggered by bumping into one of your other squids) and a long-distance shot (called “Eagle Eye”) by your ranged shooter.
You are not stuck with the character you begin with for each class, and in fact have various squids for each class type to choose from. The selection of alternate SQUIDS grows via unlockable characters you encounter and either defeat or with whom you complete quests throughout the story's progression. For the most part they have similar stats, but they vary in appearance and can be individually upgraded via leveling up and auxillary items that are unlocked, discovered or purchased for virtual or real currency.
That said, though the devs chose to allow purchase of power via real currency, this is not an imbalanced “pay to win” game. Though it teeters on the fine line that asks why you should pay money over the original purchase price to get an advantage, the game can be played without issue without spending more money; here your hard earned cash simply buys you time and effort. A further example of this is that you can spend either in-game earned currency (pearls) or real convertible currency to make a level easier. Again, while this is most often a taboo, here, it isn't a game breaker.
Difficulty does escalate, however, and at time rather quickly, but a combination of understanding your options, patience and some puzzle-solving proves sufficient in almost every case.
What really helps SQUIDS along, beyond the lovely (award-winning) artwork, is that the integrated storyline really does add a sense of scope and context. Supported by a terrifically recorded soundtrack, Wild West actually improves on the original by immersing you in a seaworld replete with saloons, showdowns and even rideable seahorse mounts that can alter the outcome of combat.
The Game Bakers have done a commendable job in adding an engaging story-driven physics-based action game to the iOS platform that can easily compete with the best that Angry Birds has on offer.
There are many iOS games attempting to dethrone the mighty Birds. A vast majority of them are either sub-par in their own right or simply too derivative to supplant it. In the case of SQUIDS however, this reviewer has unwittingly wiled away many sunny hours, lost in its undersea adventures. Is it mind-blowingly innovative? No, but it is as solid a new entry as can be found in this mixed genre.

I feel like I've been waiting to be impressed by Makoto Shinkai . That's not to say that their previous work has been bad. It's just been a bit aimless, repetitive, or overwhelmed by a tendency to wallow in their signature aesthetic. I've been following their career since I first saw 5 Centimeters Per Second in the mid-2000s, and for a long time, my opinion of them hadn't changed much. He's great at production design – particularly their trademark hyper-detailed backgrounds – and evoking a particularly wistful sense of melancholy. But while he'd been improving as a writer ( Garden of Words was a well-executed short story), it wasn't in any radical, attention-grabbing way—or so it seemed.
Midway through last year, I started hearing buzz for their latest feature, your name. It was blowing up the Japanese box office, and my friends lucky enough to access advance screenings kept coming back with glowing reviews. I sat through the chatter impatiently – the film wasn't out early in my area, and I could hardly jump on a plane to Japan just to see a single movie. I wanted to know why people – including longtime Shinkai skeptics like me – were being converted by this unexpected megahit.
Luckily, I got to see the film early for review purposes, just short of its April 7th release date stateside. Without spoiling anything for those still waiting, and after what's felt like ages of unending hype, I can now report that your name. lives up to all the brouhaha. This is the best anime blockbuster that I've seen in years – a gorgeous, tightly paced and scripted piece of artistry that manages to be about something more than Shinkai's usual hobby horses. That's not to say that their voice is absent – there's enough star-crossed love, lush scenery, and celestial imagery to make it clear that this is their project absolutely – it's just that he's finally managed to tie all this into themes that truly complement the cosmic scale of their sentimentality. your name. is a perfected version of the story that Shinkai has spent their entire career telling, an instant mainstream-ready classic in the vein of Summer Wars and The Girl Who Leapt Through Time , if those films had also contained some Ghibli-esque ruminations on how Japan's ancient traditions intersect with increasingly modernized life.
Now that I've gushed about the film like everyone else, it's time to get to the brass tacks of what its themes are trying to achieve. Over the course of my acquaintance with Shinkai's oeuvre, I've seen them obsess over certain story beats, in particular the idea of bonds that transcend time, space, and emotional state. Every single one of their films has been dominated by plaintive yearning for both a relationship and period of life that's been lost. your name. 's innovation on this front is that it turns this circumstance between two individuals into a metaphor for Japanese society as a whole, particularly the relationship between the present and the past, the city and the countryside. This is the type of thing that Ghibli is known for doing, but your name. accomplishes something similar without merely copying that studio's style (as Shinkai already tried with Children Who Chase Lost Voices ). As a work of magical realism that refuses to confine itself to either the urban or the provincial worlds, Taki and Mitsuha's journey involves both fateful meetings on the Tokyo subway and visits to the netherworld via remote mountain shrines. It's a neat synthesis of the two types of magical realism I've seen most from Japan – the urban strain popularized by Haruki Murakami as well as Hayao Miyazaki 's rural romanticism.
In the end, these parallel spaces come together to save the day in a situation that channels unresolved emotions surrounding recent events in Japan. If you were watching the news in 2011, you might remember the Fukushima disaster. It was the biggest nuclear incident since Chernobyl; three towns were evacuated in its aftermath, displacing hundreds of thousands of people. Many of these people still haven't returned home. The surrounding area still constitutes an exclusion zone and may not be declared habitable again for decades. It was a traumatic moment not only for those directly affected, but for the people of Japan as a whole. your name. makes conscious use of Fukushima imagery – the barricade, the newscast, the circle of absence – to stir these cultural memories, but then it proceeds to work through these feelings in the safe space of an optimistic mainstream film. I imagine that this was a contributing factor to your name. 's domestic success, alongside its general excellence. As Mad Max: Fury Road has proven, well-written and exhilarating original blockbusters are good, but if they also happen to cut through current cultural anxieties, that's even better.
NYAV Post (in cooperation with Anime Limited ) put out a great dub for this. The leads are very solid in their roles, although Stephanie Sheh (Mitsuha) takes a little longer to shine than Michael Sinterniklaas (Taki). It evens out in the first 20 minutes, however, and there were no performance hiccups for the rest of the film. The translation is largely excellent, excepting two particular difficulties. The first is that important connotations are lost in translating the particular Japanese word for “twilight” used throughout the film. The specific word happens to pun on a way of asking "who are you?", meaning that every time the leads say it, they're also asking for “ your name. ” This double meaning is hugely resonant throughout the film, but there's no easy way to capture that in English. The second is a scene where the humor hinges on different gendered versions of Japanese first-person pronouns. Since we don't have those in English, this is substituted by Mitsuha awkwardly referring to themselves in the third person. It's clumsy, but I also can't think of a better way to have resolved the issue, so I'll have to accept it as a necessary casualty. These are just nitpicks – overall, this English dub is an enjoyable and satisfactory way of experiencing this movie.
The film's three insert songs were also re-recorded in English for this dub . I found the results to be mixed. Singer Yōjirō Noda (who supplied the film's soundtrack alongside their band, RADWIMPS ) is a proficient English speaker, and their delivery sounds fine. The problem is in the song lyrics, which are as clunky as translated song lyrics tend to be without meticulous adaptation. They cram in more words than can fit per line, and I generally prefer how the Japanese versions flow. They're not terrible though, and it's cool that we even got these versions in the first place.
After all of this discussion of the film's themes and the director's career, if you have to take one thing from this review, let it be that your name. is an absolute blast. I haven't had this much fun with an anime film since Summer Wars . The body swap plot results in a ton of funny gags, mostly because it's blunt and straightforward about the kind of stuff that would go down in that situation. The character writing is strong, though not super unique. Taki and Mitsuha are distinct and likable enough to carry the story, and it's fun to see them connect through their game of corporeal telephone. It's also super well-paced, accomplishing more in its first half-hour than most films do in their entire runtimes. The chronologically scrambled plotting is both novel and effective, tying into the movie's metaphor for time as interwoven threads. And for all my talk of its cultural context, your name. is totally accessible to non-Japanese audiences. It ranks alongside Miyazaki and Mamoru Hosoda films as a great introduction for people unfamiliar with the medium.
You should never ask a teen to buy a Christmas present it seems, after US and German researchers found that they are terrible at predicting what their buddies want. The team taught a selection of adults and teenagers about another group's preferences for activities, fashion and food, and found that, when asked to rate the second group's preferences on new items or activities, the teens' responses were less accurate than the adults.
Media Release
The Journal of Neuroscience
How Teens Learn About Others
Despite their intense interest in other people, adolescents are slower to learn about the preferences of their peers than adults, according to results from a new approach to studying social development published in JNeurosci.
Understanding the mental states of others has been extensively studied in children, yet the development of this theory of mind in teenagers as they transition into the socially complex world of adults and the brain network supporting this ability is not well understood.
In this study, healthy adolescents and adults performed a task in which they learned about a peer's preferences for activities, fashion and food items from a previously conducted survey of individuals not involved in the study. Comparing 13 computational models to explain participants' behavior, Gabriela Rosenblau and colleagues found that both adolescents and adults use a combination of their own preferences and feedback about how their peer actually rated each item to predict their peer's preferences for future items. Adolescents, however, were less accurate in predicting their peer's preferences and had lower learning rates than adults. Ongoing development of the fusiform cortex and medial prefrontal cortex during adolescence may underlie these differences.
HOUSTON, TEXAS – Tuesday, scientists at NASA were shocked by images of a Cnidarian fossil beamed from Mars. The Curiosity rover, which has been surveying an ancient riverbed, unearthed a bright white fossil which NASA's exobiologists say appears similar to primordial coral reefs.
Coral reefs are formed by colonies of simple polymorphous invertebrates which lack organs. Angstrom H. Troubadour, spokesperson for the exobiology lab at Curiosity command, said, “This object could be anything from a piece of an ancient Martian coral reef to a previously undiscovered form of life.”
Other experts are critical of this announcement, calling it “premature,” but Mr. Troubadour maintains that this is sure evidence of life on Mars, adding “The object may not even be fossilized. If that's true, it's an incredible find because it would contain much more organic material to analyze. It may even give us a profound insight into why life on Mars died out.”
Science has long held the probability of of extraterrestrial life to be incredibly high. This probability is so high, in fact, that this discovery does not come as any surprise to the community. Some churches, however, have already denied that this discovery could be possible. Pastor Fred Falwell of Liberty Baptist Church says, “Satan has placed this fossil, like other fossils on Earth, in order to deceive humankind and deny the truth of the Bible. There is nothing in Genesis about God creating life on Mars, so it is surely a deception of Lucifer.”
Despite some skepticism, this discovery has fired the imaginations of people worldwide, and some have even taken to the streets rejoicing in the fact that we are not alone. Environmentalists have taken this as an opportunity to preach about the frailty of life, and UFO enthusiasts have also hailed this discovery as evidence for their long-held beliefs.

Perth bands The Faim (formerly known as Small Town Heroes) have been recording a bunch of new music over the course of 2017, and now it's been revealed that they've finished writing a new song with some surprise VIP guests.
They recorded a new track in LA recently, bringing on Mark Hoppus of Blink-182 and Twenty One Pilots‘ Josh Dun to help put it together.
“It was inspiring to work with such iconic musicians who we have looked up to for so long,” say the band in a statement.
“Both guys were super warm and we ended up writing a really powerful song that we can't wait for everyone to hear.”
The new track (which is yet to be released) isn't the first time The Faim have worked with big names, having smashed out some recording sessions with Blink-182's Travis Barker, as well as Fall Out Boy's Pete Wentz earlier in the year as well.
The band have also revealed recently they sat down for a writing session with Ashton Irwin of 5 Seconds Of Summer.
The Faim are posting regular Vlog updates to their Instagram as they continue to put together their first release under their new name.
A Galaxy S5 with a QHD (2560×1440) display – tentatively called Galaxy S5 Prime – seems to be getting closer and closer to becoming official, as after a recent appearance in Hong Kong, it has (temporarily) reared its face on a Korean website. An SM-G906K (the Korean variant of the phone) was spotted at the Olleh TV website as a device supported by the service but has since been taken, though not without leaving a hint that the SM-G906 – whatever this device may turn out to be named – could be in its final stages of development and be made official very soon.
The image accompanying the phone's listing was one we've already seen before, showing a Spigen back cover on the device. It isn't surprising that an existing image was used – Samsung has been pretty good with hiding its devices' actual design before launch, so we probably won't know whether the Galaxy S5 Prime really does sport a new design and/or a metallic construction before it goes official.

If, as the French counter-revolutionary Joseph de Maistre wrote in 1811, every nation gets the government it deserves, what might the United States have done to deserve Donald Trump?
A well-functioning democracy should undercut the appeal of blustering, xenophobic demagogues by ensuring that most citizens have a stake in government and hope for the future. And although no single cause or problem can explain Trump's appeal to a large part of the American electorate, their nomination as the Republican presidential candidate should be cause for serious reflection about what is going wrong in America. For many Americans, one thing that has gone wrong is that the promise of scientific and technological progress has not been fulfilled.
This promise is at the heart of the American identity: it is anchored by founding fathers Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, scientists and inventors both, extolled by Alexis de Tocqueville in their 1835 masterwork Demo­cracy in America, embodied in the inventions of Thomas Edison, and codified in its modern form in Science, The Endless Frontier, Vannevar Bush's famous 1945 science-policy report to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, which laid out the still-powerful argument for government sponsorship of basic science.
Indeed, Bush's linking of the frontier metaphor to the promise of scientific progress was a distinctively American flourish. And their formula was simple: three factors — “the free play of initiative of a vigorous people under democracy, the heri­tage of great natural wealth, and the advance of science and its application” — would deliver to all Americans full employment and rising standards of living, improved health, and military security. Government investment in science, especially research carried out at the nation's elite universities, would prime the pump of continual progress.
Not everyone, however, was buying Bush's story. Starting in the early 1940s, Senator Harley Kilgore, a Democrat from West Virginia, championed a different national approach to science policy, one in which government investment would focus research and development directly on social goals and economic growth. A six-year political battle between Kilgore and Bush followed, to control not just US science policy itself, but, equally importantly, the rhetoric of science and progress. Bush, who had much of the leadership of academic and industrial science on their side, and who saw Kilgore as a threat to the independence of both elite academic science and the economic marketplace, became the decisive winner on both fronts: the 1950 bill creating the National Science Foundation gave scientists primary responsibility for determining the agency's research agenda.
“The promise of scientific and technological progress has not been fulfilled.”
Over the subsequent 65 years, scientists and science advocates have not shirked from parroting Bush's Endless Frontier vision of scientific knowledge, flowing from “the free play of free intellects”, as an unalloyed good from which all citizens would benefit through the ever-expanding economic opportunities created by science-based innovation. It has been an appealingly non-ideological view of progress, adopted across the political spectrum. As Nobel-prizewinning physicist Leon Lederman put it in 1992: “What's good for American science … is good for America.”
Maybe not. Although Trump supporters are by no means a homo­geneous lot, a clever analysis in The New York Times in March showed that they can most reliably be characterized by two attri­butes. First, they identify their ancestral heritage as American, rather than any particular ethnic or religious stock. And second, they live in regions of the country that have not only failed to benefit economically from innovation, but have been harmed by it.
Mainstream media analysis of the Trump phenomenon almost never links it to the science and technology policies pursued by the nation since the Second World War. Yet technological revolutions arising from these policies have contributed to more than 40 years of wealth inequality, disappearing middle-class jobs and eviscerated manufacturing communities in the places where support for Trump is strongest. Indeed, economic theory throws aside these millions of people as the inevitable losers in the ‘creative destruction' that science catalyses, as if ruined cities and livelihoods are just side effects of the strong medicine of science-based innovation. These people are the cost of the prevailing myth of progress, and, given their core identity as ‘Americans', it is no wonder they are susceptible to Trump's jingoistic populism.
No one remembers Harley Kilgore any more, and it's impossible to know whether their socially oriented vision of science policy might have contributed to a more equitable linking between scientific advance and economic benefit. But it is more than simply ironic that Kilgore's home state of West Virginia — whose per capita income ranks 49th out of the 50 states — is now Trump's strongest supporter.
Having claimed for more than a half a century that science-based innovation would be good for everyone, science advocates and scientists who have benefited so greatly from this line of argument can hardly now say, “Oh, but it's not our fault, these are problems of trade and labour and economic policy”. Trump's ascendance should rekindle the Bush–Kilgore debates, and policymakers should seriously consider what a system of socially responsible and responsive science would look like. The current system has failed the test.
MOUNTAIN BROOK, Alabama -- Mountain Brook residents awoke to a vulgar sight near the post office on Montclair Road on Sunday, June 30: graffiti spray painted on the wall of a foreclosed property portrayed a hate-filled message targeted toward the police.
By Monday morning, city crews worked to cover at least part of the message and placed a tarp over the offensive language.
Mountain Brook City Manager Sam Gaston told AL.com today that police are investigating the incident.
"Public Works will try to remove the word, but if they can't," said Gaston in an emailed statement, "we will paint over it."
Ronnie Vaughn, public works director for the city, confirmed today that the offensive word has already been removed from the wall using a "graffiti remover and a pressure washer."
Unfortunately, the pressure washer went down this afternoon with mechanical problems before crews could finish the job, but Vaughn said their team will continue to try and remove more of the graffiti in the morning.

Fetch Robotics, a Silicon Valley startup that's bringing robots and a supporting cloud-based software system to industrial environments, has raised $25 million in a series B round of funding led by Sway Ventures, with participation from O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, Shasta Ventures, and SoftBank's SB Group US.
Founded in 2014, San Jose-based Fetch Robotics develops autonomous robots that operate among humans in locations such as warehouses, factories, and distribution centers. CEO Melonee Wise previously headed up Unbounded Robotics, which was shuttered a few years ago due to its inability to raise VC money — apparently because of an agreement it had with Willow Garage, the robotics company it was spun out of.
But while both Unbounded and Willow Garage focused on personal robots, Wise has taken a sideways step to cater to the fast-growing on-demand ecommerce industries that require the speed and efficiency of automation.
The company unveiled its first two products, the Fetch and the Freight, back in 2015. These are designed to operate in a modern warehouse and help companies cut costs and save time. Robots, you see, don't need regular breaks, and they don't usually call in sick.
Fetch Robotics had previously raised $23 million, and with its latest cash injection it plans to meet “accelerating worldwide customer demand” for Fetch Robotics software and robots.
“We are seeing first-hand that the growth in ecommerce and an expanding on-demand economy are contributing to unprecedented labor challenges faced by the $5 trillion global logistics industry,” said Wise. “With labor in short supply, our customers are still able to quickly realize significant, measurable productivity increases by deploying our autonomous mobile robots.”
Robotics and automation technologies have seen a major spike in investment of late, particularly in industrial applications. Veo Robotics, for example, recently raised $12 million to help machines and humans collaborate more efficiently, while Bossa Nova raised $17.5 million for retail robots that monitor merchants' in-store inventory. Elsewhere, Abundant Robotics raised $10 million to commercialize its apple-picking robot.
“The warehouse and logistics automation market is estimated at over $40 billion today, and is poised to double over the next five years,” added Brian Nugent, founding general partner at Sway Ventures.
As a result of Sway Venture's investment, Nugent will join Fetch Robotics' board of directors.

A Lafayette woman was sentenced Wednesday for their role in a crash that killed a Purdue University staffer.
Stephanie Shrock, 32, received a six-year sentence on one charge of causing death when operating a vehicle with a controlled substance in the blood, according to a sentencing order provided by the Boone County Prosecutor's Office.
Shrock will spend 19 days in the Indiana Department of Correction, while the remaining prison time will be suspended and spent on supervised probation, the order states.
One remaining felony and four misdemeanor charges were dropped as part of a plea agreement in March, according to online court records.
Shrock was charged in November after investigators found THC — marijuana's psychoactive ingredient — in their system after an Aug. 18 crash near Lebanon that killed 45-year-old Jacquelin Harp.
Harp was an administrative assistant in Purdue University's Information Technology Department, Purdue spokesperson Jim Bush confirmed last year.
Shrock was reportedly traveling south on U.S. 52 when they reached for a cup of coffee and accidentally crossed the median, striking another vehicle head-on.
The crash was one of several accidents last year on U.S. 52 after the stretch of highway was designated a detour route for Interstate 65 construction.

New York's Occupy Wall Street group is warning it could run out of money by the end of the month, raising questions about the future of the movement that sparked nationwide protests against economic injustice last year.
Donations to the group have slowed six months after it set up camp in a park near Wall Street, igniting the Occupy movement across the United States.
A report by Occupy Wall Street's accounting group for the week ended March 2 showed it had $44,828 in a general fund in addition to $90,000 set aside to bail protesters out of jail during planned “American Spring” protests.
The report said, “At our current rate of expenditure, we will be out of money in THREE WEEKS.”
The report – posted on the group's websitewww.nycga.net – showed $1,556 had been raised that week, while $14,942 had been spent on the group's kitchen, street medics, New York bus and subway passes, and printing costs.
The latest donation total constrasted sharply with the estimated $500,000 the group raised within weeks of setting up camp at Zuccotti Park on Sept. 17.
Since Occupy Wall Street began, it has received more than $730,000 in donations, according to the accounting group. It has a fiscal sponsor, the Tucson-based Alliance for Global Justice, which allows donations to be tax exempt.
Critics say the Occupy movement lacks direction and specific demands and has lost momentum. Occupy protest crowds in New York and other U.S. cities have tended to number only in the hundreds, despite the group's social media savvy.
But Occupy Wall Street spokesperson Ed Needham said, “The success of the movement has never depended on money.”
“Occupy Wall Street is about our abundant human resources – the creative talent, dedication and sweat equity of people here and elsewhere that have decided to stand up against a corrupt and unjust society run by a powerful elite few,” they said.
Inspired by the pro-democracy Arab Spring movement and Spain's “Indignados” movement, Occupy sparked a national debate about economic inequality and has influenced the political debate in this year's U.S. presidential election campaign.
The Occupy movement, which prides itself on being leaderless, has struggled to grow beyond the initial protest camps that sustained it.
Christine Crowther of the Occupy Wall Street accounting group said the group had “a lot planned for the spring and we fully expect the money will start flowing in again,”
A march is planned for March 17 to mark the group's six-month anniversary. Needham said there would also be “Occupy the Fundraisers” protests against money in politics, a March 24 protest against the fossil fuel industry's spending on lobbyists and an April 25 protest against U.S. student debt hitting $1 trillion.
Crowther said the $90,000 bail fund would allow To Occupy members to keep taking to the streets to protest. More than 1,000 people were arrested in previous Occupy protests in New York.
“While we give the dire warning (on finances) so that people will be conscious and considerate of how we're spending our money, we are still going to be able to take care of our people in the way that really matters – making sure that their bail and their court fees are paid,” Crowther said.
Occupy Wall Street protesters have been scattered across New York since their camp was evicted from Zuccotti Park in November.
A number of churches offered places to stay for some of the several hundred people who had traveled to New York to join the protest. Occupy Wall Street has also appealed online for more people to “host an occupier in your home and help sustain the movement.”
It has been spending several thousand dollars a week on transit passes so protesters can travel to an office space the group has been using in Lower Manhattan and a public atrium of a Wall Street skyscraper it uses for meetings.
Reprogramming bacteria to produce proteins for drugs, biofuels, and more, has long been part of the job for bioscientists, but for years they have struggled to get those bugs to follow orders.
Those days may be over. It turns out that a hidden feature of the genetic code controls how much of the desired protein bacteria produce, a team from the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard reported in today's online issue of Science.
The findings could be a boon for biotechnologists, and help synthetic biologists reprogram bacteria to make new drugs and biological devices.
By combining high-speed “next-generation” DNA sequencing and DNA synthesis technologies, Sriram Kosuri, a Wyss Institute staff scientist, George Church, a core faculty member at the Wyss Institute and professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School, and Daniel Goodman, a Wyss Institute graduate research fellow, found that using more rare words, or codons, near the start of a gene removes roadblocks to protein production.
“Now that we understand how rare codons control gene expression, we can better predict how to synthesize genes that make enzymes, drugs, or whatever you want to make in a cell,” Kosuri said.
To produce a protein, a cell must first make working copies of the gene that encodes it. These copies, called messenger RNA (mRNA), consist of a specific string of words, or codons. Each codon represents one of the 20 different amino acids cells use to assemble proteins. But because the cell uses 61 codons to represent the 20, many codons have synonyms that represent the same amino acid.
In bacteria, as in books, some words are used more often than others, and molecular biologists have noticed over the last few years that rare codons appear more frequently near the start of a gene. What's more, genes whose opening sequences have more rare codons produce more protein than genes whose opening sequences do not.
No one knew for sure why rare codons had these effects. Many biologists suspected that the rare codons functioned as a highway on-ramp for ribosomes, the molecular machines that build proteins. Under this “codon ramp” hypothesis, ribosomes wait on the on-ramp, then accelerate slowly along the mRNA highway, allowing the cell to make proteins at a deliberate speed. But without the on-ramp, the ribosomes gun it down the mRNA highway, then collide like bumper cars, causing traffic accidents that slow protein production. Other biologists suspected rare codons acted via different mechanisms, including mRNA folding, which could create roadblocks for ribosomes that blocked the highway and slowed protein production.
To determine which hypothesis was correct, the three researchers used a high-speed, multiplexed method they reported in August in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
First, they tested how well rare codons activated genes by mass-producing 14,000 snippets of DNA with either common or rare codons, splicing them near the start of a gene that makes cells glow green, and inserting each of those hybrid genes into different bacteria. Then they grew those bugs, sorted them into bins based on the intensity of their glow, and sequenced the snippets to look for rare codons.
They found that genes that opened with rare codons consistently made more protein. A single codon change could spur cells to make 60 times more protein.
“That's a big deal for the cell, especially if you want to pump out a lot of the protein you're making,” Goodman said.
The results were also consistent with the codon-ramp hypothesis, which predicted that rare codons themselves, rather than folded mRNA, slowed protein production. But the researchers also found that the more mRNA folded, the less of the corresponding protein it produced — a result that undermined the hypothesis.
To put the hypothesis to definitive proof, the Wyss team made and tested more than 14,000 mRNAs — including some with rare codons that did not fold well, and others that folded well but had no rare codons. By quickly measuring protein production from each mRNA and analyzing the results statistically, they were able to separate the two effects.
The results showed clearly that RNA folding, not rare codons, controlled protein production, and that scientists can increase protein production by altering folding, Goodman said.
The knowledge could help resolve other thorny debates in molecular biology. “The combination of high-throughput synthesis and next-gen sequencing allows us to answer big, complicated questions that were previously impossible to tease apart,” Church said.
“These findings on codon use could help scientists engineer bacteria more precisely than ever before, which is tremendous in itself, and they provide a way to greatly increase the efficiency of microbial manufacturing, which could have huge commercial value as well,” said Donald Ingber, Wyss' founding director. “They also underscore the incredible value of the new automated technologies that have emerged from the Synthetic Biology Platform that George leads, which enable us to synthesize and analyze genes more rapidly than ever before.”
The work was funded by the Department of Energy, the Office of Naval Research, Agilent Technologies, an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship to Goodman, and the Wyss Institute.
A Georgia woman is suing their former employer after they say they were fired because of two period leaks.
Alisha Coleman, who is being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, filed a lawsuit last week against the Bobby Dodd Institute, an employment agency in Fort Benning, Ga. In the filing, they detailed two occasions where their period leaked and they were allegedly given a disciplinary write-up and then fired.
They were told they were being fired because they didn't "practice high standards of personal hygiene and maintain a clean, neat appearance while on duty," according to the lawsuit.
“I loved my job at the 911 call center because I got to help people,” Coleman said in a statement. “Every woman dreads getting period symptoms when they're not expecting them, but I never thought I could be fired for it. Getting fired for an accidental period leak was humiliating. I don't want any woman to have to go through what I did, so I'm fighting back.”

The first leak happened in August of 2015 on Coleman's office chair, according to the lawsuit. They reported the stain to their supervisor who dismissed them from work to change their clothing and later told them "she would be fired if they ever soiled another chair from sudden onset menstrual flow," the lawsuit states.
On April 22, 2016, Coleman leaked menstrual fluid on the carpet on the way to the bathroom. After cleaning the spot with bleach and disinfectant, their site manager told the site supervisor to fire Coleman, the lawsuit says. They were fired April 26, 2016.
The ACLU and co-counsel Buckley Beal LLP say this is a case of workplace discrimination on the basis of sex, including “pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions" and violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.
"A heavy period is something nearly all women will experience, especially as they approach menopause, and Alisha was shamed, demeaned and fired for it," Andrea Young, ACLU of Georgia executive director, said in a statement. "That's wrong and illegal under federal law. We're fighting back.”
Bobby Dodd Institute released the following statement after being contacted by 11Alive:
Our mission is to help those with disabilities and disadvantages find work and keep work. While we cannot share specific details about this case because it's become a legal matter, please know there is more to this story than is being portrayed by those who are suing us. We can say we followed proper protocol and went the extra mile to avoid dismissal in this case, as we would for any of our employees.
Coleman does not have a court date yet, but prosecutors expect oral arguments in the next few months. The ACLU said they want the courts to allow the case to move forward so a jury can decide if the company did discriminate against Coleman.

In September of 2011, we at Hardcore Gaming 101 ran a massive reader-voted poll to determine the best video game music of all time. The result was over 1000 excellent songs, but had one curious deficiency - roughly 90% of the entire list consisted of music composed for Japanese video games. This is not a result of Western music being inherently inferior, but rather, I think, that not enough of the readership (myself included) has really been exposed some of the better songs. So, my goal was to run another poll, this time focusing entirely on Western music, and put to rest the stereotype that all music that comes out of the United States and Europe are all wannabe Hollywood-style orchestral blockbusters.
The rules were similar to the last poll, although the number of votes was cut in half to 50 songs due to the smaller pool to choose from, and the point structure was reworked so "Top 5" choices were given two points instead of three. Using the same cutoff of three points, the result was slightly under 200 songs, which seemed a little bit paltry. It also seemed to be missing some of the more well known or well regraded Commodore or Amiga soundtracks, which I was trying to promote. In order to fill in the gaps a bit, I chose an additional 50 songs myself to round the whole list out to 250. It's hardly the most democratic method of doing things (though all songs did get some levels of votes) but makes for a slightly more comprehensive playlist. So think of the first 200 as the actual poll, and the remaining 50 as sort of "editor's choice" bit. There's probably still quite a few gaps as far as establishing a canon of awesome Western composed music, but this site is all about education and exploring outside of our comfort zones a bit, so hopefully everyone will at least find some great new songs to stick on their playlist. If nothing else, hopefully it will help you become familiar with works from European legends like Chris Huelsbeck, Rub Hubbard, Ben Danglish, Jeroen Tel, Matt Gray, Matt Furniss, Tim & Geoff Follin and Stephane Picq, Sega mainstays like Spencer Nilsen, Howard Drossin and Richard Jacques, other talented American folks like Tommy Tallarico, Alexander Brandon and Frank Klepacki, and all the way up to recent musicsmiths like Jake Kaufman, Danny Baranowsky, Souleye (Magnus Pålsson), and Module (Jeremiah Ross).
VVVVVV
Naturally, many of the songs from the top 1000 list made recurring appearances, including Baba Yetu from Civilization IV and the theme from Monty on the Run, although the Diablo town theme overtook Stickerbush Symphony from Donkey Kong Country 2 as the top role. Some other decent songs that previously inhabited the dregs of the list placed much higher, like New Junk City from Earthworm Jim and the theme from The Last Ninja. Many tracks from Chris Huelsbeck's legendary Turrican scores placed, although the single most voted on game is the 2010 indie title VVVVVV, with nearly the entire soundtrack placing somewhere on the list. This, combined with the popularity of Amanaguchi's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World's score, shows a huge interest in retro-style music.
At any rate, please enjoy the music, and we hope you'll vote in our next poll!
Russell Simmons: "Don't Eat Anxious Sick Sad Animals"
Like us on Facebook:
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
Animal advocate Russell Simmons took to their Twitter account while at Veggie Grill, a veg chain restaurant based out of Santa Monica, to advocate for a vegan diet for the health of people and animals.
Simmons brought their daughters there for a meal, and was soon tweeting their thoughts on why diet is so important. They wrote, “You're what u eat. Don't eat anxious sick sad animals (t)hat were born into suffering & stuffed w/ poison #goVegan”.
If you're unsure what they mean by sick sad animals who are being stuffed with poison, check out this information on factory farming and the heavy use of antibiotics due to overcrowding.
The hip hop mogul also brought up the issue of food deserts, and how some areas don't have access to healthful foods. They wrote, “Everybody can't come to bev hills we need @veggiegrill in the hood #goVegan.”
And to top it all off, Simmons let everyone know that for the environment, it doesn't get worse than beef. They tweeted, “The greatest cause of globalwarming/2x all planes trains and automoblies put together? =The cows alone”.
Let's see. Animals. People. The planet. We think in just a few tweets, they covered it all.
So, what did they and their family eat while out at Veggie Grill? According to Simmons, they ate a “big mac w/ cheese”, “smothered fried chicken plate& steamed kale miso dressing”, “Fo-beef barley” and “fried fo-chicken mash cauliflower & steamed kale w/ ginger”.
In fact, they love the chain so much, they mentioned they wished they could “buy in”. With reviews like those, this east coast girl is feeling quite jealous.

Google-owned YouTube had a chance to beat Twitter's Periscope and its biggest competitor, Meerkat, to market by somewhere in the ballpark of 8 years, but decided against the move due to the fact that a large portion of the company's resources were engaged in fending off a Viacom lawsuit and creating the Content ID copyright detection system.
According to the Wall Street Journal, YouTube considered building its live-streaming platform into a mobile application. While the current existing system had been designed for a select few users and required Google's permission to launch a stream, the mobile app would have featured far fewer restrictions on who could use it and how.
Unfortunately, YouTube was also engaged in a legal battle with Viacom at the time over the use of unauthorized copyrighted material that had been uploaded by users. Combine that with the fact that the company was right in the middle of developing the Content ID system it still uses to track and remove copyrighted videos, the project was never fully explored and eventually fell by the wayside.
Google seriously considered building out its own desktop live-streaming service, which requires users to get Google's approval prior to live-streaming an event, into a less restrictive mobile app, said a former YouTube employee with knowledge of the matter. But for a variety of reasons the company didn't pursue it. Among them was that building the Content ID system while also fighting Viacom was such an undertaking that going into mobile live streaming didn't seem worth the extra investment, this person said.
It's quite possible that we'll see Google jump on the livestreaming bandwagon at some point in the future, but even if that does end up happening, there will always been a question of what might have been if Mountain View had been the first major tech company to enter the space.

Microsoft previously showed some concepts of how the Xbox dashboard could look with Fluent Design. While we found out at E3 2017 that Microsoft isn't ready to talk about when (or if) the Xbox dashboard will pick up some Fluent visual tweaks, at least the Xbox (beta) app for Windows 10 is about to join the party.
Fluent Design adds elements of translucency and cursor responsiveness to interactive features across all of Microsoft's apps and services. The most prolific examples of Fluent Design can be found on the Windows 10 Fast Ring for insiders, where more and more system apps and features are picking up design updates.
The hamburger menu on the left side of the Xbox app now has a translucent effect, allowing you to see right through to whatever is behind the app. There's no mouse-over light feedback on the menu as seen in Microsoft Groove and certain other apps, but there's no reason to think it won't arrive in the future.
It'll probably be months until all Microsoft apps are using the Fluent Design System fully, but at least for the time being, we'll have to put up with the random updates here and there. We'll keep you posted on other updates.

… I don't know. Literally. I'm not going to watch the first six minutes of this because everything I've seen from “Bates Motel” actually looks pretty good to me so I'm saving myself for an entire episode. I can wait a week. But if you can't wait, it's right here for you.
The series stars Academy Award nominee Vera Farmiga (“Up in the Air,” “The Departed”), Freddie Highmore (“Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” “Finding Neverland”), Max Thieriot (“Disconnect”), Olivia Cooke (“Blackout”) and Nicola Peltz (“The Last Airbender”). Season one also co-stars Nestor Carbonell (“Lost,” “The Dark Knight Rises”) and Mike Vogel (“Pan Am”).
“In “Bates Motel,” following the tragic death of their husband, Norma Bates buys a motel on the outskirts of the idyllic coastal town of White Pine Bay, seeking a fresh start. As Norma and Norman get ensconced in their new home, they discover this town isn't quite what it seems, and the locals aren't so quick to let them in on their secrets. But the Bates' are done being pushed around and will do whatever it takes to survive – and will do whatever it takes to protect their own secrets.”

Saudi Arabia has now suffered three deliberate attacks by supporters of Islamic State (IS) on the restive Shia Muslim minority living in the country's oil-rich Eastern Province.
The first, in November 2014, was a gun attack. And, in May 2015, there have been two devastating suicide bomb blasts targeting worshippers at Friday prayers.
The last two attacks used RDX, a powerful military explosive, and have been claimed by IS's self-styled Najd Province, named after Saudi Arabia's staunchly conservative Sunni heartland, the desert plateau in the middle of the country.
So what is IS trying to achieve and will it succeed?
These attacks are a watershed for Saudi Arabia.
How it reacts now and in the coming months will determine whether the largest and most important Arab state can stave off a wider sectarian conflict between the country's majority Sunni and minority Shia Muslim populations, something that would be disastrous for both communities.
The attacks follow decades of state and religious discrimination against the Shia minority, who constitute about 10% of the population.
Even a senior royal, Prince Abdelaziz Bin Salman Al-Saud, whose father is now king, admitted to me in an interview in 2013 that the Shia of Saudi Arabia had a legitimate grievance and that their situation needed addressing.
Since then, there have been deadly clashes between police and protesters in Eastern Province, and tensions there had only just started to subside.
The Shia are considered by many ultra-religious Saudi Arabian Sunnis to be heretics, outsiders suspected of being more loyal to Iran than to Saudi Arabia, and recently there have been a number of vitriolic speeches and sermons demonising them as apostates.
This narrow, discriminatory view is shared by IS, which despises the Shia even more than it does Christians, and it has frequently targeted Shias in both Iraq and Syria.
"[IS] is trying to weaken the Saudi state by claiming the conservative Salafi Sunni mantle," says Nawaf Obaid, a Harvard senior fellow.
"They will fail, as al-Qaeda did 10 years ago."
Sensitive reaction
So far, the new Saudi Arabian leadership has reacted with surprising speed and sensitivity.
King Salman, who took the throne in January, said they were "heartbroken" by the attacks.
Image copyright Frank Gardner Image caption Saudi Arabia's capital is peaceful, but residents remember al-Qaeda's bombing campaign of 10 years ago
They allowed Saudi Arabian television to broadcast the massively attended Shia funerals in full.
On 3 June, they referred to the Shia volunteers who had died preventing the second bomber from entering the mosque in Dammam as "martyrs" and "heroes" - a significant step for the absolute monarch in a country that has never had a senior Shia minister and where the authority of the ruling family rests on the support of the arch-Sunni clergy.
"[The Saudi leadership] may be saying the right things to calm the situation," says a Saudi Arabian Shia, who asked not to be named for their own protection.
"But all the calls by the Shia leadership for the government to crack down on anti-Shia rhetoric have been ignored.
"These are a precursor to attacks like the ones we have just seen."
IS has come into this delicate diplomatic minefield, with guns blazing and bombs blasting.

It would like nothing better than to trigger a fully blown sectarian war between Sunni and Shia in Saudi Arabia, which is home to the two holiest sites in Islam, in Mecca and Medina.
IS likes to present itself to Sunnis as being the sole force in the region capable enough and willing to push back against the creeping advance of Iran's Shia allies.
As part of that narrative it would like to pull in more of the mainstream Sunni population behind its banners to resist what it sees as a heretical Persian-inspired apostate creed.
Saudi Arabia demographics:
The population is estimated at 29.8 million, of which about nine million are foreigners
Sunni Muslims make up the majority of the indigenous population, 75-90%
Shia Muslims make up the remaining 10-25%
"Shia-Sunni relations in Saudi Arabia are already under severe strains due to events in Iraq and Syria, as well as Saudi Arabia's campaign in Yemen against the [Shia] al‐Houthi [rebels]" says Aimen Deen, an expert on jihadist movements.
"Therefore IS will seek to provoke the Shia minority to retaliate or at least take to the streets in violent protests."
More attacks likely
Mr Deen predicts more attacks by IS inside Saudi Arabia to further provoke a reaction from elements of the Shia protest movement.
Image copyright Frank Gardner Image caption In Saudi Arabia's deeply conservative and religious society, any sectarian conflict would harm both Sunni and Shia Muslims
They do, though, point out that the Saudi-led air campaign in Yemen against Shia rebels seen by many Saudis as Iran's proxy militia is so popular with much of the Saudi population that recruitment of Saudis to IS has fallen off dramatically.
And what if IS persists in its attacks anyway?
Nawaf Obaid believes the government is capable of dealing with it, bearing in mind that the current crown prince is the man who led the successful anti-al-Qaeda campaign for many years.
"The remarkable Saudi counter-terrorism programme will defeat [IS] and the legitimacy of the Saudi state will only be reinforced," they say.
That prediction is likely to be tested in the coming months.
However, both its bid to host the tournament and alleged treatment of workers on related building projects have been mired in controversy. Serious concerns remain over the treatment of the many migrant workers building the arenas and infrastructure needed.
"Unless action is taken – and soon – then every football fan who visits Qatar in 2022 should ask themselves how they can be sure they are not benefiting from the blood, sweat and tears of migrant workers," Qadri said.
"FIFA has played its part in this sorry performance. It knew there were labor rights issues in Qatar. It must work closely with the Qatari authorities and business partners to ensure the World Cup is not built on exploitation."
Amnesty International's criticism comes at the end of a year that has seen FIFA embroiled in several damaging scandals.
In September, Swiss prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into FIFA President Sepp Blatter on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and misappropriation. FIFA's ethics committee subsequently banned Blatter and Michel Platini, the head of European football's governing body, UEFA, from FIFA for 90 days.
On Tuesday, Amnesty International said Qatar has "seriously failed" to address five of its nine "fundamental" concerns relating to the labor rights of migrant workers it highlighted in a report seven months ago.
These include the issue of paying wages on time, an expansion of the country's labor inspection force – which Amnesty says has now been postponed until late 2016 – and a reform of the "kafala" system, which legally binds workers to their employer.
"The reforms proposed by the government fail to tackle the central issues that leave so many workers at the mercy of employers, yet even these changes have been delayed," Qadri said.
A common practice in the Middle East, the kafala system is a key bone of contention for critics of Qatar. Migrant workers' employed under the system are unable to leave the country or change jobs without "explicit permission" from their employer or sponsor, according to the International Labour Organisation.
DES MOINES, Iowa — Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told the moderators of the Republican presidential debate at Iowa Events Center on Thursday that they might just take their ball and go home.
Their threat to leave the stage came after they accused Fox News' questioners of encouraging their rivals to attack him.
“I would note that the last four questions have been, ‘Rand, please attack Ted. Marco, please attack Ted. Chris, please attack Ted. Jeb, please attack Ted.”
SLIDESHOW – The 7th GOP debate (the one without Trump) >>>
Cruz's comment provoked loud boos from the audience. Their critique of the debate questions came after former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was asked about how their plans to confront the jihadi group ISIS would differ from those put forth by Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.
Moderator Chris Wallace offered a retort to Cruz.
“It is a debate, sir,” Wallace said.
Cruz wasn't satisfied with Wallace's response.
“No, no, a debate actually is a policy issue,” Cruz said. “But I will say this, gosh, if you guys say — ask one more mean question, I'm going to have to leave the stage.”
It was unclear if this was a real threat, a badly delivered joke or a shot at Donald Trump, who Cruz previously mocked for actually boycotting the debate over a beef with Fox News. In the spin room after the debate, Cruz campaign consultant Jeff Roe told Yahoo News that Cruz was indeed kidding.
“Hopefully their humor was a little better than for it to be confused, but yeah, no they were joking,” Roe said.
Cruz concluded by urging the moderators to “stay focused” on substantive issues.
“The most important determination any voter is going to make in this election is who's best prepared to be commander in chief, who has the experience, who has the knowledge, who has the judgment, who has the clarity of vision and strength of resolve to keep this country safe,” Cruz said. “That is what this debate is all about, and I would suggest let's stay focused on those issues rather than just attacks directed at each other.”
Wallace said they felt “the questions were about issues.”
The next question went to Rubio, who began with a comment on Cruz's behavior.
“First of all, don't worry I'm not leaving the stage no matter what you asked me,” Rubio said.
In the spin room following the debate, Rubio's communications director Alex Conant said the exchange was not “a very good moment” for Cruz.
“Ted Cruz had a rough night. This was obviously Ted Cruz's worst debate performance so far,” Conant said.

South Carolina Supreme Court chief justice Donald Beatty.
In the United States, many municipalities rely on fines from traffic violations and other misdemeanors to fund basic government services. The upside of this means of revenue generation, from a political perspective, is that it's invisible to most voters, and painless for rich people (who are often campaign donors).
But the policy's downsides are considerable.
For one thing, you generally need to milk those fines from the most disempowered community in your area (any police chief who aggressively cracks down on every little misdemeanor rich, well-connected people commit won't be in office for long). But the thing about disempowered people is, they don't have a lot of money. So it can be a real hassle to get them to pay up. And then, if they wish to contest their fine in court, you've got to provide them with an attorney. Pretty soon, you're spending more on collecting the fines than they're even worth.
South Carolina found a pair of elegant solutions to this conundrum:
(1) Intimidate poor people into dutifully paying their fines by imprisoning those who don't (debtors' prisons may be a tad costly, but you've gotta spend money to make money).
(2) Don't inform poor defendants that they have a constitutional right to an attorney.
This worked really well for a while. As the American Civil Liberties Union demonstrated in a 2016 report, the South Carolina municipalities of Beaufort and Bluffton were able to extract fines from thousands of poor people every year, without ever providing them access to a public defender. Meanwhile, South Carolina's Lexington County sent a strong message to its fine-evading poor, by sending hundreds of impoverished people to modern-day debtors' prisons.
Alas, on November 1, South Carolina Supreme Court chief justice Donald Beatty informed summary court judges that the Constitution requires them to honor poor defendants' rights to an attorney, and prohibits debtors' prisons — and as judges, they actually do kinda need to adhere to that document.
The instructions came during a training session, and followed studies and lawsuits from the ACLU, drawing attention to the myriad due-process violations in the state's court system. The chief justice told the summary judges that “violating someone's constitutional rights is an offense and that there are consequences for an offense,” according to the Post and Courier.
After learning that they could face legal consequences for violating the Constitution, these summary judges decided that they may have issued an improper arrest warrant or two … a thousand. As the Post and Courier reports:
Tens of thousands of South Carolinians wanted for arrest for skipping court dates or blowing off fines might be breathing a sigh of relief as judges have stopped jailing some of these low-level offenders under instructions from the state's chief justice … Many summary courts, which include county magistrates and municipal judges from the Lowcountry to the Upstate, have suspended all arrests on bench warrants as they scramble to figure out which cases are affected.
… Ninth Circuit Solicitor Scarlett Wilson said the victims are their primary concern. But they were startled to learn, they said, that even defendants who had bond hearings on magistrate-level offenses were not told of their rights.
“By recalling all those bench warrants, it seems the judges are admitting that failure,” they said. “It is a positive step that the chief justice is correcting this huge flaw in the magistrate court process.”
And they would have gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for that meddling ACLU.
UK Government Decriminalizes Piracy. VCAP to hit 2015
After many years of seemingly no progress, the UK Government has decided to scrap extensive punishment plans aimed at digital piracy. Instead, the VCAP (Voluntary Copyright Alert Programme) will be installed as of 2015. In a nutshell, this means that active illegal downloaders will receive up to 4 emails or letters a year, intended to inform the person of their illegal actions and the harm it causes to UK creative industries. The UK's biggest internet providers – BT, Talktalk, Virgin and Sky have all signed on to the scheme with more obscure providers expected to follow.
The biggest detail here is that there is absolutely no further action to be taken, even on repeated offense. Several statements have been made about the scheme, mostly claiming that the UK creative industries are suffering, but they are basically impossible to protect from piracy, but this is the most valid option they had.
Geoff Taylor, chief exec of the BPI claims that it's about “persuading the persuadable, such as parents who do not know what is going on with their net connection.” Adding that “VCAP is not about denying access to the internet. It's about changing attitudes and raising awareness so people can make the right choice.” Hence, the scheme is intended to educate, or perhaps threaten users into not engaging in piracy.
There are no current details as to how frequent or severe the offense has to be in order to be eligible for these emails, but it's a safe suggestion that constant offenders will be the initial targets. The scheme seems like a decent attempt compared to previous plans to attack torrent websites. But it's simply naive to think that this will have a long term impact on the state of UK-based digital piracy.
The western Iraqi city of Ramadi on Sunday fell to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), after the militants relentlessly bombarded the capital of the Anbar province with suicide bombers, Al Arabiya News Channel reported.
Ramadi fell after the Iraqi army deserted the city, the channel added, in a withdrawal echoing the military's shock departure from Iraq's second largest city of Mosul in June last year.
ISIS also claimed to hold the entire city but Iraqi officials disagreed with each other over whether Ramadi had fallen.
Video shows Iraqi army leaving
Shiite militias ordered in Anbar
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered government forces to “hold their positions” in Ramadi, after ISIS said it overran the strategic city, their spokesperson said.
Abadi said troops, tribesmen and other elite forces “must hold their positions and preserve them and not allow Daesh (ISIS) to extend to other areas in Ramadi,” spokesperson Saad al-Hadithi said.
“There is continuous air cover that will help ground troops there hold their positions while waiting for support from other forces and the Popular Mobilization Units,” they said of an umbrella group for Shiite militias.
Anbar province is primarily Sunni and many worried sending Shiite militias into the region could spark greater outrage among those still there.
Meanwhile, officials told Agence France-Press that ISIS militants on Sunday took over the provincial operations command center in Ramadi, putting the jihadists on the brink of capturing the Iraqi city, officials said.
“Anbar operations command has been cleared,” Muhannad Haimour, spokesperson and adviser to the province's governor, told AFP. Several security officials confirmed the retreat.
Security sources also told Reuters that ISIS militants overran one of the last remaining districts held by government forces in Ramadi on Sunday and besieged a key army base on the edge of the western provincial capital, security sources said.
The militants seized most of Ramadi on Friday, planting their black flag on the local government headquarters in the center of the city, but a contingent of Iraqi Special Forces was holding out in the Malaab neighborhood.
Those forces retreated on Sunday to an area east of the city after suffering heavy casualties, security sources said, bringing Ramadi to the brink of falling to Islamic State.
It would be the first major urban center to be seized by the insurgents in Iraq since security forces and paramilitary groups began pushing them back last year.
Anbar provincial council member Athal Fahdawi described the situation in Ramadi as “total collapse” and said local officials had voted in favor of the deployment of Shiite paramilitaries to the Sunni heartland.
Shiite paramilitaries have played a leading role in reversing Islamic State gains elsewhere in Iraq, but have so far been kept on the sidelines in Anbar due to concerns about inflaming sectarian violence.
The insurgents were closing in on the Anbar Operations Command to the west and a military officer inside the army base said it was too late to send reinforcements, pleading for help from Abadi.
“We are now surrounded inside the Operations Command by Daesh, and mortars are raining down,” said the officer. Daesh is an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.
“Daesh fighters are in almost every street. It's a chaotic situation and things are sliding out of control. Ramadi is falling into the hands of Daesh,” the officer said.
Suicide bombers
The news comes after a suicide car bomb attacks killed 15 members of Iraqi security forces Sunday in Ramadi.
Police and army officials said four nearly simultaneous bombings targeted police officers defending the Malaab district, killing 10 and wounding 15. Among the dead was Col. Muthana al-Jabri, the chief of the Malaab police station, they said.
Later on, police said three suicide bombers drove their explosive-laden cars into the gate of the Anbar Operation Command, the military headquarters for the province, killing five soldiers and wounding 12.
Fierce clashes erupted between security forces and ISIS militants following the attacks. Subsequently, ISIS militants seized the Malaab area after government forces withdrew.
A police officer who was in Malaab said retreating forces left behind about 30 army vehicles and weapons that included artillery and assault rifles. They said some two dozen police officers also went missing during the fighting.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren't authorized to talk to journalists.
The new setback came only a day after Baghdad's decision to send reinforcements to help its battered forces in Ramadi.
Meanwhile, Iraqi warplanes launched airstrikes on ISIS positions inside Ramadi on Sunday, the Iraqi Defense Ministry said, without elaborating.
Last week, the militants swept through Ramadi, seizing the main government headquarters and other key parts of the city. It marked a major setback for the Iraqi government's efforts to drive the militants out of areas they seized last year.
500 killed in Ramadi
An estimated 500 people, civilians and security forces, were killed in the jihadist offensive on Ramadi, a spokesperson for the governor of the Iraqi province of Anbar said.
“We don't have an accurate count of casualties yet but we believe at least 500 people, both civilian and military, have been killed over the past two days,” Muhannad Haimour told AFP.

Last Update: Monday, 18 May 2015 KSA 23:22 - GMT 20:22
A Philadelphia mother of two is facing three years in prison after they mistakenly entered New Jersey, where they were stopped for a traffic violation and found in possession of a handgun loaded with hollow-point bullets.
Shaneen Allen, 27, was pulled over in New Jersey's Atlantic County after making an unsafe lane change in the early morning hours of Oct. 1. Allen then told the officer that they had the .380 Bersa Thunder handgun, as well as a concealed carry permit for Pennsylvania, unaware that their permit was not transferable to The Garden State.
“The gun charge was not proper to begin with at all,” their attorney, Evan Nappen, told FoxNews.com. “She made an honest mistake.”
Allen, who has no criminal record, was later charged with unlawful possession of a weapon and possession of hollow-point bullets. If convicted, the illegal possession of the handgun is a second-degree felony punishable by a mandatory minimum sentence of three years in prison.
[pullquote]
“New Jersey's draconian and crazy gun laws gives the judge no discretion here — none,” Nappen continued. “You will get three years with no chance of parole if you're convicted of this gun charge. So in the effort of promoting gun control in New Jersey, they've created a situation where very sympathetic people get harmed and turned into the victim by gun laws.”
Allen, who could not be reached for comment early Wednesday, had only owned the gun for a week prior to the arrest, Nappen said, and purchased it for their protection after being robbed twice in the past year.
“The officer knew there was a gun there, they were completely honest and open,” they continued. “There's no aggravating factors in this case; she's a single mom of two, working in the medical field who was robbed twice and that's what inspired them to get a gun license in the first place.”
Despite a lack of a criminal record, Nappen said Allen was not accepted into a diversionary program that would allow them to avoid jail time altogether.
Nappen said Allen's arrest also coincided with a gun buyback program in New Jersey last year that netted more than 10,000 handguns. Individuals who turned in weapons during the “no questions asked” buyback period were paid up to $250 per gun.
John Lott, Jr., president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, said the case was similar to that of Brian Aitken, a New Jersey man whose seven-year prison sentence was eventually commuted by Gov. Chris Christie.
In early 2009, Aitken moved back to New Jersey from Colorado to be closer to their young son and estranged wife. A planned visit with their son was canceled at the last minute and their mother, who was concerned for their safety, called the police. A subsequent search of their car by officers revealed two locked and unloaded handguns in the trunk, both of which were purchased legally in Colorado.
Aitken's father, Larry, told FoxNews.com at the time that they refused to see their son lost in the patchwork of state gun laws throughout the country.
"I don't think there are words yet invented that could characterize the — I guess anger would be one word, but it's a lot deeper than anger," Larry Aitken told FoxNews.com in 2010. "Whatever the word is that's a combination of anger, shock, disbelief, horror and a desire to expose all of this — that's the word.”
Lott, meanwhile, said they hope “something similar” happens in Allen's case, adding that they clearly did not intend to commit any crime.
"These mandatory sentences sometimes create really unfortunate results,” Lott continued. “My own academic research indicates that Ms. Allen is the type of person who benefits the most from having permitted concealed handguns: a minority woman who lives in high-crime urban areas. The people who are most likely to be victims of crime are the ones who benefit the most from having a gun for protection. In addition, women benefit much more than men do because they tend to be much weaker physically than their attackers.”
Jay McKeen, public information officer for the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office, said Allen has a pre-trial conference scheduled for Aug. 5. Prosecutor James McClain declined to comment on the matter, McKeen said.
The Obama administration is instituting a variety of far-reaching policies to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change. Are any of these capable of making a difference? Simple arithmetic suggests not. Given this reality, we would be wise to consider strategies that complement and may be more effective than mitigation—namely, adaptation.
According to the Paris-based International Energy Agency, in 2012 the world emitted a little over 31 gigatons of carbon dioxide. China was the No. 1 emitter, accounting for more than one-fourth of the carbon produced. The U.S. was second, emitting about one-sixth.
China and India, among other developing countries, argue that they should be allowed to increase carbon emissions. They're still developing and require higher rates of economic growth. Moreover, they aren't responsible for previous emissions, and on a per capita basis U.S. emissions are much higher.
These arguments have merit but must be measured against the reality of carbon growth. Consider China: Its carbon emissions increased by an average 8.6% a year between 2002 and 2012. Were China to continue at this pace for 27 years until it reaches today's U.S. GDP per capita, it would emit 99 gigatons of carbon in 2041 alone, or three times the world's current emissions.
This scenario is too pessimistic. As countries develop, they become more efficient in energy use. But even if China tapered its emissions growth from 8.6% to zero over the same 27 years, it would still emit as much carbon in 2041 as the entire world does today. And that's not including emissions growth from India, Africa and South America.
Is there any hope of limiting carbon emissions to 30-50 gigatons in 2030, as many climatologists have called for, with substantial reductions thereafter? Some countries, notably Denmark and Sweden, have significantly reduced emissions. Can the U.S. do the same?
Feel-good actions won't make a dent. For example, it is fashionable to favor locally grown produce in part to reduce the carbon from transport. But transport from producer to retailer is a trivial part—less than 5%—of energy used in the life cycle of produce. Almost all of the emitted carbon is associated with production, which means that growing a tomato bound for Chicago in an Illinois winter hothouse rather than outdoors in Florida is not a carbon-saving strategy.
How about using public transportation, driving carbon-friendly vehicles, living closer to work, or biking instead of driving? Suppose that the U.S. completely eliminated carbon emissions from transportation over the next four years. The IEA data show that world emissions would still rise because the reduction from the U.S. would not cover the increase in carbon emitted by the rest of the world. Without world-wide changes, there is limited gain, even from dramatic action by the world's second-largest emitter.
The economics also work against a major transformation in the technology of producing power, either mobile or stationary. Coal is cheap. Natural gas is becoming even cheaper, but its carbon emissions, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, are still half those of coal and three-quarters those of gasoline per unit of energy produced. Although a switch to natural gas for many power uses would help, and accounts for recent drops in U.S. emissions, it cannot change the carbon arithmetic enough to prevent the world from exceeding "safe" levels.
Unless an economical low-carbon source of power generation becomes available, it is unrealistic to expect that countries, especially developing ones, will accede to any demand to produce power in a higher-cost manner merely to emit less carbon.
Very high carbon taxes or severely restrictive cap-and-trade policies might provide substantial motivation to conserve. These could reduce carbon-intensive consumption and motivate a switch to lower carbon power sources like nuclear. But these actions are undesirable because of their adverse effects on the economy. Australia instituted a $22 per ton carbon-dioxide tax in 2012. It repealed the highly unpopular measure this July, mainly because of its economic costs and perceived ineffectiveness. Research and development are worthwhile. But they can be wasteful and ineffective—recall Solyndra—and if R&D is to be government sponsored, all developed countries should participate in funding.
Given these limitations on mitigating carbon emissions, it is important to study how to adapt to climate change. There are myriad possibilities for adaptation, including the obvious, like building dikes in low-lying areas, and planting heat-tolerant crops and trees in cities. Some adaptation will occur naturally. For example, economic incentives will induce people who are setting up new households, businesses and farms to move to areas that are less severely harmed by warming temperatures.
Organizations like the U.N.-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have pushed adaptation as a complementary strategy to mitigation. Still, adaptation has received little attention by the Obama administration and is hardly mentioned in public discussion. Proponents of strong anti-carbon measures seem to believe that even considering an alternative to mitigation will weaken the public's willingness to bear the costs of mitigation.
Carbon math makes clear that without major effort and a good bit of luck, we are unlikely to control the growth of emissions enough to meet the standards that many climate scientists suggest are necessary. It is time to end the delusions and start thinking realistically about what can and will be done.

Latest Revelations Show How Collecting All The Haystacks To Find The Needle Makes The NSA's Job Harder
from the and-makes-us-all-less-safe dept
The volume of NSA contacts collection is so high that it has occasionally threatened to overwhelm storage repositories, forcing the agency to halt its intake with “emergency detasking” orders. Three NSA documents describe short-term efforts to build an “across-the-board technology throttle for truly heinous data” and longer-term efforts to filter out information that the NSA does not need.
Spam has proven to be a significant problem for NSA — clogging databases with data that holds no foreign intelligence value. The majority of all e-mails, one NSA document says, “are SPAM from ‘fake' addresses and never ‘delivered' to targets.”
In fall 2011, according to an NSA presentation, the Yahoo account of an Iranian target was “hacked by an unknown actor,” who used it to send spam. The Iranian had “a number of Yahoo groups in his/her contact list, some with many hundreds or thousands of members.”
The cascading effects of repeated spam messages, compounded by the automatic addition of the Iranian's contacts to other people's address books, led to a massive spike in the volume of traffic collected by the Australian intelligence service on the NSA's behalf.
After nine days of data-bombing, the Iranian's contact book and contact books for several people within it were “emergency detasked.”
Yet another post about the latest NSA revelations about collecting buddy lists and email contacts. As we'd mentioned in the original post, the story noted that this data collection was at times overwhelming . Here's the Washington Post's report on this point:Here's a slide from the leaked NSA presentation, in which it urges people to be more careful about what kind of data it collects via this program, saying they're trying to "store less of the wrong data" and "shift the collection philosophy at the NSA" to "memorialize what you need" from "order one of everything off the menu and eat what you want."This is the very same NSA which is led by Keith Alexander, whose unofficial motto has been described as "collect it all." At times, Alexander has argued in public that "you need the haystack to find the needle." Of course, that's bogus, and the data deluge discussed in this program demonstrated why. Collecting it all makes itto find the right information. Piling more hay on the haystack doesn't make it easier to find the needle, it makes it harder. That's one of many reasons why we're so concerned about these bulk data collection programs. Not only do they rarely seem to turn up useful information, but they also seem to betterimportant information by flooding the system with bogus data.

Friend of mine just forwarded me this CFP (that's ‘call for papers,' for the unwashed among you) for an impending scholarly clambake at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia. In this golden age of academic off-jag, it's pretty hard to stand out as a polysyllabic bullshitter, but this, uh, text and its author deserve mad props for totally delivering on the enticing promise of the panel's subtitle. Take us beyond meaning, Jamie Bianco of the University of Pittsburgh!
Non-discursivity and Affect: Beyond Meaning in Media
Seminar Organizer: Jamie Bianco, U of Pittsburgh
Within cultural and comparative studies, we engage the world through discursive and critical frameworks. In response to emerging theorization of multimodality, non-discursivity, creative criticism, practical research, object-oriented philosophy, and speculative realism, this seminar seeks to engage work that draws out these emergent conceptualizations in relation to cultural and media production, reception, circulation/distribution, and response. Are non-discursive elements “readable” in a critical response? What is the role of “design”? How might we think about and produce responses to ecologies and ethologies of culture, media, mediated objects, and user/makers within creative critical or multimodal productive methods that privilege critical making over intervention? Are experiential critical designs effective? This seminar considers media to include print and analog forms as well as digital and computational forms and welcomes work in multimodal/multimediated genres and styles.
So much to admire here. I love the way that “practical research” stands out like a turd in a punchbowl next to “multimodality, non-discursivity” etc etc. I love them scare quotes around “‘readable'” and “‘design,'” though would prefer to see same around “role,” and maybe “seminar” too, because that's a concept that's really been insufficiently problematized. I'm dying to know the distinction between “critical making” and “intervention.” Are we talking here about the difference between sitting around criticizing shit and actually doing something about shit? Just a fucking guess, based on the rash assumption that it has to mean anything at all.
In the words of my man Flann, “Can you imagine the sneering daredevils who despise each other for not ‘understanding' grey incomprehensibilities like this?”
Deval Patrick in Washington on June 22. Larry French/Getty Images for the Jefferson Awards Foundation
The world of finance! There's nothing inherently wrong with it. People need banks so they can buy houses and cars, and need to invest their money for retirement and whatnot. Some of my closest friends work in finance, and I enjoy being invited to their beautiful country homes, where I drink their pink lemonade and lounge on their fine divans.
And yet … do I think that any of these friends of mine should run for president in 2020 on the ticket of America's liberal party during an era of unprecedented wealth inequality and consolidated corporate power? No! And neither should Deval Patrick, the ex–Massachusetts governor who now works for Bain Capital and is for some reason the subject of a Tuesday Politico story with this headline:
Screenshot/Politico
You may remember Bain Capital as the private-equity company co-founded by Mitt Romney—as in, the Mitt Romney who Barack Obama (a Democrat) effectively attacked for enriching themselves through mass layoffs during a 2012 election that many “Obama insiders” should have at least a passing familiarity with. As it happens, many Obama voters—including those in, to name three states at random, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan—would go on to vote four years later not for the Democratic candidate whose insider connections and high-priced speeches to Goldman Sachs became a major campaign issue, but for the Republican candidate who made repeated and energetic (albeit totally dishonest) promises to stick it to the rich and powerful. Apparently Obama insiders do not have a passing familiarity with that election, but it was bad. It was a problem.
This is not merely a matter of “optics” or electoral strategy, though. It's also a matter of principle. Individuals whose main day-in, day-out concern is the well-being of financial service executives and corporate shareholders naturally tend to advocate policy goals friendly to the interests of financial services executives and corporate shareholders. Those interests sometimes, but do not always, overlap with the interests of potential Democratic voters, as this comparison of corporate profits to inflation-adjusted household income during the 21st century indicates:
Federal Reserve via Jordan Weissmann
Corporate profits: way up! Income for normal people: eh.*
One group that believes that Democrats shouldn't overtly represent the interests of the wealthy, in fact, is the current Democratic Party. Even Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New Yorker who counts Wall Street executives among their most prominent constituents (and top donors), is on board with a 2018 Democratic platform that frames the party's agenda as a matter of increasing wages while diminishing corporate power. Is a finance executive who conducted their Politico interview at “Bain headquarters in Boston” really the ideal messenger for this sales pitch?
The Politico article acknowledges this practical reality, sort of, writing that “Bernie Sanderized Democrats … are suspicious of finance types to begin with, and were taught by Obama's 2012 brutal campaign attacks on Mitt Romney to think of Bain as a curse word.” (Again, though, the group that swung the 2016 election was not “Bernie-addled coastal leftist elites,” it was former Obama voters in the Midwest.) The piece then suggests that Democratic voters in 2020 might rally around the idea of “taking on Trump's management shortcomings” and “calling for a different way of merging government and business experience.” And, well, I suppose anything can happen in three years, but if the 2020 Democratic primary turns on an angry base's passionate demand for “a different way of merging government and business experience,” I will eat a hard copy of the Mitt Romney “47 percent” video.
Politico, incidentally, published more or less this same piece—a 2020 “will they run?” trial balloon describing momentum building behind a candidate who has good relationships with party operatives and wealthy donors—in July, except that one was about Andrew Cuomo, who would also be a bad 2020 nominee. I look forward to reading “Democratic Insiders Are Buzzing About This Anthropomorphic Stack of $100 Bills” in Politico in September.
*Correction, Aug. 1, 2017, at 2:10 p.m.: This post initially included a graphical comparison of GDP growth to real income growth rather than the comparison of corporate profits to real income described in the text. Classic economics graph mix-up!

Conservative Fox News television host, author, and radio host Glenn Beck has started a university.
Sort of.
According to an announcement on Beck's Web site, "Beck University is a unique academic experience bringing together experts in the fields of religion, American history and economics." In July, August and September, interested parties can participate in "captivating lectures and interactive online discussions" in which "experts will explore the concepts of Faith, Hope and Charity and show you how they influence America's past, their present and most importantly their future."
At left is the actual insignia of Beck University. (Note the buffalo, feather and Latin words.) To be clear, calling it a university is more than a stretch: It is actually simply an opportunity to watch online classes taught by three men, among them the controversial David Barton.
Barton is described on Beck's site as "the founder and president of WallBuilders, a national pro-family organization that presents America's forgotten history and heroes, with an emphasis on our moral, religious, and constitutional heritage."  They are an evangelical minister and GOP political activist who has pushed hard against the separation of church and state and been embraced by conservative Republican politicians.
They have been criticized repeatedly for bad scholarship. According to People for the American Way, then-Republican Sen. Arlen Specter wrote in the Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy in 1995 that Barton's arguments "range from the technical to the absurd" and "proceed from flawed and highly selective readings of both text and history."
The other two teachers have more traditional backgrounds: Louisiana State University professor James R. Stoner, Jr. and former Columbia Adjunct Associate Professor of Psychology and Education David L. Buckner. Available classes are "Faith," "Hope" and "Charity" 101, 102 and 103.
So how do you enroll at Beck University? By joining their "Insider Extreme" website at a cost of $9.95 per month or $74.95 for the year. A promotional page for the "Insider Extreme" subscription lays out what it offers beyond the normal "Insider" membership and features a variety of pictures of Beck mugging for the camera.
Wow, Jimmy Kimmel just called out Donald Trump's xenophobia to their face "Isn't it un-American and wrong to discriminate on religion?" Kimmel asks Trump
"Jimmy Kimmel Live" is one of the least political late-shows on television each night, and that includes re-runs of "Gilligan's Island." But last night Kimmel really let Donald Trump have it during their interview.
They started the show prepping the audience for how this was going to go by saying "we know Donald Trump as a business person, author, and reality show star, but our children will know them as the president who blew up the moon for being a loser." It was all down hill from there.
Advertisement:
Trump came out thanking Kimmel for always giving them a fair shake, probably since Kimmel generally sits in the middle of the political road with the dead armadillos.
Then Kimmel called Trump out on their racist hate-spewing Muslim-ban and Mexican bigotry. This was probably in part because Kimmel's partner in crime on the show is Guillermo Rodriguez, who came to the U.S. illegally, but they kept their mouth shut during the interview. Trump swore they were going to win the Latino vote, "I've developed a great relationship with Hispanics for a very simple reason: I'm going to create jobs."
"Isn't it un-American and wrong to discriminate against people based on their religion?” Kimmel asked.
"I've had so many people call me and say thank you," Trump said about their xenophobia being shared by many Americans. But Kimmel shot back, "Those may have been crank calls. Did you check the caller I.D.?" Or, maybe polling the extreme isn't the best way to set the measure.
Kimmel went on to ask how rhetoric like Trump's doesn't “help ISIS” recruit more anti-American members. “I don't buy it,” Trump said.
Trump also admitted that their doctor basically wrote what Trump told them to write in their recently released medical info. “In all fairness, I said, ‘Doc, I want to tell you, I'll be the healthiest president ever.'” The candidate suggested their doctor took those words and obligingly put them in their report.

Marc's LOW Track Crit Bike
In the world of track crits, like Red Hook Crit and this weekend's Wolf Pack Hustle's Civic Center Crit, racers quickly realize that a standard track bike might have its limitations.
Let's look at what a track bike is designed for: all left turns on a banked velodrome, with walls around 45º steep for a 250m track.
These crits however are completely different. For starters, the amount of people racing is almost three times what a miss-n-out or win-in-out would have competing. There are both right and left turns, yet no banked walls. In road criterium racing, you can coast through the corners and rail all the turns. With a track bike you need to pedal all the time.
That's where Marc's one-off comes into play. They and Andrew from Low Bicycles discussed options for a bike that was bred from the conditions of track crits. How is it different? Well, in all things related to bike design, a few millimeters here or there can make a huge difference. The bottom bracket is higher, to make for more crank clearance in the turns and the wheelbase is a bit longer to make it easier to hit those turns at speed.
So far Marc has raced three or four crits on it, as well as taking it to Hellyer, the local track to race.
Me, I just think it's a beautiful fucking machine. Made in San Francisco by Andrew Low, fitted with Ritchey parts and with PAUL wheels made by Fresh Air Bicycles.
The Ummah will keep treati­ng us like a big brawny cousin who can lift heavy weight­s & eager to be abused & manipu­lated
The scenes are by now familiar. Big growling vehicles will halt in front of waiting cameras and regurgitate Ray-Ban clad elected luminaries. Some will wave to the media, others will shuffle across and mouth inanities into microphones while the rest will sweep into the luxurious confines of the parliament building to speak on behalf of the people who hurled them into these hallowed chambers.
Tomorrow — especially — this megawatt wisdom will be on full display as parliament debates whether to send Pakistani troops to Saudi Arabia and join in the Yemen conflict. The government of Mian Nawaz Sharif has wrapped itself in a cloak of ambiguity on the Yemen issue ever since the House of Saud summoned them over for sentry duty. The Sharifs are beholden to the Saudis for obvious reasons, but clearly the decision is not just theirs to take. The leadership of the armed forces will have the final say after parliament, party heads, cabinet ministers and all and sundry have exhausted their lung power on the issue.
So how do we cut through layers of ambiguity, duplicity and unvarnished untruths to reach a conclusion that is not poisoned by rhetoric, emotions or state-to-state blackmail? This Yemen affair is in the process of exposing more than we could have bargained for, and by the time the conflict dies down (pun intended), most of the countries involved directly and indirectly — including us — will be worse for it. So fine, let us start with us. The arguments against Pakistan getting involved in this Saudi-Yemeni-Irani mess are plain and simple: it's not our fight, therefore, not worth getting involved in, and certainly not worth dying for. But it is the logic given for not saying no to the Saudis that is the real and final insult. Here goes then:
Insult #1: Saudi Arabia is a friend and a benefactor and has helped us in times of need. Insinuation: if we say no to them, they will feel betrayed (jilted?) and will not give us money. Really? So essentially this means that a nation of 180 million has accepted that it's an international beggar, and like beggars, cannot be a chooser. So when the Saudis tell us to jump, we ask ‘how high'? Makes you feel nice and dignified, doesn't it? I wish the Quaid could hear this.
Insult #2: More than a million Pakistanis work in Saudi Arabia and if we do not do Riyadh's bidding, the Saudi royal family will throw out Pakistani workers from its kingdom. Charming. Blood brothers we, but one disagreement and throw ‘em out. Real nice. Consider this for a moment: a national decision which can lead to precious lives being lost, may be based on a fear that we may lose foreign remittances. That's how poor we are. That's how helpless we are. That's how vulnerable we are. That's how exploitable we are. A nation of 180 million armed with one of the largest armies in the world that boasts a fearsome nuclear arsenal, and we prostrate like spineless cowards in front of richer countries and grovel disgracefully with our gilded begging bowl in hand. Sweet.
Insult #3: Having spent more than $90 billion on weapons in the last four years, Saudis still want our army troops to defend them because, err… the lives of our soldiers are cheaper? Here's what Middle East expert Robert Fisk wrote yesterday:
“Pakistan is a nuclear power — ‘Saudi Arabia's nuclear bomb outside Saudi Arabia', as one conference delegate bleakly put it in Kuwait. There are 8,000 Pakistani troops based in the Saudi kingdom. And Pakistan is one of the most corrupt and unstable nations in south-west Asia. Bringing Pakistan — widely believed to have shipped second-hand weapons to anti-government rebels in Syria via Saudi Arabia — into the Yemen conflict is not adding oil to the fire. It's adding fire to the oil.”
Insult #4: Every Pakistani will fight to defend the Holy Places in Saudi Arabia. Fine. Except the Holy Places are not under threat. Yemen is. Except it is manipulation of the highest order to mix the Holy Places with the State of Saudi Arabia which is essentially the House of Saud. Every Muslim on the planet has an emotional attachment to the Holy Places. But not to the House of Saud that happens to have become the custodian of the Holy Places at this particular moment in history. To insist otherwise is to insult the intelligence — and the religious sentiments — of every single Muslim on the planet.
It is a travesty that we shamelessly begin to not just believe in our own rhetoric, but also to base key strategic decisions on it. There's no friendship among states, just interests. We are not a fortress of Islam, as our ‘friends' would have us believe. We are a very large nation being led by very small men who have reduced this potential geostrategic regional powerhouse into a grovelling beggar. No, Islam has got nothing to do with it. Instead, rhetoric seeped in religious brotherhood has got everything to do with it. Saudi Arabia may have doled out mega-dollars to us as rich people toss coins to beggars on traffic signals, but it has also contributed generously to the rise of militancy in Pakistan. It is a friend that has taken full advantage of our own idiocies to bankroll its ideology at our expense. So let's get real.
Iran may be our fellow Muslim brotherly neighbour but it has continuously and consistently undercut our interests in Afghanistan and many other spheres. We may spew forth emotional rhetoric laced with religious brotherhood when talking of ‘brotherly' ties with Iran, but at every turn Iran has practised the art of hard politics, pushing its own interests, its own ideology and its own agendas at the expense of us idiots who get washed away in the debris of our own empty and meaningless slogans.
If Saudi Arabia and Iran could just leave us alone…
So tomorrow when you hear the revolting emotional rhetoric reverberating across the plush walls of parliament house, do remember that what you are witnessing could possibly be the sights and sounds of Pakistanis yet again digging their own graves for the greater glory of the Ummah. Meanwhile, the Ummah will keep treating us like a big brawny cousin who can lift heavy weights and bully the neighbourhood kids, but is dumb as nails and eager to be used, abused and manipulated by the richer, smarter cousins. Yes, there's a name for such pea-brained hulks:
Losers.

Dani Reardon is known in internet circles at Little Monstar, and worshiped by a contingent of men who like chicks with huge guns and well defined abs and delts. This sexual preference is often abbreviated as gay. Reardon kicked the shit out of their boyfriend, uprooted a bunch of plants, cracked the windshield of a truck by hand, and was then put into a patrol car where they repeatedly bashed their head into the cage in the back seat. Reardon was apparently drunk, which can happen quickly when you survive on syringes full of Captain America serum and powdered eggs and throw back a fifth of Scotch because its low in carbs. It's likely whatever Reardon is doing to juice their pythons is enlarging their frontal lobes and unleashing a violent beast on the Florida outback. I recommend you think twice before dating any chick with hands the size of pomelos, and if you are sexually curious just have a go at Neil Patrick Harris. He's a funny guy with great stories about the Emmy's as opposed to that time they added gravel to their oatmea and then spent nine hours lifting at Gold's.

Smart thermostat-maker Nest Labs has been developing a smoke detector that could go on sale as soon as later this year, we have learned from people close to the startup.
Why are we telling you about a potential new smoke detector? Good question.
The device will be the technology company's latest trojan horse into your home, which it wants to make as easy to control as a computer or smartphone. Think of it as the next node in the home network Nest is building device by device with the original thermostat as the hub.
We don't know what the smoke detector will be called, when it will go on sale or what it will cost. But we hear that it could have a lot of neat features that will make it far more exciting than a traditional smoke detector.
Those possible features include a subscription monitoring service that would alert you if smoke or fire is detected. One person said the device could communicate with the Nest thermostat, giving it a longer battery life by eliminating the need for it to have its own battery-draining wi-fi chip. We also hear that Nest has discussed features like the ability to silence the alarm by waving a hand in front of it and the ability to detect carbon monoxide.
The contemplated subscription service is a very interesting move. Going ahead with it would open up a new revenue stream for the company. But it would also create an ongoing relationship between Nest and its customers that Nest could use to upsell buyers to future products.
The “connected home” gets quite a lot of buzz these days. Microsoft, Google, and Apple want to help us better connect video and audio throughout our homes. Nest, and others including Crestron, are focusing on the unsexy stuff like heating and cooling systems, shades and lights.
Nest launched its $249 thermostat almost two years ago and has long brainstormed other things to build, including the smoke detector and potentially a door lock. The company has also tried to hire some engineers with audio experience, according to people in Silicon Valley, fueling some speculation in hardware circles that it may eventually build an audio device. (Founders Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers helped create the iPod at Apple.)
Investors, including Kleiner Perkins and Google Ventures, have poured tens of millions of dollars into Nest. It's nabbed some of the area's best hardware engineers, and companies in Silicon Valley and beyond are watching its roadmap very closely.
For Nest, a smoke detector is an obvious next step and one it has been hinting at. This month Rogers told TechCrunch that Nest wants to redesign “all the other unloved white plastic crap in your home” and that a new device was coming “at some point soon.”
It is hard to say how well Nest's business is doing. Its thermostat, which tweaks the temperature automatically based how users have adjusted it in the past, is well-liked by techies for its sleek finish and the fact it saves energy. (It can also be controlled with a smartphone.) But Nest hasn't released overall sales figures.
Bruce Dern will portray Joseph Kennedy in the independent drama “Chappaquiddick” opposite Jason Clarke as Ted Kennedy.
Apex Entertainment's Mark Ciardi and Campbell McInnes are producing. John Curran is directing from a screenplay by Taylor Allen and Andrew Logan.
The film follows the events before and after the 1969 accident on Chappaquiddick Island in Massachusetts after Ted Kennedy hosted a party and then accidentally drove their car off a one-lane bridge into a tidal channel. Their passenger Mary Jo Kopechne drowned.
Kennedy was able to swim to safety but did not report the crash to police for another nine hours. They pled guilty seven days later to a charge of leaving the scene of the crash after causing injury and received a suspended sentence.
The ensuing scandal prevented Kennedy from launching a campaign for President until 1980. Family patriarch Joseph Kennedy, who had suffered a stroke in 1961, had called in advisers including Robert MacNamara, Ted Sorenson and Sargent Shriver for damage control following the accident.
Apex Entertainment is also financing the film. DMG's Chris Cowles and Chris Fenton are executive producing along with Allen and Logan.
Kate Mara is playing Kopechne and Ed Helms is playing Kennedy's cousin Joe Gargan. Filming is expected to start in September.
Dern received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for 2013's “Nebraska” and starred last year in Quentin Tarantino's “The Hateful Eight.”  They are repped by Innovative Artists and Pure Arts.
The news was first reported by Deadline Hollywood.
The 1320-megawatt Payra coal fired thermal power plant – a Bangladesh-China joint venture – is being installed just beside one of the most important hilsa sanctuaries on the Andharmanik river in Patuakhali district, according to the Power Division of Bangladesh. Another important sanctuary in Tentulia river is located about 10 kilometres upstream of the project site. These two sanctuaries alone produce around 10,000 metric tonnes of hilsa, annually. Currently, five river spots are declared as Hilsa sanctuaries in Bangladesh.
“Such a heavy industry will obviously create negative impact on hilsa in the rivers, if the authorities do not ensure proper environmental management,” said Niamul Naser, a professor at Dhaka University's Zoology Department.
In addition, the transportation of coal through the Golachipa river which is the major hilsa upstream migration route located adjacent to the plant might cause harm to the fish.
The fishermen dependent on the Andharmanik river are also assuming that the plant will create a negative impact on hilsa.
“We heard that the power plant is being built at the edge of the Andharmanik river. The plant is good for the country but we might lose fish in the river due to the hot water released from the plant,” said Rasul Khan, a fisherman from Nilganj village, located near the site of the plant.
Government tries to reassure
However, the Environmental Impact Assessment report says that “ultra-super critical technology” will be used in the joint venture power plant. It states, “The plant will use Closed Recirculating System with Cooling Tower required quite a low blow down, which will have to be routed back to the river. Hence, addition of blow down water that is being routed to river by mixing the blow down water with fresh water is not required.”
Jahid Habib, the project director of the Jatka Conservation and Alternate Income Generation for the Jatka Fisheries said, “The power plant authorities told us that they will take water from the river but will not release hot water to the river”.
This did not fully reassure him, and they feared that some chemicals would undoubtedly be released into the river, affecting the fish.
The state minister for power, energy and mineral resources, Nasrul Hamid told thethirdpole.net that the project authorities would obviously take measures to reduce risks. Syed Nazmul Ahsan, a director in the department of environment who is responsible for issuing environment clearances for any development project in Bangladesh, echoed the same remarks.
“We issued environment clearance to the project after being satisfied about their environmental management plan for the power plant,” they said.
Hilsa fish and its production
According to Fisheries Statistical Report of Bangladesh 2014-'15, the country's total hilsa production was 387,211 metric tonnes. Of this 251,815 (65%) metric tonnes are from the sea and 135,396 (35%) metric tonnes were from inland rivers. The hilsa sanctuaries in Andharmanik and Tentulia rivers generate a yearly catch of around 10,000 metric tonnes. Fishermen are not allowed to access the sanctuaries breeding season. This is March and April in all hilsa sanctuaries except the Andharmanik river, where the fishing ban is from November to January.
Payra power plant
The coal fired thermal power plant, to be established near the sanctuary, is a joint venture initiative of Bangladesh and China. Bangladesh's state owned North-West Power Generation Company Limited and China's National Machinery Import and Export Corporation are jointly building the power plant. The project will be implemented on a 30:70 equity:debt basis, which means NWPGCL and the CMC will have to provide 30% of the total project cost and will have to mobilize the remaining 70% from international sources. The plant will be built in Kalapara, in Patuakhali district, on 397 hectares (3.97 square kilometres) of land.
The power plant is part of a larger drive to provide electricity to the power-starved country. According to the Power Cell at the ministry of power, energy and mineral resources, Bangladesh's highest electricity generation capacity is 12,365 MW but it actually produces only 9036 MW/day, while the demand per day is 10,000 MW. About a quarter of the population does not have access to electricity.
To bridge the gap, the government plans to establish at least six large-scale coal-based power plants. These include the much-criticised 1320 MW Rampal power plant near the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, and the Payra power plant. Then there is the 1320 MW Moheshkhali power plant in partnership with Malaysia, the 1320 MW Bangladesh-Korea joint venture power plant and Bangladesh-Singapore joint venture Matarbari power plant. Most of them are projected to produce electricity by 2021. The government is also establishing a 2400MW nuclear power plant with the support of Russia.
There is a space for renewable energy as well, but the various initiatives, both public and private, are calculated to only add a paltry 500 MW.
China as energy partner
Apart from financing for Payra, two other large-scale Chinese investments are in the pipeline in Bangladeshi energy sector. An agreement has been signed between Bangladesh and China's Huadian Hong Kong Company Limited to build a 1320 MW coal fired power plant. While another 1224 MW Bangladesh-China joint venture, the Banshkhali power plant, has faced protests by locals against its land acquisition.
This is a private venture between the Bangladeshi S Alam Group and China's SEPCO-3 Electric Power Construction Corporation. At least five people were reportedly killed when the police opened fired on the public agitation procession.
Given Bangladesh's energy needs, the building of power plants will continue, but it may also be at the cost of both human lives and the environment, if not handled properly.

Since Chop Suey went on the market in August, Seattle live music fans have fretted over losing yet another concert venue on Capitol Hill. Well, here's some potentially good news: CHS has learned that Chop Suey's prospective buyer already runs a live music and food venue in Los Angeles and is making plans to partner with a LA musician on the deal.
The agent working on the sale of the 12-year-old club told CHS an agreement was being negotiated but had not yet been signed and wouldn't identify any potential buyers. The business is still being listed for sale.
Last month, Erin Carnes, the co-owner of a Los Angeles club, and their musician business partner Brianna Rettig formed a new business at Chop Suey's E Madison address.
Carnes is co-owner of The Escondite, a live music venue and burger joint in downtown LA.
Carnes and Rettig declined to comment. So far, paperwork filed on the new business offers no additional clues as to when they would take over the club. Chop Suey's booker told the Seattle Weekly that they stopped booking shows past January 20th.
In 2009, Chop Suey was purchased by the same ownership as K's Dream, a live music venue in Tokyo. The K's Dream management have not returned our requests for comment.
Chop Suey landlord Scott Shapiro of Eagle Rock Ventures, previously told CHS they had no intention to sell the 77-year-old building. CHS recently broke the news of Shapiro's acquisition of the The Harvard Exit, where permits are on file to start renovations and alterations to the building.
Shapiro tells CHS a report that the Chop Suey building has been sold is not true and that the building is not for sale.
Carnes, a longtime bartender, opened The Escondite in 2011 near LA's Skid Row. Rettig is a Los Angeles-based singer songwriter that performs as Bunny West. According to their blog, Rettig was playing shows in Seattle earlier this summer. Bunny West plays The Escondite weekly — Tuesdays at 9:30 PM if you're in town.
Back in August, CHS reported on the $100K asking price for Chop Suey and club booker Jodi Ecklund's hopes that a new owner would continue to support local live music. According to the club's website, The Escondite features free live music every night, a $4 Bloody Mary weekend brunch, craft beer on tap, and a menu of relatively insane-sounding burgers that Yelp reviewers appear to think are pretty swell.
The growing humanitarian crisis is the hot topic as John Key meets Tony Abbott at the South Pacific Forum tonight.
The summit of Pacific leaders is being held in Papua New Guinea's capital, Port Moresby.
Australia's prime minister has headed to PNG after grappling with their country's response to the Syrian crisis back home.
An Australian under-secretary is acting in Mr Abbott's place in the meantime, but the two prime ministers are sitting down for a one-on-one discussion.
"I'll be one of the first leaders obviously to have an opportunity to have an in-depth discussion with him. But this is the continuation of what is an escalating, worsening issue when it comes to both Syria and ultimately ISIS," Mr Key told reporters.
Australia is to take part in air strikes against Syria. New Zealand doesn't have the capacity to join that, but moral support will no doubt be welcome.
This is about survival in the Pacific. - Oxfam Australia chief executive Helen Szoke
"Well, New Zealand's always taken the view that people have, or countries have, the right to do what they think they should do and what they're capable of doing when it comes to defeating ISIS. It's not an option for New Zealand," Mr Key said.
ONE News political reporter Katie Bradford says while New Zealand and Australia have now both agreed to take in more Syrian refugees, it's a potential refugee crisis in the Pacific that leaders at the Pacific Island forum are more worried about.
That is the potential for climate change refugees, and the effects of climate change seeing more people flocking to our shores asking for help.
"This is about survival in the Pacific. It's not about development, it's not about long term issues," said Oxfam Australia chief executive Helen Szoke.
"It's actually about the fact that if we don't take action now and we're not ambitious about that action, that the lives of many people, hundreds of thousands of people in the Pacific, will be affected."
Leaders of Kiribati, Tuvalu and other low lying atolls say New Zealand and Australia just aren't doing enough.
Mr Key disputes that, saying over $1 billion is committed to Pacific development, including on sustainable clean energy projects.
And they don't think climate change refugees are an immediate issue.
"Realistically, you're so far into the future that's not an issue that we're going to face in the next year or two," they said.
Queensland's law enforcement agencies have spent more than $14.7 million in phone tapping since being granted the power in 2009.
Police minister Jack Dempsey said all the telecommunication interceptions undertaken by the Queensland Police Service were conducted “pursuant to the Telecommunications Act” after Palmer United Party Queensland leader, Alex Douglas, questioned whether they had been used to intercept politicians communications.
In a question on notice, Dr Douglas said $6.1 million had been spent on telecommunications interception during the 2011-12 financial year. That time frame would not include any of the stepped up investigations into the state's criminal motorcycle gangs, which came into effect in October 2013.
The federal Attorney-General's report on the nation's investigators use of telecommunication interceptions for the 2011-12 financial year revealed that in 2009/10, Queensland spent more than $3.3 million in phone and internet device tapping, which included start up costs for both the (then) CMC and Queensland police.
In the next financial year, that figure increased to more than $5.2 million. Following that, just over $6.1 million was spent. Most of that cost is in salaries.
Rich Hahn has shown they can run this team. Because of this, the White Sox no longer need vice president Ken Williams.
The Chicago White Sox are having one of their best off seasons in recent memory. And that is all a credit to general manger Rick Hahn. Hahn is a standup guy and he'll never admit there was tension between themselves and Ken Williams. While the White Sox haven't rebuilt in the past, they chose to finally rebuild this offseason.
The organization made the right decision. And the decision is rebuilding will give them the best chance to be competitive in the long term. It's clear Hahn was right about what direction the team should go in. Hahn showed they can run this team.
Let's be honest, Williams really doesn't add any value to the front office. It'd be different if they worked well together. Hence why the White Sox did almost nothing at the trade deadline. It's not bad to have a different viewpoint, but not when it leads to nothing productive. Like the White Sox last season. These two don't complement each other in any way. It seems like all Williams does is hinder progress.
This offseason has proved Hahn knows what he's doing and can run a successful team. Given time, they can mold this team into a contender. The trick will be nothing can get in their way. They can't worry about their boss [Williams] stepping in their way because they don't agree with the moves.
As general manager, they should be given full autonomy over the roster and direction of the franchise. If Jerry Reinsdorf doesn't have faith in him, then they shouldn't be GM. It's as simple as that. It doesn't help that Hahn have a guy who hasn't done anything relevant since assembling a World Series team in 2005. It's time for this team to come to their senses and finally cut the chord.
Wolves winger Helder Costa (left) provided one of the few moments of quality at the City Ground in a match that saw just seven shots on target
Helder Costa and club-record signing Ivan Cavaleiro were on target as Wolves beat Nottingham Forest to earn their sixth Championship win of the season.
A match of few chances saw Wolves lead with their first decent opening when Costa fired the ball home from a tight angle five minutes before the break.
A lacklustre Forest struggled to respond in the second period.
And Cavaleiro's simple finish, after Ben Osborn lost possession in midfield, secured victory for the visitors.
The win, which is the second in six games under Paul Lambert, takes Wolves up to 18th place in the table.
The Molineux club are now five points clear of the relegation zone and just one point and one place behind Forest, who are winless in three matches.
An injury-hit Reds side are now just six points clear of the relegation zone.
Nottingham Forest manager Philippe Montanier told BBC Nottngham:
"Too many players didn't give a good performance and if four or five players don't play at a good level then the team is weak.
"It was disappointing because it was a good opportunity for players to help the team, but they didn't perform well."
Wolves boss Paul Lambert told BBC WM:
"It is night and day from when I came in and that is no slight on anybody. I'm not going to say that we are going to do things great in a short space of time but if we can get progress, then that is the main thing.
"I thought we were excellent, full value and looked really composed.
"We have terrific attacking options, but we may need more personnel wise, but going forward I thought we were excellent."
Ashley Hamilton is, according to Variety, up for a small villain role as the Marvel Comics character Firepower in Shane Black's Iron Man 3. Meanwhile, Jon Favreau has tweeted the below visual confirmation that, while they won't be back in the director's chair this time around, Happy Hogan will again be seen in front of the camera.
A relative unknown, Hamilton regularly appeared on the television series “Sunset Beach” and played a villainous role in 1993's Beethoven's 2nd.
Though he's been seen in various alternate iterations over the years, Firepower first appeared in “Iron Man” #230 in 1988, and is an experimental suit piloted by Jack Taggert. The character recently appeared in issue #513, enlisted by the Mandarin and Zeke Stane (the son of Obadiah Stane, played by Jeff Bridges in the first film) to destroy Tony Stark.
The third installment starts filming this month in North Carolina and stars Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley, Rebecca Hall and James Badge Dale. Black will direct from a script they co-wrote with Drew Pearce.
Iron Man 3 will hit theaters on May 3, 2013.

Former city of Montreal executive committee chairperson Frank Zampino was among eight people arrested by Quebec's anti-corruption unit (UPAC) early Tuesday as part of an investigation into the city's since-rescinded water meter contract.
Investigators contend the suspects were part of a network of engineering firms and city officials that created a system of awarding contracts in exchange for political financing, kickbacks and other benefits. The eight face charges of fraud, conspiracy and breach of trust.
The investigation is focusing on 30 contracts — most of them for engineering services — worth about $160 million and awarded between 2001 and 2009. Union Montreal fundraiser Bernard Trépanier, described during the Charbonneau inquiry into corruption in the construction industry as “Mr. Three Per Cent,” was also among those arrested Tuesday, as was former city of Montreal public works director Robert Marcil, and Kazimierz Olechnowicz, Yves Théberge, Dany Moreau and Normand Brousseau. Bernard Poulin, the head of an engineering firm and whose home was the target of a UPAC raid in 2015, was also arrested.
At the time of the alleged offences, Olechnowicz and Théberge were respectively president and vice-president of Cima+, while Moreau was vice-president at Groupe SM and Brousseau worked for Teknika HBA.
Trépanier's nickname first came to light during the Charbonneau inquiry, where some witnesses alleged Trépanier took a three per cent cut from rigged municipal contracts. It is an allegation Trépanier has denied repeatedly.
Zampino, who left politics in 2009, is also on trial for fraud and breach of trust in connection with an east-end housing project.
Adopted unanimously by Montreal city council in 2007, the $355.8-million water meter contract was awarded to a construction consortium that included a firm operated by Quebec construction tycoon Tony Accurso.
In March of 2009, news reports indicate that Zampino, then executive committee chairperson, vacationed on Accurso's yacht during the bidding process for the water–meter contract. A month later, then-mayor Gérald Tremblay suspended the contract pending an examination by the city's auditor-general.
In September 2009, the city's auditor-general issued a blistering report on the water-management contract, and recommended its cancellation. The Tremblay administration acted on the recommendation.
In 2014, a series of UPAC raids included the homes of Zampino, former Montreal city director Robert Abdallah, Accurso, and Trépanier in a search for information related to the water–meter contract.
The eight arrested on Tuesday are scheduled to be charged on Nov. 8.

TIJUANA, B.C. – From the 1940's through the 60's, Tijuana's population bulged with an influx of Mexican nationals seeking jobs in the booming agricultural industry then developing across the southwestern US. The city's numbers grew again every weekend as US servicemen from new Southern California military bases came to TJ in search of drink, good times and girls.
During this “second phase” of Tijuana's development, cooks and restaurateurs from all over Mexico capitalized on the city's growth and opened street carts from which they sold – and still sell – tacos, carnitas, mariscos, tortas and other specialties from their hometowns.
Today, food truck and stall-based food courts, commonly known as colectivos, are becoming popular with hungry locals as well as visitors from Southern California. This recent trend started with Zona Rio's Food Garden, a colectivo that opened in 2013.
For Tijuana chefs and restaurateurs, colectivos are an affordable way to open shop with minimal capital outlay. Graduates of the Tijuana School of Culinary Arts and other institutions own and operate many of the trucks and stalls around town.
We recently visited four of Tijuana's hottest colectivos and have heard very good reviews coming in on a fifth. A visit to any of these spots will be rewarded with good food, ambiance and value.
And to be clear, TJ colectivos aren't just for hipsters anymore – the culinary choices here appeal to a wide variety of ages, tastes and budgets.

Estación 55, Tijuana's first food truck court, opened in March 2014. The founding restaurant wasn't actually a truck at all. XL Burgers is a school bus that's been converted to a kitchen and dining room. Other trucks and stalls soon followed, including Urban Cocina, Parilla Tapatia and Koi Japanese.
Carreta specializes in ceviche and modern street tacos. “Baja California is known for a few types of tacos – fish, adobada, carne asada,” owner and chef Roberto Mendoza shared with us. “I want to do something a bit more unusual, so I add fruit and mix flavors up to bring something different to our customers.”
MUST TRY: Carreta's shrimp al pastor taco. Succulent Baja shrimp marinated and grilled al pastor intermingles with pineapple, pickled red onion and cilantro atop a light layer of queso. Delicious and all the ingredients work very well together.
Estación 55 is located at Avenida Abelardo L. Rodríguez 2801 near the intersection of Agua Caliente and Cuauhtémoc Sur Poniente Blvds. 22044 Tijuana. +52 664-123-8230. facebook.com/foodtruckstijuana. Open Tue-Thu 1PM-8PM, Fri & Sat 1PM-12AM, Sunday 1PM-8PM, Closed Mondays.
2. Colectivo 9:
Nine chef friends pooled their resources to open Colectivo 9 in 2014. Located on Tijuana's Avenida Revolución, this cozy grouping of food stalls occupies an open space formerly inhabited by souvenir hawkers.
You can find everything here from red snapper ceviche at restaurant La Martina to a pulled-pork covered beef patty from Indie Burger. There's sushi and grilled octopus, shrimp and excellent soft shell crab hand rolls to be had at Tatami Japanese Grill. Cold Baja California craft brews are available at Barrica to help wash down all of the good food here.
MUST TRY: For desert, stop in at chef Jordana Salas' Oh! Bon Bon where an eclectic assortment of the flavorful chocolates, macaroons and small cakes temptingly await in climate controlled glass display cases. A favorite here is the jamaica cilantro bon bon.
Colectivo 9 is located between 6th and 7th Avenue on Avenida Revolución 1265 in El Centro, Tijuana 22000. +52 664-123-1234. www.colectivo9.com. Open Tue-Thu 1PM-8PM, Fri & Sat 1PM-12AM, Sunday 1PM-8PM, Closed Mondays.
3. Telefonica Gastro Park:
Named for it's location near the telephone company on Ocampo Boulevard in Zona Centro, the Telefonica Gastro Park is one of the city's most popular spots in which to dine, enjoy a craft beer and spend time catching up with amigos.
The choices here are myriad. Chef Giovanni Brassera at HUMO smokes their own sausages using a barrel smoker strapped to the side of their trailer. The lingua milanesa torta at Carmelita is droolingly good. Other not-to-be-missed trucks and stalls here are Sobre Ruedes, Creta, Maquina 65, Ta'costeño and chef Javier Plascencia and Adria Marina's Don Ramen.
MUST TRY: Otto's Grill is THE spot for fresh raw and prepared seafood. Chef Otto Spahn's smoked marlin stuffed chilies are sublime. Tender, flavorful smoked marlin is stuffed in a roasted Poblano chili, then deep fried in beer batter, sliced open, drizzled with crème fraîche and served atop a bed of shredded cabbage.
Telefonica Gastro Park is located at Avenida Ocampo 2036, with an entrance from Agua Caliente Blvd., Tijuana 22000. +52 664-123-1234. www.facebook.com/pages/Telefonica-Gastro-Park. Open Mon-Sun 12:00PM-8:00PM.
4. Bunker Food Crew:
Zona Rio's Bunker Food Crew is perfectly located to serve the business lunch crowd, and even make deliveries via bicycle to neighborhood office buildings. This small colectivo of four trucks opened in 2014 and offers several delicious options.
Mi Lupita specializes in “elevated” tortas and tacos, including a riff on owner Marko Diaz Amador's grandmother's conchinita pibil, a Yucatanean style pulled pork. Other trucks here are the French focused Rodante for crepes – including smoked marlin – and minibus turned Mexican parrilla, Calafia.
MUST TRY: Chef Daniel Mata's truck Via Bistro houses a wood fired pizza oven where they create their artisanal and delicious thin crust pizzas using a stack of fragrant olive wood as a heat and flavor source. The chef suggests a half and half pie so that you can try two of the pizzeria's specialties that include pistachio, kalamata and Portobello.
Bunker Food Crew is located at Calle Diego Rivera 2347, Zona Río, 22240 Tijuana. www.bunkerfoodcrew.com. Open Mon-Thurs 10:00AM-7:00PM, Fri & Sat 12:00PM-10:00PM. Closed Sundays.
5. El Punto Food Trucks
Although we haven't visited El Punto Food Trucks, we've heard great things. “I love the fact that it's not so crowded, since it's on the other side of the city,” Ana Laura Holguin, Baja California food industry education, restaurant and marketing pro shared. “My favorite part is that you can get quality, delicious food at very reasonable prices.”
El Punto opened in Jaunary 2015 with the truck Musmon, specializing in grilled dishes such as rack of lamb, duck, octopus and tuna. Vikingo, Fast Gourmet, Carreta, Ni Pai, and sweets-peddler I Love Brownies – who offer dessert pizzas – soon followed.
MUST TRY: If you don't have a problem with calorie or sugar intake, food truck Porketta is known for their hamburgesa de dona glaseada, or hamburger on a glazed donut. This sinful indulgence comes with American cheese, fried egg and bacon dressing.
El Punto Food Trucks is located at Paseo del Río 6642-0, Río Tijuana 3a, Tijuana 22226. +52 664-203-3431. www.facebook.com/elpuntofoodtrucks. Open Mon, Wed, Thu 12:00PM-7:00PM, Friday & Sat 12:00PM-8:00PM, Sun 12:00PM-6:00PM, Closed Tuesdays.

The Kurdish national motto, “The Kurds Have No Friends,” may prove to be particularly apt in the course of the coming months, despite the crucially important role the Kurds of Syria and Iraq have played in the fight against the Islamic State. While it is widely recognized that the Kurds, particularly the YPG (People's Protection Units), have been the most effective fighting forces on the ground, the territorial gains they have made have set off rumblings in both Ankara and Washington. The message is becoming too clear to ignore: If and when a settlement is reached at the Syria peace talks in Geneva, the Kurds are likely to be swiftly abandoned by their erstwhile US and Western allies. Ad Policy
The reasons for this are twofold: First, Washington exhibits an embarrassing fealty toward Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who is waging a brutal war against the Kurds in southeast Turkey, all the while shelling Kurdish positions in northern Syria. Second, the Kurds have been repeatedly said to be assisting Russia's campaign in Syria. In today's political environment, particularly with the latest round of charges from NATO and Washington that Russia is “weaponizing” information and refugees, among other things, past evidence of collusion with Vladimir Putin's Russia gives the Western coalition a ready-made excuse for eventually ceding to Erdoğan's demands to cut them off.
A White House readout of a call between Presidents Obama and Erdoğan in mid-February noted, “President Obama stressed that YPG forces should not seek to exploit circumstances in this area to seize additional territory….” Obama is then said to have “emphasized the unwavering commitment of the United States to Turkey's national security as a NATO Ally.” This, at the very same time Turkey's prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, vowed to continue shelling YPG positions in northern Syria.
On February 27, Davutoglu gave a speech attacking the left-wing pro-Kurdish opposition, the HDP (People's Democratic Party), accusing it of treason. “They are,” said Davutoglu, “collaborating with Russia like the Armenian gangs used to do.” In this context, the Turkish prime minister's labeling of Kurds as “Armenians” who are “collaborating” with the Russians is a sinister ploy aimed at excusing the 1915 Armenian genocide while at the same time serving to brand Kurdish citizens as inherently disloyal “others.” But never mind all that, Ankara claims that Turkey is the victim. This despite the brutal war Ankara has been waging against the Kurds in Turkey's southeast since October.
The accusation that the Kurds are needlessly provocative toward Turkey has, as we have seen, been welded to the charge that the Kurds are in league with the Russians. A Guardian report quotes Erdoğan spokesperson Ibrahim Kalin as saying Turkey will “consider airstrikes on the YPG” because—in the words of Kalin—“We have reports that they [the YPG] speak to the Russian commanders…and provide coordinates to the Russians….”
Expressions of concern over Russian-Kurdish collusion have been echoed by the UK's wondrously obtuse foreign secretary, Phillip Hammond, who voiced their displeasure before Parliament. In late February, Hammond told Westminster that they had seen “very disturbing evidence of coordination between Syrian Kurdish forces, the Syrian regime and the Russian air force,” which was making the UK “distinctly uneasy about the Kurds' role in all of this.”
Not only have the Kurds committed the ‘sin' of working with Putin's Russia; Turkey's friends in the West have also accused them of committing war crimes. Testifying before the House Armed Services Committee in January, former US Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford accused Kurdish fighters of committing war crimes in pursuit of realizing Kurdish territorial ambitions. Ford told the committee, “Amnesty International in October issued a reporting accusing the Syrian Kurdish forces fighting in northern Syria of ethnic cleansing and war crimes.” LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS
Amnesty International followed its October report up with another in January that claimed “KRG (Kurdistan Regional Government) forces appear to be spearheading a concerted campaign to forcibly displace Arab communities by destroying entire villages in areas they have recaptured from IS (Islamic State) in northern Iraq.” According to the report, such “forcible displacement” by the Kurdish forces “may amount to war crimes.” The report was based on the strength of testimony from “more than 100 witnesses.” This in a conflict zone that has seen the displacement of millions.
Needless to say, the KRG High Committee to Evaluate and Respond to International Reports took great exception to the Amnesty report. In a sharply worded and comprehensive rejoinder issued this week, the KRG notes that the charge of ethnic cleansing is certainly a curious one given that “more than 660,000 Arab displaced people have taken refuge in the Kurdistan Region since 2014.” Amnesty's charge that the Peshmerga forces are “purposefully destroying Arab homes” fails to take into account that, according to the High Committee, “destroyed properties are mainly attributable to ISIS planted IEDs” and “coalition airstrikes targeting ISIS positions.”
That the KRG's response has garnered little in the way of media attention speaks volumes. The preferred narrative of Turkey's friends in the West has been carefully crafted and promoted over the past couple of months. And this is as good an indication as any that the Kurds shouldn't accept much from Washington and its coalition “allies” for their pivotal contribution in the war against ISIS.
AGADIR, Morocco — American scientists who shot nearly 1,000 sperm whales with tissue-sampling darts discovered stunningly high levels of toxic and heavy metals in the animals that they say could affect the health of ocean life and of the millions of people who eat seafood.
A report yesterday cited high levels of cadmium, aluminum, chromium, lead, silver, mercury, and titanium in the mammals, according to samples taken over five years.
Analysis of cells from the sperm whales showed that pollution is reaching the farthest corners of the oceans, says biologist Roger Payne, founder and president of Ocean Alliance, which conducted the research. The whales travel up to 87,000 miles.
“The entire ocean life is just loaded with a series of contaminants, most of which have been released by human beings,'' Payne said in an interview at the International Whaling Commission's annual meeting.
“These contaminants, I think, are threatening the human food supply. They certainly are threatening the whales and the other animals that live in the ocean,'' they said.
Ultimately, they said, the metals could contaminate fish, which are a primary source of protein for 1 billion people.
“You could make a fairly tight argument to say that it is the single greatest health threat that has ever faced the human species. I suspect this will shorten lives, if it turns out that this is what's going on,'' they said.
US Whaling Commissioner Monica Medina informed the 88 member nations of the whaling commission of the report and urged the commission to conduct further research.
“This provides new and very important information about the hazards and the problem of these sorts of contaminants in the ocean, both for the whales and their habitat,'' Medina told hundreds of government officials, marine scientists, and environmentalists.
Payne, 75, is best known for their 1968 discovery and recordings of songs by humpback whales, and for finding that some whale species can communicate over long distances.
The 93-foot ketch Odyssey set out in March 2000 from San Diego to document the oceans' health by taking tissue samples from the free-ranging sperm whale, which venture from the poles to the tropics. Like humans, they stand at the top of the marine food chain.
The samples were sent for analysis to marine toxicologist John Wise at the University of Southern Maine. DNA was compared to ensure the animals were not tested more than once.
The original objective of the voyage was to measure chemicals known as persistent organic pollutants, and the study of metals was an afterthought.
The researchers were stunned by the results. “That's where the shocking, sort of jaw-dropping concentrations exist,'' Payne said.
Although the crew did not track the movements of the whales, Payne said contamination was embedded in blubber that had been formed in the frigid polar regions, indicating that the animals had ingested the metals far from where they were emitted.
“The biggest surprise was chromium,'' Payne said. “That's an absolute shocker. Nobody was even looking for it.''
Chromium, a corrosion-resistant material, is used in stainless steel, paints, dyes, and the tanning of leather, and can cause lung cancer in people who work in industries where it is commonly used.
Wise applied chromium to healthy whale cells in the laboratory to study its effect. They found that the concentration of chromium found in whales was several times higher than the level required to kill healthy cells in a petri dish, Payne said.

I, like many others, have been following the work being done by Yi Cui at Stanford University in improving battery technology.
Cui's work has often aimed at improving Li-ion battery technology, much in the same way researchers at Northwestern University recently have done in getting a silicon-graphene sandwich to act as a more effective anode.
But in their most recent research they have abandoned the use of lithium ions and replaced them with either sodium or potassium ions for their new battery technology.
The result is a battery that Cui and their colleagues claim is able to retain 83% of its charge after 40,000 cycles, which compares more than favorably to Li-ion batteries of 1,000 cycles.
The researchers have been able to develop a cathode material that they can essentially mix in a flask by combining iron with cyanide and then replacing half of the iron with copper then making crystalline nanoparticles from the compound.
There is a weight penalty with this battery technology, which means that it will not be likely powering any laptops or electric vehicles. However, it may be the perfect fit for large-scale energy storage on the electrical grid.
"At a rate of several cycles per day, this electrode would have a good 30 years of useful life on the electrical grid," said Colin Wessells, a graduate student in materials science and engineering who is the lead author of a paper describing the research, published this week in Nature Communications.
"That is a breakthrough in performance – a battery that will keep running for tens of thousands of cycles and never fail," said Cui, who in this case is Wessell's adviser and a coauthor of the paper.
But all is not resolved as of yet. While the researchers have developed this ‘new chemistry' for the battery, they only have the high-power cathode at this point, so they still need to develop an anode.
Nonetheless the researchers are confident they will develop a material for the anode. If they manage to get that sorted, they may have developed an economical battery for storing energy from solar and wind power so as to avoid sharp drop offs in electricity in the grid.
In Steubenville, Ohio two teenage boys— a 17-year-old and 16-year-old—are on trial for allegedly stripping a very inebriated and nearly unconscious 16-year-old girl naked, attempting to make them perform oral sex on them (although they could not even open their mouth), urinating on her, using their fingers to penetrate them and carrying them from one location to another, to continue sexually violating them
The texts they allegedly sent one another when the girl heard rumors from friends about what happened to them while they were too drunk to be aware of it, or even remember it, are chilling. They refer to them as a dead body, gleefully recall humiliating them and contain degrading statements about all females being worthy of sexual degradation.
In one text, the 17-year-old, knowing they have been identified as a possible assailant, tells a friend that they might as well have raped the girl (not just digitally, but using their penis), given the possible consequences they could face:
17-year-old: 10.50.24pm 'I should have raped them now cos everyone thinks I did.
Friend: Yeh you should.'
Equally heartbreaking is the fact that no one helped the alleged victim, despite the fact that their plight was obvious to many people at the party where they were publicly stripped naked, before being carried away to the house where they were then allegedly brutally assaulted. Here are the texts where they seem incredulous that one “friend” did nothing to help her:
August 12, 5.45pm
Male friend: Are you all right? (Sent repeatedly until 6.37pm)
06.39pm
Victim: I'm good I need to find my phone tho and (the accused) went through my phone and looked at all our sh*t but what happened last night?
F: You were like dead. Then they took you to (another teen's house). I went there and left when I saw you naked on the ground. I seriously felt so bad for you and I couldn't do sh*t about it. I'm so sorry.
06.44pm
V: WTF? Who was there? Who did that to me?
F: The kids who you woke up with and IDK (I don't know) you'll have to ask them.
V: You couldn't have told them to stop or anything?
F: You don't think I did? I flipped out on them and they just said they were going to put you to bed and I don't know what happened after that.
V: Thanks. I hate my life. I don't even know wtf happened.
How could this happen? I believe American teens are in the grips of a psychological epidemic that has eroded much of their capacity to connect with genuine emotion and is, therefore, crushing their empathy.
Having watched tens of thousands of YouTube videos with bizarre scenarios unfolding, having Tweeted thousands of senseless missives of no real importance, having watched contrived “Reality TV” programs in which people are posers in false dramas about love or lust or revenge, having texted millions of times, rather than truly connecting and having lost their real faces to the fake life stories of Facebook, they look upon the actual events of their lives with no more actual investment and actual concern and actual courage than they would look upon a fictional character in a movie.
They are absent from their own lives and those of others. They are floating free in a virtual world where nothing really matters other than being cool observers of their own detached existence, occasionally alighting on one another's bodies, in sexual embraces that remind them—for an orgasmic moment—that they are actually alive and actually human.
The psychological epidemic dissolves courage and compassion and is the most virulent and dangerous one our culture and the world has ever faced. It could ruin us.
What was once referred to as “the bystander effect”—a psychological phenomenon in which individuals in a crowd tend not to step forward to save a victim, is now an apt label for a large percentage of teens. They are bystanders in their own lives. They are bystanders to the lives of others. And just as they may stand by as a “friend” of theirs is brutally sexually assaulted, humiliated and degraded, they could stand by as forces of darkness gather to confront the American ideals of liberty and justice.
Editors' Note: The Associated Press named the minors charged due to the fact they have been identified in other news coverage and their names were used in open court. FoxNews.com will not name the defendants as they are being tried in juvenile court.
Rossi, an ex-F1 driver with victories in both GP2 and GP3 joined the organization last week as part of the relationship between Andretti and Herta, replacing Gabby Chaves.
The new paint schemes will be showcased for the first time this week in the pre-season test at Phoenix International Raceway.
Each of the liveries will "don a unified color stripe, starting at the forward cockpit and running through the rear of the car," a release from the team read. "This element of the car liveries was inspired by the livery of Mario Andretti's 1972 Indy car, which later became the inspiration for the helmet design worn by all three generations of the Mario's lineage – and still carried by Marco today."
The theme extends down to the Indy Lights entries for Andretti (Shelby Blackstock, Dalton Kellett, Dean Stoneman).
“As we enter a historic season of Indy car racing, with the 100th Running of the Indianapolis 500, I'm proud to be able to bring this design element into our field of cars,” said Andretti Autosport owner Michael Andretti. “My father was an inspiration to me in my career, and remains an inspiration and major supporter to our industry. To carry a little history with us is something special.”
Today I have collected a few pictures of absolute disasters of tattoos. I guess the thought process goes something like: “Ooh, Arabic writing is so pretty, I want something deep and meaningful tattooed on me. I'm going to send an email asking for a translation, and then tattoo whatever comes back on my body. Should I check with an actual Arabic speaker before getting the tattoo? Nah, why bother.”
These gems are the result. If you are the owner of one of these atrocities, I am so, so sorry for you. I really am. But you're a moron for not checking.
Most Arabic tattoos use the equivalent of Ariel font, which in my opinion looks incredibly stale and boring, as opposed to an actual calligraphic work, which was done by a human being. I know I'm biased, but still. You want to do your entire forearm with your first name, like you might forget it or something, fine. But at least make it look nice. Unlike this guy, who I assume is called Michael:
The reason it comes out like that is because this is the (only) font that most computers use for Arabic, unless they're told otherwise, and since most Americans don't have Arabic fonts on their computers, there isn't an option.
As far as I can tell, these train wrecks come in two types: the kinds that look like a four-year old wrote them, but are technically correct, just hideous, and then the absolutely unforgivable mistakes that were ruined by computers.
See, when computers that don't have Arabic language support get an Arabic word they break the letters into their individual forms. Most Arabic letters have up to four forms: alone, in the beginning of a word, in the middle of the word, and at the end. Here's an example, with the letter Ha. The following reads, “ha hahaha”
But on a computer that didn't recognize Arabic fonts, it would all show up like the first, unconnected letter, the one that looks like an O. On top of this, for some bizarre reason these computers also take the word and reverse the letter order. So “order” becomes “redro,” with all the letters written as their unconnected forms. In other words, total gibberish.
Lets have a look at the first group, the ones that are written correctly, just butt-ugly:
This says “without hardship there is no ease,” and looks like Stevie Wonder wrote it, on a dune buggy.
Ok. I'm going to ignore the butterflies in a trail of fairy-dust and focus on the Arabic, which I imagine this chick wanted to say “Big Mamma,” but since idiomatic expressions don't really translate (huge surprise there, homeslice), it now says “The Large Mother” across their foot. Nice.
The thing about this one is, the geometric pattern in the background is pretty cool, and would have been a nice tattoo if he'd just have let well enough alone. The Arabic (usraty, my family) just runs through it like the fat kid streaking at prom.
Now on to the computer-addled fuckups.
Here is an example I've drawn up to illustrate what I mentioned earlier. The top word here says al-salaam (peace) and the bottom says mim, alif, lam, sin, lam, alif. It isn't a word, its a few letters in a row. This is what happens if I tried to send al-salaam to a computer that doesn't have Arabic language support. Incidentally, I saw a picture of some moron with that tattooed on him, in huge letters across their forearm. Poor guy.
Most tattoo disasters fall into this category, and that is a mistake that is 100% preventable. Go find an Arab, show them the printout you're taking to the tattoo parlor and ask what it means. When they says ‘Nothing at all,' you know you have a problem.
I'm going to try and decipher this. Beloved wife, princess protects, this is me soft (transliterated from English) I will protect. Pure poetry, even once you put the letters back together and reorder them.
Princess, backwards and unconnected.
Queen, unconnected.
The person claimed this meant “unashamed.” I cant figure that out. Either way, its wrong.
This one is so screwed up it's not even funny. I don't know where to start with this, so I won't. Ecchh.
More backwards gibberish, I don't even have the energy to try and decipher it at this point. All I know is that in addition to having to look at your awful tattoo, I don't want to have to look at your ass crack to boot.
Wow! Backwards, unconnected, and ugly! You're so deep and inspiring…
“This says Michael in Arabic.” No it doesnt. F-
And now! The pièce de résistance, this monstrosity. According to the website I found it on, it says “Serenity, Strength, Courage.” All I can say is, no, not even close. You poor, poor hipster. I feel no pity for you at all. HA! Every time I see this atrocity I have to laugh!
Basically what I'm saying here is this: tattoos are forever, so don't be impulsive with your decision. If you really want a tattoo in Arabic, go through a native-speaking translator if it's more than a few words, and through a calligrapher for the art work itself. If you are serious about wanting an Arabic tattoo, please visit my site Arabic Calligraphy Design, or send me an email at arabic.calligrapher@gmail.com with the phrase you want written, and I will write you back.
For an example of the difference between computer written Arabic fonts and hand-written calligraphy, have a look at the two pictures below. Both say al-quwa al-dakhilia, one written by a computer, one by me.

Virtual reality (VR) meetups are becoming more prevalent every week, thanks largely to the ongoing success of the likes of Silicon Valley Virtual Reality (SVVR) which spawned it's own 2-day conference back in May of this year. Today saw this announcement of Belgium's own VR meetup, simply titled ‘Belgium VR Meetup', along with it's headline acts: Jaunt VR, Pixel Rift and Darkfield.
Jaunt VR is a cinematography company specialising in VR films. Their success lead them to receive $27.8 million USD in funding earlier this year following their work on big name events including the Guardians of the Galaxy premiere red carpet event. Darkfield is a space combat title from Darkfield VR, who successfully passed their Kickstarter campaign last month and benefit from a keen following in the VR community.
The leading light in the event will be Pixel Rift, the highly-anticipated VR experience developed by National Film & Television School (NFTS) student Ana Ribeiro. Along with offering hands-on demonstrations of Pixel Rift, Ribeiro will present a keynote speech titled “My story and why I am excited about VR”. VRFocus recently went hands-on with a new edition of the videogame, which you can read about in our Pixel Rift: Halloween Special preview.
Other highlights of the Belgium VR Meetup include a live chat with Virtuix Omni CEO, Jan Goetgeluk, and in an unusual turn a representative from Microsoft will be in attendance to offer a corporate view of VR. You can find out more details about the first Belgium VR Meetup here, and VRFocus will keep you updated with any further additions to the line-up.
RABBITOHS hooker Issac Luke is under investigation from the NRL over a homophobic slur made by the Kiwi international on social media.
Luke took offence to comments made on their Instagram account by followers in the wake of Good Friday's explosive Bulldogs-Rabbitohs clash, during which Luke was taken from the field with concussion.
The 27-year-old took exception to taunts after they had called on Rabbitohs fans to help them track down a young fan who was hospitalised after the match.

In response to the taunts, Luke wrote: “get off my page you lil poofters. This is about a kid your fans knocked out. Well now two kids Yous dropped. We train at Redfern come down and see if you fellas are still carrying on #rulesarerules even though it was a hard penalty to take. I bet youse would've done the same had we done it to one of your players. Or we would've have even had u gooses commenting had it happened earlier on in the game. Now get off my page.”
Luke's post was quickly deleted, and followed up within a few hours by an apology, and the news that they had found the young fan.
Thanks to everyone. #respect A photo posted by Issac luke (@bullyluke14) on Apr 4, 2015 at 1:08am PDT
The NRL confirmed they are aware of the incident, with the integrity unit likely to take up the matter's investigation. “Rugby League is a game for everyone regardless of race, colour, religion, ability or sexuality,” an NRL spokesperson told Fairfax Media.
“As an inclusive game, we do not tolerate discrimination in any form. This is an important matter, and it is certainly one which we will take up with Souths.”
After undergoing Tommy John surgery over the summer of 2012, Drew Hutchison returned to the mound the following year, making 15 starts in the minors. Then in 2014, they arrived to spring training supposedly throwing harder. The positive news got me excited, and intrigued me to the point that I boldly predicted they would win a rotation spot and earn positive 12-team mixed league fantasy value.
The apparent velocity spike was backed by their spring training performance. They struck out 19 of the 55 batters they faced, for an impressive 34.5% strikeout rate. We know to put little stock in spring training results, but strikeouts are the one metric I still do pay attention to. Since the strikeouts were evidently supported by a real change, I then named Hutchison as one of four breakout candidates based on spring strikeout rate surges.
Unfortunately, Hutchison didn't exactly enjoy that breakout performance. Or maybe they did. It depends of course on which metrics you choose to focus on. On the one hand, they posted an ugly 4.48 ERA, which alone meant that they were essentially replacement level in mixed leagues and likely added and dropped all season long. On the other hand, that came along with a 1.26 WHIP and 184 strikeouts, both of which contributed positive value to fantasy teams.
Even more telling though is that their strikeout rate did rise, though we have just one short season to compare it to. They struck out nearly a batter per inning, and I'm quite confident in saying that the mark was well above even the most optimistic of expectations and projections. And while they were an extreme fly ball pitcher, they maintained about a league average walk rate. Put all together, their SIERA was nearly a full run lower than their actual ERA at 3.59.
Oddly, it's not so obvious why their ERA was so much higher. Their BABIP and HR/FB rate both sat right around the league average. Their LOB% was the primary culprit, but even that mark was just a percentage point below average. Perhaps given their fly ball tendency, they gave up a higher rate of doubles and triples than most and the homers they did allow just so happened to be of the multiple-run variety more often than not. They don't even need to improve their skills for their ERA to improve significantly.
In the intro, I talked about talk of Hutchison's velocity improving during the spring. On the season, their fastball velocity did improve over their 2012 mark, though only marginally, and certainly not to the degree it sounded like based on all the spring rumblings. Their fastball did reach a peak velocity of about a mile per hour more than in 2012. So it's still good news, even if I was expecting just a bit better.
When inspecting their pitch results, it appears that they have real strikeout ability. Their fastball induced swinging strikes at a well above average clip, representing quite the jump from their short 2012. The velocity increase likely has something to do with that. And both their slider and changeup are solid pitches, generating SwStk% marks in the mid-teens. The improved changeup compared to 2012 may have once again been helped by their increased fastball velocity. But with three average or above average pitches, their strikeout rate shouldn't regress too far.
Another non-obvious path to strikeouts is the potential for a jump in their called strike rate. According to the leaderboard at Baseball-Reference, they posted the second lowest looking strike rate (L/Str) in baseball. Looking strike rate is definitely a skill, but not as reliable as swinging strike rate. So while it's unlikely they suddenly come close to leading the league in the category, they should definitely get more called strikes next season. And guess who recently signed with the Blue Jays? Russell Martin, who finished 10th among catchers this season in the RAA catcher framing metric. So Hutchison should enjoy a nice boost in called strike rate next year.
The only real concern is that they threw just 57 innings in 2013 after returning from surgery, and is coming off an enormous jump to 184.2 innings this year. But assuming they stay healthy and is good for another 180+ innings, then he's going to prove to be quite the bargain in drafts/auctions.

Greece has failed in its attempt to secure the first release of cash under its €87bn bail-out package , as creditor powers deemed the country had failed to make enough progress on passing key reforms
Athens' anti-austerity government will not receive a €2.15bn as scheduled this week, raising fears the country's new rescue programme is stalling at the first hurdle.
The government of prime minister Alexis Tsipras has been locked in a duel with creditors over two key issues: a new insolvency law for home confiscations, and revamping the way the country's banks are run.
Eurozone finance ministers, meeting in Brussels on Monday, warned the stumbling blocks could also threaten the process of rehabilitating Greece's battered financial system.
Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the eurogroup, said there would be no disbursement until Athens had fulfilled all of its mandated "prior actions".
The Dutch finance minister called on the left-wing Syriza government to implement laws overhauling the governance of the banking sector, as the "key priority" before any creditor money can be used to plug a €14.4bn black hole in the financial system.
Creditors are hoping the private sector will stump up for at least €4.4bn, with the additional €10bn coming from bail-out funds earmarked for the country. But the banking sector continues to be plagued by a high level of "bad loans".
"There are open issues which have to do with non-performing loans and household insolvency", said Mr Dijsselbloem.
"More work needs to be done. Implementation needs to be finished over the course of the coming week. All of that is necessary to finalise the process of recapitalisation".

• The fight to end Greece's Great Euro Depression
Slovakia's finance minister, Peter Kazimir, said: "We need to see how recapitalisation of Greek banks will look like. We want & need to see a solid participation of private investors."
We need to see how recapitalization of Greek banks will look like. We want&need to see a solid participation of private investors #Greece — Peter Ka?imír (@KazimirPeter) November 9, 2015
Greece agreed a new three-year international bail-out package after months of turmoil in August.
Under the terms of the deal, Athens has been asked to carry out more than 60 prior actions to secure the first release of cash.
Without a successful review, Mr Tsipras's government will not be able to progress with vital talks over reducing its 200pc-to-GDP debt burden.
Technical officials from the eurogroup are due to hold another meeting to review progress later this week.
Greece's creditor powers are asking the government to ease the restrictions on home foreclosures, lowering the threshold to properties valued over €120,000 from the current €200,000.
Syriza have resisted the unpopular measures for fear of exposing hundreds of thousands of indebted households to the threat of losing their homes.
Pierre Moscovici, the euro's economics chief, said the law was designed to "help the weakest in society".
"But we have to avoid people using that protection to game the system and abuse the protected measures," said the former Socialist French finance minsiter.
Athens has managed to resist some measures demanded in the initial bail-out. It will not be imposing a 23pc super-VAT rate on private schools, substituting them with other tax-raising measures.
The government has been given more leeway over its bail-out programme as EU officials has sought the government's co-operation in dealing with Europe's unprecedented refugee crisis.
Vice-president of the Commission, Valdis Dombrovskis, said they did not want to "link" the two crises when assessing the government's compliance.
As someone who has made a living from selling, blogging about, and launching smartphones, I was really interested to see what the first reactions would be for the Pixel, the first “Phone by Google.” Media samples went out around a week ago and the press embargo lifted this morning, so I thought it would be fun to analyze the first reviews of this important device.
In order to provide some instant insights, I scanned the pros and cons from the first 25 reviews I found with Google search. To keep it simple, each pro got a point and each con lost a point. Then I tallied up the results to examine the stand out features, and tossed out all the stuff in the middle.
Top Pros and Cons from Google Pixel Reviews
Feedback ranged anywhere from Best Phone on the Planet to Bland and Pricey, but the overall tone was very positive. Even though many claimed this to be the best Android phone available, my fuzzy math found the Pixel to have an average review score of 8.8, which is slightly behind the Samsung Galaxy S7 that averaged 9.1 in similar reviews.
My Quick Takes On Standout Features
Camera: Google spent a lot of time pushing the camera during their launch event and boasted it was “The highest rated smartphone camera ever” using the DxOMark of 89 to back up their claim, and it appears to live up to the hype so far. Even though the Galaxy S7 has been winning blind comparison tests by a mile, the average consumer still thinks Apple has the best cameras thanks to the Shot on iPhone campaign. If Google markets this wisely, they might be able to win mindshare and be eventually recognized as the best smartphone camera.
Unlimited storage of pics and videos: Speaking of the camera, a quarter of the reviewers praised the unlimited backup of all your photos and videos at original quality. Google has previously attacked Apple in this area with their Free Up Space TV ads, and offering this unlimited cloud storage can help emphasize the strength of Pixel's camera. Now that Google has made unlimited media backup the standard, customers are going to expect this kind of treatment on other flagships.
Google's take Android and fast OS updates: As expected, the software experience is one of the top reasons to buy this phone and it's going to be difficult for other Android OEMs to compete here. Phones that I helped launch were badly criticized for their heavy Android skin, and I didn't see any praise for Samsung's software this year either. Looking forward, all Android OEMs are going to have to rethink their strategy in this area. How do you attempt to differentiate your software experience from Google, and do you risk annoying the Android faithful by altering their beloved stock Android just for the sake of change? It should also be noted that even though Google is promising at least 2 years of software support, some pointed out they are still behind Apple that updates some devices for 4+ years after launch.
Google Assistant: Siri is suddenly dumb, and Assistant is new smart kid at school and it's exclusive to Pixel for now. Even though some have pointed out that Assistant is mostly just a repackaging of what we already had, it does appear to be a more useful implementation that more consumers will find easier to use. Assistant integrated with the home button will remain a Pixel exclusive in the near-term and it might help Google sell some more units, but other Android users can still access it from Allo in the meantime. We are still at the beginning of this AI first journey, but Google is raising the stakes for the smarts that consumers will begin to expect in future smartphones. Samsung appears ready to respond with Viv in upcoming products, but I think the smaller OEMs will be playing catch up for the next couple years.
24/7 On-device customer support: This feature didn't receive as many kudos as I thought it might, but I think that's because all the reviewers are pretty tech savvy and know how Android operates by now. Customer service is not an area that Google is well known for, but this could help change that perception. Just the fact that it got called out as a pro in reviews is a win for Google, since Samsung has offered their similar Samsung+ live support app which has been largely ignored by the media.
Speakers: Pixel suffers from a single bottom-firing speaker, and more consumers are starting to demand a more premium audio experience with dual stereo speakers. Apple and Huawei have offered this in their latest flagship smartphones, and I expect all the major flagships will include it next year or continue to be criticized.
Dunkable water-resistance: Pixel is only rated IP53 for dust and water resistance, which means it won't survive a swim in the pool or dunk in the toilet. The two most popular smartphones, Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7, are both much higher rated and can be submerged underwater for 30 minutes, so now consumers are demanding this from competing flagships.
Pricing: Pixel is priced correctly like other carrier flagships, but I think reviewers were disappointed it didn't receive the value discount of last year's Nexus models. Even though the Pixel might not check every single item on the hardware wishlist, it does deliver one of the best cameras and it offers the most premium Google experience to date. Now that Pixel has been established as Google's premium smartphone brand, I don't expect to see price as a big issues next year.
The Long and Short
Today was just the first test for the first Phone by Google, and it appears they have aced it so far. Multiple sites are already proclaiming it's the best smartphone available and I don't see any glaring issues yet. I don't expect the Pixel to be a huge seller in the US since only Verizon offers it in stores, but Google doesn't need this to be a homerun product. Google has proved they can deliver a premium Android phone that can compete with the iPhone and Galaxy, and next year's model will only get better.
Google has said it's business as usual with their Android OEM partners, but If I was an Android OEM, I would already be losing sleep thinking about Pixel 2/3/4 and how I'm going to compete at the high-end where the money is being made.

The Ebola virus has landed in the United States, after Thomas Eric Duncan flew from Liberia to Texas. They were released by a hospital in Dallas, despite telling hospital staff that they came from Liberia. They came in contact with up to 20 people, including 5 schoolchildren since touching down in Dallas. The CDC is monitoring these people, but I have little trust in government organizations to do anything efficiently or effectively.
The world's largest outbreak of Ebola is raging through West Africa. Over 6,000 people have been sickened with over half dying. U.S. health officials warned this week that the number of infected could explode to at least 1.4 million by mid-January.
ZeroHedge reported that the US government bought 160,000 hazmat suits specifically designed against Ebola, just ahead of the worst Ebola epidemic in history making US landfall…
Lakeland Industries, Inc. (LAKE), a leading global manufacturer of industrial protective clothing for industry, municipalities, healthcare and to first responders on the federal, state and local levels, today announced the global availability of its protective apparel for use in handling the Ebola virus. In response to the increasing demand for specialty protective suits to be wormed by healthcare workers and others being exposed to Ebola, Lakeland is increasing its manufacturing capacity for these garments and includes proprietary processes for specialized seam sealing, a far superior technology for protecting against viral hazards than non-sealed products. Lakeland stands ready to join the fight against the spread of Ebola,” said Christopher J. Ryan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lakeland Industries. “We understand the difficulty of getting appropriate products through a procurement system that in times of crisis favors availability over specification, and we hope our added capacity will help alleviate that problem. With the U.S. State Department alone putting out a bid for 160,000 suits, we encourage all protective apparel companies to increase their manufacturing capacity for sealed seam garments so that our industry can do its part in addressing this threat to global health.
Currently, there are no licensed drugs or vaccines for Ebola, although some vaccines as well as some drug candidates have entered clinical trials. Investors have been picking up shares in biotechnology companies that are working on a vaccine for the Ebola virus. Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation (TKMR) was up 24% today and has been getting most of the attention. The stock is up over 200% year to date and may likely continue higher in the doing months if Ebola spreads in the United States. The company has a market cap of around $450 million.
But I think two other biotech stocks may develop superior vaccines and generate even greater returns for investors. These two stocks are Inovio Pharmaceuticals (INO) and NanoViricides (NNVC).
Inovio Pharmaceuticals plans to initiate human testing of a DNA-based vaccine for the Ebola virus in the first half of 2015. The company creates DNA-based vaccines and immune therapies, and said its vaccine might be able to address a variety of developing strains of Ebola. Inovio said that it will work with GeneOne Life Science, a company in which Inovio owns a minority stake.
Results from the drugmaker's studies on guinea pigs and mice have been positive, with vaccinated animals surviving after exposure to the virus and maintaining their weight. Ebola is spread when a victim comes in contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. The virus produces a protein that wreaks havoc in the human body, causing blood to leak from blood vessels. It interrupts the body's ability to thicken and coagulate blood.
NanoViricides announced it was restarting its drug development program to combat Ebola virus infections.
“We believe that with our ‘intelligent nanomachines' approach we have the potential to develop superior therapeutics as compared to other approaches,” said Anil R. Diwan, PhD, President of the Company. “We are happy to restart the Ebola program, considering the public health impact of the Ebola virus infection,” said Dr. Eugene Seymour, MD, MPH, CEO of the Company, adding, “We are in a strong financial position now, enabling us to work on this project while we continue to advance our FluCide™ and DengueCide™ therapies further towards clinical trials. We hope to create highly effective drugs against Ebola, similar to what we have achieved with our FluCide™ Influenza drug candidate.”
The chart shows sideways trading over the past few months. The share price has now hit support just below $10 and we should get a powerful bounce if they make progress on their vaccine. Investors may also snap up shares if Ebola begins to spread in the United States or elsewhere.
The Company's first drug candidate, NV-INF-1, Injectable FluCide™, is designed to treat all influenza infections in hospitalized patients. Influenza A H1N1 infected animals treated with FluCide survived the full 21-day observation period, whereas animals treated with 40mg/kg/d oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu®) survived only 8 days in this highly lethal study. NV-INF-1 demonstrated an unparalleled 1,000-fold reduction in lung viral load compared to untreated animals on day 4 in this lethal animal model study. Moreover, the lung viral load remained suppressed to this baseline level. In contrast, the current standard of care, oseltamivir, (Tamiflu®, Roche) exhibited only a 2-fold reduction in lung viral load at day 4, that rapidly rose by approximately 2X on day 7. NV-INF-1 also caused the lungs of treated animals to remain substantially healthier than the untreated control or oseltamivir-treated mice. Further, NV-INF-1 has been found to be extremely safe in preliminary safety/toxicology studies.
The Company currently has approximately $41 million cash-in-hand and cash-like-instruments. These funds are estimated to be sufficient for taking at least one of our drug candidates through initial human clinical trials, and possibly take another drug candidate into human clinical trials. NanoViricides, Inc. now has its own drug manufacturing facility that is capable of producing sufficient quantities of an anti-Ebola drug after it is developed, for combating Ebola epidemics.
The company has a small market cap of around $170 million and their share price is down 35% year to date. NanoViricides has the highest risk/reward profile, followed by Inovio and then Tekmira.
The technical chart shows a recent dip below trendline support and spike higher today. The RSI is oversold, so we could get a continued bounce from NNVC in the coming weeks.
Other stocks getting attention as the Ebola virus spreads include BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, NewLink Genetics Corp and Sarepta Therapeutics. They are all working on some type of treatment for Ebola. Godspeed.
Their proposal seeks to address concerns from victims. | AP Photos Pols push military justice reform
A bipartisan Senate coalition opened up a new front in the military sexual assault debate on Tuesday, rolling out a fast-moving proposal that lines up a key part of the military criminal justice system with its civilian counterpart.
Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) are lead sponsors of the amendment that would overhaul the military's pre-trial Article 32 process for sexual assault cases and other major military crimes.
Story Continued Below
Their proposal — which they plan to offer later this month on the floor as an amendment to the annual Defense authorization bill — seeks to address concerns from victims who have been put into the uncomfortable position of testifying under oath for hours with probing questions about their sexual habits, dress and behavior.
“The current system is a disaster,” Boxer told reporters. “The reason it's a disaster is there's no protection for the victim in that room at all.”
( PHOTOS: Key players in military sexual assault fight)
Under Article 32 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, a senior officer hears from the prosecution and defense to determine whether there's enough evidence for defendants to face a full court-martial. Unlike a civilian proceeding, there are fewer restrictions on how military attorneys may conduct themselves.
Boxer and Graham's bill would allow victims to opt out of testifying during the preliminary trial process and instead let them file sworn statements. It would require military courts to make a recording and transcript of the Article 32 hearing available to the victims' lawyers and it limits questioning from defense lawyers to only items involving probable cause.
Victims' advocates say the lack of restrictions under today's World War II-era Article 32 can make victims feel as though they're the ones on trial.
“Right now there are no restrictions,” Boxer said. “You can go on a fishing expedition and you can do whatever you want and there are no boundaries.”
The legislation also would require Article 32 hearings to include a presiding officer of equal or higher rank to the prosecutor or defense counsel, rather than the current set up allowing someone of lower rank to run the process.
The Boxer-Graham proposal does not address another pressing question before the Senate, offered by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), that would remove the chain of command from the entire decision-making process involving sexual assault cases or other major crimes. That plan, which the Pentagon opposes, has divided Senate Democrats and Republicans and appears a long shot for success winning 60 votes when it hits the floor in the coming weeks.
( Also on POLITICO: Sex assaults not scaring off recruits)
Cosponsors of the Boxer-Graham plan include several key GOP and Democratic senators who oppose Gillibrand's amendment, including Sens. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.). Also on board are Gillibrand and Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Max Baucus (D-Mont.), Richard Blumethal (D-Conn.), Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii).
Boxer said she's shared information about their proposal with Pentagon lawyers but hasn't brought it to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel for their approval. The Defense Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this story.
In an interview Monday, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin said they were open to the idea of reforming the Article 32 process but said there were some challenges in addressing the issue now since it didn't come up through regular order in their panel.
“It looks to me at least at first blush like it's a good amendment, but we're trying to run through a bunch of traps to see if we are missing something,” the Michigan Democrat said.
“Article 32 has got to be changed,” Levin added. “Not just on sexual assault. It hasn't been looked at for a long time. It's got some real problems and hopefully we can make some changes in it, but they've got to be thoughtful changes.”
Eleanor Smeal, the president of Feminist Majority, said the Boxer-Graham proposal would address some of the critical issues that undercut the military justice system. They noted a lengthy Article 32 hearing earlier this year involving three Naval Academy midshipmen accused of sexually assaulting a classmate. There, the victim faced hours on the witness stand answering questions about their techniques for performing oral sex, as well as the outfit they were wearing the night of the incident.
Two of the three midshipmen will face court martial in February.
”These pretrial hearings are pretty disgraceful,” Smeal said. “It's another way of wearing down the victim. And basically denying them even a trial if they report.”
Smeal insisted that the Boxer-Graham proposal wouldn't undercut support for the Gillibrand bill either, even if it looks like the latter faces challenges in making it into law.
“I don't see it as an alternative,” they said. “I see it as more movement. We're not going to give up on taking it out of the military command. But if we can get this pretrial thing changed and eliminated so that the victim isn't put on trial without adequate protection twice, that would be a real victory.”

Immigration department confirms disturbance after reports guards had left the centre following fires and damage to detention centre buildings
Unrest has broken out among detainees on Christmas Island after the death of an Iranian refugee, the immigration department has confirmed.
The department said in a statement it was working with service providers “to resolve the situation”. It said no one had been injured in the disturbance.
Refugee Action Coalition spokesperson Ian Rintoul said fences and walls had been knocked down and fires started in some sections of the detention centre in the unrest on Sunday night.
Refugee found dead after escaping Christmas Island detention centre Read more
Rintoul told Guardian Australia a demonstration that began about 11pm local time on Sunday had involved about 200 people, and a smaller number had damaged the centre.
The canteen, medical centre and property area had extensive fire damage, they said. There was smaller fire damage in accommodation areas and fences had been damaged.
They said the centre was quiet on Monday morning.
A New Zealand Labour MP Kelvin Davis, who recently visited the island, said a New Zealander in detention had told them detainees had taken over the centre and guards had retreated.
Davis told ABC radio the riots began when a detainee who had asked questions about the death of the man, named by refugee groups as Fazel Chegeni, was assaulted.
“They have put holes in the walls, so even if they are rounded up and put back in the cells they actually can't be locked up,” Davis said.
On Monday morning most detainees were huddled together outside the detention centre on a sports ground, Davis said.
“There's safety in numbers there and they want to be outside.”
New Zealand detainees on the island had asked Wellington for help, Davis said.
“They're scared, they've asked me to try and get New Zealand consulate people over to Christmas Island to be witness to the injuries that they believe they're going to receive in the coming days.”
The behaviour of guards was fanning the flames of unrest, they said.
“They're scared that these guys will come in with batons waving, rather than trying to calm the situation in the first instance,” Davis said. “I don't think that the situation will be helped if they come in guns blazing, so to speak.”
A New Zealand detainee earlier told TVNZ guards had abandoned the centre.
“They've gone, they've freaked out and left,” they said, according to audio provided to ABC radio.
Another New Zealand detainee told Radio NZ they feared a crackdown from guards in the coming days, including the use of “rubber bullets and tear gas”.
A coroner will investigate the death of the Iranian Kurdish refugee, whose body was found on Sunday after they escaped from the centre on Friday.
Detainees “feared the worst” had happened to the Kurdish man, Davis said.
“If they were out for a couple of days and on the run, they wouldn't have been found near the perimeter of the detention centre, and there's nowhere to run on Christmas Island either,” they said. “So there are a lot of grey areas. I think there's a quite a bit of propaganda coming out from both sides.”
On Monday morning, the department put out a second statement outlining the events.
“The disturbance follows an incident on Saturday (November 7) in which a detainee escaped from the centre,” the statement said. “A search and rescue operation was immediately undertaken however the escapee's body was later discovered by search and rescue teams on Sunday at the bottom of island cliffs away from the centre.
“The cause of their death is not currently known and a report is being prepared for the coroner,” the statement said. “The department will make further comments as events unfold through the day.”
Christmas Island shire president Gordon Thomson said the escape had triggered panic among local residents.
They told ABC radio they were disappointed the immigration department had “allowed rumour to spread” through the community without providing any information.
A spokesperson for the immigration department said any criminal offences “would be referred to police”.
“The department is committed to providing a safe and secure environment for detainees, and maintaining the good order of detention facilities,” the spokesperson said. “It would not be appropriate to make further detailed comments on matters that are subject to ongoing operations.”
Labor's immigration spokesperson Richard Marles said greater transparency was needed at all Australian-funded centres.
Labor senator Doug Cameron said it was appalling most of the information about the riot was coming from New Zealand rather than the Australian government.
“The government needs to be open about what's happening,” they told reporters.
The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, told reporters the situation in the detention centre was “volatile” and “needs to be investigated”.
“We have grave concerns about what's happening on Christmas Island,” they said. “This is a stain on our national character.
“We've got a policy now that is morally unsustainable, that is financially unsustainable,” Di Natale said. “This is something that Malcolm Turnbull needs to demonstrate some leadership on.”
The Greens would work with the government on changing asylum seeker policies, they said.
“I'll be talking to Malcolm Turnbull to let them know that I'm prepared to work with them to change our current system of offshore detention to ensure that it is more decent and more compassionate,” Di Natale said. “We are pushing people to breaking point ... This is a symptom of a government policy that is now in crisis.”
Argentinian wine and Brazilian timber are just the latest products being transformed by entrepreneurs building distributed applications on the ethereum blockchain in South America.
One of Brazil's largest banks recently built a smart contract designed to automate parts of the process by which a company goes public; a group in Chile is working to help scale the blockchain using the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS); and a team in Nicaragua is building a secure identity system using Ricardian contracts.
Other than ethereum, what all these projects have in common is a company in Brooklyn, New York, with a rapidly growing presence across industries and around the world.
Of about 100 employees scattered across five continents, three have taken a leadership position to run these diverse projects that push the limits of how a blockchain can be used.
One of those men was hired by ConsenSys in early 2015 after spending more than 10 years building financial markets software in their native Brazil and in New York City. ConsenSys blockchain specialist Daniel Novy tells CoinDesk he's been surprised by how quickly their country has adopted a diverse set of ethereum applications.
Having founded Brazilian bitcoin exchange Basebit in 2013, Novy saw firsthand how in those early days bitcoin's reputation for being associated with illicit transactions made it difficult to sell the technology to banks.
But they added that the stigma doesn't exist with ethereum, which is making their job of approaching companies to “sprinkle a little blockchain on them” much easier.
Novy told CoinDesk:
“It seems all the companies I'm dealing with are searching blockchain. But in the end, they all come to ethereum because of the smart contracts. Many of them, especially the banks have researched bitcoin but they almost always, I think always, choose ethereum.”
A São Paulo stock exchange
Based in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, a city surrounded by rainforest just north of Rio de Janeiro, Novy is the lead developer of Regis, ConsenSys' registry service and a consultant with many of the company's projects in both Brazil and Argentina.
Currently, they say he's working with six financial institutions in the area, including multiple banks. But none is more advanced in its blockchain development than Bovespa, a stock exchange based in São Paulo, Brazil.
During Novy's most recent meeting with Bovespa, they said they addressed a group of 20 people and helped them build a smart contract prototype that would automate part of the process by which a company goes public.
Beyond just building the prototype for the Bovespa employees Novy described working alongside employees of Microsoft, taking the exchange line-by-line through the code to teach them how to write the IPO smart contract to to deploy it.
The work is still in its earliest phases.
“We started to think about what we should do in the afternoon to prove that this thing works,” said Novy.
ConsenSys has confirmed with CoinDesk that they are meeting in Brooklyn with Bovespa in two weeks to discuss the possibility of working together on another project.
A Brazilian rainforest
Whereas Brazil once had a reputation for being slow to embrace bitcoin due to low visibility, Novy says the country is quickly adopting ethereum.
In June, timber tracking company BVRio announced it would use Novy's Regis tool for building decentralized registries to help track the origin of wood harvested from the Amazon rainforest and elsewhere in the region.
Using Regis, which logs identifying information on the ethereum blockchain, BVRio scores each beam of timber based on where it comes from and who harvested it to help ensure its legality.
Prices for the timber are in part determined by this score, according to Novy.
By decentralizing that registry using the Regis software, BVRio said in a statement announcing the project that “the information is guaranteed to not change, given the immutability of blockchains, and it's available publicly”.
Novy says they expect that project will go live by the end of the month.
Argentinian wine
But not all of Novy's work is limited to Brazil. Whereas they say their native country had a post of being late adopters, Argentina, with its history of rapid inflation embraced bitcoin early and has continued to experiment with ethereum.
Still in its stealth mode, Cora in Argentina's Uco Valley is a 2.5-acre vineyard using Regis to sell individual vines to investors.
Cora founder Lucas Abihaggle is working with Novy to integrate land tracking service These Three Words, which has divided the planet into 57 trillion three-meter by three-meter squares with Regis.
“We want to organize a community to buy very valuable vineyards and tokenize the vines for each plant and sell those plants,” Abihaggle told CoinDesk. “In that way, [we can] save those vineyards that are in danger of being ripped out for real-estate purposes.”
As part of the effort to raise the project's visibility Novy says he'll be pitching it at the DevCon2 Demo Day in Shanghai this September.
According to Abihaggle, angel investors are backing the company but a few final details remain to be worked out before it can launch.
Chile, Nicaragua and beyond
Elsewhere in South America, ConsenSys is working to develop a wide range of applications of ethereum.
Herman Junge in Santiago de Chile is leading a stealth project INFURA to use IPFS to help scale the ethereum infrastructure.
In Nicaragua, lead mobile developer for Uport, Pelle Braendgaard, is using Ricardian style contracts to help ensure self-sovereign identity and key management to help ensure that people and things are what they appear to be.
Braendgaard told CoinDesk:
“I have a strong interest in bring our services to the developing world.”
Novy shares Braendgaard's vision for connecting the developing world with the ethereum blockchain. In addition to BenBen, a land registration project currently being discussed with the Ghanaian government, Novy hinted an african project that “emerged from South America” and could eventually result in a new way to protect rhinoceroses using the ethereum blockchain.
The wide range of projects being undertaken in multiple countries is resulting in a synergy of sorts.
When one of Novy's colleagues initiates a conversation with a bank or business in one country they may benefit from them starting that conversation in Brazil, and vice-versa.
“They are working individually,” they said. “But we are always collaborating with each other.”

UKRAINE – As unrest in Ukraine continues to grow, news emerged today of the assault of a Lutheran pastor in Odessa on February 19.
Rev. Andreas Hamburg reports on Facebook that they were present at a peaceful protest taking place at Odessa's regional administration building when a pro-government civilian group arrived and began attacking the protestors. “I stood still, hoping that my peaceful attitude and pastor's shirt would have a calming effect,” they write. But they were attacked nevertheless. “I lay on the ground, and no one prevented them from beating me, first with their feet and then with bats.”
They were eventually saved by a police officer who came and pulled them out. Before order could be restored, the assailants also attacked others, including members of the media. Rev. Andreas Hamburg is a pastor at St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Odessa, a member congregation of the German Evangelical Lutheran Church in Ukraine (GELCU). GELCU has ties to the Lutheran World Federation.
The Patriarch of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC), Archbishop Major Sviatoslav Shevchuk, called Rev. Hamburg shortly after the incident to express support and solidarity. “During the call, both sides stressed the importance of peaceful resolution of the crisis in Ukraine,” a UGCC release notes. “Every person, no matter which side of the fence they are on, is a child of God and needs to protect every human life.” A local Odessa ecumenical group—with Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant members—also condemned the attack.
In addition to being the headquarters of the German Evangelical Lutheran Church in Ukraine, Odessa serves as the headquarters of the Synod of Evangelical Lutheran Churches in Ukraine (SELCU). SELCU has strong ties to Lutheran Church–Canada (LCC), a member church of the International Lutheran Council. SELCU and GELCU have a cordial working relationship in Ukraine, even sharing buildings in certain locations.
LCC's missionary in Ukraine, Rev. Alexey Navrotsky, notes that, currently, “The most dangerous places are in Kiev, Lviv, and cities on the west side of Ukaine.” SELCU has no congregations in these areas, and in communities where the church is represented—like Odessa—the situation is not yet considered dangerous, comparatively speaking. “But the situation changes every hour,” they explain. “The waves of human anger and sorrow are flowing from Kiev to all regions of Ukraine.”
Asked how other Christians across the world can help, Rev. Navrotsky is clear: “We really need and appreciate your prayers.”

In America, the share of the economic pie going to workers has been on the decline for about three decades, and this has accelerated since the turn of the century. The fall has occurred in most other countries, too. In the U.S., the share of income workers take home each year now hovers around 60%. The leading theories to explain this trend — automation and competition from China — are inadequate. A recent paper puts forward a different story based on the rise of “superstar firms”. More and more industries have become “winner take most” over the last 40 years. The rise of the superstar firm isn't simply a reflection of a rigged economy where the incumbents are colluding to rip off consumers and workers. But the risk is that the dominance of superstars will eventually contribute to a fall in economic dynamism and productivity that will further entrench their power. Left unattended, this may stoke popular resentment of big business or big government, or both.
Few things are stable in economic life. Sixty years ago, Nicholas Kaldor laid down one seemingly immutable fact: The share of the national income taken by labor was constant. In other words, every year workers took home around two-thirds of the economic pie, and the owners of capital took the rest. The stability of this ratio was, as their fellow Cambridge economist Lord Keynes said, “something of a miracle.”
So much for miracles. In America, labor's share has been on the decline for about three decades, and it has accelerated since the turn of the century. The fall has also occurred in most other countries. In the U.S. the share of income that workers take home each year now hovers around 60%.

There's a lot of debate over the magnitude of the decline, but there is broad consensus that it has happened and that it's a big deal. The disagreement is over why labor has been losing out.
Maybe the leading story is “Robocalypse Now.” Rapid technological advance in computers and automation has led to a huge fall in the quality-adjusted price of capital equipment. Firms replace expensive people with cheaper machines, and the fraction of added value going to workers falls — or so the story goes.
The problem with this story is that it assumes firms have the flexibility to switch easily between labor and capital. In wonkish terms, the capital-labor elasticity of substitution must be greater than one for this hypothesis to be true, so that a fall in the price of machines spurs employers to spend more on machines relative to workers. The empirical evidence does not suggest that labor and capital are sufficiently substitutable for this to occur.
The other main explanation for labor's downfall is that Chinese imports have caused employers to outsource employment to Asia, causing a fall in the labor share domestically, even if labor utilization does not fall globally. But the data shows a fall in labor's share in nontraded sectors like retail and wholesale, not just in traded sectors like manufacturing. Moreover, China itself is experiencing a sharp decline in labor's share. Thus it's unlikely that China is the main cause of the decline in the labor share in the West.
In a recent paper, we put forward a different story based on the rise of superstar firms. More and more industries have become “winner take most” over the last 40 years. Firms with a cost or quality advantage have always enjoyed higher market shares. In the “good old days,” more-productive companies would take a bigger slice of the market, but there would be plenty left over for their rivals. By contrast, the new behemoths of our age capture a much larger fraction — if not all — of their market. Think of Google, Apple, and Amazon in the digital sphere, or Walmart and Goldman Sachs in the offline world.
It's not that superstar firms pay lower wages; in fact, on average, big firms usually pay more. But wages at superstar firms represent a smaller fraction of sales revenue. Superstar companies make lots of profit per employee, so as they become a bigger and bigger part of the economy, the overall share of GDP going to labor goes down.
Several pieces of data support our superstar theory. First, our theory predicts that markets will become increasingly concentrated, and sure enough that's what the data shows.
A second implication of the theory is that the labor share in the average firm won't have changed very much. Our data confirms that this is the case. What's happened is that the mass of the economy has shifted between firms, toward the superstar companies.
Third, the industries that have become more concentrated are the very same sectors where the labor share has fallen the most. These are the industries where the reallocation toward superstar firms has increased the most.
The rise of superstar firms isn't simply a reflection of a rigged economy where the incumbents are colluding to rip off consumers and workers. The patterns we document are not confined to the U.S.; they are happening all over the world. That suggests that changes in antitrust law or other policy-specific factors can't be the primary driver.
If policy isn't driving rising concentration, what is? One possibility is that the near-frictionless commerce enabled by the internet and globalization enables more efficient firms to be rewarded with higher market shares today than in the past. Indeed, we show that the industries where concentration has risen the most are also those where there has been the fastest growth in productivity and innovation.
Does this mean we should be relaxed about the move to an economy dominated by superstar firms?
No, for at least two reasons.
The declining labor share has been coupled with a slowdown of economic growth, which means declining pay and job opportunities for the average worker. In effect, workers are getting a shrinking slice of a barely expanding pie.
And although superstar firms may have become dominant through competitive means, they may cement their position using methods that are less benign. Large, profitable firms invest heavily in lobbying to protect their advantage, skewing the political system. They may pursue business strategies that make it hard for new challengers to grow and flourish. Microsoft became a near-monopolist in operating systems through innovation and good decisions, but then strove to keep entrants like Netscape out of the market. Even when superstars fail to deter competitors, they can often just buy up the new threat, as Facebook has with Instagram and WhatsApp.
The risk is that the dominance of superstars will eventually contribute to a fall in economic dynamism and productivity that will further entrench their power. Left unattended, this may stoke popular resentment of big business or big government, or both. Arguably, this process is already well under way.
Last year, I couldn't find a recipe for a pate based on lamb's liver, so I improvised a recipe that has now become a favourite. I've been using the same recipe with the liver of our home-killed beef. Pate with sourdough crackers must be one of my favourite snacks.
Beef liver pate
Beef Liver Pate
500g beef liver (you can substitute lamb's fry), cut into pieces
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 cup red wine
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1/2 teaspoon dijon mustard
1 sprig fresh rosemary
1 sprig fresh thyme
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 cup butter
salt
2 tablespoons cracked black pepper
*Saute the liver and onions in a couple of tablespoons of the butter until the livers are browned and the onions are tender.
*Add wine, garlic, mustard, herbs and lemon juice and cook uncovered until most of the liquid has gone.
*Cool and blend to a smooth paste in the food processor along with the rest of the butter. (This is easier if the butter is not fridge cold!)
*Add salt to taste.
*Check the consistency of the pate. If it seems dry and crumbly rather than smooth and creamy, add more butter.
*Put pate in a shallow dish and press the cracked pepper onto the top of it.
I spoke to Garland ahead of the film's US premiere at the SXSW festival. And, as you'll quickly learn, he's got a lot to say about AI and the nature of consciousness. Ex Machina hits theaters on April 10.
What was your creative spark for the story? Were there any ideas for the story? This one just seemed a little different for AI, more of an exploration of how you could love an AI.
Going way back, for me it would go back to childhood ... and having very, very simple home computers.
The ZX Spectrum
What was your first home computer?
I think the first actual computer [for me] was the ZX81, but the one I actually got to grips in any way as the ZX Spectrum, which was a follow-up to that. ... It had BASIC commands sort of burned into the keyboard that you could access through shortcut keys.
So I would write very, very simple ... "hello world" kind of programs, where the computer would maybe have the ability to answer three or four questions. ... It would give you this feeling as a kid of bolting up and thinking, this is suddenly feeling sentient. Of course it's not sentient -- you're very aware it's not, because you've programmed it. But nonetheless it gave you that sort of funny electric feeling. I think that always stayed with me.
Then years and years later I got involved in a really long argument ... with a friend of mine whose principal area of interest was neuroscience. He's affiliated with a school of thought that basically says, "Machines are never going to be sentient in the way we are." There are very serious thinkers attached to that, like Roger Penrose [a renowned physicist and philosopher]. And I instinctively disagreed with this, but I didn't have the sort of armory to disagree with it on their terms, so I started reading as much as I could.
Not to get too boring, but our sticking point was over qualia [a philosophical term for defining conscious experiences we all have]. ... I had a kind of instinctive, and then subsequently I'd say rationalized, sense that qualia might not even exist.
Domhnall Gleeson [left] and Oscar Isaac in 'Ex Machina'
You mean even in human language and thought?
Yah, yah. ... In reading about this, I came across this book by [cognitive roboticist] Murray Shanahan, who wrote a book about consciousness and embodiment. Within it there's a really beautiful idea, which is an argument against metaphysics [the philosophy branch that explores how we experience the world] in terms of the mind. And in a way, if you can get rid of metaphysics as a problem, it allows for an artificial intelligence -- or a strong AI. ... And I have to say, as I was reading that book -- and as a layperson, it's fucking difficult for me to read this stuff; I struggled like crazy -- but it was while reading it that the idea for this movie appeared in my head.
I was in preproduction on Dredd; I was spending a lot of time in South Africa, on planes, and I had a lot of time to read. ... So whenever we shot Dredd, the three months before that, that's basically where it came together. And after I wrote the script, I sent it to Murray Shanahan and said, you don't know who I am, but I want you to really look at this script. I wanted the stuff within it to be reasonable.
"There are a lot of legitimate reasons to be scared of superintelligence."
So what did they think?
There was a bit of coding in there where they said, "I'm not sure it's compiled correctly." In fact, in the film some of the code that appears on screen, if you were to write it out, what you'd find is it leads you to the ISBN of their book.
What other sorts of AI books have you read?
I pretty much would read everything I could. I tried to read people like Penrose, who were arguing against what I instinctively believed.
That's a good way to solidify your argument.
I don't want to dignify it from my point of view, because I can't stress enough I'm a real layperson. So I can understand the principles of an argument, but when it comes to the actuality of what people like Demis Hassabis at DeepMind [a British AI company owned by Google] are actually doing, I really don't understand it. That's part of what interests me. It's the gap between people who do understand what they're doing, and the way information disseminates, and the confusion that exists between those spaces.
The thing I began to get fixated on -- this is separate from the film, but related -- was confronting my own intellectual limitations. And thinking, here I am; I'm not dumb, I'm doing what I can, but I'm also running into a brick wall of my own intellectual capacity. And it sort of made me a bit nervous in some respects, because I was thinking, that means a lot of this stuff, for a lot of people, and I would include myself in that part of the Venn diagram, becomes articles of faith.
That's troubling where there are ethical consequences to the things that are happening, because to get through the ethics, you have to understand it.
Alex Garland
What do you think about the rise of AI and superintelligence? Do you think it's something we need to worry about?
I think there's a lot of confusion around this. I mean, a few months ago it was announced that a machine passed the Turing test in a way that was completely ridiculous; it didn't stand up to any scrutiny at all, but the fact that it was reported as widely as it was tells you that what kind of problem there is in terms of what people are actually doing, and what they're perceived to be doing.
There are a lot of legitimate reasons to be scared of superintelligence; of course there are. And exactly as there are reasons to be scared of the implications of nuclear power, hence the [Robert] Oppenheimer analogy that exists throughout the film. Both of them are potentially dangerous. From my point of view, I would see myself as being sort of green in terms of my outlook, but I'm also in favor of nuclear power. So I would see the superintelligences as being analogous to that. They could be problematic if they're controlling drones and making kill decisions over humans; I can completely see that.
I think that probably people get a bit confused about them, and maybe a film like Ex Machina in some respect doesn't help, in as much as we think that they might be human like. But they probably won't be, in terms of how they see the world, and the way they interact with it and each other.
It's completely alien to us.
Yah we don't really know because they're not here yet. And as a father, it's a bit like trying to conceptualize your child before they're born. You can't actually do it. It's an abstract thing until it arrives. And then, of course, you can get your head around it. ... If you get an AI that was human-like, and it has similar things to our consciousness embedded within it. There's nothing within that, that I find necessarily frightening.
"Being clear about these things is important. Otherwise, you'll be talking about the sentience of Siri. And Siri doesn't have any fucking sentience."
Human intelligence is capable of being fantastically dangerous if it's given the life path and powers of [Joseph] Stalin or Pol Pot. And I could say if you provided an AI with too much power, you might get serious problems. But what that would be is an argument in favor of checks and balances, rather than an argument against AIs.
I think it's helpful and actually sensible when talking about this stuff to be clear what it is one's talking about. AI's a super-broad term. I play video games with AIs. And in the same way that the reporting of the passing of the Turing test would misunderstand A) whether it had been past and B) what the Turing test was, and also, C) whether the Turing test is actually an indicator of consciousness in a machine, or whether it's just an indicator that the machine passed the Turing test. And I would say it's the latter. ... It doesn't tell you whether you're sentient.
Being clear about these things is important. Otherwise, we're very quick to conflate stuff, and suddenly you'll be talking about the sentience of Siri. And Siri doesn't have any fucking sentience. AI is probably too broad of a term to be useful at the moment.

But today would have been Gwynn's 56th birthday, and to commemorate the occasion, we've compiled a list of 19 facts about No. 19.
SAN DIEGO -- There's never a bad time to rehash the insane numbers Tony Gwynn put up during their 20 Hall-of-Fame seasons in San Diego.
SAN DIEGO -- There's never a bad time to rehash the insane numbers Tony Gwynn put up during their 20 Hall-of-Fame seasons in San Diego.
But today would have been Gwynn's 56th birthday, and to commemorate the occasion, we've compiled a list of 19 facts about No. 19.
Happy birthday, Mr. Padre.
• The historic 1994 season in which Gwynn batted .394 -- the closest anyone has come to hitting .400 since Ted Williams did so -- was cut short by the strike. Could Gwynn have reached .400? It's pure speculation at this point, but they were batting .423/.472/.613 in the second half that year. Gwynn's .334 career second-half batting average is the third best in the last 50 years.
• Rather famously, Gwynn only struck out three times in a game once -- against Bob Welch and the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1986. But Gwynn played a pivotal role in that game, nonetheless, singling in the eighth, and scoring the tying run in the 10th after reaching on an error. In fact, they added 37.9 percent to the Padres' win probability that day.
• At 23 years old, Bryce Harper, arguably the game's best left-handed hitter right now, already has 23 games with at least three K's. In 2015 alone, 22 players recorded at least 10 three-strikeout games.
• In their entire 20-year career, Gwynn struck out 434 times -- an average of 21.7 K's per season. Entering play Sunday, 76 different players had already whiffed 22 times in 2016 alone.
• Since Gwynn debuted in 1982, only 46 different hitters have posted a season with a batting average above .350. Gwynn has seven of those seasons, the most of any player in that span.
• Gwynn batted .300 in every season but their rookie year, giving them a record 19 straight seasons above .300. Miguel Cabrera is the current leader with seven straight .300-plus seasons. No other player has an active streak of more than three.
• Beginning in 1988, when STATS Inc. began tracking numbers in certain counts, Gwynn batted .302 with two strikes. That's easily the best mark for any player in that span, with Wade Boggs coming in second at .260. In fact, in 1994, Gwynn batted an absurd .397 in two-strike counts.
• Six times in Padres history has a player recorded 200 hits in a season. Five of those seasons belong to Gwynn (1984, '86, '87, '89, '97). Mark Loretta had 208 hits in 2004.
• On 45 separate occasions, Gwynn recorded four hits in a game -- 11 more times than they recorded a multi-strikeout game.
• Gwynn faced Greg Maddux 107 times in their career -- more than any other pitcher. They batted .415/.476/.521 against the four-time Cy Young Award winner and Hall of Famer. That's easily the highest average against Maddux for any player with at least 70 plate appearances.
• Of course, it's not like Gwynn's numbers against Maddux were an anomaly. They torched just about every pitcher they faced. Among the 38 pitchers that they faced at least 50 times, their lowest average was a .243 mark against Dwight Gooden. They batted at least .300 against 32 of those 38 pitchers, including Tom Glavine, Nolan Ryan, John Smoltz and Orel Hershiser.
• Padres fans have called the second game of the season, "Tony Gwynn Opening Day" for years, because of Gwynn's affection for the fans who showed up for Game 2. Nobody owned "Tony Gwynn Opening Day" quite like, well, Tony Gwynn. They batted .403/.439/.500 in Game 2 of 162.
• Gwynn played both baseball and basketball at San Diego State, and they still own several records in basketball for the Aztecs. Their 590 career assists are the most in school history and their 221 assists in the 1979-80 season are also a record. In fact, Gwynn owns the top three single-game assist tallies in Aztecs history -- with their 18 dimes against UNLV on Feb. 5, 1980, as the most.
• In the past 100 years, nobody has more batting titles than Gwynn's eight. Only Ty Cobb, who won 12, all before 1920, had more.
• Gwynn's .338 career batting average is the highest in the expansion era -- and it's not even that close, as Gwynn sits 10 points ahead of Boggs, in second. The last player to finish their career with a higher average was Ted Williams' .344 mark.
• Since World War II, Gwynn is the only player to bat above .350 in five consecutive seasons (from 1993-97). Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby and Al Simmons did so before him.
• In 2007, Gwynn was inducted into the Hall of Fame after receiving 532 of 545 votes -- the eighth highest total in MLB history.
• Gwynn owns all-time Padres records in: batting average, runs, hits, total bases, doubles, triples, RBIs, walks, stolen bases and games played.
• Gwynn's 68.8 career WAR, according to baseball-reference, is more than twice that of any other player in Padres history. Dave Winfield, at 31.9, is second.

It was one year ago that I invested my yearly SEP contribution into bitcoins.
Actually, it was into something called the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which at the time was the only investment vehicle that I could find after researching options for investing qualified retirement funds into bitcoin. At the time bitcoin was trading in the $500 to $600 range.
Six months ago, I wrote about losing half of my investment in the Trust and received much "love" from those who had sympathy for me (actually I'm still looking for those comments but I'm sure that someone out there does care). I also was very clear at the time that there was no need to worry that I'd be "dumpster diving" for my next meal because I was doing what every investor needs to do — proper asset allocation. Meanwhile bitcoin was trading in the $400 to $300 range, and no one likes losing money.
My investment in the Trust and bitcoin is a small portion of my investment portfolio and considered as part of the alternative investment class of my overall investment portfolio. Some of you have gold, oil wells or real estate in that category. I prefer things less tangible (I read a lot of science fiction growing up).
So here I am, one year later. Bitcoin is trading at $230 as I'm writing this. Maybe it's time to listen to the naysayers and realize that it's time to give up and just recognize that bitcoin is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme, a harsh trick played on people from a guy named Satoshi and little more than the outlawed game of Three-Card Monty that was so popular before Mickey Mouse invaded my beloved Times Square?
Before writing this article, I decided that before I could put the nail in my bitcoin "folly,” I wanted to get a better view of the current bitcoin landscape, so I went to the Inside Bitcoins conference in New York City to see if in fact, the end of bitcoin is around the corner, as so many commenters had said to me six months ago.
What I walked away with was a cautiously optimistic outlook on bitcoin, but an overwhelming level of respect for something called the blockchain. Without going into too many technical aspects, the blockchain is the "ledger" that all bitcoin transactions are recorded on. When you recognize that this provides a decentralized and permanent record of all of these transactions, you soon come to understand why venture capital is pouring into new ventures that use the blockchain.
New companies that are looking to use the power of the blockchain include Factom, which is a company that plans to create a method that will allow for the permanent storage of records such as land titles, medical records, books, and pretty much anything that requires being reported, through the use of the blockchain.
When I spoke with the CEO of Factom, Peter Kirby, you realize that he's not only the "smartest guy in the room" but he's also keenly aware of the skepticism that exists about bitcoin and the blockchain. Although there is a rush of venture capital out there for blockchain companies, Kirby has decided to also raise money for their company through a channel called Koinify, which allows anyone to invest in startups such as Factom. Kirby explains that their reasoning for seeking investors through that channel was due more to the need to build a community, rather than it being the only channel available to him.
By selling "factoids,” the Factom form of cybercurrency to new investors, Koinify allows Factom to reach a wider range of investors, who can become enthusiasts for the application, while allowing any investor to participate in the start up of a company. It does require that you purchase factoids with bitcoin, but in case you haven't noticed, the opportunities to buy bitcoin have grown immensely from a year ago when I began my efforts to do that.
So, one year later, I'm still out over half of my original investment. Because of the structure of the investment, I can't get out of it (although it will soon transfer into an exchange-traded fund type of investment soon and will trade on an exchange). Yet, I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing in not only the advancements around bitcoin, including the wide range of opportunities for the blockchain, as well as the level of intelligence and enthusiasm around the individuals and executives involved in the companies in this space.
There have been many comparisons between what is currently occurring with bitcoin and when the Internet first became widely known. There were intelligent and enthusiastic people at the start of the Internet days as well. Money was made and money was lost. I'm sure that will happen again (I guess I'm living proof of that).
I'm fortunate enough to be alive and around long enough to see how the Internet has been one of those rare things that actually did change the world. I look forward to seeing whether bitcoin and the blockchain can do the same thing.

Leap second to make June 30, 2015, a longer day, Paris Observatory announces
Posted
The year of 2015 will be one second longer, with the Paris Observatory announcing a leap second will be added on June 30 when clocks will read 11:59:60pm.
The French-based International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service said a leap second was to account for the slight differences in time between highly accurate atomic clocks and the rotation of the globe.
"The Earth is slowing down a little bit," said Nick Stamatakos, the chief of Earth Orientation Parameters at the US Naval Observatory.
"Atomic clocks keep very accurate time. The measurements are telling us 'Oh, they're slowing down'."
The first leap second was added in 1972, and it will be the 26th time it has been added to clocks in history.
It means the rotation of the Earth will have slowed 26 seconds compared to the time measured on atomic clocks.
"They add an extra second to something called UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) in order to make sure the rate of UTC is the same as atomic time," they said.
The Earth isn't as slow [now] as it was in the 1970s. Relative to ... the 1970s, we've sped up a little bit, but we're still going slower than atomic time. Nick Stamatakos from the US Naval Observatory
It means that at 11:59:59pm on June 30 for one second clocks will read 11:59:60pm.
"For that day [June 30] there'll be 86,401 seconds, instead of 86,400 seconds. The length of the day for you and I and everyone on the Earth will have an extra second," Mr Stamatakos said.
Leap seconds are rarer these days than they were when the practice of adding seconds first began.
From 1972 to 1979, at least one second was added every year. Leap seconds were added six times throughout the 1980s. But there will only have been four leap seconds added since 1999.
Mr Stamatakos said it was all down to physics.
"The Earth isn't as slow [now] as it was in the 1970s," they said.
"Relative to ... the 1970s, we've sped up a little bit, but we're still going slower than atomic time."
The last time a leap second was added was in 2012. It caused serious issues with websites on the internet, which crashed because of software bugs.
Major companies, including Mozilla, Reddit and Gawker reportedly experienced issues, and there were also problems with the Linux operating system.
Scientists debate benefits, complications of extra second
June 30's leap second may be the last in history.
The Radiocommunication Assembly and the World Radiocommunication Conference was due to vote later in the year on whether the leap second should be abolished.
A vote was supposed to take place in 2012, but was deferred.
The matter was controversial. Supporters of the leap second argued corrections were needed to maintain accurate time for some branches of science.
Those opposed said it was not worth the energy to change the clocks infrequently, and said it would be beneficial for computing to have a timescale that never needed changing.
A time that never changes would eventually be noticeable by humans, but not by much.
Without leap seconds there would be a slip of two to three minutes by 2100 and about half an hour by 2700.

For online marketers looking to make an impact, it can be hard to determine what actually generates revenue.
Startup SourceMetrics is looking to address this problem by launching a tool for real-time return-on-investment analysis of social media campaigns.
Swix, which created SourceMetrics, backed by $1.6 million from Growthworks and Canada's Fed Dev program, analyzes leads, click-throughs and conversions. The Ottawa, Canada company, founded in 2008, has previously built analytics and campaign manager tools for social media marketers. But the company has been getting more interest from brands more data, so the company is releasing SourceMetrics as its new main product, folding its previous products.
The company takes on others in this general space including Wildfire Interactive, which was just acquired by Google, and BuddyMedia, which was acquired by Salesforce.com.
SourceMetrics provides social publishing, campaign management and social media monitoring, as well as tools to measure the return on investment of campaigns. While there are many tools for social media monitoring of online discussions about brands, there isn't a tool that provides good analysis of the results of a campaign in social media, says Scott Lake, cofounder and CEO of SourceMetrics and former cofounder of startup Shopify.
With SourceMetrics, companies can analyze the traffic to different landing pages, which campaigns the clicks came from, and which social media sites they originally came from, as well as which individual tweet or Facebook post, to determine which posts worked best. (SourceMetrics also measures LinkedIn, YouTube, blogs and email campaigns.) That is then translated into how much was purchased from each link, if that is the goal of a campaign. "Which is driving the most conversions?" Lake says. "Are they being retweeted, and how much? Which landing page performs best with which social channels?" Lake says.
In other words, some campaigns start on Facebook but are then re-posted on Twitter, where the traffic then comes to a landing page. SourceMetrics enables companies to see the original source of the traffic. Many other tools will tell you the traffic on a landing page, but won't tell you where the traffic to the landing page originally came from. "It doesn't tell you how many posts are involved in the campaign and how much reach the posts get versus conversion numbers," Lake says. "It doesn't tell you which properties convert better, if you want to find out what about the messages convert better."
Brands use SourceMetrics to try to get people to sign up with an email address for later marketing, sign up for an event, download a white paper, or to simply purchase a product. With SourceMetric's online dashboard, marketers can adjust their campaigns in real time to improve results. Marketers can also add input information on how much they spend on particular campaigns to calculate return on investment of a campaign.
The 11 person-company is planning to release new features soon, including a landing page creator to make it easier for marketers to build landing pages and integrate them with SourceMetrics.
Salads have rarely been so expensively dressed after a combination of drought and disease pushed the price of olive oil up 10% so far this year, amid warnings from suppliers that harvests are the worst they have seen.
The Italian government has declared a “state of calamity” in the provinces of Lecce and Brindisi on the heel of the country, where olive groves are being attacked by a bacterial disease nicknamed “olive ebola” . Up to 1m centuries-old olive trees could be felled in one of the most picturesque tourist spots of Italy in an attempt to contain the problem.
Price of olive oil soaring after worst harvest in over a decade Read more
The cost of the raw material has been increasing for two years as crops have been hit by drought in Spain, the world's biggest producer of the oil, and the bacterial disease Xylella fastidiosa, which is destroying trees in Italy.
Analysts are expecting prices to remain high in coming months as demand is increasing. Retailers and distributors wanted to buy 12% more olive oil than exporters were able to deliver last month, according to industry insiders. Buyers in Latin America have turned to Europe in the wake of poor harvests over the Atlantic, while eastern Europeans have also been using increasing amounts of olive oil.
The next harvest from southern Europe is not expected until September, but fears of a third poor harvest in a row in Spain and Italy continue to push up wholesale prices of remaining stocks over the summer. The other two large olive oil producers, Greece and Tunisia, had good yield and production, but not enough to compensate for Spain and Italy.
In the UK, heavy price competition between retailers, led by the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl, has helped keep prices relatively low for shoppers. But this year, retailers and processors have been forced to pass on increases as the cost of the raw material from Italy has hit a 10-year high. The average retail price of a litre of extra virgin olive oil has risen from £6.32 in December to £6.95 this month, according to data from trade journal the Grocer.
One olive oil supplier told the Guardian: “Retailers and suppliers hold a lot of stock and contracts are signed for six months or a year, so volatility in the market can take a while to feed through to supermarket shelves. Retailers absorbed price rises earlier in the year because they were pegged by discounters but there has been absolutely no letup and we're now in a crisis situation.
“Until this year I would have said this was just the vagaries of the olive oil market. But nobody has seen it this bad. I don't know that I would go as far as to blame global warming but clearly three years of bad harvest would be almost unknown.”
The EU's health and food safety commissioner, Vytenis Andriukaitis, visiting southern Italy this week amid concern about the disease, which is also a threat to citrus and grape crops, said it was an emergency situation: “Every day matters. Because every day is a day in which we are putting the healthy olive trees of Puglia at risk.” The EU has warned that there would be serious consequences for supply chains if the disease spreads.

Olive harvests work on a cycle in which trees generally produce a strong harvest one year and then weaker results the following year as the trees take a bit of rest. Last year should have been a strong season in Spain, but fierce hot and dry weather meant yields were lower than hoped for. This year again, the country suffered from a dry and fiercely hot spring, when the olives flower, raising fears of another poor crop.
Lourdes Negrillo, from Vallejo, a producer from the Jaén province in southern Spain, said: “It didn't rain as much as it should've done in the spring and that doesn't help with the feeling about this next crop. I think that the new crop won't be as bad as last year but probably the olives will be smaller and have fewer quantities of oil. If it rains in September and October then we will get a bit more. It will be a different picture.”
Vito Martielli, an analyst at Rabobank, said good weather conditions during the next few months would be crucial for Spain: “In the coming months, prices are expected to be sustained and in particular the premium extranvirgin olive oil which is experiencing even stronger price increase in Italy.”
As part of its massive nationwide program of job cuts, cereal maker Kellogg's has announced that another 76 employees will lose their jobs in Maryland.
The breakfast food giant announced that it will close down its distribution center in Hagerstown, according to the Herald-Mail.
The facility located at 11841 Newgate Boulevard in the Hunters Green II Business Park is only one of the 39 distribution centers being shut down as part of a program dubbed “Special K” by the Michigan-based company.
“While this is the right move for the company to achieve our long-term objectives, it was a difficult decision because of its impact on employees,” Kellogg's spokesperson Kris Charles told the paper in February.
Kellogg's told the state employment office responsible to regulate mass layoffs of its move on May 26, the paper reported.
The announcements coincided with a 4.1 percent drop in sales during the first fiscal quarter.
“In the first quarter, we managed through an unusually challenging environment for packaged food companies, including a period of industrywide softening of consumption trends,” John Bryant, Kellogg's chairperson and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
Bryant added that the company had a “slow start” but that despite that, “it is expected to improve for the second fiscal quarter ending in August.”
The company is also facing a lawsuit filed by the thousands of distributors and truckers who face financial devastation due to Kellogg's new distribution plan.
At the beginning of the year, Kellogg's began the process of closing dozens of distribution centers and laying off as many as 11,000 workers, but contractors are soon to file a lawsuit, as they claim that Kellogg's did them wrong with the abrupt shift in its supply chain system.
Supply and shipping industry journal SupplyChainDive.com recently reported that a group of sub-contractors, who bid for and won work as drivers and distributors, are filing a class action lawsuit over Kellogg's new business plan. The lawsuit will charge the breakfast food giant with a breach of contract, wrongful termination of contracts, and lack of fair dealing, an attorney's letter said.
Kellogg's has already laid off thousands of workers during the last two months. To name a few, almost 500 were fired in North Carolina, nearly 300 were fired in facilities in New York, and another 219 lost their jobs in Minnesota. Another 500 were laid off in Pennsylvania.
The cereal giant's troubles also come on the heels of the company's decision to pull its advertising from Breitbart News. As it pulled advertising from the popular news site last November, company spokesperson Kris Charles said Breitbart News and its 45 million readers “aren't aligned with” the cereal maker's “values as a company.”
The move prompted Breitbart News to launch its #DumpKellogg's petition, which has been signed by more than 431,000 people.
Kellogg's attack on Breitbart Newsreaders also came amid widespread allegations of racism toward its factory workers and profiting from the use of child labor.
Reportedly, Kellogg's politically motivated non-profit has close ties to billionaire George Soros, Black Lives Matter, and deceased Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.
The left-wing campaign to coerce companies to pull their ads from Breitbart News has had “little to no impact” on the organization, Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow said in a November statement. But it does show contempt for customers who lean to the center-right in the American political spectrum.

When Ukip won the Clacton byelection and almost gave Labour a bloody nose in Heywood and Middleton earlier this month, Nigel Farage suggested their party was on an unstoppable upward trajectory.
Yet last Thursday, a mere fortnight after those electoral coups, Farage's deputy, Paul Nuttall, found themselves addressing an almost empty public meeting in Sheffield, the heart of Ukip's next electoral battle. “This is Labour heartland,” they boomed at rows of vacant seats in the Victoria Hotel ballroom. “But we can win here.”
This Thursday, a week before the people of Rochester and Strood decide whether to re-elect their former Tory MP, Mark Reckless, on a Ukip ticket, one million people in South Yorkshire will go to the ballot box to vote for their new police and crime commissioner (PCC). Or rather: one million people will have the chance to do so, in a byelection the Home Office estimates will cost £1.66m.
Two years ago, when the inaugural PCC elections were held, just 14.5% of the electorate in South Yorkshire bothered to turn out. That was depressingly respectable: in Staffordshire 11.6% cast their vote. This time the turnout could be even lower, thanks to a pernicious combination of fury, disgust, apathy and lack of awareness the poll is happening.
“I won't be voting,” said a 61-year-old woman from Rotherham at the Meadowhall shopping centre. “I don't believe in the position.”
They said they were “quite disgusted in the whole affair” that led to Thursday's vote, which was the resignation of Labour's Shaun Wright from the role.
Wright, former cabinet member for children on Rotherham council, made a belated resignation as PCC last month after the Jay report into child sexual exploitation revealed that authorities in the town had turned a blind eye to the abuse of 1,400 children.
On Wednesday one of those 1,400 victims told Sky News they wouldn't be voting and believed the PCC position should be scrapped. “They're on a very high salary which could be used for more useful things, especially in Rotherham with what's happened,” they said.
Last time Wright got 51% of the votes cast, meaning they won the £85,000 salary job on the first round. David Allen, the English Democrat candidate, came a distant second, on 16%, with the Tories third on 15% and Ukip fourth on 12%. If Labour's replacement, Church of England priest and former Sheffield council deputy leader Alan Billings, doesn't get more than 50% on the first round this time they could be in trouble: all three of their opponents represent more right-wing parties and so it's conceivable that Labour willpick up very few second preference votes (candidates eliminated in the first round have the second preference of their supporters allocated to the remaining candidates).
That – along with widespread anger at Wright and the Labour party locally generally – is why Ukip senses a chance at topping the poll. “This is an election we can win!” Nuttall hollered at that sparsely attended public meeting last week, reminding the 40 or so party faithful present that Ukip has come second in the two parliamentary by-elections in South Yorkshire since 2010 and in this year's European elections did better than Labour in Rotherham and Doncaster, coming a close second in Barnsley and Sheffield.
Nuttall said they had personally ensured that “serious money” was being spent on the campaign by Ukip – a necessity to have an attempt at reaching the huge electorate in South Yorkshire. There has been no freepost mailout sent to every household on the electoral roll. Instead, after paying their £5,000 deposit, the four candidates were invited to submit a 300-word mission statement to a booklet which has been placed in libraries and GP's surgeries, as well as on the www.choosemypcc.org.uk/ website.
Lobbying such a large constituency requires deep pockets and a large army: Ukip reckons it will have printed and delivered 100,000 leaflets during the four-week campaign as it tries to deliver victory for its candidate, Jack Clarkson, a 57-year-old ex-police officer. Clarkson's leaflets say they will “build a police force you can trust again” – though their critics say their service in South Yorkshire police for 30 years was at the time of many of the force's darkest days, including the miners' strike, the Hillsborough disaster and the child sexual exploitation scandals. After their retirement in 2006 they spent four years as a Liberal Democrat on Sheffield council, before leaving over tuition fees and control orders; they were re-elected on a Ukip ticket in May.
They insist they will act independently despite the obvious conflicts of interest which will arise given their past life. “I'm an honest man,” they said. “I have always served the public and done my best.” But critics say their ideas for clearing up the Rotherham debacle are muddled. During a hustings for Victim Support they claimed they want an “FBI director” to oversee an investigation by the National Crime Agency. (Arguably, just as bizarrely, their English Democrat rival, Allen, told the hustings they thought that the long disbanded Royal Ulster Constabulary should be brought in to investigate South Yorkshire police.)
Clarkson accuses their Labour rival, Billings, of hiding their past: on the Choose My PCC website Billings makes no mention of the 13 years they spent in the highest echelons of Sheffield city council, serving as deputy to the future home secretary, David Blunkett. “Nonsense,” said Billings of the accusation. “How could I hide 13 years?” But they prefer to dwell on what is their arguably more relevant experience as a member of the Youth Justice Board. They admit they had to be persuaded to stand: “In the Labour party quite a number of people were anxious as to what might happen. They wanted somebody with a certain credibility,” they said, admitting Blunkett had urged them to run.
Knowing they need to convince the electorate of their integrity after the row about Wright, Billings has pledged to give half of the PCC salary away to victims' charities.
The Conservative candidate is Ian Walker, a 55-year-old engineer from Sheffield, who has the advantage of having never been a South Yorkshire councillor or police officer. But in pledging to engage with “Muslim community leaders” and imams in Rotherham they appear to be making the same mistake as many before them – Jay's report despaired there was no attempt to engage the Muslim community beyond such leaders and imams. Walker also prefaced this pledge by telling the hustings they had “lots of Pakistani Muslim friends”, prompting some mirth among some Victim Support volunteers listening in the audience.
Whoever wins this election will probably be the party which works hardest to get its vote out. But it won't be easy, as many voters deliberately boycott the ballot. “I know it's happening but I'm not voting,” said Gordon Hawksley, 66. “It's a ridiculous arrangement, absolutely bonkers, having all these political candidates. I just want the man who can cut crime and sort the police culture out.”

LUCKNOW: In a fresh twist to the, the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board distanced itself on Wednesday from senior lawyer Kapil Sibal's plea before the Supreme Court that hearing of the Ayodhya title suit be deferred to July 2019. The board said it wanted the case to be decided at the earliest. Other litigants from the Muslim side, too, supported the board's view.Appearing for the Muslim side before a three-judge bench on Tuesday,promised a Ram temple in Ayodhya. They asked the court to postpone hearings to July 2019, by when the general elections would have decided the fate of the Modi government.He said that it was the most important litigation in the history of India and the case had widespread ramifications. UP Sunni Board chairperson Zufar Ahmed Farooqi said, “Sibal was not the advocate on record (AOR) for the board which is the original litigant in the title suit.  They are representing one of the private parties involved in the suit. Shahid Hussain Rizvi was our AOR in the Supreme Court.” They added that none of the board members supported the view that the case be deferred to July 2019. “We had no idea that any of the lawyers from the Muslim side would come up with such a plea,” they said.PM Modi brought up the developments in their rallies in Gujarat, saying, “. But is the Waqf Board going to contest elections?  They are clearly looking at loss or benefit for Congress.” Sibal accused Modi of misstating that they represented the Sunni Waqf Board in the SC and said they represented a private person and not the board. Sibal said they appeared on behalf of Iqbal Ansari, son of the late Hashim Ansari, the original litigant in the case. But Iqbal Ansari said Sibal sought deferment of the case to 2019 on their own accord and no such brief was given to them by any of the litigants. They also claimed Sibal was not representing any of the private litigants and might have been asked by their authorised lawyers to appear in the case.Asked if the Muslim side was considering disengaging Sibal from future hearings, Iqbal said, “All the Muslim litigants will soon sit together to discuss what has happened and put in place a strategy to decide what should be done in order to ensure that such things don't happen again.” They insisted that all litigants wanted an early solution and the parties should be given sufficient time to present their case.“We don't want the case to be taken up in 2019. We need just enough time so that all the parties could get the records that have to be tabled before the court,” they told TOI. “If we sought time it was only because we had not got all the records of the case that are to be placed before the court. Once our lawyers get the records, we are all for regular hearing in the case,” Iqbal said.

ANTI AUSTERITY ALLIANCE TD Paul Murphy has been released from garda custody this afternoon.
Murphy emerged from Terenure Garda station just after 3.30pm today to a small crowd of cheering supporters and spoke with the media alongside their party colleague Joe Higgins.
They had been arrested and questioned this morning by gardaí investigating the protests in Jobstown last November where Tánaiste Joan Burton was held in their car for over three hours.

Murphy was arrested early this morning and questioned by gardaí over allegations of false imprisonment. They released without charge and a file is being prepared for the DPP.
Speaking to reporters this afternoon, Murphy confirmed that six gardaí came to their home to arrest them at 7am this morning. They said they were civil but quite “forceful”.
They said that they engaged with gardaí in having their photo taken and other procedures but said they did not answer questions put to them by officers about the Jobstown incident on the advice of theirs solicitor.
Colleagues also arrested
Two of Murphy's party colleagues were also arrested early this morning and questioned as part of the investigation. They were released at around lunchtime.
The pair of AAA councillors Kieran Mahon and Mick Murphy – both of South Dublin County Council - have also been released without charge.

The fourth person arrested this morning, Éirigí's Scott Masterson, has also now been released.
A small number of protesters gathered outside Terenure station with homemade signs along with around 20 reporters, camera people and photographers prior to Murphy's release.
Earlier, Mick Murphy told RTÉ's Liveline upon their release that they were shown videos of the Jobstown protests by gardaí who questioned them this morning, including footage from the garda helicopter.
A Garda spokesperson said earlier that four males aged between 30 and 50 had been arrested early this morning.
They were detained at various southside Dublin Garda stations under the provisions of Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act.
Higgins told TheJournal.ie this morning that the Dublin South-West TD was arrested at their home at 7am.
“It's quite outrageous that they would take them from their bed at 7am this morning. These are ordinary, decent people. It wouldn't happen to a big financier. Six gardaí arrived at the door, that's a bit overkill don't you think?,” the Dublin West TD said.
Mokhtareizadh Farrah, the TD's partner, said Murphy had still been in their pyjamas when officers called to arrest him.
Jobstown
The Tánaiste was trapped in their car for over three hours on Saturday 15 November as they attempted to leave a graduation event at An Cosán — a higher education college.
Banging loudly on the vehicle, the protesters chanted “shame on you” and “peaceful protest”.
Burton was eventually escorted away by gardaí in a patrol car, after a tense stand-off with demonstrators that saw the Public Order Unit and dozens of back-up gardaí called in.
Two people were arrested on the day itself — but this morning's were the first arrests in connection with the follow-up investigation.
The Tánaiste — who was also struck by a water balloon thrown by Jobstown protesters at An Cosán— gave a statement to Gardaí the week after the incident happened.
Others caught up in the action have also given statements to investigating officers and Gardaí have also been trawling through video footage captured and uploaded to social media sites.
In the days after the incident, Murphy insisted the Jobstown protest had been largely peaceful.
“I don't need to apologise for anything that I was responsible for or involved in,” they told TheJournal.ie the following week.
Burton said language “heavily-loaded with sexual imagery against women” was shouted at them and their assistant while protesters clamoured outside the car.
“I was concerned if the [car] doors were opened what would happen next,” they added.

Speaking to RTÉ's Sean O'Rourke earlier, Anti Austerity TD Ruth Coppinger criticised what they said had been a “huge mobilisation of Garda resources to arrest three elected representatives”.
They said they didn't expect any charges to arise from the investigation, maintaining Murphy and their colleagues hadn't done anything wrong.
Coppinger also rejected suggestions that the development was “political manna from heaven” for their party.
Farrah (Murphy's partner) told Newstalk's Pat Kenny the politician had still been in their pyjamas when gardaí called, and that they asked if they could change.
They said they had been prepared for gardaí to arrive, and that they had to be prepared for every possibility.
Joe Higgins said that gardaí hadn't contacted Murphy in advance of their arrest.

In a statement this afternoon, Éirigí's Brian Leeson said Masterson had been arrested at their home at 7am as they prepared their two young daughters for pre-school and primary school.
“When Scott's partner returned to the house, having earlier gone to work, there were eight Gardaí in the house along with Scott and the two children. Scott was then arrested and made to stand in handcuffs on a public road for a number of minutes before being transported to Tallaght Garda barracks,” Leeson's statement said.
They said the arrests over the blocking of the Tánaiste's car smacked of political policing and had been designed “to cause maximum disruption to Scott, their partner and their young family”.

Paul Murphy: It would have been peaceful to hold Joan Burton for 12 hours
THERE is increasing confidence that Brett Emerton will become Sydney FC's new marquee signing - either before the transfer window closes next week or in January.
Though Sydney has been careful to avoid a direct approach to Emerton's English club, Blackburn, as they are still under contract for this season, it is believed their representatives are seeking to earn Emerton a release.
Blackburn's new owners are keen to trim the wage bill, though Emerton has not yet been told they can leave.
It had been hoped a settlement could be negotiated that would free them to return to the A-League, though Blackburn's shaky start to the season has muddied those waters.
Sydney will not pay a transfer fee, but sources say the club is very confident of landing Emerton.
Sydney chief executive Dirk Melton admitted the club would be keen to talk in principle. "We'd be mad not to want him," they said.
The Herald Sun revealed in May that Sydney had held talks with Emerton about their future, with the Socceroo keen to return to their roots.

NATIONAL (VFB) – It's hard to imagine someone seeing the picture and caption of Mark Maxey with Bernie Sanders in Oklahoma City and not feeling some sort of emotional response. When I saw it, I wanted to know more about Mark and what drove them to dedicate so much time and effort towards Bernie's election.
So I sent them a tweet. They responded, and after exchanging hellos, they gave me a call.
“We waited over 3 hours just to get in the door,” they recalled of the OKC rally. The event served as a culmination of just three weeks of fast-paced, nonstop GOTV efforts for Bernie. So how did Mark and other volunteers end up helping #TeamBernie pull out a victory in so little time?
“That first day in February we had a rally with field organizers. The next day I started volunteering, and it turned into 7 days a week, 12 to 14-hour days.”
“It wasn't just me,” Mark made sure to point out. “I can honestly say that in three weeks, I don't think I'm exaggerating, we had at least 1000 volunteers knocking on doors, phone banking and reaching out to the local public to spread awareness about Bernie's platform and issues.”
“In those three weeks, we literally took Oklahoma away from Hillary.”
“In those three weeks, we literally took Oklahoma away from Hillary.”
For a number of years until last fall, Mark worked for a local Methodist Church. But when theirs and another church merged, cuts were made and Mark found themselves unemployed.
“I was unemployed about 6 months,” they told me. “I'd been flooding the market with my resume when a friend starting posting a lot about Bernie Sanders. So at that point I really dug deep to find out who and what Bernie was. I quickly understood that everything they were talking about, everything that they were for, was where my heart and mind had been for years.”
Once Bernie's campaign was up and running, “I went to their website and said, ‘Since I have time on my hands, let me just volunteer.'”
I asked Mark what drove a man like them to get engaged now in the Sanders campaign.
“People my age, I'm 53, it's getting harder and harder to find companies willing to invest their time in older Americans like me. Plus, being an ex-felon, although though my felony was over 20 years ago, there are still companies that won't even consider hiring me.”
“When I was in Folsom, myself and five lifers started the first prayer group with Father Thomas Keating. That's when we really saw positive changes in our lives and awakenings through meditation. Now similar meditation programs operate in 8 different prisons, and over 8,000 prisoners participate in meditation programs on a daily basis.”
“There really are programs out there that can turn prisoner's lives around and to be a part of that is not only humbling, but it really defines what Bernie Sanders is all about. They speak the truth about Criminal Justice reform, which we desperately need.”
Long before crossing paths with the Senator, Mark like many Americans had grown dissatisfied with establishment politics. “I had become very disenfrachinsed with the Democratic party, politics in general. I come from long line of Oklahoma Dems and party machines, I had to turn my back on it years ago, because of the unethical behavior.”
“Everything they were talking about, everything that they were for, was where my heart and mind had been for years.”
“At the rally I was one of the many, many volunteers. One of the staff told me to go up to ropeline and try to get picture with Bernie.”
“When they walked by I told them I had volunteered 84 hours a week.”
“With tears in my eyes I told them the reason I worked so hard is I want to make sure they are our next President.”
“He put their hand on my shoulder and said, ‘Thank you.'”
“I think that's part of the reason that the tears began to well inside me and fall down my face. That my whole life I have waited for a candidate with the moral and ethical fiber and the genuineness that they have.“
“That's the thing I like best about the Bernie Sanders' campaign, first and foremost, out of all the candidates that are running, they are the only genuine human being running.”
With Bernie's candidacy leading the way, Mark has never felt more optimistic.
“There is a real sense of hope that change is in the air.”
“You can sense it, and feel it.”
“We will change the face of America through Bernie and through the participation of all there grassroots people,” they announced.
“If an unemployed ex-felon can do this, then America can get Bernie elected!”

What is permaculture? For those of you who've only heard of the term in passing, and even for you seasoned “permies” who struggle to explain this exciting (and sometimes life-changing) idea to others, here's the gist in 7 points:
1. Permaculture is a Design System That Uses Ecosystem Principles to Meet Human Needs
Permaculture is an ecological systems theory. As author Toby Hemenway notes, while conventional thinking asks how we can meet our own needs, permaculture asks the broader question of how we can meet our needs while also taking ecosystem health into account.
Permaculture looks closely at how ecosystems work and condenses those functions into twelve general principles. These in turn inform our design decisions about shelter, food, water, energy, and waste management. They also rest on two fundamental assumptions:
Humans are a part of the planet and cannot be separated from it. Humans can be a positive force that leaves things better than we find them.
If we are willing to learn from and work with nature, we can make smarter decisions to inform how we live. These choices can prevent the wasteful use of fossil fuels or the unnecessary need for environmentally and economically costly foods. They can help us avoid living in areas prone to fires, droughts, and floods. They can help us tread more lightly on the environment while saving us money and keeping us healthier and happier in the long-term.
2. Permaculture Regards Humans as Part of the Solution
Human beings cannot live in a physical world without having an impact. We consume resources, generate waste, and alter our surroundings. But what we can do, as an ethical and responsible species, is to optimize that disturbance. As a global industrial society, we are very ignorant of the consequences of our actions and are causing a lot of damage. Permaculture offers us a framework and the tools to align our creativity with actions that can repair and regenerate both the natural and human world.
3. Permaculture is a Way to Reframe the World
At its core, permaculture is an optimistic discipline. Research has shown that negative thoughts can shut down our prefrontal cortex – the part of the brain we think and design with. If our mindset constantly revolves around doom and gloom, it becomes very difficult to find solutions to the environmental challenges we face in the twenty-first century. By looking to the wonder and complexity of nature, permaculture allows us to reframe problems as opportunities. In the natural world, disturbance brings about new cycles, niches, and possibilities for species to adapt and prosper. When we approach things with this optimism, problems become much easier to deal with. A popular permaculture saying:
“One never has a slug problem in the garden, but rather a duck opportunity waiting to be exploited.”
4. Permaculture is a Metric to Define Sustainability
Modern society's metrics for success are fundamentally flawed. Did GDP go up or down? Did quarterly result increase or decrease? Did employment rate rise or fall? As Steven Stoll writes in the Orion Magazine article, The Mismeasure of All Things, a lot of these indicators tell us nothing about the things that are truly important in life. They tell us nothing about ecosystem health and biodiversity, of farmer livelihoods or community cohesiveness. They offer us no advice on how to create a happier and healthier world.
In my opinion, we need new metrics to measure genuine success. Did we sequester more carbon than we emitted? Did we leave an area more species-rich than before? Did we grow a vibrant and thriving community? These are the things that truly matter, because we cannot thrive as a society without clean air and soil and community, no matter how large the GDP becomes.
Permaculture helps us establish many of these metrics. It helps us identify opportunities to make change and to inspire others. It promotes actions that increase diversity, health, and balance. There's a lot of exciting work that can be done through the permaculture lens.
5. Permaculture is a Systems Approach to Design
It doesn't matter what you're designing – permaculture's system approach represents a way of doing things differently. I've designed businesses, community groups, houses, and even laundry systems through a systems mindset. Permaculture design is universally applicable because it reflects how the real world, a world of interdependence and complexity, works. It makes available the tools for you to become aware of those connections, always with the big picture in mind.
6. Permaculture is a Set of Solutions
I've often said that permaculture is just one big solutions matrix. For any problem, there are a huge number of potential solutions. Permaculture provides you with the principles so that you can choose solutions that are optimized for you and your surroundings. An example in the area of home design:
What is most important – High thermal mass, high insulation , high thermal mass and insulation, or lightweight construction?
The solution depends on your needs: Which one will be most comfortable? Which uses the least energy? Which lasts the longest? Which has the lowest embedded and operating energy? Which is most suitable for your environment?
Examples in other design areas:
Compost tea or Compost Extract?
Wind power, Solar Power, Microhydro or Biomass?
Raised beds or not? Wicking beds or sunken beds? No-till or till-based?
Passive Solar greenhouse vs Gable style greenhouse?
It is this decision-making process, based on systems thinking and focused on optimization, that is invaluable to any project.
7. Permaculture is a Bunch of Disciplines Rolled Into One
Permaculture is engineering, physics, biology, anthropology and architecture all rolled into one. Obviously you don't become an expert in all these fields just by studying permaculture, but you can gain a solid foundation in these areas while gaining perspective on how human beings fit on this planet. With this broad knowledge base, you can get started designing around your life's needs while creating positive change.
As one of my friends once asked me, if the nuclear bomb is the most negative thing we have ever created, what is considered the most positive? I don't think we really know yet because we have only started to apply ourselves, and that is really exciting to me.

WILMINGTON, NC (WWAY) — More than a dozen vacancies, seven of which opened up in the last month, has WPD looking for applicants.
“We're in a tough business right now. The police profession right now is under a microscope like no other time in history,” said police chief Ralph Evangelous.
- Advertisement -
That is one of the reasons they said WPD and departments across the country are struggling to fill positions and keep officers on the job.
“No other profession in the world every time you're on duty you're always being watched, every second of every day,” said Evangelous.
They said the department has been working closely with city council over the last several years to help combat some of that by increasing pay, but it's not always enough.
“Some local sheriff's departments, and I'm not going to mention names, have hired away some of our best and brightest for substantially more money than they were making here. So that's a struggle for us,” Evangelous said.
So far in June alone seven vacancies have opened up in the department and Evangelous said over the past 18 months they have seen an “unprecedented number of retirements,” leaving about 17 jobs open right now.
“To recruit, hire, put them into the police academy, put them into field training, and get them out on their own somewhere from nine to 14-15 months,” Evangelous said.
They said they have two full time recruiters always reaching out to find new applicants. Evangelous said there is a new academy class starting in August and about 10 to 12 recruit officers will be in that class. They said they are trying to fill the rest of the vacancies with certified officers who already have police academy training.
These are five books people are talking about this week -- or should be:
1. The Mothers by Britt Bennett (Riverhead)
Bennett, just named by The National Book Foundation as one of its “5 Under 35” honorees, demonstrates their extraordinary talent in this debut novel. Set in a black community in Southern California, The Mothers focuses on a trio of friends coming of age and growing into adulthood. Partly narrated by a Greek chorus of “Mothers” holding forth — and providing moral perspective — from the Upper Room Chapel of an African-American church, this beautifully empathetic novel powerfully depicts life on intersecting fault lines of race, personal integrity, and loss.
2. Shock and Awe: Glam Rock and Its Legacy, from the Seventies to the Twenty-First Century by Simon Reynolds (Dey Street)
In this nicely titled study, Reynolds examines, in high style, Glam Rock's ascendance and enduring influence. A music aficionado who appreciates stars like David Bowie and Alice Cooper, and intellectual with a facility for thinkers like sociologist Erving Goffman and radical feminist Germaine Greer, Reynolds argues that Glam Rock resonated because it “wove together strands of the radical and reactionary,” and while it teemed with innovation in style, it was was also regressive in its escapism and flirtation with glamor. “Shock and Awe,” Reynolds argues, “is about sensation and mania as social facts, about mass hypnosis and mass hysteria as real phenomena in which thousands get swept up.”
3. El Paso by Winston Groom (Liveright Publishing/W.W. Norton)
Forrest Gump, the story of an amiable, intellectually limited man who witnesses the big events in American history, became a best-seller and a Oscar-winning film starring Tom Hanks. Nearly two decades after its publication, Groom has unleashed a new work of imaginative, peripatetic fiction. The 400-plus page novel El Paso, which is set during the Mexican Revolution, follows a Boston railroad tycoon with a huge cattle ranch in Chihuahua on a manhunt to rescue their kidnapped grandchildren. Groom infuses their story with real historic characters, including writer Ambrose Bierce, movie star Tom Mix, and socialist journalist John Reed, and sets it against the backdrop of war in the Sierra Madre. It is a rich and engrossing tale — something Hollywood will, no doubt, take little time to notice.
4. Cruel Beautiful World by Caroline Leavitt (Algonquin Books)
Disappearing young women are having a cultural moment — we are in an an era of literary gone girls — and so is the late 1960s. Both of these of-the-Zeitgeist phenomena are present in Leavitt's marvelous new novel Cruel Beautiful World. Leavitt brings to life the chaotic days of Vietnam War protests, the assassination of Martin Luther King, and the Manson murders as the setting for a complex story of the relationship between two sisters and a predatory teacher. The result is a captivating, timely-feeling thriller.
5. The Best American Short Stories 2016, Edited by Junot Diaz, Series Editor Heidi Pitlor (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt)
“On my way to the novel I fell in love with the short story,” writes guest editor Junot Diaz in their charming, modest, and winsome Introduction to the latest installment of this well-known annual anthology. Diaz chronicles their own struggles as a writer, and recounts how they learned their craft by studying short stories. This year's collection brings together fine stories by famous fiction writers like Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Karen Russell, familiar to readers of The New Yorker, but a great deal of the magic is generated by the appearance of less familiar names from publications like Missouri Review or Copper Nickel. Each of these outstanding stories is, as Diaz observes, a chance to listen “to some other lone voice struggling to be heard against the great silence.”
As a junior in college, Mitchell Trubisky produced impressive, if not dominant, passing stats. Here were the 2016 leading passers in the ACC:
While Trubisky had a very good year, both the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association and the ACC coaches only named them to the third team in the conference, behind Lamar Jackson and Deshaun Watson.
So you will be forgiven if the Trubisky hype train caught you by surprise. This wasn't exactly an Andrew Luck situation, or even a Tim Tebow or Johnny Manziel type of college star (to take a couple of examples of non-top 20 draft picks). But the Bears decided they had to get Mitchell Trubisky, sending the 3rd, 67th, and 111th picks, along with a 2018 3rd round pick, to the 49ers for the 2nd pick in the Draft.
How Much Value Did Chicago Give Up?
It's easy to value the 3rd, 67th, and 111th picks using the Draft Pick Value Calculator I created. Those three picks are worth 27.6 points, 7.8 points, and 4.6 points, respectively. For the 2018th 3rd, we have to take two extra steps: come up with an approximate draft slot and an appropriate discount rate. I decided to keep it simple: I used the 80th pick (i.e., the middle of round 3) and a 10% discount rate, which together values a 2018 3rd round pick at 6.0 points.
As you can see, to get Trubisky, Chicago gave up 46.0 points of draft value. Which is a ton of draft value! That's more than the first pick in the draft, of course. It's ever so slightly more than the 1st pick and the 38th pick! Giving up a top-3 pick plus three other picks that represent, on average, a mid-third rounder, is enormous. Especially for a player like Trubisky, who started for just one season in college.
What About Other Deals? Didn't The Bears Give Up Less?
This is true, too. There have been three other notable and similar trade-ups in recent memory, and the Bears paid the cheapest price of the four.
Eagles Trade Up For Wentz
In 2016, Philadelphia sent the 8th, 77th, and 100th selections in the Draft, along with a 2017 1st and a 2018 2nd, to the Browns for the second overall pick (i.e., the right to obtain Carson Wentz) and a 2017 4th rounder. The 8th, 77th, and 100th picks are worth 21.4, 6.9, and 5.3 points, respectively; if we value the 2017 1st as the 16th pick and with a 90% discount, and the 2018 2nd as the 48th pick and with a 20% discount, those picks are worth 15.2 and 7.9 points. That means Philadelphia sent a total of 56.7 points of draft value for Wentz and 4.1 points of value (the discounted value of the 112th pick in the 2017 Draft).
So Philadelphia paid a bit more to get the 2nd pick in the draft than the Bears did. Of course, just because the Eagles overpaid, and the Bears paid less than the Eagles, it does not follow that the Bears did not also overpay.
Rams Trade Up For Goff
But by comparison, the Rams trade for Jared Goff is even worse. Los Angeles sent the 15th, 43rd, 45th, and 76th picks, along with a 1st and a 3rd in 2017, to Tennessee for the first overall pick, and the 113th and 177th selections in the 2016 Draft. That turns into 66.6 points of value given up for Goff plus 6.1 points of value.
The Rams gave up 25.9 more points of value than they received, which is remarkable when you consider that unlike the Eagles and Bears, the Rams were trading for the the 1st pick (which is worth more than the 2nd).
And yet, this wasn't the worst trade, or even the worst trade involving the Rams.
Washington Breaks The Budget For RG3
In 2012, the Redskins sent the 6th and 39th picks, along with a 2013 1st and a 2014 1st, to the Rams for the 2nd pick in the draft, and the right to draft Robert Griffin III.
Even giving discounts of 10% and 20% on those two future picks, this was an enormous haul…. and it ignores that the 2014 pick turned out to be the 2nd pick in the draft (less exciting for Rams fans: it was used on Greg Robinson). Washington gave up an incredible 63.2 points of draft value for the right to select Griffin.
A detour for the Sanchize
There is one recent trade where a team jumped into the top 5 to take the first or second QB in the draft and the team trading up didn't get raked over the coals. That was when the 2009 Jets sent the 17th pick, 52nd pick, and three veterans to the Browns for the 5th pick in the Draft, and the right to select Mark Sanchez. It's tough to value those three players, and the nuance here is that Eric Mangini coached the Jets in 2008 and the Browns in 2009, so they were looking to add cheap players they liked from New York. Those three players were not impact guys: Kenyon Coleman, a run-stuffing DE who started 15 games for the Jets in '08 at the age of 28, Abram Elam, a journeyman safety who started 9 games for the '08 Jets at the age of 27, and quarterback prospect/preseason star Brett Ratliff, who never played in a regular season game.
Those players had value to Mangini, but I doubt New York could have traded them for much in the way of draft value; for purposes of this trade, I valued them as mid-5th, mid-6th, and mid-7th round picks. But either way, the Jets didn't give up a crazy amount to get Sanchez.
Of course, the Jets I am sure would have preferred to have given up much more in the deal if Sanchez had turned out to, you know, be a franchise quarterback.
So, Did The Bears Overpay?
Yes. That's clear. There's an argument to be made that overpaying is simply the cost of doing business, but one doesn't need to be in this sort of business. Chicago may be able to get back some of the departed draft value by one day trading Mike Glennon, but the Bears guaranteed Glennon $18.5M to have that option. Chicago did pay less than the Eagles, Rams, and Redskins did for Wentz, Goff, and RG3, but they also used more capital to obtain Trubisky than the Colts did to get Luck or the Bucs did to add Jameis Winston.
Even putting aside the fact that the conventional wisdom is that Trubisky would have been available to the Bears at 3, there appears to be a very real case of overconfidence going on in Chicago. Which, as you can see, didn't serve Washington or Los Angeles very well, either (and at least so far, the returns in Philadelphia on Wentz aren't great, either). In general, teams overvalue having the right to choose, particularly in a case where we are analyzing multiple top prospects at the same position. Chicago could have traded down a few spots, picked up additional draft picks, and grabbed Patrick Mahomes or Deshaun Watson, or well, any other quarterback in the Draft (DeShone Kizer was the only other QB selected between picks 15 and 75).
Remember, we have some evidence that Trubisky wasn't a Luck-type prospect, and not just from watching their college tape. The Browns, who were in more dire need of quarterback help than the Bears, didn't think Trubisky was worth the 1st pick. The 49ers, who are more desperate for a quarterback than Chicago, didn't think Trubisky was worth the 2nd pick in the draft. So the fact that the Bears thought they were worth the 1st overall pick and the 38th overall pick is a sign that perhaps Chicago was overvaluing how good Trubisky is, or was overconfident in how likely it is that they will turn out to be a star.
Chicago could have likely moved down, picked up a third round pick, and still had their choice of Mahomes or Watson (or, in theory, even Trubisky). Then the question becomes: is Trubisky worth more than Watson or Mahomes plus four third round picks? Given the history of quarterback evaluations in the Draft, you have to be extremely confident in your ability to beat the draft to say that the answer to that is yes.
The Girl Scouts of America organization is defending its transgender-inclusion policy. (Photo: LHB Photo/Alamy)
Those pint-sized radical feminists also known as the Girl Scouts are in trouble again — this time for their transgender-inclusion policy — and they've wasted no time in shutting down the haters. Though the national organization has formally accepted transgender girls into its ranks since 2012, it seems one conservative organization has either just heard the news or has been stewing about it ever since.
STORY: Boy Scouts of America President Says Ban on Gay Leaders Unsustainable
“A new Girl Scouts of America (GSA) policy states it will extend membership to boys who identify as girls,” notes the website of the American Family Association, a Christian-morals organization that's been labeled an anti-LGBT hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. “This means girls in the organization will be forced to recognize and accept transgenderism as a normal lifestyle. Boys in skirts, boys in make-up and boys in tents will become a part of the program. This change will put young innocent girls at risk.” The AFA then invites people to join the 38,000 who have so far signed its petition against the Girl Scouts' policy.
STORY: When Your 5-Year-Old Daughter Insists She's a Boy
The Girl Scouts, meanwhile, were quick to fire back in this latest chapter of its transgender-policy saga. “Girl Scouts has valued and supported all girls since our inception in 1912. There is not one type of girl. Every girl's sense of self, path to it, and how they are supported is unique,” wrote developmental psychologist and Girl Scouts' “chief girl expert” Andrea Bastiani Archibald on the GSA blog. “If a girl is recognized by their family, school and community as a girl and lives culturally as a girl, Girl Scouts is an organization that can serve them in a setting that is both emotionally and physically safe. Inclusion of transgender girls is handled at a council level on a case by case basis, with the welfare and best interests of all members as a top priority.”
The Girl Scouts would not comment further on the issue for Yahoo Parenting, but Bastiani Archibald did remind a CNN reporter, “Our policy is not new.”
The GSA's transgender issue first blew up nationally back in 2011, when 7-year-old Bobby Montoya, a transgender girl, joined the Girl Scouts of Colorado after initially being rejected. Them acceptance inspired a call for a Girl Scout cookie boycott, which in turn led to the GSA cementing its trans-inclusive policy. Similar controversies in Louisiana reportedly led to the disbanding of three troops there.
But the Girl Scouts organization, in general, is no stranger to controversy: In just the past few years, it's come under fire for issues ranging from selling cookies in front of a marijuana dispensary and honoring pro-choice politicians to hiring a gay punk rock singer as a spokesperson and screening a documentary on famous feminists.
The issue of transgender inclusion in general is also far from new, with protests about policy changes known to come from both sides of the political aisle, albeit for different reasons. Republican lawmakers and proponents of the Christian Right (including the Duggars) have battled against trans-inclusive bathroom and intramural-sports policies in schools across the country. But even more traditionally liberal groups, including some factions of the gay community, have long wrestled with the idea of transgender inclusion when it comes to altering the makeup of feminist, women-only spaces. Such battles have played out in places from Smith College — which just announced its historic policy change to begin admitting transgender women — to the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, a sort of feminist Woodstock that will hold its 40th and final event in August; some point to its long-controversial exclusion of transgender women as a contributor to its demise.
What it often comes down to, in the most basic sense, noted a recent New Yorker story, is this: “The elasticity of the term ‘transgender' has forced a rethinking of what sex and gender mean.” And the idea that something so fundamental can be changed, as Diane Sawyer noted in their historic interview with Bruce Jenner recently, can shake humans to the core.
GLOBAL sensation Ted Williams, the homeless man with the pitch-perfect voice, has been offered a role in a Jack Nicholson movie, Entertainment Tonight reported today.
The 53-year-old Ohio man has been flooded with job offers after showcasing their pitch-perfect voice in a YouTube video recorded by a Columbus Dispatch reporter.
 They are currently weighing up an offer as an announcer for NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers and was offered a commercial stint recording an ad for Kraft Macaroni & Cheese that will air on ESPN during the Fight Hunger Bowl on Sunday.
Now they may be making their way into Hollywood.
"As a matter of fact, Jack Nicholson had contacted one of my in-laws who happen to be in Columbus Ohio," Williams told entertainment news program ET.
"They're supposed to be making a movie in which Jack is playing opposite a disc jockey, which they would like me to portray in the movie."
The news comes after Williams reunited with their mother Julia Williams in New York today for the first time in 20 years.
Williams said, "Mommy, mommy" as they rushed to their mother in an emotional meeting at a Manhattan conference room, the Columbus Dispatch reported.
"My prodigal son has finally come home," their mother said.
Williams' rapid rise to fame thanks to the YouTube video that has received 11 million hits has taken the world by storm.
A Dispatch reporter saw Williams, who was born in Brooklyn, panhandling beside an Ohio highway with a sign saying they the God-given gift of a radio voice so they stopped by with a video camera.
Before making world headlines Williams had a lengthy rap sheet - according to law enforcement records - that landed them in several Ohio lockups on criminal charges including theft, robbery, escape and drug possession, CBS reported.
Williams admitted their shady past during an appearance on American morning news and talk show Today and explained that they turned to crime so they could afford their drug habits.
Each year when the NBA's freshly drafted rookies gather for the offseason photo-shoot during the summer, NBA.com surveys the group to get their thoughts on the league's current players, as well as predictions for the future of this year's incoming class.
While several topics were covered, one of the more interesting questions posed to the 36 rookies who were surveyed asked who was their favorite player in the league.
The winner in this category was Kobe Bryant.
From John Schuhmann of NBA.com:
1: Kobe Bryant, L.A. Lakers — 21.2 percent 2: LeBron James, Miami — 15.2 percent T-3rd: Kevin Durant, Oklahoma City & Dirk Nowitzki, Dallas — 12.1 percent T-5th: Kevin Garnett, Brooklyn & Chris Paul, L.A. Clippers — 9.1 percent Others receiving votes: Carmelo Anthony, New York; Vince Carter, Dallas; Tim Duncan, San Antonio; James Harden, Houston; Kawhi Leonard, San Antonio; Steve Nash, L.A. Lakers; Dwyane Wade, Miami
The outcome is interesting, for a variety of reasons.
Bryant is the game's most polarizing player; fans either love them or hate him, and there is rarely any in-between. Additionally, Bryant is known for their competitive nature and their scoring ability above all else. Last year in particular, they were caught on more than one occasion not playing any type of defense whatsoever.
Still, Bryant is one of the game's elite talents, even 17 years in. Despite LeBron James and Kevin Durant having more athleticism and pure skill at this point of their respective careers, it's great to see the future of the game appreciate all that Bryant brings to the table.
Eurogamer recently interviewed not one but six people from The Coalition about the technical aspects of the forthcoming (at least for PC) Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, and the site came back with a few interesting tidbits of information. The remake is one of the few that may actually deserve the name, since the devs are diving into the guts of the original game and, in a way, ripping the old renderer out and replacing it with a modern one that's shiny and chrome enough to make Immortan Joe salivate.
The Coalition says the PC version will be built with and optimized for DirectX 12, with an unlocked framerate and "a variety of graphics options." Not only that, the remake's textures were "re-authored with 4K in mind," possibly (and ironically) making this title one of the first "next-generation" PC games. The interview goes deep into the technical bowels of the project, and it's really good stuff. Heck, you know it's a good day when we're discussing illumination solutions and texture formats.
The team chose to use the original codebase and the latest version of Unreal Engine 3, ensuring the game would remain more or less playable from day one of development. Despite using UE3 at the core, the graphics engine has been massively improved. The team worked on parallelising the DirectX 12 renderer to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, and it's used some UE4 optimization features where possible.
The remake uses an updated version of Lightmass for HDR lighting, and the game's physically-based shading is based on the UE4 method, something which apparently has made life easier for the project's artists, who are already familiar with that technique. Although the artists increased the models' geometry by only 10 to 30 percent, texture detail has been increased, as well, a choice which is reportedly one of the biggest contributions to the remake's improved look. Too bad nothing could be done about the characters' oversized jaws and tree-trunk necks.
Climate change denial comes in various stages and varieties. Some bury their heads in the sand and deny anything is happening, some take it a step further and call it a ‘Chinese hoax', and some acknowledge that the climate is shifting but it's all due to natural variability. We're too small, too insignificant — a drop in the ocean — to alter the planet, the rhetoric goes. That's an odd thing to say when humans have totally altered the planet's environment, so much so that we're officially in the Anthropocene. There are only a couple of virgin forests left in the world and some of our cities stretch for hundreds of square miles.
Pre-humans: 0.01°C rate of change / century. Human-age: 1.7°C rate of change / century
It's true, however, that natural forces like the variability of the Earth's climate system or that of the sun have an influence on shifting climates, but scientists agree that human activity is the main driver for the major shifts in the climate we see all over the world. Just how much influence wasn't always clear, however, but we may now have an official figure. According to an international team of researchers who developed a new equation, human activity is driving climate change 170 times faster than natural forces.
In their paper, they write that for the past 4.5 billion years since our planet has been in existence, astronomical and geophysical factors have been the dominating influences on the Earth system. In the past few decades alone, however, humans “have driven exceptionally rapid rates of change in the Earth system,” the authors write in The Anthropocene Review.
“Over the past 7,000 years the primary forces driving change have been astronomical – changes in solar intensity and subtle changes in orbital parameters, along with a few volcanoes. They have driven a rate of change of 0.01 degrees Celsius per century,” said Professor Steffen, from the Fenner School of Environment and Society and the Climate Change Institute at the Australian National University (ANU). “Human-caused greenhouse gas emissions over the past 45 years have increased the rate of temperature rise to 1.7 degrees Celsius per century, dwarfing the natural background rate.”
To determine the impact humans have on Earth's system, Steffen and Owen Gaffney, from the Stockholm Resilience Centre, devised the “Anthropocene Equation.” Its final form is simple but it took into account rate of changes in the atmosphere, oceans, forests and wetlands, waterways and ice sheets, and biodiversity.
“The human magnitude of climate change looks more like a meteorite strike than a gradual change.”
“This is a bold statement. But viewed this way, arguments about humans versus natural causes disappear. In 2016, Earth experienced a massive El Niño event affecting the global climate. But this is balanced by the cooler La Niña – taken together, the net rate of change of the Earth system resulting from This is zero over a decade or so,” Gaffney explained in a blog post for New Scientist. “While the rate of change of the Earth system needs to drop to zero as soon as possible, the next few years may determine the trajectory for millennia. Yet the dominant neoliberal economic systems still assume Holocene-like boundary conditions – endless resources on an infinite planet. Instead, we need “biosphere positive” Anthropocene economics, where economic development stores carbon not releases it, enhances biodiversity not destroys it and purifies waters and soils not pollutes them,” they added.
This may not be the final word, but the order of magnitude seems right considering average CO2 levels crossed the 400ppm threshold — the highest it's been in 66 million years; only 150 years ago it was 280ppm. It's a useful thing to have, nevertheless, so people can have a sense of the kind of impact we're having on the Earth climate system.
“It shows that while other forces operate over millions of years, we as humans are having an impact at the same strength as the many of these other forces, but in the timeframe of just a couple of centuries,” said Steffen.
The researchers note that human societies need to transition to a carbon-neutral future if we're to avert a potential total collapse of human civilization. There is still time but it's running out fast.

Citing Italian explorer Christopher Columbus' abuse of Native American tribes, the Los Angeles City Council voted on August 30, nearly unanimously, to end the city's celebration of Columbus Day, traditionally held the second Monday in October. The holiday will be replaced with Indigenous Peoples Day, which will commemorate “indigenous, aboriginal and native people” of North America.
The move to eliminate Columbus Day was called “restorative justice” by one city councilman. Chrissie Castro of the Los Angeles City-County Native American Indian Commission argued before the vote was handed down ending all celebrations of Columbus would help to “dismantle a state-sponsored celebration of genocide of indigenous peoples.”
While Columbus' connection to the murder, destruction, and enslavement of some Native American groups is unquestionably immoral and unworthy of being celebrated, the decision to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day is more than a little ironic and another example of the rampant historical revisionism that has infected those who wish to erase those parts of American history they deem unworthy of being remembered.
Many of the indigenous people Los Angeles will now celebrate engaged in truly horrifying atrocities of their own. For instance, it is well known Mesoamerican tribes regularly practiced human sacrifice. As Richard Overy's Times Complete History of the World notes, European sources recorded the Aztecs made between 10,000 and 80,000 sacrifices in 1487 as a part of their dedication to the primary temple in Tenochtitlan. Many of the sacrifices involved ritualistic torture and abuse, including cutting the hearts out of live victims.
Many Native American tribes practiced slavery and held racist views of other tribes. Following wars, enslaved people who were lucky enough not to be sacrificed would often be forced to engage in small-scale labor. Some tribes would mutilate their slaves to keep them from escaping. Indigenous peoples throughout North America also engaged in brutal war tactics and infanticide, the murder of innocent children.
Additionally, Native American groups committed many unjustifiable attacks on American colonists. In March 1622, Powhatan warriors traveled to multiple colonial settlements in Virginia under the guise of wanting to engage in peace and trade. Once settlers opened their communities to the Powhatan, they were murdered in one of the bloodiest events in early colonial history. Roughly one-third of all Virginia colonists were killed in a single day.
Human sacrifice, slavery, racism, and the murder of innocent children — hardly sounds like a group worth celebrating by modern standards. And yet these are precisely the groups the Los Angeles City Council have determined to be worthy of recognition.
There's no excuse for the tremendous horrors inflicted on Native American tribes by some European settlers, just as there is no excuse for the numerous crimes against humanity committed by many of these same Native Americans against each other and against many innocent, peaceful colonists.
For some, that means these people should be relegated to the dustbin of history, forever labeled as unworthy of honor or respect. But such a view is shortsighted, foolish, and applied in a wildly inconsistent manner. There was no outrage, for instance, when Hillary Clinton accepted the Margaret Sanger Award in 2009, an “honor” named after a noted racist and proponent of eugenics.
Rather than ignore the flawed people of the past who have helped to shape America, we should celebrate their achievements while learning from their mistakes — always remembering the road to true progress is paved with humility. The only other consistently applied alternative would be to scrub from the public arena any mention of anyone who didn't live up to our modern standards, which, by the way, is just about everyone. And in the end, that might be what those behind this movement truly want: the complete destruction of the grand achievements of the Western world.
Corning today unveiled a new ultra-slim, flexible glass that the company hopes can revolutionize the shape and form of next-generation electronics.
Corning's Willow Glass is expected to be put to work on mobile devices, with the possibility of displays being "wrapped" around a structure, Corning said in a press release. The cousin to Corning's Gorilla Glass, Willow Glass can withstand temperatures up to 930 degrees Fahrenheit. It also allows for high-temperature, continuous "roll-to-roll" processes, similar to how newsprint is produced  an industry operation previously deemed impossible.
A curved display  think paper page-likecould become a reality, as well as more lightweight devices, according to Dr. Dipak Chowdhury, Corning division vice president and Willow Glass program director.
"Displays become more pervasive every day and manufacturers strive to make both portable devices and larger displays thinner," they said in a Corning-produced video (below).
The glass, just 100 microns thick, or about as thin as a sheet of copy paper, "could revolutionize the shape and form of next-generation consumer electronic technologies," Corning said.
During this week's Society for Information Display's Display Week in Boston, Corning demonstrated the glass's color filtering, showing its thin, lightweight capability, without being chemically reduced.
"The glass has a display-quality surface as a substrate for thin, light-advanced LCD and OLED," the spokesperson said.
The glass is "formulated to perform exceptionally well for electronic components such as touch sensors," Corning wrote in statement. Willow Glass will support displays on devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops.
The super-thin glass is currently manufactured in a sheet-to-sheet process, but Chowdhury said they expect Willow Glass to eventually allow customers to switch to roll-to-roll processing, what they called "a long-awaited industry milestone."
According to the spokesperson, the company is currently sampling rolls of Willow Glass to unnamed customers, and working closely with others in the industry to build the ecosystem for roll-to-roll processing.
Corning recently slapped its Gorilla Glass 2 on the face of the new Samsung Galaxy S III, toting a rough-and-tumble, scratch-resistant screen, according to SlashGear.

"Fly the W" has become an iconic rallying cry on social media and at the ballpark, front porches, downtown buildings and all manner of other places as the Cubs made their historic World Series run this year. Whether you take the meaning of the flag to be "win" or the success of the team in a more holistic sense, there is no doubt the symbol is now completely fixed in Cubbiedom. Like the team, the flag has an interesting and colorful history likely going back to the the Wrigley family's purchase of an island off the coast of Los Angeles, a shipping company and the constant changes at Wrigley Field. Here is a brief visual tour.
William Wrigley Jr. buys a California island The chewing-gum magnate purchases Santa Catalina Island, 26 miles off the coast of Southern California, for $3 million, or more than $41 million in today's dollars. It was sold by the Banning family, who built a shipping empire in California. "Part of the purchased package was a company that the previous owners had founded in 1884, Wilmington Transportation Co. ... all of Wilmington's vessels flew the white W on a dark blue background," said Michele Bestudik, historian and film liaison for the Santa Catalina Island Co. Wilmington is a neighborhood along the harbor in Los Angeles. This W flag was possibly flown aboard a steam ferry built in 1924 that chugged to and from William Wrigley's island off the coast of Los Angeles. The flag is signed by crew members from the Wilmington Transportation Company, which operated the ships. The signatures are dated 1933. (Lucy Ruggirello / Los Angeles Maritime Museum) (Bain News Service, William Wrigley Jr., Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. and Chicago Tribune archives)
Cubs take SS Avalon to spring training Wrigley moves the team's spring training to Catalina Island in 1921. The team takes the SS Avalon from Wilmington to Catalina Island. With a ballpark built for them, the Cubs would travel to the island for spring training from 1921-41 and then 1946-51. Formerly called the SS Virginia when it sailed the Great Lakes, this ship was bought by William Wrigley Jr. and renamed the SS Avalon. It was 263 feet long and capable of carrying nearly 3,000 passengers. (Santa Catalina Island Co.)
Wrigley continues to use W flag on Catalina One of Wrigley's additions to the island was the opening of Catalina Casino, and an invitation to the grand opening featured the W flag. "What's interesting is that the invitation was sent out by the Santa Island Catalina Co., which Wrigley chaired (since) 1919. Wrigley bought the Cubs in 1921 and the ballpark changed its name to Wrigley Field in 1926. This invitation with the W-wearing pirate was sent out in 1929. While there are missing links, I think this is a good piece of evidence to support the theory that the flag design was swiped from the Wilmington Transportation Co. flag," said Stephanie Arias, reference services manager at The Huntington Library in San Marino, Calif., which holds the Banning Co. records. (Banning Co. records addenda II, The Huntington Library, San Marino, Calif.)
Wrigley Field renovations includes flags Philip K. Wrigley — a shy, diminuitive leader who refused to add lights to Wrigley Field — assumed control of the team and ballpark after their father's death in 1932. In 1937, P.K. Wrigley decided to make some adjustments to Wrigley Field to create a better experience for fans — adding new bleachers, the iconic center-field scoreboard, a flagpole and ivy to climb up the outfield walls. They put a young Bill Veeck Jr. in charge of the beautification plan, who detailed this process in their 1962 autobiography: "There was only one promotional gimmick I ever got away with. Mr. Wrigley permitted me to install lights on top of the flagpole to let homeward-bound Elevated passengers know whether we had won or lost that day. The flagpole was on top of the new scoreboard, and at its summit I put a crossbar with a green light on one side and a red light on the other. The green light told the El passengers we had won, the red that we had lost." (Holabird & Root)
W flag appears in center field The actual date when the W flag flew over Wrigley Field for the first time is not known. "There were a lot of changes to the park between 1937 and 1938 — the building of new bleachers, a new outfield wall, a new scoreboard — the flying of a new flag apparently didn't warrant a mention with so much else going on," said Ed Hartig, the Cubs historian. (Chicago Tribune historical photo 1938)
Cubs program explains meaning The won/loss flags were referenced in a 1946 Cubs program, says Todd Radom, a contributor on logos, design and visual history for Sporting News. They picked up the program on ebay, and penned a guide to Wrigley's flags. Cubs historian Hartig adds, "That 1946 program is the only one with the Cubs W flag graphic." (Courtesy Todd Radom)
Changing colors Hartig says a conversation with a former Cubs front office staffer revealed the W flag changed colors several times during this time period. No photos were available of these differences, however.
Cubs in 1st place On July 2, 1967, the Cubs beat the Cincinnati Reds, 4-1, to tie with the St. Louis Cardinals to lead the National League. As Hartig recalls, some of the more than 40,000 fans on hand refused to leave until the Cubs' flag was placed atop the league standings on the flagpole atop the center-field scoreboard. Later, the yardarm light signaled a Cubs win and the W flag was raised. (Chicago Tribune archives)
The current design and Ernie Banks "Mr. Cub" Ernie Banks' No. 14 would be the first number retired by the team on Aug. 22, 1982. A white flag with blue pinstripes bearing their number and last name would be raised on the left-field foul pole. Hartig notes Banks' flag replaced a blue Chicago Cubs flag, and also prompted the team to switch the 'Win' flag to its current design, a white flag with blue "W." (Chicago Tribune archives)
Cubs host All-Star Game "Today we think of the W flag as being iconic ... but it wasn't always this way," Hartig says. Despite its 1982 design change, they say the Cubs' media guide continued to list this flag as being on a blue background through 1989. "With the Cubs set to host the All-Star Game (in 1990), the guide was revamped and at that time someone in media relations finally noticed that they failed to change the color scheme seven years earlier." Hartig notes the 1990 media guide had the correct flag color. Chicago Cubs manager Don Zimmer returns from the locker room to acknowledge the cheers of the crowd after the Cubs defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates, 4-1, in the final regular season home game at Wrigley Field on Sept. 24, 1989. Notice the W flag on its white background above the scoreboard. (Mark Elias / AP) (Chicago Tribune historical photo 1990)
Frequent flier: The L flag The Cubs finished last in the National League Central Division with a record of 68 wins and 94 losses. The "L" for loss flag flies again over Wrigley Field on Wednesday, April 16, 1997. At the time, the Cubs were 0-12 for the season. (Beth A. Keiser / AP)
Fans unfurl flag during N.L. Central-clinching game Hartig says the popularity of the W flag took off during the 2003 season — especially in the National League Central Division race. Video from the WGN-TV broadcast shows fans holding makeshift W flags made of posterboard and golf flags. (WGN-TV video posted on YouTube)
Both flags fly on same day On Aug. 3, 2006, the Cubs split a doubleheader at Wrigley Field against the Arizona Diamondbacks, which meant both the W and the L flags flew on the same day. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune)
Another N.L. Central title to celebrate W flags sprung up outside Wrigley Field when the Cubs clinched the National League Central Division on Sept. 20, 2008. For the first time since 1906, both the Cubs and the White Sox were in the playoffs. (Paul Beaty / AP)
A memorable run With a win at Wrigley Field on Oct. 20, 2015, the New York Mets swept the Cubs in the National League Championship Series. Mets fans turned their W flag rally towels upside down to celebrate. (Nuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune)
The attorney general of New York state is taking over an investigation into the case of a black woman who was found dead in a jail cell last month.
Raynette Turner, 42, was arrested for shoplifting on 25 July and was found dead two days later in their cell at Mount Vernon police headquarters.

The mother of eight was arrested on a Saturday, reported feeling ill on Sunday and was taken to an area hospital that night. They were brought back to the jail around 10pm that night, and found dead at 2pm the next day, when corrections officer came to collect them for their arraignment.
State attorney general Eric Schneiderman is operating for the first time under a new executive order signed into law in July by governor Andrew Cuomo. It requires the attorney general to be a special prosecutor in cases where an unarmed civilian death was caused by law enforcement.
Cuomo said in a statement that this case is exemplary of why they signed the executive order into law. “Ms Turner's death is a tragedy for their loved ones, and it raises questions not just from their family, but from their neighbors, elected officials, community members and the media – questions that deserve answers,” Cuomo said.
Turner's autopsy is pending. They had a history of hypertension and gastric bypass surgery, Mount Vernon deputy police commissioner Richard Burke told lohud.com.
The incident has also raised questions about why Turner was kept in police custody over the weekend over a minor charge instead of being released and summoned to court at a later date.
Them death has drawn comparisons to that of Sandra Bland, a woman who was found dead in a Texas jail cell after being arrested for a minor traffic violation. An autopsy said that Bland killed herself, an assessment that many are skeptical of – including their family and civil rights advocates.
Three other black women have died in police custody in the past month. Kindra Chapman, 18, was found dead in an Alabama police holding cell, where they were being held after the attempted robbery of a cell phone. Joyce Curnell, 50, was found dead at a South Carolina detention center after being detained for an outstanding warrant for shoplifting. And Ralkina Jones, 37, was found dead in a Cleveland jail where they were being held after their ex-husband called police to say that they were attacking him.
In case u missed it, James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong, center of 'Pizzagate' controversy, emphatically stated for the record yesterday on the Kojo Mnambi radio show that Comet Ping Pong DOES NOT HAVE A BASEMENT. https://thekojonnamdishow.org/shows/2016-11-30/pizza-propaganda-the-local-fallout-from-fake-news
Now, this is problematic because it contradicts the available evidence we currently have. Including James Alefantis themselves talking about canning 10 tons of tomatoes at Comet and storing them in said basement. Which can be found here in this Metro Weekly article. http://www.metroweekly.com/2015/04/from-scratch-james-alefantis/ http://archive.is/03Lhm
In addition to their own words previously confirming the existence of a basement, we also have this book, Boutique Restaurants, which documents the interior of Comet Ping Pong. The only available images are too low of a resolution to make out the description of the basement looking image. However, the space depicted is able to be assumed to be a basement area of the building. (Cant find the direct link to the book image right now but i have the image here) https://i.imgsafe.org/0a8a899ef3.jpg
Another puzzling piece of information is the listing of Comet, 5037 Connecticut Ave. on Propertyshark, has the number of stories of the building listed as '2'. Whether this could just be an indication of the height of the building, or number of actual floors is inconclusive.
http://www.propertyshark.com/mason/Property/11881126/5037-Connecticut-Ave-NW-Washington-DC-20008/ http://archive.is/9gzzh
Here is a second property information site (provided by a commenter here on this article) that also has 5037 Connecticut listed as a 2 story building.
https://i.sli.mg/HqeyxT.png
Other supporting evidence that lends a high probability of a chamber below Comet Ping Pong, is a confirmed basement level in a neighboring business, Politics and Prose (which is in the same building as Comet Ping Pong) Across the street there is Joe's Basement Bar, so we know buildings in the immediate vicinity have basements.
Images from James Alefantis' Instagram account show what appears to be construction work being conducted inside a basement area. https://i.imgsafe.org/0aab857046.jpg https://i.imgsafe.org/0aac970f94.jpg
Fox News biggest argument in favor of "debunking Pizzagate" was the statement of fact that "Comet Ping Pong does not have a basement"
I'll leave it to the reader, and the greater community to interpret the implications of these findings published above.
Protesters storm Le Havre square and clash with police in Paris as French PM says legislation will stand
French protesters scuffled with police, dockworkers set off smoke bombs and union activists disrupted fuel supplies and nuclear plants on Thursday in the biggest challenge yet to François Hollande's government as it tries to give employers more flexibility.
On a day of nationwide strikes and protests, the prime minister, Manuel Valls, opened the door to possible changes in the contentious labour bill but said the government would not abandon it. Union activists said it was too late to compromise. Posters at a protest in the port of Le Havre bore a blood-red tombstone representing the bill reading: “Not amendable, not negotiable: Withdraw the El Khomri Law.”
Why have France's labour reforms proved so contentious? Read more
The draft law, aimed at boosting hiring after a decade of nearly 10% unemployment and slow but corrosive economic decline, relaxes rules around the 35-hour work week, weakens the power of unions and leaves workers less protected from layoffs.
Determined to defend France's labour protections, union activists have targeted the strategic fuel industry in recent days, causing gasoline shortages. The country's two main oil ports were blocked on Thursday and only two of France's eight refineries were working, the head of the UFIP oil industry lobby, Francis Duseux, said.

“There could be improvements and modifications” in the bill, Valls said on BFM television. They didn't elaborate on what might be changed, and insisted that the “heart” of the bill – a measure weakening the power of unions over workplace rules – should remain.
Withdrawing the bill “is not possible”. they said.
Union activists and ordinary workers took to the streets in several cities. In Paris, police detained nine people and scuffled with masked protesters as several thousand people marched from the Bastille plaza through eastern Paris.
Members of the firmly leftist CGT union, leading the protests, remain angry that the government forced the bill through the lower house of parliament without a vote because of division in the Socialist majority.
“Valls is hardening their tone? Well we're hardening our tone, too!” an organiser shouted into a loudspeaker at the Normandy Bridge, in northern France, where 200-300 trade unionists and other protesters gathered to block traffic.
The union activists then made their way into the port city of Le Havre, waving red flags, a percussion band leading the way. At least 10,000 dockworkers and others poured into an esplanade in front of Le Havre city hall, setting off smoke bombs and threatening bystanders. They tossed powerful fireworks into the fountains, sending plumes of water rising into the air as the square reverberated with explosions.
Fabien Gloaguen, an activist with the Workers Force movement, said the government would have to back down.
Valls insisted the bill is “good for workers” and small businesses, and argued that many of its critics were ill-informed of its contents.
In addition to loosening rules about the 35-hour work week, the bill makes it easier to fire workers in times of economic downturn, and weakens the power of unions to set working conditions across an entire sector.
The stakes are high for both Hollande and the unions. The president is hopeful of being re-elected next year, despite being deeply unpopular, and needs to show they have the strength to push through reforms. The unions are fighting for relevance, having lost membership in recent years.
Union revolt puts both Hollande's future and France's image on the line Read more
“We're at an interesting juncture. If the movement finishes once more in failure, it might make further mobilisation more complicated,” said Stephane Sirot, a historian of the French union movement at the University of Cergy-Pontoise.
They said it's been decades since a leftwing government has been confronted with a nationwide strike of this magnitude.
Two months of protests escalated over the past week as unions targeted the sensitive oil industry, blocking fuel depots and refineries.
The government has started using its strategic fuel reserves and forcing depots to reopen, but supplies remained spotty Thursday, with long lines and caps on purchases.
Drivers endured long waits to reach gas pumps, railing at the strikes, the government and the overall funk in France. Prices have risen noticeably at gas pumps and some stations are rationing.

But at the blocked Normandy Bridge, at least one pair of travellers said they did not mind.
“It's for us that they're doing this,” said Jean-Luc Geraert, whose van was caught behind the makeshift barricade. Geraert, a 55-year-old industrial painter, said the situation would get worse if the government does not back down soon.
A vegan friend of mine made dinner last week. As they cleared our plates, I noticed a sad angle in their mouth, and asked what was the matter. “I'm still hungry,” they said, “but I'm so sick of nuts and fruit.” They noticed my confusion and continued. “I know vegans can't eat dairy, but I miss dessert.”
I don't care what special diet you're restricted to, or volunteered for: there can always be dessert. The next day I got my Kitchen Aid out, apron on and started to bake – vegan dessert.
When I think of dessert, I think of cake. Contrary to popular belief, non-dairy cake can be absolutely rich and mouth-watering. This amazing vegan cake recipe is even gluten-free, with a mix of rice flours, potato starch, and almond flour that gives it structure along with moist texture. These luscious chai mini bundt cakes are spicy, sweet and coated with a wonderfully complimentary coconut icing; bound to satisfy any sweet tooth.

B.A.P's Daehyun and Himchan Pose with ‘Grazia'
Ben Cho, March 20, 2017, 8:18 a.m.
B.A.P members Daehyun and Himchan recently struck a pose wearing matching prints for ‘Grazia' fashion magazine! The two rock completely different styles and looks, and they both show off their best impression of the perfect boyfriend. In regards to their upcoming concert they commented, ‘We wanted to talk to our fans more, so we decreased the number of songs we're going to perform. It's going to be like a concert and a fanmeeting at the same time.'
B.A.P (an acronym for Best Absolute Perfect) is a South Korean boy group formed in 2011 under TS Entertainment. The group's six members are Yongguk, Youngjae, Daehyun, Himchan, Jongup, and Zelo. B.A.P made their musical debut with the single "Warrior" on January 27, 2012, followed by the release of their debut EP Warrior in February 2012.
Creator Skyler Page and creative director Nelson Boles spread good vibes with their original series Clarence.
With the glut of fantasy-driven kids' content riding the airwaves the last few years, a cartoon centered on the ordinary adventures of a simple neighborhood kid would seem a breath of fresh suburban air. Meet Clarence, the lovable eternal optimist whose eponymous show is the latest 2D animated comedy to join Cartoon Network this month.
The series celebrates the joys of childhood without magical embellishment or talking animals. Whether Clarence and their buddies (overly-cautious Jeff and unpredictable Sumo) are tackling epic dirt fights, awkward crushes, trampoline combat or prank-filled sleepovers, the gap-toothed hero finds wonder in the everyday.
“I think our show is pretty clearly striving to be realistic … keyword ‘striving,'” says first-time show creator Skyler Page, who also voices the main character. “It seemed like the market was pretty flooded with fantasy and random humor, and I remember a lot of shows when I was growing up that were more poignant, with more relatable situations … real characters who can't use magic to get out of their problems. I felt like there was a need for that, and that was our focus driving the show.”
The young artist was aided in developing Clarence by the show's creative director, Nelson Boles, whom they met while studying animation at CalArts (the two bonded over a shared love of Ren & Stimpy their first year). They begin developing the concept a while ago, but when Page landed a job at Cartoon Network and found out the studio was looking for ideas for its shorts program, it was full steam ahead. This turned into a pilot which earned the duo a greenlight — and a little more time to sharpen things up!
The Amazing Ordinary!
From a two or three-person crew polishing the pilot, Page — who previously served in storyboarding and writing departments for Adventure Time and Secret Mountain Force Awesome — now finds themselves in command of a local team of 30-35 writers, storyboarders, designers, colorists and revisionists at Cartoon Network Studios. Animation service work for the show is done by Saerom in Korea. While Page and Boles are a bit harried by the production schedule to give accurate estimates, they guess the show order is about 60 percent finished.
Page points out that though Clarence is “the little taste of reality in a sea of fantasy,” there's still room in their show for imagination. “Everyone gets tired of reality, we get enough of it in real life,” they joke. “So, there's some fantasy in our show, too. One thing I like is we can do both and show the incongruity of the two — show a character's ideal version of a situation and then what's actually happening.”
This blending of the realistic and the fantastical is reflected in the show's design, which favors ordinary (or even downright unappealing) locations made inviting with cartoony flair. And the character designs also teeter back and forth between the scales of probability.
“With all the characters, it's almost like the inconsistency is the consistency,” says Boles. “Some look like Muppets, some look like they're from Steven Universe, but the art direction ties it all together. The way we justify it to ourselves is, the world is full of different looking people.” Boles adds that they showrunners wanted to avoid the Simpsons effect where every character has to look just right to fit in to the existing animated world.
Page adds that another show philosophy is to treat background characters with care, making sure whatever they are doing on-screen is memorable. The old schoolmates add that they are always looking for ways to take these smaller roles and use them to expand Clarence‘s story possibilities. “Another thing we're trying to push with the show is there's not just three main characters and everyone else is just there for a joke,” adds Boles. “Everyone has a chance to hang out with everyone … the world gets bigger and bigger.”
Fans of old school cartoons will appreciate Clarence‘s emphasis on character-based and physical humor. Clarence, after all, is not all that aware of how clumsy they are and frankly doesn't care how ridiculous they look (a trait we should all be jealous of). Whether he's sneakily tiptoeing about while managing to knock over everything around them or flagrantly violating Jeff's personal space, it's all part of the plan as far as Clarence is concerned.
When asked about the toughest part of producing their first show, Page says while they love every minute, the pace is hard to get used to: “Once you do an episode, and it's really good and you're proud of it, you have to start over. Every time. It's exciting, but it's very challenging.”
Page and Boles list John Kricfalusi's Ren & Stimpy as well as King of the Hill and SpongeBob SquarePants (a few veterans of which are on the Clarence staff) and the feature work of Phil Lord and Chris Miller as their top animation inspirations. But when asked for advice for other upstart cartoonists, they say being true to yourself is the key.
“Don't do what you think other people are looking for, just do what you think is funny and cool,” Page summarizes. “…And don't edit yourself, because if you ever do get a show, they will edit you.”
Clarence premieres Monday, April 14 at 7 p.m. on Cartoon Network.
Badgers Blog The Latest news, analysis and links on UW football, basketball and other sports SHARE
By of the
Madison – First-year coach Gary Andersen acknowledged recently they wanted to add a quarterback to Wisconsin's 2013 recruiting class.
The Badgers finally landed a prospect on Monday when Tanner McEvoy, a 6-foot-6, 215-pound dual-threat quarterback from Arizona Western College, chose UW over Florida and Oregon.
McEvoy, from Hillsdale, N.J., is expected to join UW in preseason camp. They will have three seasons of eligibility.
“We are a multiple offense," Arizona WC coach Tom Minnick said by phone Monday. "He is a very accurate passer and a good athlete...They're getting a good one in Tanner."
McEvoy signed with South Carolina out of high school and redshirted in 2011. They entered preseason camp last summer No. 4 on the depth chart at South Carolina and transferred to Arizona WC, located in Yuma, Ariz., before the opener.
Their transfer came less than two weeks after they were arrested in North Carolina and charged with speeding and driving after consuming alcohol while under 21. The state of North Carolina does not allow a driver under the age of 21 to have any alcohol in their system. McEvoy posted a $250 bond for the two misdemeanor charges and was released.
Minnick said they encountered no problems last season with McEvoy.
"None," they said. "He is a great kid and a hard worker."
McEvoy helped Arizona WC to an 8-2 record last season. That included a 42-37 victory over Nassau Community College in the El Toro Bowl on Dec. 1 in Yuma, Ariz. McEvoy completed 18 of 24 passes for 245 yards and three touchdowns and rushed nine times for 51 yards.
McEvoy started the last nine games and reportedly passed for more than 1,500 yards, with 21 touchdowns and only three interceptions.
Minnick compared McEvoy to Kansas State quarterback Collin Klein.
Klein passed for 2,490 yards and 15 touchdowns and rushed for 890 yards and 22 touchdowns as a senior to lead Kansas State to an 11-2 record.
"We used them in a variety of ways," Minnick said. "He is 6-6 and can run.  They are exactly like the kid at Kansas State but a better athlete and a better passer."
McEvoy will join a crowded field for the No. 1 quarterback job at UW. The Badgers return Joel Stave, Curt Phillips, Danny O'Brien, each of whom started last season. Bart Houston and Chase Knox, both of whom redshirted last season, are also back. Jon Budmayr, who has missed each of the last two seasons because of injuries, is also expected to compete for playing time.
So how did Andersen and their assistants, three of whom came with them to UW from Utah State, find McEvoy?
According to Minnick, Utah State routinely evaluated players at Arizona WC.
Then-Utah State assistant Bill Busch was at Arizona WC last fall and saw McEvoy play.
"He was impressed by how accurate Tanner was and how athletic they are," Minnick said. "They didn't need a quarterback but when they switched to Wisconsin they decided they needed a quarterback."
I've been using my slow cooker more and more lately. I guess my laziness has increased? Who knows. What I do know is, fajitas are pretty easy to make. And fajitas in the slow cooker are so easy a two-year-old could manage (you might not get your vegetables cut into neat little strips like mine, but I bet they'd make it into the slow cooker eventually).
By the way, it's fa-hee-tas, not fa-ji-tas. Just in case you were wondering.
(I know you weren't, but I wanted to elbow that reference in somewhere. Sorry)
By the way: what's the difference between fajitas and tacos? I literally have no clue. I know tacos are often eaten in hard shells, so I guess that's one difference, but you can get soft tacos too, right? Which are surely just fajitas? I don't know. Maybe what I've made here are actually tacos. It's all a mystery to me. I don't really mind though, because it all tastes amazing. If I was on death row (which… hopefully will never happen, especially since capital punishment doesn't happen in the UK), my last meal would definitely involve some sort of Mexican food.
Soft flour tortillas, vegetables, cheese… you really can't go far wrong.
If only I'd had some sour cream to dollop on top, these would have been perfect.
Remember, the filling of a fajita (/taco? I don't know, I've confused myself) is just the beginning – make sure you get loads of toppings on there too. I was pretty restrained with my fresh coriander and grated cheese, but I'm thinking you could go for some big slabs of avocado, maybe some salsa… yum.
You can totally make these vegan by the way, just forego the cheese or use a vegan substitute (I'd recommend the latter, since fajitas without cheese are like pizza without cheese, i.e. probably fairly tasty, but a bit pointless in my eyes).
Slow cooker veggie fajitas Print Prep time 10 mins Cook time 3 hours 30 mins Total time 3 hours 40 mins Author: Becca @ Amuse Your Bouche Recipe type: Main meal Yield: 2 Ingredients 1 onion, halved and then thinly sliced

Venezuela is being sucked into a political and social vacuum because neither its local leaders nor regional players have the slightest idea where the country of 30 million people should be heading or how to get there.
The awful probability is that the vacuum will be filled by violence. That's usually what happens when human societies lose their way.
For over a month Venezuela's cities have been in turmoil as supporters of the opposition Democratic Unity Movement (MUD) alliance demand that President Nicolas Maduro be removed and that new presidential elections be held.  They are accused at home and abroad of creating an authoritarian regime, filling the jails with political prisoners, gross incompetence and corruption in managing the economy of one of the world's major petro states, and of standing idly by as the country's people suffer from shortages of food, medicines and all the basic necessities of life.

Maduro and their United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) shout back that they are the victims of a plotted regime change orchestrated by Washington in partnership with Venezuela's business classes.
Over 30 people have been killed and hundreds injured in these demonstrations, with both the protesters and the authorities ratchetting up the level of force and violence day by day.
Venezuela has been heading for a cataclysmic denouement since the death of its strutting rooster leader Hugo Chavez in 2013. Indeed, many people, both among Venezuela's opposition parties and its despairing neighbouring countries, would argue that the country's collapse began when Chavez came to power in 1998.
Maduro was Chavez' Vice-President and took over when Chavez died of cancer on March 5, 2013. The collapse of oil prices and loopy economic policies based on Chavez' ignorant but melodramatic devotion to the 19th Century South American “Liberator” Simon Bolivar have accelerated the collapse. The PSUV lost control of the National Assembly in December elections last year and fears, with good reason, that in anything like a free and fair election voters would take the presidency from them too.
So Maduro is writhing like a trapped python. In March, the Supreme Court, which is controlled by Maduro and their supporters, moved to dissolve the National Assembly and assume the legislative powers itself. Maduro was forced to backtrack after an international outcry, though the National Assembly remains largely powerless.
One of the main critics of the Maduro regime has been the Organization of American States (OAS). Last year the OAS brandished its Democratic Charter and rebuked Maduro for smothering opposition, locking up political opponents and ruling by decree.
Late last month the Maduro regime announced it will pull out of the OAS, an exit that will take two years to complete.
On Monday, in their efforts to complete the neutering of the National Assembly, and to ensure they are not subject to recall and a new presidential election, Maduro announced they would invoke Article 347 of Chavez's 1999 constitution. Maduro said they will convene a “citizens' constitutional assembly to advance state reforms and a national peace agenda.”
Calling the assembly, Maduro said, was necessary to “defeat fascist attempts at a coup” through invoking the sovereignty of the people to “impose peace, harmony, and true national dialogue.”
What exactly that means and what sort of institutions or processes the assembly will produce is anyone's guess. What seems certain is that Maduro aims to conclusively sideline the National Assembly and create in the citizens' assembly an alternative legislative body.
The assembly will have 500 members who will be selected from among peasant and grass roots organizations, which, for some unfathomable reason, mostly remain loyal to the fantasy of the “Bolivarian Revolution” spun by Chavez in their hypnotic four, five and six-hour speeches.
All this could be dismissed as farce and comedy if the opposition was at all co-ordinated, and had a coherent vision of where it wants Venezuela to go and how to get there. But it does not.
The unfortunately named MUD is a “roundtable” coalition of 15 political parties. These range from insignificant, but charming parties like the Fearless People's Alliance, to heavy-hitters like Voluntad Popular, Primero Justicia, Vente Venezuela, and Democratic Action.
However, MUD members have been unable to develop a clear strategy for what they want and how to get there. For example, recent demands from various MUD members include the resignation of Maduro, immediate national elections, immediate elections for state governors, the release of political prisoners, the jailing of Maduro and their senior officials, and even that the United States be invited to remove Maduro.
Former U.S. President George W Bush did conspire with Venezuela's business leaders and elements of the military in 2002 to remove Chavez. But after only 47 hours out of office Chavez was returned to power by a combination of loyal military officers and mass peasant demonstrations.
Bush was never that enamoured of the Venezuelan adventure and Donald Trump might be even more unwilling to assist in the removal of Maduro.
One of the more entertaining stories to emerge from the Venezuelan cataclysm is that Maduro's government stumped up $US500,000 to help finance Trump's inauguration. The story is all the more delightful because it also involves the Russian oil giant Rosneft, and seems to have been a spin-off from the belief in the Kremlin that Trump was a friend who would soon lift sanctions against Russia.
Venezuela's state oil company PdVSA is, like the rest of the economy, in need of life support. For PdVSA this comes in loans from Rosneft. But in January PdVSA had to offer Rosneft a 50 per cent stake in its U.S. subsidiary, Citgo Petrol, as collateral for a $US1.5 billion loan. However, Rosneft could not take control of Citgo, which owns oil terminals, pipelines and three refineries in the U.S., because of Washington's sanctions against the company and its chief executive, Igor Sechin, stemming from Moscow's support of Ukrainian separatists and its annexation of Crimea.
Soon after, Citgo made the $US500,000 donation for Trump's inauguration celebrations, according to a report by the U.S. Federal Election Commission. Citgo was apparently the vehicle for the donation because as a U.S. affiliate, it avoided the ban on foreign donations for these kinds of jollifications. And because of sanctions, the Russians couldn't directly stuff money into Trump's accounts. But it remains a question whether this money was a gift from Maduro or from Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Trump and their Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, are intent on castrating the State Department. Senior desk officers responsible for Western Hemisphere affairs are yet to be appointed in the department. The result is that there is no coherent view on Venezuela on which members of Congress can base opinions. Even the Pentagon – apparently Trump's preferred agent of foreign policy – has put forward various options such as direct intervention, sanctions and diplomatic leverage through the OAS.
With Maduro's withdrawal from the OAS the chances of that being a useful channel for a negotiated settlement appear to have shrunk to nil. Another regional organization, the South American Union, has made some approaches to Caracas, but with little result. Mercosur, the free trade organization for South American countries, has suspended Venezuela's membership, so its ability to influence Maduro is very limited.
Venezuela called a meeting of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States on May 2 to try to get a vote of support for Maduro's constituent assembly ploy, but too few delegates turned up for Caracas to succeed.
There are some efforts to promote a negotiated settlement by neighbouring countries that continue to support Maduro – Nicaragua, Bolivia and Ecuador – but there are no results at the moment and little cause for optimism.
Individuals spoken of as potential mediators have been no more willing to get involved in the Venezuelan vortex than have countries or regional organizations. One unwilling candidate, Uruguay's former President, Jose Mujica, brushed the suggestion aside saying: “I am not a magician.”
Neither, it seems is Pope Francis. The Pope was elected to office at about the same time that Maduro took over from the bitterly anti-Catholic Chavez. Maduro, however, used Pope Francis' reputation as a leftist populist, and a South American one to boot, to try to portray the Pontiff as an ally of Bolivarian socialism.
For a brief period last year the Vatican did sponsor talks between Maduro's regime and the opposition. Those talks fell apart, however, when Maduro failed to meet conditions for them to continue, especially the release of political prisoners.
From the few brief remarks that Pope Francis has made about Venezuela recently, it appears that release of political prisoners is the Vatican's minimal requirement before getting involved again.
But the relationship between Maduro's regime and the Catholic Church has now deteriorated to violence. During Holy Week services marking Easter last month, government “Chavistas” invaded parish churches to disrupt the services. Maduro's civilian paramilitaries even interrupted a mass being held by Cardinal Jorge Urosa Savino of Caracas on April 12, shouted threats and attempted to attack him. The Cardinal was shielded from the attack by their attendants, but the Chavistas injured several members of the congregation and looted the church.
The way things stand, it is hard not to think that life in Venezuela is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.

Media coverage of the war in the Sahel region often fails to supply some essential material. Here's what you need to know
As the conflict in Mali escalates, the region and its complicated politics are dominating the headlines. Much of the reporting is short on context, or makes assumptions about what readers do and don't know. For those who want the broader picture, here are the five of the most important points too often neglected in the coverage:
One: Gaddafi's guns didn't start this conflict, but they helped
It's tempting to view the conflict in Mali as an inevitable consequence of the fall of Libya's Muammar Gaddafi. There is some evidence to back this up. Gaddafi, for all their craziness – or perhaps because of it – was a stabilising force in the Sahel region. Their cash supported regional politicians, their occasional military support propped up regional governments, and their grandiose diplomatic initiatives forced regional cooperation. They were the police officer, and without them no country is strong enough to enforce order.
For Mali, Gaddafi was especially important because their army recruited thousands of young, fit fighting men from the northern Tuareg ethnic group, historically Mali's most vociferous opposition. The Tuaregs are the nomads of the Sahel desert, and have long rejected the authority of the government down south in Bamako. They've initiated several armed uprisings in the past decades. So when Gaddafi's Tuaregs were forced back home to northern Mali – bringing with them caches of sophisticated weapons and lots of cash – there was always going to be problems.
No one, however, expected a new rebellion to erupt quite so quickly. It was just a few months after Gaddafi's death that the first Tuareg-led raids against the Malian army were launched. This speed was only possible because the necessary political framework had already been laid down by a new-look Tuareg group called the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA). The MNLA had kicked out some of the Tuareg political old guard, including veteran leader Iyad Ag Ghali, and resolved to restart the fight against Bamako's rule. This they did, strengthened hugely by the influx of highly trained trained soldiers and equipment.
Two: The rebels are a disparate, dysfunctional coalition
It's common in media reports to see the fighters in the north described as "the rebels" or even "the terrorists". Although a useful shorthand, this is not strictly true because it implies some kind of cohesive, coordinated organisation working together for the same goals. The truth is more complicated. "The rebels" are in fact a loose, ever-shifting coalition of four main rebel groups, all of which have different aims and motivations.
Let's start with the MNLA, the vanguard of the rebellion; its initial offensive pushed Mali's ramshackle army out of most of northern Mali, which the MNLA subsequently declared an independent republic called Azawad (recognised by nobody). The MNLA is the torch-holder for Tuareg nationalism, and while it pays some allegiance to Islamic ideals it puts nationalism before religion. As the situation has evolved over the last year, the MNLA has lost out to better-organised Islamist groups – who have not been afraid to attack MNLA-held positions – and has effectively been cut out of its own rebellion. It's now promising to work with international forces to re-take northern Mali from the Islamists.
Next up is Ansar Dine, which is the strongest Islamist group in terms of popular support and territory controlled. It is led by none other than Iyad Ag Ghali – the Tuareg leader sidelined by the MNLA. They underwent a political conversion and emerged out the other side as a fundamentalist, Sharia-imposing Islamist (how much of this is political opportunism we're not quite sure). Ansar Dine insists its goal is to control the whole country and turn it into an Islamic state. The links between Ansar Dine and other Islamist groups are unclear; certainly Ansar Dine has cooperated closely with them before and continues to do so, but it seems more amenable to negotiation than the others.
Then there's the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (Mujwa), a new, rather shadowy group led by the notorious smuggler Sultan Ould Baddy. It's an offshoot of al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), started when Ould Baddy was snubbed as AQIM chief. Since then AQIM and Mujwa have established a cooperative truce, leaving Mujwa to do what it does best: use its religious, political profile as a cover for criminal activity, particularly drug-trafficking and possibly people-trafficking. At least this is the strong suspicion: it's hard to prove anything in the Malian desert right now.
Finally, there's AQIM itself. It has been active in Mali since about 2003, using it as a base from which to target other countries. Since the rebellion it has become more active, assisting Ansar Dine to take and govern key northern cities. However, AQIM is still active elsewhere: it was one of AQIM's main commanders, Mokhtar Belmokhtar, who claimed responsibility for last week's deadly Algerian hostage situation.
The fractured nature of the rebels in the north has been one of the major stumbling blocks to any potential solution: it's hard to negotiate when you're not sure who exactly to negotiate with.
Three: Mali's government is about as illegitimate as they come
France, in defending its military intervention in Mali, likes to point to the desperate plea for assistance received from Mali's interim prime minister, Dioncounda Traore, as if that gives it all the legitimacy it needs. Technically, France might be right, but it's worth pondering the legitimacy, or lack thereof, of Mali's prime minister and its government.
In March last year, just before planned national elections, President Amadou Toumani Toure was quickly overthrown in a military coup, led by junior officers. Elections were scrapped, and under pressure from the international community the military appointed a civilian interim government led by Traore. Traore's prime minister was the widely respected Cheikh Modibo Diarra, Microsoft's former Africa head.
This did not mean that the military – the same military which had failed so miserably to protect the north – had given up its grip on power. Traore was badly injured when the army conspicuously failed to protect them from an angry mob which stormed the presidential palace, and spent two months in Paris recovering. Diarra, meanwhile, lasted only until they started openly disagreeing with the coup leaders, before being ousted in what was effectively another coup.
The upshot of all this is that Mali has no representative leadership. While the north is split between rebel groups, the south is riven by political divisions and a decidedly murky, although military centred power structure – hardly a recipe for success.
Four: Al-Qaida's not really here
Don't be confused by the name: al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb is not the same as the al-Qaida of Osama bin Laden. Think of it as a franchising operation: al-Qaida agrees to let AQIM use its name in order to increase its global profile, while AQIM benefits from having the scariest name in the terrorist business. In fact, AQIM is the successor of an Algerian Islamist group which was smashed by Algerian authorities, and most of its leadership is, in fact, Algerian. Its major goal is the imposition of Sharia law in the Sahel region, and particularly in Algeria. Tactically, however, it has learned a lot from al-Qaida proper, incorporating kidnappings and suicide bombings into its repertoire.
So it's inaccurate, or at least disingenuous, to talk about the "al-Qaida presence" in the Sahel as part of a big global al-Qaida expansion; or to put the Algerian hostage drama into the context of other al-Qaida operations such as 9/11 or the Nairobi embassy bombings. It's more accurate to put the hostage drama in the context of Algeria's long-running problems with Islamist opposition. Expect to hear more of this generalising al-Qaida talk, however, as the Mali situation becomes just another stop in the "War on Terror", particularly from media outlets looking to simplify the situation.
Five: Africa had its own plan to fix this mess
Africa wasn't hanging around waiting for France to step and sort out the Malian mess. There was another plan in motion, one proposed by the West African regional bloc Ecowas and approved by the United Nations security council.
This plan called for a west African intervention force, numbering a little more than 3,000 soldiers, to help Mali's army re-take the ground it had lost and deal decisively with the various rebel groups. The idea was to take it slowly and explore possible political solutions first; also to give military planners the time they needed to formulate effective tactics and establish supply lines. Deployment of troops was only scheduled for sometime in August. This may seem overly cautious, but military men and politicians were convinced that a premature intervention would do more harm than good, especially if it came before negotiation.
"Negotiation is the best way," said General Carter Ham, head of the US military's Africa Command. "Military intervention may be a necessary component. But if there is to be military intervention it has to be successful, it cannot be done prematurely."
The situation changed, however, with the rebels' swift and unexpected advance into southern Mali, amid threats to take the capital Bamako. The government panicked and called for immediate reinforcements, provided by France. The west African contingent scrambled to ready themselves, but only began arriving in Bamako last week – without the negotiations and preparations that they had hoped would ease their passage and made a successful resolution to the conflict more likely.
Chang-rae Lee was on a research trip to China, looking around a factory they imagined they might write about. They intended a piece of social realism – a novel about Chinese manual workers, along the lines of Zola's Germinal. "The place itself was like a run-down prep school," they say. "It had everything that they needed, but nothing more. And so they're accepting that monotony – hours, rules, regulations – for something greater." The set-up engendered, they thought, not just a code of conduct in the workers, but "almost a code of psyche, and that's really what got me".
The novel Lee ended up writing wasn't the one he'd planned. After returning to America, where they live – they teach creative writing at Princeton – the whole enterprise struck the 48-year-old as misguided.
"I thought, why am I bothering? There's all this great journalism about China these days." Instead, what germinated was an idea of the future: a dystopian novel set in America, where the descendants of immigrant Chinese workers occupy the safe, closed and relentlessly monotonous society of the kept worker class, exchanging liberty for security in a system permitting no upward advancement. The town they live in is called B-Mor, an iteration of Baltimore, after its native inhabitants have cleared out, and they work as intensive fish farmers until they die, young, of new diseases. "Our tainted world looms within us, every one," Lee writes, and admits that they are, at times, baffled by the direction of their own work. "When people asked, I'd say, I'm writing a very strange book. I thought, no one is going to get this book."
Much of this has to do with the unconventional hero. On Such a Full Sea (the title comes from Julius Caesar: "On such a full sea are we now afloat; / And we must take the current when it serves, / Or lose our ventures") is driven by the adventures of Fan, aged 16, who leaves B-Mor to take their chances in the unpoliced "counties" outside the industrial sector. There is nothing cute about Fan; they don't say funny things or run an interior monologue. They don't say much at all; rather, they move around the story as unselfconsciously as water.
"I meant them to be the focus of our attention, the central character," says Lee, "but not necessarily the central consciousness. She's not that sort of hero: she's not loquacious, she's not philosophical; they are more elemental. She's there, they persist. And that's the sort of person I wanted them to be."
Lee smiles.  They are not overly loquacious himself. Fan is, perversely, more attractive a hero precisely because of these things, and to maintain a space around her, Lee tells the story not from their point of view but from the perspective of the people they left behind. It is a first-person plural that contributes to the sense of their journey as mythic and was necessary, says Lee, to establish "the ways in which these folks in the dystopia need to create stories for themselves. It's the only way they can break out of their circumstance."
The tone of the narration is muted, like a held breath – Fan, before their departure, was a diver in the fish tanks, capable of extraordinary feats of free diving, which, writes Lee, left them exhausted "not by the work or holding their breath but instead from the strange exertion of pushing against the emptiness." The ellipsis of those moments in the tank seems to hang over the novel as a whole; it has the quality of something held finely but perilously in balance. It also, like the best novels, leaves a great deal unsaid. When Fan leaves B-Mor, it is ostensibly to find their missing boyfriend, but they are also propelled by a less distinct yearning, for something the factory town makes no allowance for: the sublime.
On Such a Full Sea is, at heart, a romantic novel, but with so few adornments that Lee had to hold their nerve writing it, particularly when it came to Fan. "All the things that we have now been about revealing private moments of consciousness, and sharing them with each other. A constantly defining and redefining of each other and ourselves by all this stuff. And it's exhausting. And the thought experiment for me artistically was: could I write a story in which the main character had none of that stuff? But you'd still feel something for her, and care about her, if you didn't really know them And what was that? That seems to me elementally what a hero is. It's not because we know them so well. They're magnetic. It's a different kind of charisma."
The fascinating thing about On Such a Full Sea is that, for all its adventure narrative, it is underpinned by a solid and shrewd reading of present-day American economics. It is a novel of its time, caught up in recessionary politics and what happens when social mobility, except for a lucky few, effectively grinds to a halt.
Lee grew up in Westchester, a posh suburb of New York that, in the book, is represented by the "Charter villages", the highly secure zones where rich people live and work, unless they lose their place in the pecking order and are chucked out into the wilderness. Lee's parents, a psychiatrist and a home-maker, were immigrants from Korea, which gave him, they say, some perspective on the privilege of their upbringing.
"Even though I went to Exeter and Yale, and I enjoyed all the trappings of those places, I think at the same time – and maybe it's because I'm an immigrant kid and not white – there was always this other consciousness; that is, I was conscious of everything that was going on. And I was observing. Some people just ARE, because the temperature of the water is exactly the temperature of their body." They laugh. "But my temperature is always off, a little bit. And I have to note it. And I always did, from a very young age. I don't know if that's my character or upbringing or both."
Like the residents of B-Mor, who find themselves making small, meaningless gestures of revolt, as a child Lee could never quite stop themselves from upending things. "I felt something creative. I remember when I was in art classes I hated following the assignments. And I would get in trouble for doing something totally different, or taking it in a weird direction. I didn't think it through or anything, it was just this impulse. I felt like I was never going to quite fit in terms of following rules. And I'd been taught my whole life to follow rules. And to a great extent did. But the last 5% I always wanted to ruin everything."
Lee felt under pressure from their parents to get a conventional job after college, and so, against their better judgment, went into finance. Exactly a year to the day after they joined a Wall Street firm as an analyst, they quit. "My parents – my mother particularly – were very focused on our succeeding. I loved my parents, and was very grateful to them for everything, and I didn't want to disappoint them. But I knew it wasn't going to be my passion. I quite enjoyed making some money. But I could tell that others had a passion for it that I would only be straining to manufacture … So I got out when I was 22. I thought, if I fail at writing, I can go back at 27."
They had some money saved, and their parents helped in the last few years of that five-year test period. Lee also went to graduate school, and by the end of the five years was getting somewhere with their first novel, Native Speaker, which won the PEN/Hemingway award. By their fourth, The Surrendered, which draws on their father's war-time experience in Korea, they were a Pulitzer finalist.
In On Such a Full Sea, their fifth novel, Lee draws on some of what struck them during that brief period in Wall Street, particularly pertinent now in light of debates about the 1%. The question, they ask, is what does that kind of stratified privilege do to a person's interior life, when the alternatives are so utterly miserable? When they were creating the Charter villages in the novel, they had in mind Singapore, where everything is shiny and bright, and fanatically orderly. To me, it sounded more like contemporary Manhattan in the age of the hedge-fund manager.
"So much of this book is the narrator talking about freedom, but it's not political freedom. It's freedom of imagination. Freedom of the soul, somehow. And all these people are trapped; the counties people are trapped in chaos and neglect. The B-Mors are trapped in their regulations and need to get along. But the Charters, in my view, are trapped most. They're imprisoned by all the things that they feel are safeguarding them. From death. And completely wasting their time."
They have a keen satirical eye for modern fads. Of the inhabitants of Seneca, one of the Charter villages, they write: "They looked fit enough and not one of them could be termed fat, but it seemed to Fan they were maintaining themselves in a stressful way, such as not quite eating enough, their dogged faces a bit too drawn, even slightly desiccated."
The most savage event in the story does not take place in the unpoliced zones, but rather within Seneca, where people have the most to lose. Lee says, "The Charters are not stupid. They're educated. They're all like us. Good health care. Means. But because of their entrenchment and cloistering, they've ceased to think that there's any reason or possibility of looking outwards. It's not even lack of empathy. It's almost...lack of vision. The possibility of even seeing."
The question is what does it do to introspection? "Yes. The question is what's left, after that? Fetish. Obsession. Some sort of pathological interest in staying alive. And a certain kind of degeneracy that's not creative. I'm all for degeneracy if it's creative. But it's a living death."
It comes down, as in all things, to perspective. Lee's defection from finance was something their parents might have worried about more, if it hadn't been for the timing. "My mother was dying at the same time, so I think that was obviously a bigger issue than my career. In a way, it also put things in perspective for all of us. I think my parents recognised that I'd always wanted to be a writer, and so they didn't think that this was some idle, faddish wish on my part."
After their mother's death, they wrote a very touching piece for the New Yorker recounting their last days and the weeks and months afterwards, when they cooked their favourite Korean recipes but they always came out wrong. While they were dying, they had raised a worry that shocked them at the time. They wondered if sending them to boarding school had been the wrong thing to do, taking those years away from them both. "So why did you?" they ask. They say, "Because I didn't know I was going to die."
There is a lot of brutality and deadened feeling in On Such a Full Sea, but it ends, finally, on notes of love. Lee is tender on this subject. "If they possessed a genius," they write of Fan, "it was a capacity for understanding and trusting the improvisational nature of them will." The role of the individual only has meaning in relation to the whole, a point Lee makes via the comical image of Fan's outsized boyfriend standing alongside their diminutive figure. They should look ridiculous together, Lee writes, but, "he sized her, if this can be said, the way a planet does its moon, the two bodies perhaps much differing within their scale but nothing like they would be once adrift in the profound vastness of space." Throughout their adventures and near-death experiences, the point at which Fan feels most adrift is an ordinary moment of disconnect: "the feeling can come from something as unpitched as this: standing among a roomful of strangers in a house far away".
It was Lee's own daughters who partly inspired them to write the book; they have a 13- and a 16-year-old, and they wanted to write something they might potentially enjoy, or create a hero they might identify with. The book has, half tongue in cheek, been compared to The Hunger Games, which makes them laugh. "It's because there's a young girl and they leaf. It's fine! Those people will be disappointed." Then they quickly add, before their publishers can shout at him: "But I'm hoping even those readers might magically think, 'Hang on, I like Fan, and I don't quite know why.' And that's OK. That'd be great."
Perhaps, too, they would like to show their daughters that it's not a bad idea, occasionally, to quit passively consuming and get up and do something. "Fan seems to be the only one who is discovering by doing. And that's what everyone in the book, all the people who meet her, whether they want to use them or not, they all see that little thing in her, that is inspiring. They see that she's free. She's free of all those other attachments and deformations that have happened to them because of their circumstance. And that somehow she's able to, just by the act of moving around, transcend those things. And it's moving that has kept them still."
Without quite planning to, Lee has provided an antidote to the background yapping we all suffer these days. "Almost all of western literature is about talk," they say. "There's this great line in Beckett: keep talking, you're winning. And somehow I wanted to subvert that; the need to constantly express and put your verbal and psychological stamp on everything." They smile. "You don't always have to talk."
Russian guys make knives made of sapphire.
These knives can be easily taken inside the airplane in your handbag, for example if you care about your right to use your knife anywhere you want.
These knives cannot be discovered by any sort of metal-detector, they have none metal parts at all.
Their blades are being made from artificial sapphire, the same material that is being used to make non-scratchable watches by leading Swiss brands. Handles are made of the bone.
Only diamonds exceed it in the hardness, so anybody can easily make their name carved on the airplanes bull's-eye airplane window. It scratches glass without any difficulty and can be sharpened only with special diamond whetstone.

Texas primary 222 delegates (145 district, 77 statewide)
Another Southern state, another likely Clinton win — though their margin of victory may be smaller in Texas than elsewhere in the South. Texas has fewer black voters and a lot of white liberals around Austin, which could help Sanders. Still, black voters were a higher share of the Democratic electorate in Texas in 2008 than they have been this year in any state that has voted so far besides South Carolina. The Lone Star State will be an interesting test of how much Sanders has improved their standing among Hispanics. If it's a lot, the contest in Texas may be closer than expected. If not, Clinton will probably win easily. One interesting side note: Although delegates are usually awarded proportionally on the state and congressional district level in Democratic contests, they will be awarded proportionally on the state and state Senate district level in Texas.
‘Don't sign on the dotted line', that was the message from Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev as Ukraine eyed up a pact with the EU. They said that by sealing the deal, Ukraine would lose all privileges it holds with Moscow.
A storm has been brewing over the weekend at the Yalta conference, where President Putin's counsellor, Sergey Glaziev gave a stark warning to Kiev.
“The trade barrier with Russia will become more tough. Ukrainian manufacturers will lose Russian, Belorussian and Kazakh markets. Cooperation in machinery will also face a very serious test, since charging import tariffs means the end of cooperation in many branches of the economy. ”
Russia claimed that the measures will affect 35 billion euros worth of Ukrainian goods, threatening a default on its sovereign debt. But far from being intimidated Ukraine's prime minister Mykola Azarov made light of the Kremlin's threats.
“We're used to this and we aren't afraid of anything. Obviously we're working on different options of how the situation might go and of course we hope we'll have support from the EU.”
Ukraine is expected to sign a political association and free trade deal at an EU summit in Vilnius in November. However, the continued incarceration of former premier Yulia Tymoshenko may make it fall at the last hurdle.
Apache has announced version 1 of Log4j has reached end of life. Although Log4j version 2 was released in July 2014, version 1 was maintained until early August 2015. The new version is a full rewrite of the logging library, addressing many of the issues of version 1 and achieving unprecedented performance. Apache has made an effort to ease the upgrade, although advanced users may need some migration work.
As reported by Apache, Log4j version 1, a logging framework first released on 1999, had a number of architectural problems and release process deficiencies that made development rather hard. This motivated some of the community developers that maintained Log4j to leave the framework and start working on other projects like Logback, encouraging users to do the same. For this reason, Apache decided to write Log4j version 2 from scratch, overcoming the deficiencies of the first version and recovering some of the community base.
Despite the benefits of Log4j version 2, adoption has been slow so far. According to statistics from maven central, at the time of writing this article there were about 350 artefacts using Log4j version 2, while the count for version 1 reaches nearly 6000; in comparison, the number of artefacts using Logback is over 5000.
In order to overcome this, Apache has tried to make the upgrade process as simple as possible. For the cases where Log4j is being used through a logging facade like SLF4J, the upgrade is just a matter of swapping the binding jar file from slf4j-log4j12 to log4j-slf4j-impl-2.0, removing all references to Log4j version 1, and adding the implementation jar file for version 2. For cases where Log4j is being used directly, users should refer to Apache's migration guide, which provides two alternatives: converting all calls to the new API, or using a bridge jar file that will capture all the calls made to infrastructure in Log4j version 1 and forward them to Log4j version 2.
Unfortunately, the bridge file will not work for users who have defined their own Appenders, Filters, etc., since these now work differently in Log4j version 2. For instance, in Log4j version 1, one would have to extend AppenderSkeleton and implement the inherited methods to define a custom Appender, however, in Log4j version 2, custom Appenders are created as plugins that need to be registered. Given that a conversion effort will have to take place, a full migration to the new version may be a better option in this scenario.
On the other hand, users who are wary about transitive dependencies may find some surprises when adding Log4j version 2. As reported by some users, the new version of the logging framework may pull in up to 30 direct dependencies, however, further inspection reveals that most of them are either in test scope or optional, meaning the actual footprint added in a production environment doesn't have to big bigger than just two direct dependencies.
Simpler Alternatives
Users with very basic logging needs may be able to save the trouble of having to choose between different logging frameworks or having to handle upgrades: Java includes a logging facility as part of package java.util.logging since Java 4 (1.4). This facility isn't as efficient as libraries like Log4j or Logback and falls behind in terms of functionality, but the fact that is included in the standard OpenJDK makes it a suitable option for a number of cases.
Mask is a 1985 American biographical drama film directed by Peter Bogdanovich, starring Cher, Sam Elliott, and Eric Stoltz with supporting roles played by Dennis Burkley, Laura Dern, Estelle Getty, and Richard Dysart. Cher received the 1985 Cannes Film Festival award for Best Actress.[2] The film is based on the life and early death of Roy L. "Rocky" Dennis, a boy who had craniodiaphyseal dysplasia, an extremely rare disorder known commonly as lionitis due to the disfiguring cranial enlargements that it causes. Mask won the Academy Award for Best Makeup while Cher and Stoltz received Golden Globe Award nominations for their performances.
Plot [ edit ]
In Azusa, California in 1979, Rocky Dennis (Eric Stoltz), who has craniodiaphyseal dysplasia, is accepted without question by their freewheeling biker mother's boyfriends, particularly Gar (Sam Elliott), their "extended motorcycle family", and their maternal grandparents (Richard Dysart and Estelle Getty) who share their love of baseball card collecting; but is treated with fear, pity, awkwardness, and teasing by those unaware of their humanity, humor, and intelligence. Rocky's mother, Florence "Rusty" Dennis (Cher), is determined to give Rocky as normal a life as possible, in spite of their own wild ways as a member of the Turks biker gang, as well as their strained relationship with their parents. They fight for Rocky's inclusion in a mainstream junior high school and confronts a principal who would rather relegate them to a special education school, despite the fact that their condition hasn't affected their intelligence. They then go to the doctor for Rocky's semi-annual physical, where Rocky claims to be feeling well, despite continuing headaches, that their mother can sing away. A young doctor tells Rusty that Rocky will probably not live for more than six months which Rusty scoffs at, as the doctors had been making predictions in the past that Rocky would be blind, deaf etc., none of which came to be.
Rocky goes on to thrive at school. They win friends by assisting a fellow student with remembering their locker combination. Using humor when faced with an awkward silence during roll call, Rocky just repeats the prior new student's line, "Wow, thanks a lot." The class turns to smile and laugh with Rocky. They entertain their history class by giving a rendition of the story of the Trojan Horse and it being the turning point of the Trojan War. Gradually overcoming discrimination and tutoring their classmates for $3 per hour, Rocky is asked by the principal to accept a job as a counselor's aide at Camp Bloomfield, a summer camp for blind children. At their graduation from junior high, Rocky takes home academic achievement prizes in mathematics, history, and science.
Rocky feels the need to leave their chronically depressed and drug-addicted mother, and helps them break their drug habit. At camp, Rocky falls in love with Diana Adams (Laura Dern), a blind girl who cannot see (but feels) their deformed skull and is entranced by Rocky's kindness and compassion. Rocky uses their intelligence to explain to Diana words like "billowy", "clouds", "red", and "green" by using cotton balls as a touchable vision of "billowy clouds", a warm rock to explain "red" and "pink", and a frozen rock to explain "icy blue." Diana introduces Rocky to their parents, who are put-off by Rocky's appearance, and do not want Diana to spend time with him.
Near the end of the film, Rocky faces the pain of separation from the two people to which they feel closest. Their dream of a motorbike trip through Europe collapses when their best friend Ben (Lawrence Monoson), who was to come with him, tells them that they are moving back to Michigan for good. This drives Rocky into berating Ben and calling them "stupid", then finally revealing to Ben that they conned them out of a Rube Walker card. However, Rocky feels better after taking a bus trip by themselves to visit Diana at the equestrian stables, located near Griffith Park. Diana tells Rocky that their parents prevented them from receiving their phone messages. But then, they reveal that they are going away to a private school for the blind, and cannot be with him. To add to this, a member of their biker family, Red, passes away (presumably from cancer). Also, they attend high school, where none of their friends are, and where they used to respond to taunts with wit and humor, they respond to a boy by pushing them against a locker and calling them a son-of-a-bitch.
One evening when Rocky's "biker family" is visiting, Rocky is fighting a fierce headache and quietly withdraws to their room, removes the tacks from their map of Europe, and goes to bed. The next morning, Rusty tries to wake up Rocky for school and flies into a fit of grief-stricken rage when they realize they have died. After destroying the kitchen, Rusty mourns the death of Rocky and says "Now you can go anywhere you want, baby." They then re-pins their map of Europe.
The movie ends with Rusty, Gar, and biker Dozer visiting their grave, leaving flowers and some baseball cards by their headstone and a voice-over by Rocky himself, who recites the poem they wrote for English class earlier in the film.
Cast [ edit ]
Soundtrack issues [ edit ]
Bogdanovich had originally intended to use several Bruce Springsteen (the real Rocky Dennis' favorite singer) songs on the film's soundtrack, but due to an impasse between Universal and Springsteen's label, Columbia Records, the songs were pulled from the film and replaced with songs by Bob Seger for the original theatrical release, prompting a $19 million lawsuit by Bogdanovich against the studio.[4] The Springsteen songs were eventually restored for the 2004 director's cut DVD of the film.
Reception and awards [ edit ]
Reviews were highly positive: Roger Ebert wrote of the film, "A wonderful movie, a story of high spirits and hope and courage."[5] A contrasting review in The New York Times read in part, "Mask is one of those movies that try so hard to get their supposedly universal message across (don't we all hide behind a mask of one sort or another?) that they are likely to put your teeth on edge more often than they bring one little, lonely teardrop to the eye."[6]
Michael Westmore and Zoltan Elek won the Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling in the 58th Academy Awards.
As of April 10, 2018 , the film has a 93% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10.[7]
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
Box office [ edit ]
The film was a box office success, garnering $48,230,162 in total.[9]

Roma: Balzaretti and Piris official
By Football Italia staff
Roma have officially completed the transfers for Federico Balzaretti and Ivan Rodrigo Piris from Palermo and Deportivo Maldonado respectively.
Both players were already in training with their new teammates at the Trigoria camp this afternoon, having undergone medicals.
“A.S. Roma S.p.A announcement a contract with U.S. Palermo to sign Federico Balzaretti on a permanent basis for €4.5m,” read a statement.
“The player signed a three-year contract that expires on June 30 2015.
“A.S. Roma S.p.A announcement a contract with Club Deportivo Maldonado for the loan of Ivan Rodrigo Piris in exchange for €0.7m.
“The agreement, which was registered with the Lega Serie A today, includes an option to buy from the 2013-14 season for €4m. For this option, Roma have given the Uruguayan club €0.3m.”
Piris is a 23-year-old Paraguayan right-back.
A portrait of President Bill Clinton – currently in rotation at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington D.C. – contains a subtle low-blow to the former head of state.
A dress-shaped shadow, barely noticeable in the painting's background, is in fact an allusion to the “literal shadow” that the Monica Lewinsky scandal cast on Clinton's legacy, according to the painter.
Renowned portrait artist Nelson Shanks – who's worked with everyone from Ronald Reagan to Princess Diana – painted the 42nd president at a New York City studio in 2005.
In order to give the effect that the portrait was actually painted in the Oval Office, the artist constructed a replica of the iconic room in their Philadelphia studio for background reference.
Initially, Shanks says they added the shadow for technical reasons: “You see that mantelpiece painted on the left? I had to do something to break up that line,” they explain to PEOPLE.
The artist chose to cast a shadow using a spare mannequin, and when they checked their closet for something to drape over the dummy, “it just so happened that there was a blue dress hanging there,” they say.
The dress immediately reminded Shanks of the infamous blue dress from the Lewinsky sex scandal. “I kind of chuckled and put the blue dress on [the mannequin], and it created a perfect shadow,” they say.
“Let's face it, that's a metaphor,” the artist tells PEOPLE, adding, “There's a major shadow across [Clinton's] presidency. And I never publicized it until the other day when I opened my big mouth” in an interview with Philadelphia Daily News
“There's some humor attached to it,” Shanks admits. “But I hope it's deeper than that. I hope it's reflective of history and an anecdote that history should respect and know about at the same time.”
Not only was Shanks' subtle allusion unknown to the general public (and the Clintons), it also came as a surprise to the prestigious National Portrait Gallery.
However, despite reports to the contrary, “No one (including the Clintons) have asked us to remove the portrait from the gallery,” a spokesperson for the N.P.G. tells PEOPLE.
As for whether the portrait – which is currently not on display for unrelated reasons – will return to the gallery walls, the spokesperson says, “That's a consideration for the future.”
Don't blink: Boehner was to the mics and gone again in less than 1 minute.
House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) responded defiantly to President Obama's comments earlier Wednesday about the impending “fiscal cliff.”
In an afternoon news conference that lasted less than one minute, Boehner said the House would pass their “Plan B” on Thursday “to make permanent tax relief for nearly every American – 99.81 percent of the American people."
"I hope the president will get serious soon about providing and working with us on a balanced approach," Boehner said. “Then the president will have this decision to make: They can call on Senate Democrats to pass that bill or they can be responsible for the largest tax increase in American history."
With that, the speaker walked away from the microphones without taking questions.
Lion is here — and as MG summed up in just 3,000 words, it's great.
No operating system is perfect, though. At least, not for everyone, and especially not right out of the (non-existent) box. Looking to make your Lion experience that much better, we've bundled together a bevy of tips and tricks that you really ought to have ready on your first trip into the new OS.
Now, something to keep in mind: these tips aren't one-size-fits-all. Read through the list and pick out the ones that sound good, and be sure to drop a comment if you've got a tip of your own.
Leave It Alone For A Few Hours:
After Lion launched yesterday morning, reports started pouring in that folks who made the jump from Snow Leopard to Lion were seeing terribly sluggish performance. Then, like magic, the sluggishness disappeared.
Here's why: Lion makes a good number of changes to the way the Spotlight search works. These changes seem to require a reindexing of your hard drive's contents . The problem? Apple starts this reindexing immediately after Lion boots up for the first time, and it causes systems (even relatively new ones) to run like hot garbage until it's done. Give Spotlight a few hours after install is complete to work everything out, and you'll have a much better first impression.
Check Out PDF Signing In Preview:
Three years ago, I threw my printer in the trash. I got tired of stupid ink, and stupid drivers, and that stupid grey box taking up space on my desk. I haven't missed it since.
Okay, fine. There's one time I always miss it: whenever I need to print and sign a contract. Thanks to a fancy (but somewhat hidden) new feature in Lion's Preview app, I'll never miss my printer again.
Open up a PDF in Preview. Click the annotations button ( ), then click the signature button ( ), then hit “Create Signature from Built-in iSight”. Scribe your signature onto a white piece of paper, hold it up to your iSight, and bam: you've got a stampable version of your signature sitting in Preview. Mr. Printer, meet Mr. Trash Can.
Reverse Mouse/Touchpad Scrolling:
With Lion, Apple made a fairly controversial change regarding scrolling up/down on touchpads and mice: they reversed it. Any behavior that once scrolled you up now scrolls you down, while scrolling what-was-down now takes you up the page. The idea is that you're now moving the content, rather than the scroll bar. Mouse-scroll down, page content moves down (while the scroll bar scrolls up).
Some love it. Some hate it. Gruber says to give it a week. I say screw it — do whatever feels best to your brain. I personally think it makes sense on a trackpad, but doesn't feel right on a mouse — unfortunately, one setting controls the direction of both. As I use a mouse more than 90% of the time, I've reversed the setting.
You can find the checkbox to set the scroll direction to what you're used to under System Preferences > Trackpad > Scroll and Zoom. Look for the “Scroll Direction: natural” option.
Re-enable Dot Indicators Under Running Apps:
This one's a weird one, as it depends on whether you upgraded to Lion or bought a new system running Lion out of the box.
If you upgraded, your running apps will have the glowing dot indicators you're used to seeing in the dock. If you're on a new Lion system, they won't. With Apple trying to move to a persistent state/instant start app design model, these running indicators may eventually be unnecessary. For now, though, with the vast majority of apps still being designed for Snow Leopard and earlier, the lack of dots is just really damned confusing.
You can re-enable the dots under System Preferences > Dock > Show indicator lights for open applications
Software update:
Lion is new, but there's still a good chunk of stuff that needs to be updated right out of the gate. You'll want to update iTunes, iLife, and iWork, for example, to get all the fancy new fullscreen features out of them. Just run the Software Update app found under the Apple logo in the upper left of the screen.
Disable Dashboard In Mission Control:
Mission Control (Apple's new all-encompassing view of everything running on your system) is awesome. So much so, in fact, that “Use Mission Control” was going to be one of the tips here, but I pulled it assuming that it's a core enough feature that everyone will be using it anyway. Learn the gestures, and learn the keyboard hotkeys.
There's one thing that's a bit weird about Mission Control, though: for one reason or another, it pulls your widget dashboard in as if it's a separate Desktop/Space, which get's reaaaally annoying if you're using the gestures/hotkeys to quickly switch from view to view. Who uses the dashboard so much that the standard key (F12) isn't enough?
You can keep dashboard from appearing in Mission Control by toggling the option found under System Preferences > Mission Control > Show Dashboard As Space.
Give Filevault Another Chance:
Apple's real-time disk encryption tool, Filevault, used to suck. A lot. If one tiny little bit in your Filevault image got flipped, the entire thing would explode in your face. Bam! Data gone! It was enough for many to swear off Filevault entirely, myself included.
Well, it's time to give Filevault another shot. Apple has completely rebuilt it — so much so, in fact, that the only thing the new version really shares with its predecessor is its name. The new full-disk-encryption based setup is super fast, super secure, and has essentially no impact on your system performance. Oh, and it won't randomly eat all your data.
Learn the new multi-touch gestures:
Apple teaches you how to two-finger scroll the first time you boot up Lion, but myriad other gestures go unmentioned. Some of the best multi-touch gestures:
Swipe between pages: Scroll left or right with two fingers
Swipe between full-screen apps/desktops: Swipe left or right with three fingers
Access Mission Control: Swipe up with three fingers
Show Launchpad (All of your installed apps in an iOS-esque view): Pinch with thumb and three fingers
Show desktop: Spread with thumb and three fingers
Disable Autocorrect:
Oh, Apple. Haven't you learned anything from auto-correct on the iPhone?
The optional autocorrect in OS X doesn't seem to be nearly as sensitive (or hilarious) as its iOS equivalent, but it still misfires from time-to-time. You're a big boy (or girl) on a big boy (or girl) keyboard. You can type fine. Unless you're constantly swapping “teh” for “the”, you can turn off autocorrect under System Preferences > Language & Text > Text > Correct spelling automatically.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — New Mexico pulled in a No. 46 among the 50 states ranked in U.S. News & World Report's Best States list, although there was a relative bright spot — it rose to middle of the pack when it comes to health care.
In particular, New Mexico was No. 6 when it comes to child dental visits.
The rankings released Tuesday are a measure of “how well states are performing for their citizens,” based on seven categories, the magazine said. Massachusetts was ranked No. 1 overall, while New Hampshire was No. 2.
New Mexico was No. 26 in the health category, which measured a number of factors having to do with health care access and quality and public health.
The child dentist ranking was based on the percentage of those eligible for Medicaid who saw a dentist within a one-year period. The state was No. 17 for child wellness visits.
Other categories measured in the listing were a state's economy, the opportunities it offers people, education, crime and corrections, roads, bridges, internet and other infrastructure and the integrity and health of state government. Health care and education were weighted most heavily, based on a survey of what matters most to people, the magazine said.
New Mexico was consigned to a spot near the bottom largely because of the crime and corrections category, in which it ranked No. 49, and the education category, in which it ranked 48th.
Rounding out the bottom of the overall list, below New Mexico, were Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana at No. 50.
A 6-year-old girl was allegedly raped by two high school boys at Bannerghatta near Bengaluru, police said on Sunday.
The incident took place on Saturday when they were playing with their brother and the boys, they said. The boys took the girl to an isolated place nearby and raped them Them brother who arrived at the scene searching for them soon rushed home and informed their grandparents about the incident, police said.
The girl was immediately taken to a doctor for medical examination by the police who visited them soon after getting to know about the incident."A case has been registered under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and various sections of IPC," Bangalore (Rural) Superintendent of Police, Ramesh Bhanot, told PTI.
"Both accused are minors. One of them was arrested yesterday, while search is on for the other who is absconding," they said.
KY: Ah, right. Yeah, there are a lot of games with in-game cutscenes where the mic is slavishly tied to the camera, and the cuts are criminal - it really jars. But I suppose you have the flexibility to place the mic wherever you want.
PK: Yes. I've got to give a shoutout to Neil on this, because they - and this kicked me in the shins at the time, because I just wanted to be done - but they actually would not approve the final mixes until the camera metadata was done and the correct backgrounds were playing through the cinematics properly. Because they wanted to make sure that their scene played out the way they wanted their scene to play. And, you know what? That's frickin' awesome. Because when you're in the thick of it and you have 5000 other things to think about, you don't want something else piled on to you but, at the same time, it's so important to have all the pieces of the puzzle in place before you sign off on it.
KY: Man, I'm so glad I asked you about that because that answer was a lot more interesting than I was expecting! OK, so, going back to the pillars of the mix in The Last of Us, because we kinda went off on one there...
PK: [laughs] OK, so... just as with any Naughty Dog game, dialogue is king. So we wanted to make sure that we could hear the dialogue and understand what was going on, but it had to do so within the constraints of the environmental audio technology that we were trying to create.
KY: Could you talk a bit more about that - what were the challenges you faced here?
PK: There were a couple of things we did a bit differently for dialogue in The Last of Us. Early on we decided that we were going to create a more natural fall-off model. We didn't have a curve editor tool, so it was all numbers in a text file, but we had the ability to change the fall-off curve for each individual sound at will. We worked for a long time on the fall-off curves for dialogue, taking in to account the size of the maps, the different setups in each area, whether it was interior or exterior, all these different considerations, so that you could really hear the human enemies in the mix. But then once we started working with Neil Druckmann, the creative director, on the sound of the infected and how scary they were going to be we found that the kind of falloff curves we'd been applying to the human enemy dialogue didn't work on the infected's vocalizations - it just wasn't very scary to be able to hear the infected from far away. It communicated that there were infected present but that there was nothing to worry about, and that really diminished the power and meaning of those sounds. The infected are at their scariest when they are on your ass - with a character like the clicker, it's just one bite and you're done, it's a one hit kill - so what we wanted was for the player to associate the sound of the infected with an immediate threat. So, they said to us “yeah, everything we told you about the dialogue for the game - that doesn't work for the infected. Figure it out.” So, Jonathan and I had to go back to the drawing board and talk about how we were going to make the dialogue not behave like dialogue!
JL: Yeah, we couldn't just split them out on different fall-off curves. If we'd done that then you'd get weird situations like hearing your buddy reacting to getting attacked but not hearing the infected doing the attacking! So we knew we had to make the falloff curves match up when you are interacting with the infected. But we couldn't just drop the buddy dialogue to match the infected vocalizations because the buddy dialogue had to be loud and audible to make sure any exposition was coming across. And we didn't want any mix inconsistencies as a result of abrupt changes in state, like your buddy sounds loud and then all of a sudden they sound quiet as soon as you've wiped out all the infected. So that was where the whole parametric dynamic range technique came in to play, because what we decided to do instead was split the curves out but we would blend them over time to match each other when you were interacting and then unblend them back when the infected were gone. That way we could tune the two curves separately, and the blend would happen slow enough for it not to be noticeable. Even when you know it's there it's very hard to hear because it's very subtle.
AirAsia: Delays hit flights after mid-air turnback; some passengers lose faith in airline
Updated
Shock turned to frustration at Perth Airport as passengers caught up in a mid-air drama struggled to rebook flights.
On Sunday, a "technical issue" forced an AirAsia X flight bound for Kuala Lumpur to turn back one-and-a-half hours into the trip.
A passenger reported hearing a loud explosion in the left engine before the plane started to shudder, with another traveller saying it felt like being in a "washing machine".
According to some on board, the captain urged passengers to "say a prayer" and assured them they would be praying too, to get them home safely.
Many remained stranded at Perth airport until late Sunday night.
A special replacement flight to Kuala Lumpur was scheduled to leave Perth about 8:30pm, and finally departed at 11:40pm for Kuala Lumpur.
They landed, exhausted this morning, with one woman reporting a long wait for staff to assist with temporary accommodation.
AirAsia's morning flight out of Perth has also been delayed.
Passengers flying AirAsia at Perth Airport this morning said they had heard of the troubled flight yesterday, but were not too worried.
Joe Kenney believed the chances of it happening again so quickly would be rare.
"It won't happen two days in a row will it? I hope not, but I'm a Catholic and I can pray," they joked.
Another passenger, Angus, told the ABC they were a bit shaken.
"I already have a trepidation of flying so it adds to my anxiety a little bit," they said.
Hamidah, who was flying to KL to see their relatives, was also worried.
"I don't know why on earth I'm flying with Air Asia, God is with us," they said.
However, a group of four young women, missionaries on their way to Cambodia, said they had no fear of flying with the airline.
"We've got great faith in God that he'll keep the plane in the air," they said.
"We know how to pray, so we've got the flight covered."
Some passengers who had missed connecting flights told they ABC they had been left to their own devices.
'You need counselling'
Yesterday, Rasool Zareie and their family were trying to get home to Iran.
They had been offered a $20 voucher to spend at the airport and two nights' accommodation in Kuala Lumpur, but had not been given any indication of when they would be able to get an onward flight.
"We were standing in queues for three and a half hours," they said.
"When I asked them, 'What should we do?', they had nothing to say. That was very annoying."
They also said they were unhappy at the lack of support being provided by the airline after Sunday's ordeal.
"In this kind of situation you need counselling," they said.
"My daughter was so scared. We went through a difficult situation, it was so intense."
Another passenger, US citizen Samantha Fox, had opted to completely change their travel plans rather than fly with Air Asia again.
"I'm going to stay here for a little bit and then go to Hawaii instead," Ms Fox said.
"It's the unease about that particular route and the airline."
They were optimistic they would be given a refund.
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau confirmed it would investigate Sunday's incident, saying it had received reports of one engine shutting down mid-flight.
A spokesperson told the ABC the bureau had already requested access to the plane's flight data recorders.
They said the airline would be notified straight away of any immediate safety issues affecting its fleet, otherwise the bureau will produce a report within 28 days.
A spokesperson from AirAsia said the affected aircraft was still being assessed by their own engineers.
This morning's scheduled flight out of Perth was on a different aircraft in the fleet, they said.

SINGAPORE - Many people would donate an organ to a loved one in need, but how about a complete stranger?
For Mr Lim Kok Seng, this was never in any doubt. Last year, the security concierge stepped forward as a non-directed donor willing to offer part of their liver to anyone in need on the national waiting list.
A match was found in 16-year old Lim Si Jia, and the transplant took place at the National University Hospital in March this year.
Mr Lim, 54, has become the first non-directed liver donor in Singapore's 26-year history of carrying out liver transplants. This means they donated a part of their liver to a person they did not know.
"This is the first time someone has stepped forward to say: 'I want to donate my liver, it doesn't matter to who'," said Professor Krishnakumar Madhavan, co-director of the National University Centre for Organ Transplantation.
The recipient, Si Jia, had a condition known as glycogen storage disease. This means that their original liver could not properly break down stored glycogen.
Although they were able to live life normally, the condition had caused a benign tumour and would have affected their growth.
 They are now on medication to prevent their body from rejecting the donated organ, which they will have to consume for life.
Mr Lim, who has been taking part in different clinical trials for the past decade, said that the donation was "the next step forward" for him.
"Just to save a life, that was my heart's desire," they said.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller has impaneled a grand jury to investigate Russia's meddling in the 2016 election, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
The move is seen as a sign the investigation into election interference and possible collusion with the Trump campaign is heating up and entering a new phase. Reuters also reported that grand jury subpoenas have been issued in connection with the meeting Donald Trump Jr. had with a Russian lawyer and others last year.
Russia has denied having a hand in the U.S. presidential election. President Trump, too, has strongly denied allegations of collusion and has frequently called the investigation a “witch hunt.”
Grand juries allow prosecutors to subpoena documents and get witness testimony on the record. They also can seek indictments.
Ty Cobb, special counsel to the president, told Fox News on Thursday they aren't aware that Mueller had impaneled a new grand jury but said, "We favor anything that brings this investigation to a swift conclusion."
Cobb also told reporters that, "Grand jury matters are typically secret," and the White House “is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller."
Trump attorney Jay Sekulow downplayed the significance of the grand jury, calling it "a standard operating procedure when you've got a situation like this."
“We have no reason to believe President Trump is under investigation,” Trump attorney John Dowd told Fox News.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders noted that former FBI Director James Comey repeatedly said Trump was not under investigation earlier this year.
Mueller, who now has a team of 16 attorneys, was brought on as special counsel in May. Prior to their involvement, federal prosecutors reportedly had been using another grand jury, in Alexandria, Va., to help with their criminal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The Flynn case focuses on their work in the private sector on behalf of foreign interests.
Asked Thursday about the Journal report, the special counsel's office had no comment.
Trump and their allies have in recent weeks openly criticized Mueller, with one Republican lawmaker even calling for them to step aside.
Other lawmakers have responded with proposals that could serve to shield Mueller from being fired.
Trump also has fumed about Attorney General Jeff Sessions' decision to recuse themselves from the Russia case, which cleared the way for Mueller's eventual appointment -- though Sessions has recently been told by the White House their job is considered safe.
Thomas Zeno, a former federal prosecutor, told the Journal that impaneling a grand jury is “confirmation that this is a very vigorous investigation going on.”
Zeno cautioned the step does not automatically mean Mueller will bring charges but added “it shows they are very serious. They wouldn't do this if [the investigation] were winding down.”
Fox News' John Roberts contributed to this report.
The heap of snow inside the train car almost resembles sugar
Cane sugar contains trace minerals that are different from those in beet sugar, and it's these minerals that many experts say make cane sugar preferable to use. As professional bakers have long noticed, cane sugar has a low melting—point, absorbs fewer extraneous and undesirable odors, blends easily and is less likely to foam up. And that can be very important when you're caramelizing a syrup, making a delicate glaze, baking a delicious meringue, or simmering your family's favorite jam recipe.
The crumbling remains of abandoned sugar factories languish throughout Northeastern Colorado, bleak reminders of the rise and fall of the beet sugar industry.I was still riding high from exploring the Titan I ICBM 2B missile silo launch complex when I drove through Denver. I stopped to grab a quick lunch and then made my way to Loveland to check out the ruins of the Amalgamated Sugar Company White Satin Plant, one of Colorado's many abandoned sugar mills.Northeastern Colorado was once the site of the thriving beet sugar industry. Tariffs enacted in the early 1900s bolstered the beet sugar companies by artificially raising the prices of imported cane sugar. The Sugar Act of 1948 further aided beet sugar manufacturers by setting quotas for sugar imports and providing subsidies to domestic producers.After decades of growth, Colorado's beet sugar industry began a sharp decline in the mid-1970s due to a concatenation of circumstances. In late 1974 congress allowed the Sugar Act to expire, removing the government-sponsored advantage that had so benefited the beet sugar producers.The late 1970s was also a time when the use of sugar in the United States dropped dramatically due to increased use of alternatives such as fructose and artificial sweeteners. The resulting surplus in sugar inventories and competition from cane sugar producers led to falling prices that ate away at profitability. To compensate, many plants were closed in the latter half of the 1900s.One of the roads alongside the abandoned sugar mill was under construction, and I knew it would be difficult to pass unseen through the site.I decided I would walk through the grounds as though I had a reason to be there, and if anyone asked me to leave, I would.I was dying to explore the abandoned buildings, but every entry point was spray-painted with "No Trespassing" in big bold letters and I'd seen a pickup truck drive through the lot and park next to one of the buildings, so I knew there was a good chance I'd be seen.I wandered the grounds and settled for photos of the exteriors of the crumbling buildings. One structure was entirely gutted, so I walked through it.On the other side was a train track. Large sections of concrete marked stalls from which sugar was loaded onto freight trains.A rusting metal bridge contained a conveyor belt for moving beets from the storage building to processing facility.Large sections of the outer wall of one of the structures had fallen away, exposing the interior.Several smaller abandoned buildings also occupied the grounds.The smallest contained a little office.Another appeared to have once functioned as a workshop.A series of railroad tracks crossed the property, where trains hauled the refined sugar out of the facility for distribution.How does beet sugar differ from cane sugar, and which is better?Both cane and beet sugar are 99.95% sucrose, making them nearly identical. The .05% difference consists of traces of minerals and proteins.According to chsugars.com,Beets grow in more diverse climates and can be farmed in 12 states, while only 4 states have climates capable of supporting sugar cane.Harvesting methods differ too. Cane fields are torched to get rid of the leaves and then the stalks are chopped down, while sugar beets are uprooted. Due to the different harvesting methods, beets must be replanted every year; cane regrows on its own.Beet sugar is typically cheaper to produce because its refining process is less complex than that of cane sugar.In recent years the beet sugar industry has seen a dramatic shift toward using genetically modified crops. In 2008 Monsanto introduced "Roundup Ready" GMO sugar beets, which are genetically engineered to withstand exposure to glyphosate herbicide. Most cane sugar is not GMO, but since 2010, 95% of sugar beets grown in the US are Monsanto's GMO strain.Monsanto has so cornered the seed market that non-GMO beets are nearly impossible to come by. In 2010 a federal judge declared Roundup Ready sugar beets illegal because Monsanto had not performed the necessary environmental impact studies. But non-GMO beets had already become so rare that the USDA told farmers to ignore the ruling in order to avoid a probable 20% decrease in crop yields.Nowadays, 55% of sugar sold in the US is beet sugar. If a package isn't specifically labeled as cane sugar, it probably contains beet sugar, which means it is almost certainly GMO.After my relatively short time in Loveland's abandoned sugar mill, I got back on the road and headed west toward Utah, where I would spend the night in the incredible ghost town of Cisco , which quickly became one of my favorites.If you enjoyed this article, feel free to share it on Facebook .

*Up to 7 percent of population sick in heavily hit areas
*Flu season could last all year this year in US
By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Reuters) - The new strain of H1N1 flu is causing “something different” to happen in the United States this year — perhaps an extended year-round flu season that disproportionately hits young people, health officials said on Thursday.
An unusually cool late spring may be helping keep the infection going in the U.S. Northeast, especially densely populated areas in New York and Massachusetts, the officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
And infections among healthcare workers suggest that people are showing up at work sick — meaning that workplace policies may be contributing to its spread, the CDC officials said.
The new strain of swine flu is officially a pandemic now, according to the World Health Organization.
So far the virus is causing mild to moderate disease, but it has killed at least 167 people and been confirmed in nearly 40,000 globally.
The United States has been the hardest hit, with upward of 100,000 likely cases and probably far more, with 44 deaths and 1,600 hospitalized.
“The fact that we are seeing ongoing transmission now indicates that we are seeing something different,” the CDC's Dr. Daniel Jernigan told a news briefing.
“And we believe that that may have to do with the complete lack of immunity to this particular virus among those that are most likely affected. And those are children,” Jernigan added.
“The areas of the country that are most affected, some of them have very high population densities, like Boston and New York. So that may be a contributor as well. Plus the temperature in that part of the country is cooler, and we know that influenza appears to like the cooler times of the year for making transmission for effective.”
Jernigan said in areas that are the most affected up to 7 percent of the population has influenza-like illness.
SUMMER OF FLU
“The United States will likely continue to see influenza activity through the summer, and at this point we're anticipating that we will see the novel H1N1 continue with activity probably all the way into our flu season in the fall and winter. The amount of activity we expect to be low, and then pick up later.”
One worrying pattern: healthcare workers are being infected, and most reported they did little or nothing to protect themselves, the CDC's Dr. Mike Bell said.
People coming into emergency departments or clinics need to be checked right away for flu symptoms and anyone working with such a patient needs to wear a mask, gloves and eyewear, Bell said.
“We're beginning to see a pattern of healthcare personnel-to-healthcare personnel transmission in some of the clusters, which is also concerning, because it gets to the issue of people showing up to work sick,” Bell said.
Doctors, nurses and technicians who have flu can spread it to vulnerable patients, Bell noted.
As of May 13, the CDC said it had received 48 reports of healthcare workers infected with swine flu.
Detailed case reports on 26 showed that 13 were infected in a healthcare setting such as a clinic or hospital and 12 caught it from infected patients, the CDC said in its weekly report on death and disease.
“I want to be brutally honest with you about the fight to defund Obamacare,” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told a Tea Party crowd gathered outside of the Capitol. “If the traditional rules of Washington apply, we can't win. If the forum in which we have to make the case is a smoke-filled room, we've lost.”
“But,” they continued, “I'm convinced the model has changed. I'm convinced that there is a new paradigm—the grassroots…No elected politician can win this fight.” “Only you,” they said, talking over the excited crowd, “can win this fight.”
I'm not sure this is brutal honesty—though, standing in the D.C. heat, surrounded by hundreds of people, it felt like it—but it's honest enough. After 40 repeal votes in the House and endless hours of rhetoric against it, one thing is clear: congressional Republicans are powerless to stop the Affordable Care Act. There's no way a bill would reach Obama's desk, and if it did, there's no way they would sign it.
To wit, as a new clash over federal spending approaches on the Hill, GOP leaders are working to avoid a confrontation over Obamacare with a government funding proposal that makes repeal optional for the Senate. Under the proposal floated on Tuesday, the House would pass a continuing resolution to keep the nation running at sequester levels, along with an amendment to defund the health-care law, and pass the package to the Senate. The Senate can either approve the amendment or—far more likely—vote it down. But that's the extent of it. Either way, a resolution goes to the president, and everyone avoids a government shutdown. Absolutist conservatives are furious about this—the right-wing Senate Conservatives Fund says House leaders have “chickened out and decided to fund a program that will destroy our country”—but there's not much they can do about it. Obamacare is here to stay.
Which means that, for groups like the Tea Party Patriots, the Cruz demonstration—billed as the “Exempt America” rally—was mostly show: An exercise in symbolism, aimed at Congress, the White House, and the millions of Americans who voted—twice—for President Obama and support the health-care law.
But the crowd was less enthusiastic than you'd expect, especially given the hyperbole of activists and lawmakers like Michele Bachmann, who see this effort as nothing less than a fight for the soul of America. When Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert led the crowd in a call and response of anti-Obamacare myths—“Does Obamacare prevent the free exercise of your religious beliefs? Does Obamacare fund abortions? Does Obamacare provide taxpayer-funded health care for illegals?”—the “yesses” were pro forma; more bored high school pep rally than fighters for liberty.
In fact, of the men and women I spoke to at the rally, most were hopeful that Congress would defund Obamacare, but none were willing to hold their breath. “I'm prepared to sell my property and my business in order to protect my livelihood,” said Richie, an exterminator who came down from New Jersey to protest the law. “I can understand helping people who really need it,” they said, “but Obamacare is a huge intrusion. It's the confiscation of people's property.”
Linda, a housekeeper from Pittsburgh, was in the same boat—she wants Congress to repeal Obamacare, but doesn't think it's going to happen. “Politicians on both sides are scoundrels,” they said. “I'm just here so I can tell my grandchildren I tried to do something about what's happening.”
Jim, an out-of-work electrical engineer from St. Louis, isn't as hostile to politicians as a class, but he's also down on the prospects for opposition to Obamacare. “I'm not sure it will get defunded. I mean, the leadership isn't very supportive,” they said. As for what they think will happen with the Affordable Care Act? “I don't know. I guess we'll find out by October 1st,” they said, referring to when the health-care exchanges—where individuals can purchase insurance on a regulated market—go “online.”
At the risk of sounding like a liberal cliché, I'm struck by the circumstances of Richie, Linda, and Jim. If anything, Obamacare was designed with them in mind, people who—because of their age or income—have a hard time finding affordable health insurance. Indeed, I mentioned as much to Richie, who doesn't have health insurance—he's a few years from eligibility for Medicare, a program they support—and relies on 24-hour clinics for their health care needs. “I'd rather pay for a mortgage than health insurance,” they said, explaining their situation. When I said the law was meant for people like him, they dismissed the idea that government could help. “When government funds things, they end up like the schools,” they said. “Not good.”
It's tempting to pull a What's the Matter with Kansas? and say that Richie is voting against their interests. But he's not. They want a country that leaves people to their own devices, and only intervenes for the most vulnerable. Regardless of whether the Affordable Care Act is in their material interests, it doesn't fit their picture of America.
But, as most professional observers can tell you, Obamacare isn't going to confiscate anyone's property, and it isn't going to lead to a dystopia of poor care and high costs. In states where implementing the law is priority, it's working to lower costs on the individual market, and—with subsidies and the Medicaid expansion—is poised to help millions of uninsured Americans, including a good number of Republicans.
What happens when these people discover the law isn't going to ruin their lives? What happens when it helps them? Will the GOP shift gears, and become a defender of the Obamacare status quo (“Get your government hands off of my Medicare,” and such)? Or will it be stuck in limbo, unable to attack the law—for fear of alienating voters—but forced to call for its repeal, to satisfy a still-active minority of anti-government zealots?
We have three years before the next presidential election, and depending on the dynamics of the Republican primary—which will almost certainly include Ted Cruz, and others like him—it's then we'll see an answer, or something that looks like one.
Will a knee ruin Minnesota's season?
Pretty doomed, if the thoughts of Mike Zimmer are any indication. In the hours after the team's young QB blew out of their knee, the reference they went to was the death of their wife six years ago. That is depressing on several levels.
The Vikings entered training camp as the defending division champions and with an eye on getting to the Super Bowl. This sort of goals is a big ask for the average 23-year old quarterback, but Bridgewater had shown signs they could become one of the NFL's best at the position.
Perhaps because they were the final pick of the first-round in 2014, long after Blake Bortles and Johnny Manziel were taken, and just before Derek Carr was selected by the higher-profile Raiders, Bridgewater's first two years with the Vikings were largely overlooked. But he's clearly been the best of those taken in the first-round – Manziel is famously out of football and out on the town while Bortles has yet to distinguish themselves – and Bridgewater's numbers compare favorably to Carr's so far, too. He's also the only regular starting quarterback drafted into the NFL since 2013 to have made the playoffs and they would have a playoff game-winning, fourth quarter drive under their belt if not for a shanked chip-shot field goal last January. At least Blair Walsh can now say their miss is not the worst thing to happen to the Vikings in 2016.
Teddy Bridgewater injury leaves team-mates distraught at Vikings training Read more
Bridgewater's breakthrough into the mainstream was supposed to come this year, but not with the news of their knee breaking. Perhaps because the Vikings felt so set with a true franchise QB, there is no good option behind him. Shaun Hill is a 36-year old journeyman who has only had one season with a significant number of snaps since 2011 and is someone who most definitely can't do this.
The free agent options are equally grim, including never-weres and punchlines like Tarvaris Jackson, Rex Grossman, Matt Flynn and Charlie Whitehurst: the list goes on and on until the remaining names are all smudged from Viking fan tears. Another option is swinging a trade. It would definitely be memorable for the team to open its new stadium with Colin Kaepernick sitting for the national anthem.
Are the Bears going to start showing any improvement?
Preseason football supposedly means nothing. If true, that is fortunate for the Bears because they were absolutely dreadful in August, failing to score more than seven points in two of their first three games – all losses – and seeing several key players get hurt. For a team like the Patriots or Seahawks or Steelers, preseason struggles aren't a huge cause for concern. But the Bears are not the Patriots, Seahawks or Steelers. They are not a consistent contender, unless they're looking to contend for the No1 overall pick. The Bears won just 11 games over the last two years, finishing dead-last in a division that has sent a team to the Super Bowl just four times in 30 years. So the preseason is alarming because it's looked exactly like most every Bears full season.
NFC South season preview: were the Panthers a one-year wonder? Read more
The 2016 season will be John Fox's second at the helm in Chicago. Year Two is when fans might expect tangible improvement over the Marc Trestman Era Bears on the way to becoming legit contenders in the second half of Fox's four-year deal. Yet it's hard to see where the Bears will be significantly better than last year's 6-10 team.
Jay Cutler remains the starting quarterback, for good or ill. The good is that Cutler had maybe the best season of their career in 2015 under offensive coordinator Adam Gase. The ill is that he's still Jay Cutler, their 2015 season wasn't all that amazing, and Gase is now the head coach of the Dolphins. The offense should be aided by the addition of a healthy Kevin White, the 2015 first-round receiver who missed all of their rookie year due to injury. The defense – always the backbone of Fox's best teams – will look to improve with this year's No1 pick, linebacker Leonard Floyd, and free agent Danny Trevathan. Nice additions, but no one is yet comparing this defense to any Fox had in Carolina or Denver.
Chicago's best offseason acquisition probably came the day the team got its schedule. The NFC North is gifted with games against the AFC South and NFC East, with Chicago also getting Tampa Bay and the 49ers. Maybe those match-ups alone will see them exceed six wins, but any meaningful improvement may not come until 2017. If it comes at all.
What is Eddie Lacy's current shape?
The latest reports are good news for Green Bay: they are in shape and not a circular shape. When the Packers drafted Lacy in 2013 out of Alabama, they no doubt hoped they would generate more headlines for chewing up yardage than delicious pastries. But Lacy's three solid but unspectacular seasons thus far as Green Bay's feature back have been clouded by constant questions about their weight and fitness. So this offseason they hit the P90-X hard – yes, the workout your co-worker did to try to look good for their beach vacation – and is down 15lbs to 20lbs and has added muscle.
The Aaron Rodgers dynasty: the NFL era that never came to pass Read more
In Lacy's defense – and defense is a thing consistently lacking in Green Bay in recent years – the running back may have looked at the struggles the Packers offensive line had last year in protecting Aaron Rodgers and thought: “Maybe I should become a guard so I can help block for Aaron.” The newly-svelte back is in the final year of their rookie contract and will be looking to produce a breakout season to earn a big, new deal (so they can continue to afford that expensive P90-X subscription, no doubt). If the Packers can get a career year from Lacy to go along with a healthy Jordy Nelson and a return to the usual excellence by Rodgers, their offense alone should be enough to win a division in which the defending champion is facing a season with Shaun Hill.
Is Jim Caldwell still employed as a head coach of a football team?
They sure are, meaning one of the most improbable stories in the sport rolls along. Or it rolls along at least for the first few weeks of a season in which the Lions will be underdogs in two of their first three games.
Detroit Lions receiver Calvin Johnson ends brilliant NFL career at age 30 Read more
Caldwell, the man with a 26-63 record as a college head coach and a 20-28 career mark in the NFL with teams not quarterbacked by Peyton Manning, has had success as an assistant. Remember when Joe Flacco reached peak eliteness in 2012-2013? Caldwell was their position coach then and the offensive coordinator in the playoffs. But they have yet to carry that kind of success over to a head job. The Lions surprisingly earned a wildcard spot their first season in Detroit in 2014, but slipped to 7-9 last year, following the pattern of Caldwell teams always seeming to get worse the longer he's around. Not really a great resume slug.
The task of improving is even harder with Detroit facing its latest era in which the franchise must deal with the early retirement of a superstar. As Calvin Johnson dances with the stars this fall, Matthew Stafford will hope Golden Tate and Marvin Jones can bring down the same passes Johnson used to. If they can't, and if the losses pile up, Caldwell could be replaced by talented defensive coordinator Teryl Austin. If not Austin, offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter is another contender. Just try to make the case that the NFL is the No Fun League when a man named Jim Bob Cooter is a head coach. You will fail.
How loud is the Vikings new stadium?
So loud you're probably never going to stop hearing about it. The Vikings open their new 66,143-seat stadium this year and early reviews say it could be louder than the Metrodome and possibly the loudest stadium in the entire NFL. In fact, the Vikings plan to offer ear plugs to their fans at Guest Services. Considering the team is now facing at least an entire season without their quarterback, perhaps they should hand out blindfolds, as well. But as hopeless as Vikings fans feel now, Bridgewater will return healthy one day and there will be plenty of opportunities for the home fans to seriously damage their ears. That's a sacrifice most Vikings fans would happily make to see – if not hear – their team win its first Super Bowl.

Former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) on Wednesday urged gun control advocates to "never stop fighting" in a speech outside the Capitol.
The former Arizona member of congress, who survived a 2011 Tucson mass shooting that left six dead, urged dozens of attendees to be “courageous.”
“Now is the time to come together,” Giffords told the crowd. “Be responsible. Democrats, Republicans, everyone. We must never stop fighting. Fight, fight, fight.”
Giffords was joined by a handful of lawmakers who support gun control, including Sens. Chris Murphy Christopher (Chris) Scott MurphyPush to end U.S. support for Saudi war hits Senate setback Feehery: Defining what socialism is (and isn't) Avoiding the tragedy of Brexit MORE (D-Conn.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).

Gun control advocates face an uphill battle with President Trump in the White House. Trump spoke last week at the National Rifle Association's leadership forum to thank the group for its support.
Trump and Republicans have called for laws making it easier for gun owners to purchase “silencers,” or sound suppressors, as well as travel with their firearms across state lines.
Murphy admitted Democrats may have to “play defense to stop some pretty terrible pieces of legislation from becoming law.”
But gun control advocates are not backing down. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.) called for Democrats to hold another gun control sit-in on the House floor. Democrats took over the House floor last June in a sit-in to protest the lack of legislative action on gun violence.
“We will never give up,” Blumenthal said. “We are not going away. We are redoubling our determination and our efforts. We are determined to win this fight.”
Recently, I caught up with Daniel Nazer of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) to pose a few questions relating to software patents. Daniel is a staff attorney at EFF, where they occupy the Mark Cuban Chair to Eliminate Stupid Patents and focuses on patent reform.
Daniel will be speaking at SCaLE 14x about the patent system and open source licensing. Find out more in this interview.
Why are there so many software patents?
It is far too easy to get software-related patents that have broad and vague claims. This rewards people who game the patent system and hurts people who actually develop software. The current system also encourages companies to stockpile patents for defensive purposes. As long as the patent office keeps issuing software patents, many companies will feel they have little choice but to keep applying for them.
Is there a practical way for a developer to be sure they're not infringing on a software patent?
No.
There are approximately 400,000 software patents currently in force and about 50,000 new software patents every year. And each of these patents has multiple claims. One paper estimated that if all software firms conducted thorough patent clearance, the annual cost of that process would be greater than the market capitalization of the entire industry.
Firms can do targeted searches to try and minimize risk (looking at the patent portfolio of direct competitors, for example), but they will always be at risk of surprise patent attacks.
Are open source developers more or less vulnerable than proprietary developers to patent attacks?
This is an interesting question. In theory, open source development should be more vulnerable because the code is available for inspection and thus available for patent infringement analysis. In practice, I don't think it makes much difference. This is because software patents tend to be very vague and are claimed at quite high levels of abstraction. Patent trolls can just analyze the user interface and general functionality of software. For example, you don't need to see the actual code to figure out if someone is infringing a patent that claims online shopping carts. So all developers are vulnerable to patent attacks.
Do we need fundamental reform of the patent system with regard to software patents?
Yes. I don't think software patents promote innovation. I think they primarily serve to entrench incumbents with huge patent portfolios and to reward opportunistic patent trolls. Ultimately we should rethink whether software patents should be allowed at all.
What systematic reforms do you see as most promising?
Congress is considering some legislative reform, but it is generally aimed at litigation abuse. Unfortunately, there is nothing on the table right now that deals with the more fundamental problem of the huge volume of low-quality software patents.
Are there any books or websites you can recommend learning more about the software patent problem?
We blog regularly about these issues at EFF's Deeplinks blog. I especially recommend our Stupid Patent of the Month series. We have a white paper on patent policy at Defend Innovation.
Other resources include Public Knowledge and the Free Software Foundation.

SEATTLE (AP) - Foes of Royal Dutch Shell's use of a Seattle seaport terminal to prepare for exploratory oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean attacked on two fronts Monday as a few hundred protesters blocked port entrances and the City of Seattle declared that Shell and its maritime host lacked a proper permit.
The city issued a violation notice, saying use of Terminal 5 by a massive floating drill rig was in violation of the site's permitted use as a cargo terminal. The 400-foot Polar Pioneer and its support tug Aiviq must be removed from the terminal or Shell's host, Foss Maritime, must obtain an appropriate permit, the Seattle Department of Planning and Development said.
The companies can appeal. Possible fines start at $150 per day and can rise to $500 per day. The notice said the violation must be corrected by June 4.
"It remains our view that the terms agreed upon by Shell, Foss and the Port of Seattle for use of Terminal 5 are valid, and it's our intention to continue loading-out our drilling rigs in preparation for exploratory drilling offshore Alaska," Shell spokesperson Curtis Smith said.
"Terminal 5 is permitted to tie up ships while they are being loaded and unloaded," Foss Maritime spokesperson Paul Queary said. "That is exactly what Foss is doing there."
Queary noted that both Foss and the Port of Seattle are appealing an earlier determination by the city that the use of Terminal 5 was not permitted. Monday's violation notice followed that determination.
Earlier Monday, protesters spent several hours blocking entrances to the terminal where the rig will be loaded before heading to waters off Alaska this summer.
Holding banners and flags, demonstrators marched across a bridge to Terminal 5, temporarily closing the road during Monday morning's commute. Once at the terminal, they spread out across the entrances and rallied, danced and spoke for several hours before leaving the site in the early afternoon.
Organizers had prepared to engage in civil disobedience to stop work on the drill rig, but Seattle police said Monday afternoon that no one had been arrested and the demonstration remained peaceful. A few dozen officers followed the march on foot and bicycle and kept watch at the terminal.
The mass demonstration was the latest protest of the Polar Pioneer's arrival in Seattle. Protesters greeted the rig Thursday, and then hundreds of activists in kayaks and other vessels turned out Saturday for a protest dubbed the "Paddle in Seattle."
Smith said in an email that the "activities of the day were anticipated and did not stop crews from accomplishing meaningful work in preparation for exploration offshore Alaska this summer."
There were minimal operations at Terminal 5, "so there's not much to block," Port of Seattle spokesperson Peter McGraw said. The operator of Terminal 18, a major hub of port activity where the march began, closed those gates in anticipation of the demonstration, they said.
Officials have been urging people to exercise their First Amendment rights safely, and "that's what we've been seeing so far," McGraw said.
The activists say they are concerned about the risk of an oil spill in the remote Arctic waters and the effects that tapping new frontiers of oil and gas reserves will have on global warming. Officials in Alaska have touted the economic benefits that drilling could bring there and to the Pacific Northwest.
On Monday, protesters of all ages sang, rapped and danced at the vehicle gate of Terminal 5. They chanted and held signs saying "Climate Justice For All" and "You Shell Not Pass."
Lisa Marcus, 58, a musician who participated in Saturday's protest, turned up with their "Love the planet" sign for another day of activism Monday.
"We've got to wake up" to the dangers of human-caused climate change, they said, ticking off a list of environmental problems that the world is facing. "Shell is trying to make it worse, and that's not acceptable."
Bitcoins as an Investment
Bitcoins have recently become a hot topic as the exchange ratio of USD to Bitcoins has gone up at a respectable rate and continues to flirt with $50. I think that Bitcoins are a relatively risky investment, but the potential returns are still huge. I could easily see buying in now and selling after a couple percent gain, but I am in it for the long haul. The number of people who have Bitcoins now is still pretty small which is easily less than one percent of the population of the US. As the price continues to go up I think that the media attention will increase.
As the Bitcoin community and infrastructure has matured and developed, the price of Bitcoin has become more resilient to price shocks. While still varying in exchange rate much faster than most other currencies Bitcoin is much more stable now than its drastic price spike and crash of 2011. In March there was even an issue in the Bitcoin system that was quickly resolved by the decentralized authority of the Bitcoin miners. The price temporarily dipped around 20% but took little time to return its previous price.
Also worth mentioning is that the publicity, Bitcoin is receiving, is much more positive than past strong criticism. The price has not responded as drastically, as before, to the increased media attention. In the bubble of 2011 the price went up very quickly then crashed. Since then the price of Bitcoins has gone to new highs much slower than previously. These recent circumstances indicate a healthier infrastructure and a gradually maturing market presence for Bitcoins.
I repeat Bitcoin is a risky investment. I happen to believe that the potential return outweighs the risk; however I make no guarantees. I own a few Bitcoins myself. Please do your own research.

Leftists are escalating their violent tactics against Republican front runner Donald Trump by beheading a Trump effigy look-alike in the streets of Salt Lake City.
Nicole Vowell of KSL 5 tweeted several videos of protesters standing on the steps of city hall on Friday.
In one, a man says, “I don't like anything about Trump,” before taking a stick and beheading the effigy hung by a noose.
They then picks up the head and attempts to punt it like a football.
Another unhinged protester screamed into the microphone about Trump's hair.
#livetweet #dumptrump YES THATS ME AND I JUST LED A REVOLUTION pic.twitter.com/va8R9yPkkC — Hans Styles (@hanskurzius) March 19, 2016
“How can Trump run a country when they can't even do their hair right!” they yelled as the mob cheered. With a frenzied look in their eye, they beat the effigy and screamed. Their Twitter profile says he's a barista at Starbucks.
“Yes that's me and I just led a revolution,” they tweeted.
Fox 13 reports protesters clashed with police after the protest. The news station adds rocks were thrown at Trump rally attendees as they exited the Infinity Event Center.
The smartphone ecosystem is an ever-shifting environment, and regardless of who's on top today, tomorrow might bring about drastic changes like the loss of the crown. It's what happened to Nokia a few years back, and now Samsung might be in line for the same outcome.
After the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, Apple saw skyrocketing sales, which allowed it for the first time to push Samsung aside from the number one spot. But being the tech behemoth that it is, Sammy recomposed itself and took back the first position.
It was, nevertheless, a great achievement for Apple, which only sells a handful of phone models, compared to Samsung, which offers gazillions.
Well, a new report brings information related to the first quarter of 2015 and reveals that once again Samsung has returned to being the number one in terms of global smartphone sales, which have reached the 82.8 million threshold (24.3% market share).
Coming in at number two, we find Apple with 61.6 million devices shipped out during the time period, which translates into 17.9% market share.
Microsoft and Sony are slowly losing the mobile battle
But the interesting part comes now. It appears that two giants of the tech world, Microsoft and Sony, have been pushed aside from the top 10 of global smartphone makers.
Instead, Chinese smartphone makers have popped up like mushrooms after the rain. Actually, aside from Samsung, Apple and LG (number 5), the other 7 remaining top makers are hailing from China.
After having acquired Motorola, Lenovo has become one of the world's most prominent smartphone sellers, and now it is occupying the third position with 5.5% market share and 18.7 million units sold throughout the world.
The number 4 position is reserved for Huawei with LG following on its toes. Xiaomi, ZTE, Coolpad, TCL, and pretty obscure smartphone maker Vivo fill up the remaining seats.
It's interesting how almost unknown device makers are starting to make an appearance in the global shipment numbers, and companies with prestige such as Microsoft and Sony are being pushed aside.
For its part, Microsoft is prepping to launch two flagship Lumia devices and two mid-range ones later in 2015, and Sony has just introduced the Xperia Z4 top-tier in Japan. Which didn't impress us very much.
One of the Hurricanes' most popular assistant coaches won't be a part of Mark Richt's staff after all.
Receivers coach Kevin Beard, who interviewed with the new Hurricanes coach earlier this week, informed the Sun Sentinel via text message on Friday morning that Richt is "going in another direction."
Late Friday night, Sports Illustrated and Fox Sports reported that Beard's replacement would be USF receivers coach Ron Dugans, a former receiver at Florida State while Richt was the Seminoles' offensive coordinator.
Miami made the move official on Saturday, announcing Dugans as its receivers coach and passing game coordinator.
Before coaching receivers at USF, Dugans -- a three-year NFL veteran -- coached receivers at Louisville and Georgia Southern.  They are the final addition to Richt's coaching staff after a source confirmed to the Sun Sentinel on Friday that defensive coordinator Manny Diaz would also coach the team's linebackers and Jon Richt, previously announced as an offensive assistant, would coach quarterbacks.
Beard, meanwhile, was a member of Miami's 2001 national championship team. They spent two years with the Hurricanes, the first as an assistant director of operations in 2014 and as a wide receivers coach last season.
They were immensely popular with current players on both sides of the ball and well-regarded among many top-notch South Florida recruits, most notably St. Thomas Aquinas receiver Sam Bruce, who played for Beard at University School when Beard, a former Plantation High standout, coached at the high school level in Broward County.
This season, Miami's receivers averaged 13.5 yards per catch and were led by Northeast High product Stacy Coley, who had 44 catches for 645 yards and three touchdowns. Rashawn Scott was also a force in the passing game with 47 catches for 620 yards and five touchdowns.
Coley, a junior, has been weighing whether to return to Miami for their senior season or declare for the NFL Draft. They have not made an announcement yet.
With Beard's departure, there remain no coaches at Miami that worked under former coach Al Golden. Longtime strength and conditioning coach Andreu Swasey, who had been at the school since 2000, was not retained. Neither was offensive line coach Art Kehoe, who had previously served as an assistant in some capacity on all five of the Hurricanes' national championship teams.
Other Golden hires -- including Larry Scott, who served as the interim coach when Golden was fired in October -- took jobs elsewhere. Scott was recently named the tight ends coach at Tennessee, while former Miami offensive coordinator James Coley moved on to Georgia, where they are now a receivers coach. Former Hurricanes defensive backs coach Paul Williams took the same job at Illinois, while former defensive line coach Randy Melvin moved on to Purdue.
Dreamy Nudibranch
I was all about the wrecks last week with the USS Hogan and Missile Tower photos. But I go where the boats take me, and so this week, it was back to the kelp.
I tagged along on a spearfishing expedition to Point Loma, and after spotting and pointing out a fantastic halibut who was soon to become a fantastic dinner, I cruised over to the reef to spend some quality time with the nudibranchs.
The kelp forest can be a pretty dreamy place. The light coming through the kelp canopy has an ethereal beauty, and the gentle sway of the kelp stalks in light surge could rock you to sleep.
I wanted to capture that surreal, unearthly quality in this week's nudibranch photos.
I used my Subsee +10 diopters to get really close to these Spanish Shawl nudibranchs for a soft depth of field with creamy bokeh. The shallow focus and bright lighting is a more artsy effect than I usually go for, but I love how it came out!

The Simpsons characters recognition and detection using Keras (Part 1)
Alexandre Attia Blocked Unblock Follow Jun 1, 2017
Deep Learning : Training a convolutional neural network to recognize The Simpsons characters.
As a big Simpsons fan, I have watched a lot (and still watching) of The Simpson episodes -multiple times each- over the years. I wanted to build a neural network which can recognize characters. I don't know right now what will be the applications of the neural net (perhaps computing the characters presence in each episode).
This project is not specially difficult but can be time consuming, because I have to manually label many pictures of each character. I didn't find any The Simpsons characters database on the Internet so I am building it by myself (I am still labeling pictures when I have time). I think it could be useful for other ones. The dataset is already available on Kaggle with exploratory code (in the Kernels section).
After learning and using TensorFlow for different projects, I want to use Keras because of its simplicity (compared to TensorFlow for example) and its capacity (TensorFlow backend) for experimentation. Keras is a Deep Learning library written in Python by Francois Chollet. My approach to solve this problem will be based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) : multi-layered feed-forward neural networking able to learn many features.
You can find the code on the github repo .
Building the image dataset
The dataset currently features 18 classes/characters (the data on Kaggle contains 20 classes, but currently I used only 18 characters for training). Please check the image below for the characters used. The pictures are under various size, scenes, could be cropped from other characters and are mainly extracted from episodes (season 4 to 24).
The Simpsons characters
The training set includes about 1000 images per character (still labeling data to get to this number). The character is not necessarily centered in each image and could sometimes be with other characters (but it should be the most important part in the picture).
Dataset distribution for 20 characters (on 6/19/2017)
With label_data.py, you can label data from .avi movies : you can get a cropped sub picture (left or right part) or the full picture and then label it by entering a part of the character name (burns for Charles Montgomery Burns).
To add more data, I also use the Keras model. I capture videos and get 3 pictures for each frame I analyzed (left part, right part, full) and then I ask my algorithm to classify each pictures. Afterward, I check each picture it has classified. It's still manual but it's faster and it's an incremental process that's more and more fast, particularly for “small” characters.
Preprocessing
The first step for preprocessing pictures is resizing them. We need to have all pictures with the same size for training. I will convert data as float32 to save some memory and normalize them (divide by 255.). Then, instead of characters name, I use numbers and thanks to Keras, I can quickly convert those categories to vectors :
import keras
import cv2
pic_size = 64
num_classes = 10
img = cv2.resize(img, (pic_size, pic_size)).astype('float32') / 255. ...
y = keras.utils.to_categorical(y, num_classes)
I am splitting my dataset into a training and a testing set : for this, I use sklearn train_test_split function.
Deep Learning Model(s)
Now, let's begin the “funny” part : defining our model. Right now, we'll use a feed forward 4 convolutional layers with ReLU activation followed by a fully connected hidden layer (see below for a deeper model). This model is similar to the CIFAR example from Keras documentation. I also use dropout layers to regularize and avoid overfitting. The output layer uses softmax activation to output the probability for each class. I also tried to replace ReLU by ELU (like ReLU but with a mean closer to zero) but it didn't work.
Categorical Cross Entropy loss is -as often- used. And for the optimizer, I use RMS Prop which is a stochastic gradient descend where we “divide the learning rate for a weight by a running average of the magnitudes of recent gradients for that weight” .
Training the model
For the training, the model is iterating over batches of training set (batch size : 32) for 200 epochs.
As I don't have a huge data set, I am using data augmentation (which is really simple to use with Keras library). It means doing a number of random variations over the pictures so the model never see the same picture twice. This helps prevent overfitting and helps the model generalize better.
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
featurewise_center=False, # set input mean to 0 over the dataset
samplewise_center=False, # set each sample mean to 0
featurewise_std_normalization=False, # divide inputs by std
samplewise_std_normalization=False, # divide each input by its std
rotation_range=0, # randomly rotate images in the range
width_shift_range=0.1, # randomly shift images horizontally
height_shift_range=0.1, # randomly shift images vertically
horizontal_flip=True, # randomly flip images
vertical_flip=False) # randomly flip images
This take a while running on CPU (on my computer) so I run it on GPU with AWS EC2, Tesla K80: 8 seconds per epoch. In total, it took 20 minutes (which is really quick for deep learning).
As we can on the plot, after 200 epochs, it seems to have reach the asymptote, without an obvious overfitting. Moreover, the accuracy seems good too.
Loss and Accuracy (Validation and Training) during training
Classification evaluation
Of course, right now, it's complicated to have a true model accuracy because of the low number of pictures but as the number of pictures will grow, it will be more pertinent. Thanks to sklearn it's really easy to print a classification report :
4 convolutional layers net
As you can see, the accuracy (f1-sport) is really good : above 90 % for every character except Lisa. The precision for Lisa is 82%. Maybe Lisa is mixed up with other characters.
Indeed, Lisa is often mixed up with Bart. Probably because many pictures of Lisa contain Bart too.
Adding a threshold to improve the accuracy
In order to improve the precision (so, of course decrease the recall, but I would try to not decrease it too much), I thought that I can maybe add a threshold.
Before to talk about a threshold to improve accuracy. I just want to have a famous graph about recall and precision.
Graph to define recall and precision
I compute some statistics about good and wrong predictions : maximum probability predictions, the probability difference between the best two candidates and the std.
For good predictions : Max : 0.83, Difference Two First : 0.773, STD : 0.21
For wrong predictions : Max : 0.27, Difference Two First : 0.092, STD : 0.07
If the probability of the predicted character (1.) is too low, the standard deviation of the prediction (2.) is too high or the probability difference between the two most likely characters (3.) is too low maybe we can say that we don't want to predict a character at all.
So I plot those 3 values for the test set to find a line (or a hyperplane) to separate good and wrong predictions. I did it for both characters.
High court rules in favour of Omodele Meadows, who says they would have terminated their pregnancy if they had known child would have haemophilia
Woman awarded £9m damages for care of son who 'should not have been born'
A mother has been awarded £9m in high court damages to raise the son who would not have been born if they had known of their haemophilia.
Shortly after Omodele Meadows gave birth to Adejuwon in September 2011, they discovered they had the rare condition that affects the blood's ability to clot.
The six-year-old's condition is severe and their joints have been affected by repeated bleeds.
In December 2015, they were diagnosed with autism, which has made the management of their haemophilia more complicated.
They do not understand the benefit of the treatment they require and will not tell their parents when they have a bleed.
Adejuwon is unlikely to be able to administer their own medication or manage their own treatment plan and their autism will also prevent them living independently or finding paid employment.
Meadows, 40, brought proceedings against GP Dr Hafshah Khan, who worked in a practice in south London when Meadows saw them in 2006 to obtain the results of blood tests they had requested after their nephew was diagnosed with haemophilia.
The tests, which had been arranged by another GP, could establish whether a patient had haemophilia, but could not confirm whether Meadows was a carrier of the gene, said Mrs Justice Yip.
Meadows was told that the results were normal and, as a result of the advice received at that consultation and the earlier one, was led to believe that any child they had would not have the condition.
The judge said that, had Meadows been referred for genetic testing in 2006, they would have known they were a carrier and undergone foetal testing.
That would have disclosed that the foetus was affected and they would have chosen to terminate the pregnancy.
It was agreed that Meadows could recover the additional costs of raising Adejuwon connected with their haemophilia, but it was disputed that this applied to their autism.
Dr Khan's case was that such costs were outside the scope of their liability because the service they were providing was only in relation to the risk of haemophilia.
The judge said that Meadows was entitled to the additional costs associated with both conditions and awarded them the sum of £9m, which had been agreed subject to the resolution of the legal issue.
In their ruling, the judge said: “It cannot be easy for any mother to contend bluntly that their child should not have been born.”
But Ms Meadows's love for their son “shone through”, they added. “She had specifically sought to avoid bringing a child with haemophilia into the world, knowing the suffering that the condition causes.
“The fact that they say clearly that they would have terminated their pregnancy had they known the baby would have haemophilia is not the same at all as saying that Adejuwon is now an unwanted child.
“On the contrary, it appears that they are much loved and well cared for. The burden of caring for him, though, is much greater than the burden of caring for a ‘normal', healthy child and extends far beyond the purely financial cost.
“Although this is a claim for their loss, I do not doubt that their primary motive in bringing this claim is to provide a better life for them son.”
The judge added: “Equally, I recognise it cannot be easy for a doctor to admit liability on the basis of a consultation to give blood results which they themselves had not ordered and probably in the course of a busy day.
“Concerns about the rising cost of clinical negligence claims and the impact on general practitioners' indemnity insurance have been widely reported. Holding the balance between these competing concerns is not easy and simply highlights the need for rigorous application of the legal principles, putting sympathy aside.”

Property developers have sparked outrage by boasting to Asian investors that a new luxury tower block in one of the poorest areas of London will have “no social housing.”
More than 30 flats in the nine-storey Abbey Tower development in Greenwich are being put up for sale in London this week and at an event in Hong Kong later this month.
An advert on the website of the London and Hong Kong based agent Fraser & Co, which is hosting the launch event at the Mandarin Oriental hotel, highlights the fact that the development is “a fully private block with no social housing”.
The absence of affordable housing is listed as a major attraction, along with its proximity to a planned Abbey Wood Crossrail station, opening in 2018.
London Assembly Green Party member Darren Johnson said: “Boasting about the absence of social housing in adverts for new developments shows that housing policy in London is about meeting the needs of wealthy investors, not about the needs of ordinary Londoners. At least this appalling advert is honest about it.”
The row is the latest in a series of controversies about the glossy marketing of private homes in areas of London that are in the throes of regeneration but lack affordable housing.
Last week, a four-minute video promoting apartments costing up to £23 million at Berkeley's One Blackfriars tower in Southwark was pulled after viewers branded it sexist and likened it to soft porn.
A promotional video for the One Commercial Street scheme on the edge of the City from developer Redrow also prompted a Twitter storm when it was likened to American Psycho or “an Eighties aftershave commercial.”
The one, two and three-bedroom flats at Abbey Tower, the first phase of the Close Quarter development in Abbey Wood, are advertised as starting from £275,000 and come with a “free furniture pack and legal fees paid”.
A brochure for the scheme, which is being developed by property firms Development Securities and Hurlington, says the apartments have been “furnished with an unwavering attention to detail”.
Lawrence Martin, director of projects at Development Securities, said the wording in the advert was for “technical reasons” because buy-to-let investors often ask if there is social housing as it can affect the level of service charges.
They said the wider Abbey Wood regeneration includes a large Sainsbury's, a new library, surgery and primary school. There will be a further 186 flats of which 24 per cent are “affordable”.
NATO must prepare for nuclear first strike, report urges
By Bill Van Auken
24 January 2008
A chilling report prepared by a group of top military commanders from the US and its NATO allies declares that the alliance must be prepared to launch a preemptive nuclear first strike because of “asymmetric threats and global challenges” posed to the West.
“The first use of nuclear weapons must remain in the quiver of escalation as the ultimate instrument to prevent the use of weapons of mass destruction, in order to avoid truly existential dangers,” declares the report, which is titled “Towards a Grand Strategy for an Uncertain World: Renewing Transatlantic Partnership.”
The authors of the document, which has been submitted to the Pentagon and the NATO command, include Gen. John Shalikashvili (ret.), who was chief of the joint chiefs of staff under the Clinton administration, as well as former chiefs of the armed forces in Britain, France, Germany and the Netherlands.
According to a report published Tuesday in the British Guardian, “The manifesto has been written following discussions with active commanders and policymakers, many of whom are unable or unwilling to publicly air their views.” It is expected to be a key subject of discussion at a NATO summit to be held in Bucharest in April.
The report presents a grim picture of the 21st century, portraying the major Western powers as under siege from real and potential enemies as well as objective changes in the global situation.
It calls attention to population growth and climate change as exacerbating world conflicts and warns that terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the struggle for “scarce resources,” particularly oil, poses new threats. It also singles out China, Russia and Iran as actual or potential enemies.
In response to these supposed threats, the report calls for the NATO alliance to adopt a strategy of “escalation dominance, the use of a full bag of both carrots and sticks—and indeed all instruments of soft and hard power, ranging from the diplomatic protest to nuclear weapons.”
It warns that “traditional forms and methods of governments and international organizations,” particularly the UN, are incapable of proceeding with sufficient speed to maintain such dominance, and therefore a sweeping overhaul of NATO is required to create an adequate instrument for global intervention.
In a tone that recalls nothing so much as the rantings of Dr. Strangelove, the report states, “Nuclear weapons are the ultimate instrument of an asymmetric response—and at the same time the ultimate tool of escalation.”
It continues: “Regrettably, nuclear weapons—and with them the option of first use—are indispensable, since there is simply no realistic prospect of a nuclear-free world. On the contrary, the risk of further proliferation is imminent and, with it, the danger that nuclear war fighting, albeit limited in scope, might become possible.... In sum, nuclear weapons remain indispensable, and nuclear escalation continues to remain an element of any modern strategy.”
The report goes on to describe “nuclear escalation” as “the ultimate step in responding symmetrically, and at the same time the most powerful way of inducing uncertainty in an opponent's mind.”
While the passages on the prospects of a preemptive nuclear strike name no specific targets, there is little doubt that the immediate “opponent” in the mind of its authors is Iran. The document perversely portrays a nuclear first strike as an instrument for preventing nuclear weapons proliferation.
Iran is “strongly suspected of engaging in a military nuclear programme,” the report states. It continues: “The willingness of the USA and its coalition partners to rid the world of the two terrible regimes of Saddam Hussein's Iraq and the Taliban has left a vacuum that Iran is stepping into, with the world unable to contain Iran's growing influence in the region.”
“As a nuclear power,” it continues, “Iran could become immune to international sanctions. Furthermore, it would dominate the region, which possesses the world's largest oil and gas reserves.”
This last question is clearly the principal concern among the ruling elite in both the US and Europe—that the major powers would face a direct challenge to their control over strategic energy supplies now dominated by the multinational oil companies.
The report essentially reiterates positions already enunciated by the Bush administration in Washington, which has repeatedly stressed that it is keeping “all options on the table,” including the use of nuclear weapons, in its global war on terror and its confrontations with so-called “rogue states.”
In 2002, the US administration drafted a Nuclear Posture Review that spelled out the kind of preemptive nuclear first-strike policy put forward in the NATO report. It declared that the US “reserves the right to respond with overwhelming force—including the use of nuclear weapons—to the use of [WMD] against the United States, our forces abroad, and friends and allies.” It went on to assert that the US must develop “the capabilities to detect and destroy an adversary's WMD assets before these weapons are used.”
In 2006, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh cited extensive intelligence and military sources in a report that revealed the Bush administration had drafted plans for a preemptive attack on Iran, which included the use of “tactical nuclear devices” to obliterate not only the country's nuclear program, but also large elements of its security forces and basic infrastructure.
The document submitted to NATO by the former chiefs of staff echoes the twisted logic utilized by the Bush administration in its attempt to justify its policy of preventive war.
“The early use of military responses is often linked to pre-emption and prevention—both elements of modern strategy,” it states. “Both are applicable throughout a crisis or conflict, and neither is necessarily linked to a specific set of instruments, such as the military. Pre-emption is the reactive response, when an opponent's action is considered imminent; whereas prevention is a proactive step aimed at denial—and thus at conflict termination—in a situation in which the threat is not yet imminent, but in which evidence indisputably points to the unavoidability of conflict. Pre-emption is widely seen as a legal act of self-defence under customary international law, whereas the question of the legality of a preventive use of force so far remains unanswered.”
This is a deliberate and nonsensical falsification. Under international law, a “preventive use of force” is indistinguishable from illegal aggression—a “war of choice” waged by a military power to eliminate some perceived future threat that would place it at a strategic disadvantage. At the Nuremberg trial of the Nazi leadership, such a war was described as the “supreme international crime.”
While the ex-defense chiefs' report makes the case for NATO playing the role of a “global security provider,” independent of and, whenever necessary, in defiance of the United Nations and international law, much of the document consists of a worried critique of the present state of the Atlantic alliance.
It states, for example, that interventions in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq have all been characterized by “the absence of a properly defined political objective, the absence of an integrated and allied strategy to achieve that objective, and the absence of capabilities to implement the strategy.”
It adds, “In addition, nations have commonly imposed too many national caveats on use of their forces. There exists an unwillingness on the part of nations to transfer authority to the operational commander once in the theatre of operations. Finally, there is a tendency for nations not to resource operations effectively.”
These statements appear to directly reflect the bitter divisions that have opened up between Washington and its NATO allies in Afghanistan, where the US has been forced to dispatch thousands more Marines because of the refusal of Germany, France and Italy to send more troops or waive restrictions on the rules of engagement for those they have already sent. At the same time, the European members have criticized the American military for excessive use of force, which they have blamed for the mounting resistance in the occupied country.
A section of the document proposes far-reaching changes to the NATO command structure in order to enable the military alliance “to respond at short notice and conduct operations at a high operational tempo.”
These include changing from consensus decisions within NATO to majority votes in order to prevent dissent from blocking military interventions. The document also demands the scrapping of all “national caveats” limiting the use of European military forces, as in Afghanistan, placing them under a centralized and unrestricted NATO command.
The document calls for NATO to deny any say in its military operations to members of the alliance that do not contribute military forces to carry them out. It also explicitly advocates that NATO be prepared to carry out military action without United Nations Security Council authorization when “immediate action is needed to protect large numbers of human beings.”
In its conclusion, the document declares, “The lack of cooperation—indeed, at times, the rivalry—between the EU and NATO is something that must be rectified.” It insists, “For the USA to play its role as effectively as possible, the transatlantic bargain between the European countries, Canada and their American ally must be renewed.”
The reality is that the “transatlantic bargain” is coming unraveled as a result of the historic decline in the global position of US capitalism and the relentless turn by the American ruling elite towards militarism.
While the European bourgeoisie has repeatedly subordinated itself to Washington, including in the war against Iraq and the escalating threats against Iran, its interests and those of American capitalism do not coincide. The struggle between rival capitalist nations for “scarce resources”—which is the fundamental source of both of these conflicts—ultimately pits European capitalism against US imperialism.
Then there are China and Russia, which are increasingly asserting their own interests internationally. Significantly, just the day before the call for NATO preemptive nuclear strikes grabbed international headlines, the chief of staff of the Russian military issued their own similar warning.
“We do not intend to attack anyone, but we consider it necessary that all our partners in the international community clearly understand that for the defense of our sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Russia and its allies, the armed forces will be employed, including preventively the use of nuclear weapons,” said General Yuri Bauyevsky.
It is the drive by US imperialism to offset its economic decline in relation to rivals in Europe and Asia by exploiting its military superiority to seize hold of vital natural resources and markets that poses the threat of a world conflagration. It is in this context that the recommendations of the former defense chiefs in relation to nuclear first strikes and wars of aggression assume their full menacing significance for the future of humankind.
SEVERAL months ago, an evangelical right-winger invited me and some other twitter agnostic/atheists to take part in a radio phone-in that was so one sided and poorly organised it resulted in one of the Christian participants crying foul over the way some of the non-religious were treated. A week later, in another discussion, they were rewarded for their honesty by having some similarly dirty tricks played on them too.
Impressed with their refusal to be clumped in with the lunatics, I stayed in-touch with Heidi (@aslansmane) and exchanged several emails with her, in which we eventually decided to coauthor a statement and counter-statement book together, which attempted to address some of the truth-claims made by the religious and the tactics some use to preach their message.
So far, so good. But after sending them my introductory chapter and fielding some feedback on the best direction for the rest of the book to take, I discovered that Heidi had closed down the original Twitter account they had been using during the time we met, from across the proverbial divide, and had begun instead to use an account which trotted out many of the logical fallacies and straw-man arguments our joint venture was ostensibly charged with combating.
Keen to both give them the benefit of the doubt and see the project through to completion, I simply asked them to ensure that the series of “experiments” they were running via their blog, didn't stray into bait and switch territory that might leave anyone feeling tricked into taking part. This stood for both their Christian readership and those drawn into the debate by their increasingly antagonistic tweets.
Sadly it now seems that's pretty much exactly what Heidi wanted to do. I don't for the life of me know why, but there you have it. It could be a limelight thing, if I'm being rude about it, but I think what's more likely is that they simply didn't fully think through what might go wrong and wasn't about to take advice from a non-Christian on how the experiment they claim to have been conducting might have yielded much better results if she'd worked with me on it, thereby positively informing the debate we had hoped to play out in our coauthored book.
Given the wording of their latest blog entry on this matter and noises they have made to me in private emails, where we are right now with this joint project is that Heidi is no longer involved. That leaves me with two chapters I spent a considerable amount of time researching and setting out with nothing by way of any genuinely intended push-back from a Christian perspective to balance things out—save for a rattled out in five minutes reply chapter, penned by Heidi, which sadly couldn't have more completely ignored each of the points I attempted to make in my opening statement if it tried. (Not included)
So if you're a Christian or you know a Christian who would like to read and reply to the two opening chapters below, please contact thatjim@gmail.com
If nothing else I hope you enjoy reading what I have so far—and I look forward to one day completing the project in the way it was originally intended to be read.

Gates, who has said they will leave office this year, predicts that future conflicts will look radically different [AFP]
Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, has warned that the US should avoid future land wars such as those it has fought in Iraq and Afghanistan but not forget the difficult lessons learned in those conflicts.
Gates was chosen as defence secretary by George Bush, the former president, and given the job of rescuing the military from what many saw as an unwinnable war in Iraq by Barack Obama, the incumbent president.
"In my opinion, any future defence secretary who advises the president to again send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa should have their head examined," Gates said in a speech to cadets at the US Military Academy at West Point, in New York state, on Friday.
As a result of the last 10 years at war, West Point cadets are joining a force that is "resilient but also stressed and tired", Gates said during what is expected to be their last address at the training ground for future army officers.
"The army must prepare itself for the complex threats it will face in the future, including terrorists seeking weapons of mass destruction, outlier nations capable of nuclear warfare and the modern militaries being assembled in Russia and China," they said.
Today's army is filled with soldiers who have had "little opportunity to do more than catch their breath and then get ready for the next deployment',' Gates said.
Gates, who has said they will leave office this year, but has not announced when, laid out their vision for the future of the US army as it regroups after a decade of long and repeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.
Gates said conflicts will require Navy and Air Force engagements, not head-on clash of big land forces [AFP]
"The army has made a painful war-driven transition from a force designed to face off against other large militaries to a more nimble service that trains other armies and takes on nation-building even as it hunts insurgents," Gates said.
"It must better prepare itself to continue to face such unconventional threats and unorthodox duties in the future."
Gates has made many decisions regarding the nation's 1.1 million-strong ground force since they took over the senior Pentagon role in December 2006.
They came in facing an escalating war in Iraq that was requiring more forces.
Over time they sent thousands more troops into Iraq to a peak of nearly 180,000 and was forced to extend soldiers' deployment tours from 12 months to 15 months.
As the Iraq war began to wind down, they and the Obama administration ordered another surge this time into Afghanistan, where they are battling entrenched uprisings in the south and east.
Future high-end conflicts involving the US military are more likely to be fought with air and sea power instead of large ground forces such as the one that invaded Iraq in 2003 and the one in Afghanistan, they said.
thank's guy's, i thought i'd show how to build one this way because i think lots more people have tablesaw's than bandsaw's, or atleast access to one, well i put it on the long string, but the long string should be short enough that there's no slack in it, then i exercise it and use a gizzmo to find any flat spot's that need scraped, i feel that a gizzmo is almost a requirement to have, especcially on a non character bow such as a board bow. after you get it flexing evenly about 8" go to a short brace of about 3", and continue to use the gizzmo to check for spots that need scrapedtill you get to about 24-25" on a treethen go to full brace, i like to brace it and leave it sit for an hr or sothis is the last that i use the tree, the rest of the way i strech it out buy shooting it in, i have an arrow with marks on it and i just keep working and shooting till i get to full draw
MINNEAPOLIS -- Like a long incomplete pass bouncing untouched on the turf, Bernard Berrian's time in Minnesota fell well short of the hopes and expectations they raised following a strong first season with the Vikings.
Berrian was waived Tuesday, halfway into their fourth year with the team.
They met with coach Leslie Frazier on Monday about their status and had another talk scheduled for Tuesday, following their second healthy scratch in three games.
Frazier declined to specify on Sunday after losing to Green Bay why they left Berrian on the inactive list again, but the coach hinted this move was coming.
Berrian watched the Oct. 9 game against Arizona on the sideline in street clothes, too, and Frazier said that was for a disciplinary reason, reportedly because they missed two team meetings.
The coach said afterward they didn't "foresee any future problems" and that Berrian remained a significant part of the team's offensive plans, but the vote of confidence was conspicuously missing the past two days when Frazier gave vague answers to questions from reporters about Berrian's status.
Between those benchings, Berrian had their most productive game of the season, with five receptions for 54 yards.
But even that night at Chicago, they dropped a crucial third-down pass while running wide open on a slant route, failing to give quarterback Donovan McNabb and the struggling offense an important early spark.
In a statement issued by their representatives, EAG Sports Management, Berrian said late Tuesday he's been "blessed to have had the opportunity to be a part of the Minnesota Vikings organization" and "can't say enough about" their teammates and their experience in Minnesota.
"I view this as an opportunity to grow as a player and to bring strengths to a new organization. I am eager to begin the next stage in my career and excited about the opportunity to continue my journey with a new team," Berrian's statement said.
It appears U.S. News & World Report's propaganda is working—new census records show folks are fleeing New York as fast as...well, not the subways, but something. A native New Yorker brushing past tourists in Times Square? Sure, that.
According to the NY Post, U.S. census records show that over 1 million people have abandoned the New York area since 2010, opting to forgo our high tax rates and rampant political corruption in favor of Florida's sinkholes and whatever's in Texas. This is the "highest negative net migration rate among the nation's large population centers," the Post reports.
This trend isn't limited to this fair town—the census data includes parts of New Jersey, Connecticut, the lower Hudson Valley and Long Island. In 2016, 223,423 people left the area, as opposed to only 187,034 in 2015.
Public policy experts told the Post the phenomenon is related to the economy. "The historical trend is that out-migration grows when the economy is getting better," Empire Center for Public Policy research director E.J. McMahon told the outlet. "As the economy gets better, there are more jobs outside the region and by the same token . . . more people to buy your house if you're a baby boomer looking to move to Boca Raton or Myrtle Beach."
Other cities of interest include Denver, Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Portland, Oregon, a city famously known for being where millennials go to retire.
NYC is still full of human bodies—the population is up 2.7 percent from 2010 to 2016, and ticked up last year. But the speed of growth is slowing down. After all, it's so expensive to live here you can't blame folks for throwing in the towel in favor of, say, Philadelphia or Dallas—there might be a lot of jobs here, but you have to work harder to live, and as cheaper and warmer cities see a spike in their own job markets, they become far more appealing. Plus, there's less risk of drowning in slush puddles, even if you're more likely to become one of those terrible people who appreciates fresh air.

The American public is slowly coming around to the idea that global warming is real, but there are a significant number of scientists at this point who believe we may be too late to do anything about it. As one of the biggest contributors of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, our failure to accept that global warming is happening threatens to become an epic tragedy that historians will sadly puzzle over centuries from now, assuming we don't roast ourselves before that.
The US has always been an epicenter of science skepticism. There are several reasons for this. One is that Americans tend to be independent, self-reliant people. There is nothing wrong with a bit of independence, but when it causes one to make ignorant and harmful mistakes, it has gone too far. The world is complicated but we need to arm ourselves with knowledge in several different areas in order to achieve our : and medicine, finance, and to name a few. An effective thinker knows when to use the work of others and is able to gauge how much trust to put in it.
Another source of this skepticism is a misunderstanding about the nature of accepted scientific results. They are not engraved in stone. They represent no more than our best theories at this time. As science progresses, they will be corrected and augmented and probably ultimately be discarded in favor of more effective theories. But our best course of action as independent decision makers is to arm ourselves with as much of our current scientific knowledge that we can.
In this post I will sketch three reasons why science is generally worthy of our trust.
The unity of science
Creationists are some of the biggest science skeptics. They believe that their dispute is only with a branch of biology known as evolutionary biology. But this branch of biology is connected by thousands of chains of evidence and reasoning to the rest of biology. The genome of an organism, for instance, relates to the development of that organism as well as its evolution. Certain branches of chemistry are inferentially nearby,such as molecular . These branches of chemistry are in turn connected by thousands of lines of evidence and reasoning to the rest of chemistry. Creationism also contradicts astronomy, since astronomy tells us that the earth is billions of years old, and that the surrounding universe is several billions years older. There is light just now reaching this planet that has been traveling for billions of years. Likewise, the same carbon 14 that allows us to attach dates to fossils and other organic material is thoroughly connected to modern physics via thousands of inferential links. Creationism also contradicts fundamental tenets of geology, such as the idea that geological layers are deposited over millions of years. Taking on one branch of science is like picking a fight with one member of a very close family: fight one of them and you must fight them all.
The entirety of science could still be mistaken, but the unity of science argument makes it clear that the creationist's is a bitter one.  They are not merely choosing an alternative account of the origins of animals, they are choosing an entirely different way of life. They must disbelieve and attempt to refute the entirety of science and its accumulated knowledge. The more you go against orthodoxy, the greater your burden of proof. Given this, the burden of proof on creationism is heavy. They need to make bold claims about what their theory predicts and verify them, and this has not happened.
The connection between science and technology
Science and technology are connected via millions of threads of inference. For instance, Einstein made a scientific breakthrough that led via a chain of inference to a technological breakthrough: nuclear power. Sometimes people follow threads in the other direction, seeking to understand an existing technology by extending scientific theories. While we have mastered the technology of anaesthesia, for example, we still do not have an adequate scientific of what exactly it does to the brain.
To be consistent, extreme science skeptics such as creationists should not trust any existing technology. They should not use computers, drive modern cars, fly on airplanes, or have an MRI done, since the same science that tells us that animals evolved created these technologies. But of course these are reliable technologies. The best explanation for this fact and the fact that our cars go, our bridges do not fall down, hospital patients get better at ever-improving rates, and so on, is that the science behind these achievements correctly describes the world.
Science's system of checks and balances
Science skeptics often speak as if the entire scientific community is engaged in a secret conspiracy. As with many of their charges, there is a certain amount of truth here. Science is subject to fads and to other non-scientific factors. Just as do all humans, scientists tend to form cliques and in-groups who delight in keeping out interlopers, usually for reasons having nothing to do with the scientific merit of their work. But there is one immensely powerful force that keeps science objective and scientists honest: . There are two ways an ambitious young scientist can make a name for herself. First, they can make some important new discovery. But this can take a lifetime to achieve. However, there is a second, quicker route to success. They can show that some well accepted claim or theory is false. Established scientists are like gunfighters: They know that there are plenty of young guns waiting to take them out if they make a mistake. If a scientist publishes results that other scientists are unable to replicate, this is a substantial blow to the reputation of that scientist. Aging scientists also know that they must stay up to date on recent discoveries in their field, otherwise they won't be able to get their work published, since every science article must begin with a review of the current state of the literature.
Before a study can be accepted as part of the scientific canon, albeit temporarily, by being published in a scientific journal, it must pass several tests. First, the authors typically must possess an advanced degree in the relevant field. Ph. D.'s and M.D.'s are not easy to get. Early in their training, students are in a massive learning phase, where they are tested constantly. Later in their training, they must prove that they can conduct independent research, under the supervision of a committee of five or so professors. Second, every journal has a review process in which a submitted article is sent to three referees who are among the world's best experts in that field. Hence they are in competition with the authors of the article they are reviewing. The referees then return a review of the study, along with their opinion on whether it merits publication. In the case of a mixed verdict, the editors of the journal may ask for the opinion of additional referees, or may decide to publish or not based on the content of the reviews, along with what they know about the characteristics of the particular referees involved. These referees, by the way, are not paid anything for their work, they offer their opinions are part of belonging to a community of scientists.
The bottom line is not that scientists are unbiased. To be human is to be biased. But science as a whole minimizes its sources of by allowing them to cancel each other out. To reject science is to reject a significant portion of the whole human project. It amounts to rejecting the idea that knowledge is possible. Any rejection of science, furthermore, should be based on good reasons, i.e., it should be based on knowledge. And to reject the possibility of knowledge by using knowledge amounts to a contradiction.
It is hard to fathom what the Prime Minister was thinking when they decided to award Prince Philip an Australian knighthood. If this ever was a good idea, Australia Day wasn't the time. A Queen's Birthday honour maybe, but not Australia Day. I don't like the reintroduction of Dames and Knights in any event. but giving Prince Philip this award on Australia Day just refreshed our memories of our colonial past on a day in which we are meant to be celebrating the nation we are today and want to be in the future.
There are plenty of ardent republicans like me who have great admiration, respect and affection for our monarch. I can't think of a woman in my lifetime who would serve as a better example of putting honour, duty and responsibility ahead of self. But the overwhelmingly negative reaction to Prince Philip's knighthood shows that the admiration, respect and affection of Australians is very much focused on the Queen's life of service and does not go beyond that. John Howard's call after the 1999 republican referendum for "intergenerational tolerance" alludes to the view that no change will be made until the death or abdication of our current monarch.

The brouhaha over the Prince Philip appointment shows how far the Australian psyche has moved in the past 15 years. That so many people are annoyed indicates a growing gap between who we see ourselves as being today and our past.
I suspect the appointment was intended as a thoughtful gesture of goodwill. Sadly, it has shown that the nation doesn't have much, other than for the Queen. What our Queen and their consort have been treated to, compliments of the Prime Minister, is days and days of media coverage both here and Britain highlighting just that point. The media coverage has made a joke not just of the appointment but of the appointee. The PM has caused embarrassment to their own Queen. No one, especially a monarchist such as Tony Abbott, would ever have intended that.
FANS of Japanese anime had much to rejoice this week. First, there was the announcement that Hayao Miyazaki had come out of retirement. The 75-year-old co-founder of Studio Ghibli, and the director of such beloved masterpieces as “Spirited Away”, said that they couldn't resist making one more feature film, even if they will be 80 before they complete “Boro the Caterpillar”. But that wasn't the only good news for anime aficionados. Coincidentally, Mr Miyazaki's statement came just before the British release of “Your Name”, a film so exquisite and unpredictable that its director, Makoto Shinkai, has been called, yes, “the new Hayao Miyazaki”.
Mr Shinkai is no imitator, though. Their originality is obvious within the opening minutes of “Your Name”, with their zooming “camera” movement, their snappy editing, their unusual angles, their richly-detailed cityscapes and rural vistas, and, most of all, their variety of gorgeous lighting effects. A distinctive blend of conventional hand-drawn animation techniques and digital flair, “Your Name” is worth seeing for the shafts of sunshine in a dusty room, and the coruscating purple trail of a comet across the night sky.

It's so disorientating in its rhythms—and so lovely to behold—that it's a while before the film reveals itself to be a fast, well-observed, “Freaky Friday”-style body-swap comedy. Its teenage hero, Mitsuha (voiced by Mone Kamishiraishi), is a schoolgirl who is bored of life in their lakeside mountain town. Never mind its idyllic views and its ancient rituals, there are no cafes for them to go to, so they dream of living as a boy in the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. And, somehow, their dream comes true. One morning, they can't understand why everyone keeps telling them that they behaved weirdly the previous day, but they eventually figure it out: two or three times a week, they wake up to find that their mind has switched places with that of Taki (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a Tokyo resident of their own age.
At first, this bizarre phenomenon works out well for both of them. When Taki is in Mitsuha's body, their basketball skills turn them into a school champion, and when Mitsuha is in Taki's body, their feminine sensitivity impresses the girl they have a crush on. Not that the youngsters are always so intent on helping each other. Obsessed as they are by metropolitan cafes, Mitsuha can't stop ordering expensive desserts whenever they take over Taki's identity. Taki, meanwhile, can't stop fondling Mitsuha's breasts whenever they take over hers—much to the bemusement of their younger sister.
A further twist is that, once they return to their own selves, Mitsuha and Taki soon forget what they did during the switch. This fairy-tale logic is something of a narrative cheat, but the amnesia is ultimately what gives the film its considerable poignancy. Like “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind”, “Your Name” forces us to ask how much of ourselves we lose whenever a memory slips away, and why crises which once felt monumental can come to seem trivial just a few years later.
And that is just half of the film. “Your Name” would have been a quirky delight if it had stuck to the romantic high-school mix-ups, but it races past them on its way to a bigger, stranger and more momentous story. It would be wrong to reveal how exactly it leaps to a thrilling new genre while retaining its initial nuanced charm and humanity. But it is fair to say that, as innovative as Mr Shinkai undoubtedly is, they stick to the anime tradition of making everything go spectacularly psychedelic and apocalyptic towards the end of the film. Anyone who came out of “Arrival” with a hunger for more expansive, heart-rending science-fiction will tuck into “Your Name” as greedily as Mitsuha/Taki tucks into her/his delicious desserts.
Why California's Push for Rooftop Solar is a Foggy Idea
Would you trust your neighbors with billions of dollars of public money to invest in a clean energy future? If you live in California, this isn't a hypothetical question.
California Gov. Jerry Brown last month announced their intention to rely on “tens of thousands of little decisions” by Californians to develop a 12 giga-watt renewable energy infrastructure by 2020. In remarks at a UCLA clean energy conference, Brown embraced distributed solar generation in order to avoid the pitfalls that often encumber large-scale renewable energy projects, including the capital costs of transmitting energy from far-flung deserts and hilltops. Furthermore, rooftop solar panels and Cameron-esque windmills also pose little threat to desert tortoises or sacred Native American sites, so they are less apt to be caught up in the kind of litigation that has delayed major renewable projects.
But energy policy that relies on distributed generation has its drawbacks. Perhaps most notably, it forsakes economies of scale. It also places infrastructure investment decisions in the hands of homeowners, who, as this space has suggested, may not make socially optimal—or even individually rational—choices.
Early evidence from California suggests that because of these drawbacks, relying on tiny decisions is no silver bullet to a green energy future—and it could be a big mistake.
How else to describe the state's decision to partner with homeowners to install 1,923 residential rooftop solar installations in San Francisco, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration characterizes as having persistent clouds and fog during the summer? Despite the weather, San Francisco is still among the top ten cities in California with the most distributed solar panels per household. Solar panels in San Francisco may generate enough energy over their 20-25-year life spans to repay homeowners for their investments. But it's clear those green energy dollars could be put to far better use in desert communities, like Apple Valley, where 22% more solar energy lands each year (according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory), and yet only one in 90 homes harvest it.
If San Francisco's residential solar panels were relocated to Apple Valley, they would produce another 2.1 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity each year—enough to power 320 average California homes. That would add as much green energy to the state's electrical grid as installing another 415 average solar systems in San Francisco. At a $0.12 rate for electricity and a $0.03 environmental value for avoided carbon-based generation, the typical San Francisco solar homeowner could afford to pay an Apple Valley homeowner $167 per year to rent their rooftop and be no worse off.
If less efficient residential solar panels throughout California were moved to the sunniest cities in the state, the entire stock of residential solar would generate 15% more green energy. An optimized rooftop solar program would generate an additional $12.5 million in benefits per year and could power an additional 13,000 homes. The optimization would generate as much additional green energy as adding 7,800 more average residential solar installations to the state's homes.
In a world where energy conservation programs are heralded as successes if they yield 1-2% demand reductions, a 15% efficiency improvement would be huge. Imagine if the build-out required to meet Gov. Brown's planned 12 gigawatts by 2020 continues apace. A 15% increase in energy production on 12 gigawatts of installed capacity fuels a half-million homes.
If solar investment decisions were the product of a rational cost-benefit analysis, then solar should be far more prevalent in inland communities that lack the coastal fog and marine layer. After all, if it is individually rational for a San Francisco homeowner to install solar, then it must also be individually rational for just about every other homeowner to follow suit. And yet they don't.
The solar boom along the fog-laden California coast may be spurred by environmental preferences and even conspicuous conservation effects that yield additional, non-pecuniary dividends to homeowners in coastal green communities. But solar is also well-represented in places you would expect (and hope) to find it. San Diego, for instance, has 2,238 residential solar installations, the most in the state. And Central Valley communities with more sun and more conservative political views, like Fresno, Clovis, and Bakersfield, also rank among the state's top-ten solar cities.
It is perhaps reassuring that political party affiliation is a poor predictor of solar panel density in California. But it can be of little consolation that NREL's solar energy potential is only a weakly-significant predictor of solar density, even after controlling for housing stock characteristics, population and housing growth, and household income.
Free-market economists embrace the power of many individual decisions to guide markets and direct resources to their highest value. Yet the burgeoning field of behavioral economics has documented many instances in which consumers make mistakes. Consumer errors are much more likely with large investment decisions that require complex calculations involving discounting and expectations of future prices. Even if consumers execute the discounted cost-benefit calculus correctly, their objectives may be different from those of society, causing efficiency losses for policies that rely on their utility maximizing behavior.
So if homeowners can't be trusted to make social welfare maximizing investments, and if industrial scale solar projects can't clear legal hurdles, what should be done?
One option would be to permit the solar swapping that Dubner proposed. But this only works if a homeowner in the desert who won't invest their own money in a solar array would be willing to rent their roof for less than $200 on average. They may not find that inducement sufficient to overcome transaction costs, not to mention the potential nuisance of housing someone else's green investment.
A better solution may be for the state to coordinate investment by individual residents in larger, community-based solar installations that could be situated in the sunniest cities—perhaps on rooftops of public or commercial buildings or above parking lots in inland Southern California. Homeowners would receive payments for the energy produced from their share of the projects, much as they do from the projects on their own roofs. Only the payments would be bigger because of their better location. These larger projects would lower transactions costs and capitalize on scale economies, which a consultancy for the state's energy commission reported to be critical to generating positive net benefits for society. And, as Dubner suggests, the residential investors could get big signs to put on their roofs to replace the “green” signal their solar panels would have sent.
Burnaby sports personalities are to be inducted into the British Columbia Sports Hall of Fame.
The B.C. members of the 2012 Canadian Olympic women's national soccer team, including Burnaby superstar Christine Sinclair, were among the nine individuals and one team recognized for induction at the 2015 annual banquet of champions at the Vancouver Convention Centre on May 28.

Karina LeBlanc, Sophie Schmidt, Brittany Timko and Emily Zurrer were also members of the women's soccer team that won a bronze medal following a 1-0 victory over France at the 2012 Games after a controversial and much publicized semifinal loss to the United States.
Sinclair, Canada's team captain, finished with an Olympic tournament-best six goals.
The bronze medal was also Canada's first in a traditional summer team sport since 1936.
Also earning a place in the hall was Burnaby resident John Haar in the builder category for baseball.
Haar coached a national junior team to Baseball Canada's one and only international gold medal at the 1991 world junior championships.
They also served as team manager for Canada's entry at the 1986 World Cup in Cuba, helping the team qualify for the 1988 Olympics.
Haar was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007 and the Burnaby Sports Hall of Fame in 2012.
Also selected for induction in the athletes category were Shelley Winter Andrews in field hockey, Garett Hickling in wheelchair rugby, Denny Morrison in speedskating, Leah Pells in track and field and Burnaby Winter Club product Paul Kariya in ice hockey.
Denny Veitch joined Haar in the builder category, while Duncan Campbell was elected as a pioneer in wheelchair rugby. J. Paul McConnell made it in the media category.
Yet the multistakeholder approach is not enshrined in any law or treaty, and it is not universally liked. The governments of Russia and some developing countries, which are not members of the O.E.C.D., have expressed dissatisfaction with it. They would like to see the International Telecommunication Union, a U.N. agency, exercise greater oversight.
Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met with Hamadoun Touré, secretary general of the I.T.U., this month in Geneva, where they said that “Russia was determined to contribute to the work of the union and to strengthen the collaboration with the organization,” according to an I.T.U. news release.
The official Russian government Web site carries a more detailed description of the discussions, saying Mr. Putin told Mr. Touré: “We are thankful to you for the ideas that you have proposed for discussion. One of them is establishing international control over the Internet using the monitoring and supervisory capabilities of the International Telecommunication Union.”
The I.T.U., which coordinates international use of the radio spectrum and allocates satellite orbits, among other things, also plans an international discussion on the future of the Internet during a meeting next year at its headquarters in Geneva. There, I.T.U. members are scheduled to discuss revising existing international telecommunications regulations, which were written in 1988, when the Internet was in its infancy.

O.E.C.D. members are said largely to agree on a desire to exclude the Internet from a revised telecommunications agreement.
“There is a realization that Internet governance wouldn't work under a traditional treaty model,” Mr. Paltridge of the O.E.C.D. said. “If you do this via a treaty, are you putting a straitjacket on innovation?”
The I.T.U. does not plan to attend the O.E.C.D. meeting, said Sanjay Acharya, an I.T.U. spokesperson.
Even among supporters of multistakeholder governance, some recent developments have raised concerns about the existing approach.
Last week, one of the key stakeholders, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which oversees the Internet address system, approved plans for a vast expansion in the range of addresses available. In doing so, the organization overrode doubts expressed by the United States, the European Union and other governments, as well as organizations representing trademark holders.

At a meeting of the board of the assigning corporation and its Governmental Advisory Committee, Gerard de Graaf, an E.U. representative on the committee, compared the situation to a conversation between “the deaf and the stupid.”
Even if multistakeholder governance is sometimes messy, advocates of an open Internet say it is preferable to alternatives, like greater government supervision.
Constance Bommelaer, director of public policy at the Internet Society, a group that campaigns against restrictions on the Internet, said their organization had been invited to participate in the drafting of a communiqué to be issued at the O.E.C.D. meeting. At the G-8 meeting, by contrast, the communiqué had been drafted in advance by government representatives.
“This time, we will participate on an equal footing with business and government, which is very encouraging,” they said.
lost.vim: for when you're lost in a file
I wrote a plugin on Friday to making orienting yourself in a large piece of code easier. The short version is that with the new plugin lost.vim you can call :Lost or use the gL mapping to find your bearings.
A couple weeks ago I wrote a post about file-context , a commandline tool that would give the “context” of a single line of code in a given file. I implemented it as a vim plugin.
🔗 What does llosevim do?
The context for any of the lines in the following selections of would be the first line of each, which with the plugin get echoed when you press gL or call :Lost :
sub perl_func { # a thousand lines of code }
def python_func (): # a thousand lines of code
function javascript_func () { // a thousand lines of code }
func go_function () { // a thousand lines of code }
my $var = { # A thousand lines of hash };
🔗 How does it work?
Initially I assumed that git(1) used some kind of deep magic and actual parsing to do the above, which is why in the original blog post I literally shelled out to git and then parsed the diff. Then on Twitter Aristotle Pagaltzis showed me how it actually works.
The tool searches backwards for a line that starts with any alphabetical character, or underscore, or $ . The main failure is when working in a language where functions definitions are indented; Java, C#, and some JavaScript tend to look this way.
The new version is not just hugely more efficient (before it was copying files, running programs, doing parsing, etc) but it also works with unwritten files and is pure vim with literally no requirements other than vim.
My instinct is to extend this to work with formats that it does not already work with, like Markdown, but I honestly think that would be gilding the lily.
By the way while Markdown like the following does not work:
## The Beginning Originally I had planned to take a bus to my first stop at 5:30 am, but the guy that I work with, Kenton, offered to drive me because they were going for groceries anyway. That was nice and made the trip better since I did not have to take that long, boring, cramped bus ride. After arriving in La Ceiba Kenton and their wife Saundi showed me a number of different things that are good gifts to give in the states. I will not enumerate said gifts because readers may end up being recipients of the gifts.
this renders the same and does work:
The Beginning ============= Originally I had planned to take a bus to my first stop at 5:30 am, but the guy that I work with, Kenton, offered to drive me because they were going for groceries anyway.

After arriving in La Ceiba Kenton and their wife Saundi showed me a number of different things that are good gifts to give in the states.

I don't really care though; I don't edit much (any?) markdown that would benefit from lost.vim .
I hope you check out the plugin and find it as useful as I do; feel free to let me know on Twitter or in the comments on anything that you would improve.
If you'd like to learn more about vim, I can recommend two excellent books. I first learned how to use vi from Learning the vi and Vim Editors . The new edition has a lot more information and spends more time on Vim specific features. It was helpful for me at the time, and the fundamental model of vi is still well supported in Vim and this book explores that well.
Second, if you really want to up your editing game, check out Practical Vim . It's a very approachable book that unpacks some of the lesser used features in ways that will be clearly and immediately useful. I periodically review this book because it's such a treasure trove of clear hints and tips.

Marc Andrus, an Episcopal Bishop of California noteworthy for their public anti-Prop 8 stances, was not allowed to be seated at Thursday's installation of Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone, even though they were an invited guest. Instead, they were "escorted to a basement room at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Cathedral and detained by an usher until the time the service began." As soon as the debut performance (if you will) began, Bishop Andrus left the cathedral.
In an article explaining their basement-shaming at the hands of St. Mary's Cathedral, Andrus writes:
At this point no other guests remained in the downstairs area. The employee and I chatted while waiting. I began to wonder about the time holdup. I checked my phone; it was 1:50PM. I asked the employee standing with me if the service indeed started at 2, which they affirmed. At 2PM, when the service was to begin, I said to the employee, "I think I understand, and feel I should leave." Them response was, "Thank you for being understanding." I quietly walked out the door. No one attempted to stop me. No attempt was ever made to explain the delay or any process for seating. I arrived early, before the time given my assistant, and waited to leave until after the service had begun. My intention for attending the installation was to honor our ecumenical and interfaith relations in the Bay Area.
Prior to Cordileone's installation, Andrus penned a letter to the Diocese of California, one that noted their opposition to Proposition 8 and support of same-sex marriage. Part of their letter included this controversially humane line, "Some Catholics may find themselves less at home with Salvatore Cordileone's installation and they may come to The Episcopal Church. We should welcome them as our sisters and brothers."
"We were certainly aware of their letter," George Wesolek, the director of communications and public policy for the Archdiocese of San Francisco, later told CNN.

Stretch Goal
We've reached our initial manufacturing goal (many thanks to all of our backers!) so we are announcing a stretch goal to compliment the reward offerings!
Stretch Goal: Metric Ruler. You asked for it...so here it is! If we reach $125,000, all backers receiving a Cole-Bar will have their hammer upgraded to include a standard ruler on one side of the claw shaft and a metric ruler on the other!
A hammer for the 21st century...and so much more!
The Cole-Bar Hammer is essentially a hammer...
[Hammer]
...with a full crow bar built in! Using it's patented locking gear mechanism, the Cole-Bar can be opened and extended from 0-180 degrees and locked in place at 15 degree increments.
The only hammer in the world that turns into a full crow-bar!

Furthermore, the Cole-Bar can be separated with a button release turning it into a demolition tool.
[Button Release]
[Separated]
It uses a standard 1/2" drive to connect the head and claw shafts!
[1/2" Drive]
A standard 1/2" drive let's you use the Cole-Bar as a socket wrench.
The Cole-Bar combines 7 tools into 1. It is a hammer, a crow bar, a demolition tool, an angle measurement tool, a ruler, a socket wrench and nail pliers.
Reinventing the hammer:
1. Where we are
We have been working on the Cole-Bar Hammer since the late 90s when it was inspired by my late brother, Cole-Norman Hyde and then welded into existence by our father, Lance Hyde. We have made it a mission to bring the Cole-Bar Hammer to the world in their honor.
Since that day, we have produced 4 prototypes with a new mfg. prototype recently completed. After the first 2 prototypes and positive feedback, we decided to consult with other toolmakers.
Consulting with existing tool manufacturers has been invaluable. Their advice to us was to prove you had a viable product before you invest in a patent.
In the first part of 2000, we held our first focus group comprised of contractors, gadget folks, and people in our demographic. The focus group led to a re-design of the Cole-Bar, making it lighter and smaller while still retaining strength.
[The Cole-Bar is already patented!]
After the re-design, we held a follow-up focus group and the feedback was extremely positive! We then proceeded with securing a patent for the Cole-Bar which we were awarded in May of 2011.
2. What we need
We have secured a manufacturer and they have been hard at work on a new prototype (see below). We need your help in funding this project so we can move forward with manufacturing.
The costs involved are:
building the moulds
tooling
building pre-production units
load testing, legal fees
marketing
distribution
We now have our new prototype! Our strategy is to introduce the Cole-Bar at the National Hardware Show while this project is live.
Meet our new prototype!!!
Images of new prototype being built at our mfg.:
[New prototype claw shaft on CNC]
[New prototype on top vs old prototype on bottom.]
[New head and claw shaft pieces]
[Almost complete!]
[Getting gear assembly ready.]
[Gear assembly in the housing with switches]
[Gear assembly complete]
[Testing functionality]
[Fully assembled - Front]
[Fully assembled - Back]
From this point, we will analyze and tweak the prototype and move to pre-production. We aim to have 2-3 pre-production units ready for load testing within a month after we sign off on the mfg. prototype.
After thorough testing of the pre-production units, we will make final tweaks/updates and move into full production. We expect our first batch of hammers in the summer and fulfillment on pre-orders to be completed by fall of 2013.
3. Where we're going
Our marketing strategy post Kickstarter leans more towards direct response marketing in the forms of direct response television and website/e-commerce with retail channels on the back end.
During the hardware show, we will be introducing the Cole-Bar to the world, but we will also be working hard to make contact with buyers and distribution partners for the future.
We also have plans in place to begin filming an infomercial this spring/summer with a target launch for local markets in the summer/fall. After we analyze the data from our infomercial response, we will make adjustments and move to a regional campaign and from there to a national campaign by Christmas 2013.
Reinventing the hammer in five steps:
The inspiration
The story behind the Cole-Bar
A record £8bn ($10bn) Premier League TV rights deal that took effect this season has led to a drop in the cost of attending top-flight football in the UK, a survey has revealed.
The average cost of the cheapest home ticket in the Premier League has decreased by 6% from the year before to £29.05.
The BBC Price of Football study looked at 224 clubs across Europe to work out who offered the cheapest and most expensive tickets and also how much UK clubs charge for pies, programmes, replica shirts, tea and away tickets.
For the first time since the survey's inception in the 2011/12, the average cost of an away ticket in the Championship came in higher than the average cost of an away ticket in the Premier League.
This is because the new global TV rights deal has allowed top-flight clubs to cap prices for visiting fans at £30.
"On their current £8.3bn deal, the Premier League could afford to let every single fan in free for every game and still have as much money as they had under the previous deal," Malcolm Clarke, chairperson of the Football Supporters' Federation, told the BBC.
"That gives you an idea of the scale of the amount of money they have got."
North London clubs Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur offer the most expensive season tickets in English football at £2,013 and £1,895, respectively.
Hull City offer the cheapest at just £252 – a price that is lower than 88% of the cheapest season tickets on offer in the Championship.
Hull and Liverpool have the cheapest matchday tickets at £9, while Arsenal have the dearest at £97.
"We believe it's a positive thing that almost three quarters of ticket prices have been reduced or frozen. That's thanking in no small part to pressure from football supporters up and down the country," Clarke added.
"There is no room for complacency, however, with some Premier League clubs charging far too much for their season tickets and away ticket prices in the Championship being the most expensive in the country.
"We will remain vigilant and continue our campaigning to make football affordable for this generation of supporters and the next."
MIAMI -- The New York Yankees managed to win three fewer games this spring than they did last spring. Their collective team batting average for spring training 2016 was nearly 20 points lower than it had been in 2015. They hit four fewer home runs, they scored 22 fewer runs, their team OPS was down 50 points and their team ERA was up by more than three-quarters of a run.
And yet, as the team prepared to leave Miami on Saturday evening after a 2-1 loss to the Marlins in their spring finale, Alex Rodriguez said, “I think this team has the potential to be better than last year's."
Despite seeing their team struggle to collect four hits and failing to score all day after Jacoby Ellsbury's leadoff home run, Yankees manager Joe Girardi declared their team “ready to go," and general manager Brian Cashman said, “If we stay healthy, this team can make a lot of noise."
Alex Rodriguez managed to stay healthy this spring, but they were far from productive at the plate with just one extra-base hit. Reinhold Matay/USA TODAY Sports
Whether that is all just white noise or a cogent analysis of what the 2016 Yankees are or can be will reveal itself over the course of the next six months and 162 games.
But one common thread ran through to the optimism expressed by all three of those men, as well as many others in the Yankees' clubhouse: Despite so-so production out of all but a handful of Yankees -- most of them relatively new to the team -- Girardi, Cashman and many of the players considered this spring to be a success for one reason:
“Health," Rodriguez explained. “I just wanted to stay healthy."
For that reason, A-Rod tends to downplay their own quiet spring, in which they homered on their first swing back on March 2 and didn't have another extra-base hit all spring. Last spring, coming off a year's suspension and facing not only their 40th birthday but all sorts of doubts concerning their ability to be a productive player again, Rodriguez batted .267 with three homers and an .866 OPS last spring.
“That's pretty good," they said then. It turned out to be a precursor to a surprising season in which they belted 33 home runs, the most they had hit since 2008.
This spring, they staggered home at .245, with just the one home run and a puny .608 OPS. They were not alone. Mark Teixeira, the club's expected cleanup hitter, batted .140 with a single home run. Ellsbury came into the last game hitting just .185, but they had two hits on Saturday, including that leadoff home run, to finish at .225. Brett Gardner hit .250, and Didi Gregorius hit .239.
Only newcomer Starlin Castro, who batted .375 with two homers, and Brian McCann, who hit .333, had springs worth taking note of.
“I don't make too much of spring training for the older guys," Girardi said. “You can't. We had some guys that didn't really hit too well in spring, but you can't make too much out of that. If it happens in the regular season, then it's a different story."
The manager then added what has become the team motto this spring: “From a health standpoint, we did really well."
That seemed indisputable until Wednesday, when both closer Andrew Miller and swingman Bryan Mitchell suffered fractures on freak plays facing the same obscure batter, Willians Astudillo of the Braves. But while the Yankees will lose Mitchell for an undetermined length of time, they apparently dodged a bullet with Miller, who pitched with the injury for the first time on Saturday and reported no problems.
Add their name to the list of reasons for Yankees optimism, along with Luis Severino, the 22-year-old right-hander who looked sharp in their five innings against the Marlins, despite taking the loss due to a third-inning unearned run.
Castro, making what appears to be a successful transition to second base, is a reason to believe the Yankees' infield will be a lot less leaky this season; along with Gregorius, Castro gives the Yankees two things they have not had in their infield since Robinson Cano was in pinstripes and Derek Jeter was in their 30s: relative youth and range.
With flamethrower Aroldis Chapman closing games, and Dellin Betances and Andrew Miller as setup men, the bullpen could arguably be the Yankees' biggest strength in 2016. Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports
There is still Dellin Betances, with their 98 to 100 mph fastballs, to set up, and when Aroldis Chapman gets off their suspension on May 9, the Yankees' three-headed bullpen monster should be alive and breathing fire.
Those are all reasons to hope.
But there are still reasons to worry about the middle relief; aside from Betances, Miller and Chasen Shreve, there are a lot of unknown quantities out there named Luis Cessa, Johnny Barbato and Kirby Yates. Ivan Nova, the newest addition, has virtually never done the job before.
Then there is the rotation, which aside from Severino, is riddled with question marks. Masahiro Tanaka, the Opening Day starter, admitted on Saturday that they were worried throughout spring training about whether their surgically cleaned-out elbow would be ready to go, which explains a lot about why the Yankees delayed so long before making their start official.
Michael Pineda had an OK spring (4.50 ERA), but they have never remained healthy for an entire season. Nathan Eovaldi still has worlds of potential -- and allows worlds of basreunners. CC Sabathia was given the fifth rotation spot -- and a very short leash.
All of them have to perform well enough that Betances and Miller -- and, eventually, Betances, Miller and Chapman -- even get the opportunity to do what the Yankees are paying them to do.
And even the best of starting pitchers can't do much if the offense doesn't give them much to work with. That's where A-Rod (41 on July 27), Teixeira (36 on April 11) and Carlos Beltran (39 on April 24) come in. They need to perform at or near the level they did last year, and Ellsbury and Gardner, both of whom had miserable second halfs in 2015, need to do a whole lot better.
Clearly, a lot of things need to go right for the 2016 Yankees to be better than the 2015 Yankees, and so far, through seven weeks of spring training, one thing has:
They have stayed healthy.
Starting Monday, it's time for them to work on everything else.
LANGLEY (NEWS 1130) – The final hearing on whether law graduates from a faith-based university in Langley should be accredited to practice is about to get underway in Canada's highest court.
Trinity Western University and the BC Law Society will be in the Supreme Court of Canada for the last word on the ongoing, controversial issue.

Trinity Western wins legal victory to open Christian law school
The highest court is actually hearing two appeals — Trinity Western is appealing a decision in Ontario that favoured that province's law society, while the law society in BC is challenging the last decision made in BC that was in favour of the university. Back in 2015, a BC Supreme Court judge ruled in favour of the school to fight to have its law students practice in the province, reversing the law society's decision not to accredit them.
NEWS 1130 Legal Analyst Michael Shapray says this situation is not unheard of, explaining separate legal issues can wind their way up from different parts of the country. “And if the timeline of those cases getting to that level are similar then it makes logical and practical sense for the Supreme Court of Canada to join them together.”
This all stems from the law societies' disapproval of the school's covenant, which requires all students to sign a so-called covenant pledging to abstain from sex outside of marriage between a man and a woman.
The case will be in Ottawa on Thursday and Friday.
In the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, 44-year-old Myanmar refugee Hashim Kassim struggles to raise funds to keep their religious school open, while working hard to prepare two bright students for a Quran recitation competition.
Hashim, a refugee for 17 years himself, cares for 200 Myanmar Muslim and Rohingya refugee students. Many are orphans living in their school, with the numbers expanding as Muslim refugees flee violence in Myanmar. Can they raise enough funds to keep their school open and will their students win the Quran competition?
FILMMAKER'S VIEW
By Jules Ong
When we hear the word refugees, perhaps most of us would think about displaced people in massive refugee camps. But today, more than half of the refugees settle in big cities. In Malaysia, out of the over 100,000 registered refugees in Kuala Lumpur, 90 percent are from Myanmar. The real number may be two or three times higher.
Malaysia has not ratified the United Nations Refugee Convention because it does not want to be duty bound to provide protection for refugees. The government does not make a distinction between an "illegal immigrant" and a refugee or asylum seeker. Hence, a refugee can be arrested and detained by the authorities at will. They are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse and have no recourse to justice. They do not have legal rights to work nor the right to access the free public healthcare and their children cannot go to school.
I first met Hashim bin Kassim, a Myanmar Muslim religious teacher, about three years ago. They came as a refugee via Thailand and worked illegally as a vegetable cart pusher in the largest wholesale market in Kuala Lumpur.
Most Malaysians are not aware that close to 20,000 Myanmar refugees live and work around the central wholesale market sorting out and distributing fresh produce for hundreds of neighbourhood markets throughout the capital.
Forming the underclass of Malaysian society, these urban refugees work the jobs that Malaysians shun. Raids are a common feature in the market area, resulting in mass arrests and even deaths.
When I met Hashim, I knew I had found the main character for my film.  They are articulate, expressive and passionate about their cause. We communicated using Malay, the national language of Malaysia, both being our second language. With their newly learned language in their adopted country, Hashim uses the limited vocabulary to great effect, with sounds and gesticulations to express himself.
When Hashim was working in the wholesale market, they noticed many children loitering on their own. They were unwashed, unschooled, and many of them were orphans. Out of compassion, they took in three kids, fed them, cared for them, taught them their ABCs and gave them free Quran lessons. Gradually, they took in more and more, and after 18 years, they established a school, the Madrasah Hashimiah, with 60 lived-in orphans and between 100 to 140 children who come in for daily lessons five times a week.
Being a refugee themselves and sustaining a school of 200 kids and 11 paid teachers is no small feat. Hashim works by faith. Though they collect $20 per student from parents who can afford it, every month is a struggle to raise $7,000 to keep the school and orphanage afloat - rent, teacher's salaries, utility bills, food, clothing, medicine all have to be paid for.
I wanted to tell the story of these people because they are so invisible in our society. Yet they are the cogs and wheels that move the economy. They keep our city clean, plant our food, distribute it, and even build our homes and skyscrapers. Malaysia's economy benefits from their presence. Many of these refugees may end up being "citizens" of this country eventually, for the UNHCR is unable to resettle a large percentage of them, while more are still arriving.
Some years back, Hashim was among the lucky ones to be offered resettlement by the UNHCR to Australia, but they declined because they wanted to take care of their students. They would rather be a refugee in Malaysia than a citizen of Australia because of their devotion to their school.
My three months researching and filming the story has endeared me to the refugee cause and to the children and teachers in Madrasah Hashimiah. I learnt that despite the uncertainties and hardships they face, they are able to educate their children, raise families, and survive in a hostile climate. This film is about the resilience of the human spirit and miracles that happened along the way. Miracles inspired by faith. Hashim's School of Hope is a window to the lives, the hopes and dreams of people whose limitations do not stop them from wanting to give their children a better life in a foreign land.
Malaysia is, after all, a land of immigrants and refugees. The ethnic Indonesian, Chinese, Indian and Filipino population are part of the fabric of Malaysian society today. I, being the fourth generation of Straits Chinese lineage, have an identity card to state my citizenship - Malaysian - and I enjoy all the privileges that comes with it. But my great-grandparents struggled when they first arrived to this land before their descendants were accepted as citizens. We form the generations of inter-ethnic mixing that has contributed to the economy, to the rich diversity of culture, foods, languages and traditions that have now become part and parcel of the Malaysian identity.
There are new guests in our country today, and they will eventually become part of us. Hashim's dream, as was my great grandfather's, is to finally find a place to call home.

Every year, Hot Toys distributes a catalog from their Secret Base location in Hong Kong. Inside, it shows all of the new licenses that they have acquired, the figures that have already been announced but have yet to be released, and finally some new collectibles as well! One Sixth Society took many hours and scanned each and every page of the new catalog for you! With that being said, let's look at the Hot Toys Catalog 2017. We'll run through the Hot Toys Catalog chronologically, and right off the bat we have a lineup of the Guardians of Galaxy Vol. 2 team! We have Star-Lord, and Rocket Raccoon which have already been announced. Then we have Gamora and Drax which are to be expected, but also interestingly is a Baby Groot 1/6 scale figure. It will be interesting to see if we get a Baby Groot sixth scale figure, or if it refers to the one that will be coming with Rocket. Next up, we have some figures that have already been announced. We have Doctor Strange, as well as the highly sought after Hulkbuster Armor from the Avengers: Age of Ultron film joined by all of Captain America: Civil War characters. While these figures have already been announced, it is nice to see them shown as upcoming releases. SEE MARVEL FIGURES ❯
Pages 1 – 18 (Use the Blue Arrow to Flip The Pages)
Hot Toys Catalog of Collectibles Alongside the other Marvel characters, we also have a collectible that I am anxious to see; the Ironman armor that is opened at the back. After more Marvel characters, we are treated to a few of the licenses that Hot Toys has; Spider-Man: Homecoming, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Thor Ragnarok, and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Obviously we have seen two of these already, but it is exciting to know that we have figures from Thor Ragnarok and POTC on the way! ADVERTISEMENT Next we get into Star Wars, namely collectibles from Rogue One. We have Jyn, Chirrut, and K-2SO, but we also have a photo of Baze. Many collectors are clamoring for Baze to go along with Chirrut, and this photo should give some hope. We also have Vader some troopers from Rogue One accompanied by an Assault Tank Commander that has not been formally announced yet. There are plenty of more Star Wars figures shown, with an appearance of Rey's Speeder bike from The Force Awakens, as well as the Millennium Falcon cockpit. Time will tell if these large vehicles will be put up for order or stay forever inside the Hot Toys Catalog. SEE STAR WARS FIGURES ❯
Pages 19 – 45 (Use the Blue Arrow to Flip The Pages)
After Star Wars, we go into DC territory. We see all of the Suicide Squad and Batman V. Superman figures that we have already seen, accompanied by some Suicide Squad figures that have not been announced like Joker in the silver suit, as well as their henchmen. We also get a graphic of the Justice League, to the surprise of no one. Finally we get the Batmobile and Bat Signal from BVS, albeit with no release in sight. After DC, we have miscellaneous licenses in the Hot Toys Catalog. The Resident Evil 6 figures have already been released, as well as the Alien Warrior. The Alien Warrior is shown alongside Ripley. Next we have the Back to the Future 2 Marty McFly with Doc Brown. With the pair of them is the Back to the Future 2 Delorean, which I know several collectors are very excited for. Last up we have the Cosbaby catalog which displays a variety of Cosbaby figures from all of the licenses previously mentioned, as well as a few more! A very interesting point is that there is a Cosbaby license for Aliens, of which there has not been any collectibles from Hot Toys in several years. Hopefully the Cosbabies are a sign of things to come. The Cosbaby Catalog can be seen here. SEE HOT TOYS D.C FIGURES ❯

DALLAS (CBSDFW.COM) – A porn convention has made good on its threat to sue the City of Dallas.
Director of the Exxxotica Expo, Jay Handy, said they have filed a temporary injunction against the city to get use of the convention center in May.
“When the council decided to vote with their belief system and not necessarily the law, this is what happens. And unfortunately the only people that are going to pay for this are the citizens of Dallas,” they said.
Council members narrowly voted to ban the event from the Dallas Convention Center.
The resolution prevents the city from signing a contract with Three Expo Events, the company that's trying to hold the Exxxotica Expo in Dallas again.
Attorneys for Exxxotica said organizers have a right to free speech and should not be banned from holding the expo at the convention center.
CBS11 has reached out to the City of Dallas for comment and is waiting to hear back.

The first piece of our new series of concise reviews for regional championships will be dedicated to MRF Challenge, an India-based single-seater series which is held throughout the winter.
The series welcomes drivers in various stages of their career and has attracted some high-profile names in the past – among them Conor Daly, Jordan King, Tio Ellinas or Arthur Pic.
The 2014-15 edition consisted of three rounds at the tracks of Losail, Sakhir and Chennai with four races held on each given weekend.
The biggest talking point prior to the season was Mathias Lauda and Freddie Hunt, sons of former F1 rivals, signing up for the series. However, in terms of results, others fared better.
MSV F3 Cup champion Toby Sowery made an electrifying start to the season with two victories at Losail and two third places, taking a confident early lead in the standings.
The Indian duo of Protyre Formula Renault regular Tarun Reddy and MRF returnee Raj Bharath both took wins while GP3 regular Ryan Cullen and South African Kyle Mitchell, who returned to the race tracks after a lengthy absence, completed the quartet of Sowery's chasers.
The next weekend started with a similarly dominant showing, this time from Cullen. Stealing the race lead from pole-sitter Bharath, they kicked off with a win, followed by a third place in the reverse-grid race two and another win in race three.
While Cullen was the man to beat, Sowery, Bharath and Mitchell all remained firmly at the front. The other two wins, however, went to part-time driver Struan Moore and Lauda, who converted a reverse-grid pole to claim their first major single-seater victory.
Going into the final round, the top four of Sowery, Cullen, Bharath and Mitchell were all within 31 points of each other, thus promising a close title battle. But Sowery had little interest in keeping intrigue alive and, with two Saturday wins, clinched the title early.
Cullen would return to winning ways on Sunday, before guest drivers Oscar King, Matt Solomon and Gustavo Myasava locked out the podium in the final race.
So, in the end, was a dominant campaign from Toby Sowery, who took their second single-seater title in their second championship in a well-deserved fashion, as they finished every race in the top five.
Cullen and Bharath both enjoyed their best single-seater campaigns in second and third respectively and it was an impressive return to cars for Mitchell, who ended up in fourth despite missing the finale.
Sowery's superb debut year in cars has yielded them an Auto GP testing opportunity with Virtuosi, but their plans for the main 2015 season are as of yet unconfirmed. Neither have they been announced for runner-up Cullen and third-placed Bharath. However, some of the other MRF race winners and podium finishers have already secured their drives.
Race winner Reddy will do the inaugural MSA F4 season with Double R Racing. Solomon will also race with Double R – in the FIA F3 European Championship. Lauda, meanwhile, will be back to GT racing in the World Endurance Championship with Aston Martin.
Part-timer Moore will move to Japan to contest the national F3 series with KCMG. World karting vice-champion Nikita Mazepin, who took a career-first podium at Losail, has already completed a campaign in the Toyota Racing Series and will contest FR2.0 NEC with Josef Kaufmann.
A few weeks before Father's Day the Mirror picked up a post by married* mommyblogger Constance Hall: Mum's heartfelt post reveals 7 ‘facts' about single mothers which people keep getting wrong. Hall closes with:
7. They don't want your husbands They didn't spend all this time getting rid of theirs and supporting their kids and working their arses off to have to wake up next to your farting, snoring, horny delight.  They are all yours.
Hall is basing their argument on something the women reading understand from observing reality; single mothers (as a group) deliberately ejected the father of their children from the home. They then uses this well known fact to try to deny the risk that married women intuitively understand, that such women are on the prowl for a replacement man. The problem of course is not their assertion that single mothers (as a group) ejected the father from the home, but their claim that this indicates the woman is “done with men”. Such women aren't done with men, they are merely in between steps on the path of serial monogamy. Having it all means sticking the landing.
But while everyone knows single motherhood is caused by mothers ejecting the father from the home, everyone also knows that broken homes are caused by fathers running out on their families. This brings us from the pre Father's Day defense of single mothers at the Mirror to the Father's Day Op Ed piece by Rich Cohen at the LA Times**:
With the adoption of no-fault laws, the U.S. divorce rate doubled between 1967 and 1985. In my junior high school years, every father and every mother were fighting in every kitchen. Every road trip was tense. Every kid was being raised by a single parent. No one could go out on Saturday because it was “my father's weekend,” which meant an awkward stay with the old man and new girlfriend in an apartment downtown — apartments that always smelled like fresh paint. …[Mick Jagger] personified that greater tide of coupling and uncoupling and begetting and going away. Mick was not my father — they were our father. They stood for all the wayward fathers, all those randy middle-aged men living in a crash pad on Grand Street; for all those who refused to behave like adults or function as parents. … Does Mick Jagger, who, as a great-grandfather, will be celebrated by three generations of descendants, deserve William Jackson Smart's special day? What about all those other boomer dads who took off because they fell out of love? (“Hey man, it happens.”) How do you honor fathers who refused to behave like fathers? Do they merit the gift cards, the neckties and spice racks made in shop class?
See Also: Fatherless Doublethink.
*Hall's post is a simultaneous defense of destructive behavior and a subtle reminder to single mothers that as a married mother they outrank them.

With Sunday's 30-27 loss to the archrival Pittsburgh Steelers, the Cleveland Browns set a new NFL record by losing a 10th consecutive season opener, per ESPN Stats & Info.
Previously, the Browns had been tied at nine seasons with the 1968-76 Philadelphia Eagles, a team that was consistently bad during that stretch, topping out at 7-7 in 1974. All in all, the Eagles posted 37-84-5 over that nine-year span, good for a .313 winning percentage.
The Browns have fared a bit better during their own streak of season-opening futility, with Sunday's loss dropping their record since the beginning of 2005 to 47-98, which equates to a winning percentage of .324. Cleveland also has a winning season to show for the stretch, though its 10-6 record wasn't quite enough to qualify for the playoffs in 2007.
Speaking of which, the Browns still hold out some hope—though not much—of ending a more important streak, that being their playoff drought which dates to 2002. The Browns and Oakland Raiders are tied for the second-longest postseason drought, trailing only a Buffalo Bills franchise that hasn't qualified since bowing out on the "Music City Miracle" in 1999.
On the other side of the coin, a New England Patriots franchise that has qualified for 10 of the last 11 postseasons saw its 10-game winning streak in season openers snapped by the Miami Dolphins on Sunday, per ESPN Stats & Info. The Patriots have qualified for the playoffs in five straight seasons, tied with the Green Bay Packers for the NFL's longest active streak.
Domenic Scarfone was born and raised in country New South Wales in Australia. They spent the first 21 years of their life working, living and breathing rural air.
But it wasn't until they decided to move to London that they came to terms with their sexuality.
‘Everyone knew I was gay except for me. It wasn't until I moved to London that I was like ‘yep, this is a thing', they said.
‘Griffith is a small country town. Everyone's so relaxed and you know everyone. London is so busy. It's just exciting not being known and doing whatever you want,' they said.
A new report released by The Rainbow Project found LGBTI people in Northern Ireland have more resources when coming out in urban as opposed to rural areas.
The report found 43% of respondents said their sexual orientation was at least partly related their desire to move.
According to Pink News, Northern Ireland's Minister for Agriculture, Michelle O'Neill, believed ensuring LGBT people in rural areas is an important commitment.
‘I am fully committed to equality and my officials will continue to work closely with the Rainbow Project in taking forward key issues relevant to LGBT people especially when it comes to improving their quality of life in rural areas,' they said.
The report stated: ‘LGB&/T people living in rural areas experience poorer outcomes than those living in an urban area.'
Domenic believes there are so many more opportunities in urban areas than there are in rural communities.
‘It's like that old school saying – I didn't want any of the lives of the people around me, so I left to find the life I wanted,' they said.
The report states a number of other findings, like LGBT people in rural areas being less inclined to be out, having less access to LGBT resources, or less likely to know someone else in their workplace who is out.

If you have an affinity for yachting and $100+ million in disposable income, the Maltese Falcon is all you. Should your preference lean towards a modest one week rental of the mega-yacht, it should only set you back about $600,000. For the rest of us aspiring mega-yacht owners that may never have the pleasure of boarding such a beautiful specimen, there are plenty of pictures to nod in disbelief at. Enjoy!

THE MALTESE FALCON
– Although the Maltese Falcon is the largest sailing yacht in the world when measured on deck (LOD – Length On Deck), at 305 feet in length, Eos is the largest private sailing yacht in the world overall (LOA – Length Over All)
– The Maltese Falcon sports what is called a DynaRig, which means it is effectively a square rigger, and each of the three freestanding masts support six yardarms, which are connected rigidly to the mast
– The yacht's 25,791 square feet (2,400 square meters) of sails are set between the yards in such a way that when deployed there are no gaps to the sail plan, enabling each spar's sails to work as a single airfoil
– Unlike a conventional square rigger, the yards have a built-in camber of 12%, and the sails are trimmed to the wind direction by rotating the entire mast, which is operated by a sail control system on the bridge. When not deployed, the mega yacht's sails furl right into the mast itself
– It is also efficient, reaching nearly 20 knots under sail alone
– The Maltese Falcon's interior is as luxurious as you'd expect, of course, with the main feature being the atrium. Here, the three decks are united by a circular stairway, surrounding the main mast, and creating a spiralling effect.
– This is all enhanced by natural light streaming in from the top to the lower decks through transparent floors.
– The main deck of the Maltese Falcon is a big open space with a main saloon, a huge aft-cockpit, two studio areas and an impressive dining room.
– For sleeping there are five lower deck staterooms and one passage cabin on the upper deck with a private sun bathing area, and direct access to the mega yacht's wheelhouse.
– Them revolutionary sailing system – the DynaRig – set a new milestone in yachting history: three self-standing and rotating masts hosting 15 sails for a total sail area of 25,791 square feet for unrivaled, performance maneuverability and record-shattering speed; they can complete Atlantic crossings in ten days.

THE CURRENT OWNER
– Originally built for wealthy venture-capitalist Tom Perkins, it was recently listed on Yachtworld.com for $166.67 million before eventually being purchased by Elena Ambrosiadou for $97.36 million
– Elena Ambrosiadou created one of the most successful hedge funds in the world (Ikos Partners), and became Britain's best-paid woman in the process
– Ambrosiadou, 47, paid themselves $25.8 million in 2004. With a fortune estimated around $322.8 million, they were Britain's wealthiest woman entrepreneur in 2006
– A chemical engineer by training, they achieved early success at BP, becoming its youngest-ever senior international executive at 27
– Husband and business partner, Martin Coward was the architect of Ikos's unique trading structure. A Cambridge-educated mathematician, they eventually hit the big-time at Goldman Sachs
– Ambrosiadou will use the yacht for only a few weeks a year — “I work 16 hours a day, seven days a week. I doubt if I'll be spending much time on her”. Otherwise, the yacht can be chartered for $607,000 a week. “This is an enterprise,” they says
– With 70 professionals and an asset base of approximately $1.5bn, IKOS is listed among Europe's 30 largest single manager Hedge Funds
– In December of 2009, Martin Coward, who co-founded Ikos with their wife 17 years ago, has mysteriously quit, telling friends they want to start another hedge fund that fulfils theirs “vision”.
– Mr Coward, who created and developed the investment strategies at Ikos, told Albourne Partners, an online community for the hedge fund industry: “I have decided to leave Ikos to recreate my vision of research focused team with talented, experienced professionals. I plan to establish a smaller investment management company to manage family and other assets”

THE TOYS
– For fun, the Maltese Falcon carries two 32 foot Pascoe RIB Tenders (with water skis), four Laser sailboats, and a 14 foot Castold Jet tender
– In addition to dive gear, the Maltese Falcon also carries a private submarine for exploring the deep, which was one of former owner Tom Perkins' favorite toys, and is strangely was one of the reason they say they sold the Maltese Falcon
– “My pleasure comes from the technical and aesthetic challenges of new yacht projects more than from cruising aboard the finished boat. I would now like to indulge my interest in ‘sports' submarines and maybe to build a specialized boat to use as a sub carrier”

The 2014 Pan American YoYo Contest has been cancelled. We're going to reach out soon to the IYYF and see if this means the Las Vegas Open Yoyo Championship will remain a seeding event, or if it will continue on as a stand-alone contest.
To clarify, the organizers have confirmed the Las Vegas Open WILL proceed, whether it is an IYYF seeding event or not. The Asia Pacific and European multi-national events serve more than a dozen national events each, while the Pan American contest predominately serves the US, Canada, Mexico, and Brazil; there are national events in Chile, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia but none of these have risen to the level of the rest of the contests in this region, and their champions are rarely able to attend events held outside of their respective countries. There have been rumors of the Bay Area Classic serving as the 2014 Pan American seeding event, but nothing confirmed from the IYYF.
We'd like to take this opportunity to thank organizer Greg Cohen for their many years of service to the yoyo community and industry. They held the World YoYo Contest together for many years, when no one else had the resources or wherewithal to do it. While it appears their tenure as a major contest organizer has come to a close, we all owe Greg a huge debt of gratitude for their efforts. It's now on the rest of us to build on the foundation that they laid and create a better, stronger international contest system moving forward.
Please read Cohen's official statement below.
I have tried very hard to create a new major contest with a new mission for the yo-yo community. Unfortunately this may not have been the time to do it. Before I announced this event, we had verbal agreements of support from many sponsors and volunteers, but as the event has approached thing have changed that we appreciate that have prevented this support from coming through. Without having the sponsorship we need to make this event a success and due to the fact we have had almost no hotel registrations to this point, I regret we are forced to cancel the Pan American International Yo-Yo Contest. I had amazing hopes for this event to grow over the years, and to do some amazing things, and I am sad that this will not come to pass. One of my joys of running yo-yo contests has been to essentially build a clock with a fine movement, wind it up and see it run. Some years this has happened smoother than others, but until now it has always worked. I am are sad to say that I have had to cancel this event, and I want to apologize to everyone who has given us their support, trust and time to help try to create it over the past year. It has been a pleasure to work with you all. I look forward to the next Multi-National IYYF seeded contest that will be hosted by Steve Brown called the 2014 Las Vegas Open YoYo Championship, that will happen on December 29th and 30th. Thank you all for letting me do what I love all these years, and I hope you will let me try again at some point in the future. -GRegory Cohen
David Lynch's wine bar, St. Vincent , which had switched over to just hosting private events and wine retail sales by appointment , has been on the market for a while now.
Now we know what will be taking its place: Barzotto, a new “American Pasta Bar” from Marko Sotto, the former director of operations for Adriano Paganini (Delarosa, Belga, etc.).
Michelle Minori, who is currently the executive sous chef for Thomas McNaughton's Ne Timeas Restaurant Group, will be heading up the kitchen. Minori previously worked at Il Cane Rosso, Acquerello, La Folie, and Aqua.
As far as the menu, look for pastas like cacio e pepe and bucatini all' Amatriciana, as well as rotating seasonal offerings. On the dessert side, house-made gelato for affogatos. There will also be a retail component, with dried and fresh pastas sold by the pound, along with pasta sauces and gelato.
Look for the restaurant sometime in late summer

NJ Transit officials have broken their silence over what happens to surveillance recordings it makes of passenger conversations on light rail trains.
In April, the state American Civil Liberties Union and commuter groups demanded that NJ Transit disclose information about the surveillance after an NJ Advance Media article revealed that the conversations of passengers on light rail trains were being recorded.
"Audio and video remain in the surveillance device for approximately 30 days, with new video and audio overwriting (recording over) previous files," said Nancy Snyder, an NJ Transit spokesperson. "It is our practice and procedure."
NJ Transit had denied a public records request for the written policy that covers their surveillance program on June 10 under the grounds that no such policy existed.
"Your request is denied because no such records exist, therefore, there are no public records subject to disclosure," wrote Peter Spall, NJ Transit senior public records specialist.
Civil rights advocates say that NJ Transit still needs to build formal policies around those "practices and procedures."
"Without a written policy, there is no accountability to the public and the public needs to know that NJ Transit takes our rights seriously," said Jeanne LoCicero, state ACLU deputy legal director. "It's irresponsible to spend millions of dollars on equipment without creating a policy to guide employees and to safeguard the public."
Surveillance equipment cost NJ Transit $750,000 to install on River Line trains, and the $1.9 million expense to install it on Hudson-Bergen and Newark light rail trains was funded by a federal Homeland Security grant.
Policies should say how long the information is stored, what it is used for, who has access to it, how long it is kept and how it is disposed of, LoCicero said.
"I'm shocked they haven't done anything. The legislature should move quickly to address this gaping hole in how NJ Transit operates," they said. "When government acts on our behalf, they are supposed to have policies. Police have policies on body cameras and dash cams, we'd expect a transit agency to have them."
No fare hike, service cuts in NJ Transit budget
It took three days of criticism by civil rights and commuter advocates in April before NJ Transit officials revealed that the agency's police department manages access to the recordings for "limited investigative purposes."
"I'm concerned it took this much effort to say at least this much," said David Peter Alan, Lackawanna Commuter Coalition president. "I'm still concerned for our riders and their privacy."
NJ Transit has signs posted in light rail cars, telling riders that surveillance equipment is in use. Buses also have similar signs posted, however those surveillance systems only activate during an emergency.
"When you know a government or a quasi-government agency is listening, it has a chilling effect," Alan said. "It means you're careful about what you say."

Hey Everyone!
I've been missing for quite a while and thought I would explain why!
COLLEGE
At the end of August, I finally moved to Milwaukee, WI to go to Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE). It's my first of four years working toward my Software Engineering degree, and it's going great so far. Just remember if you hate high school, college is an entirely different environment. MSOE is known for having really intense coursework, but if I graduate, I'm basically guaranteed a job with a great salary. There may be -30F windchill in the coming months, but Wisconsin has been my home for 18 years, and I think I can handle it for a few more. 🙂
PROGRAMMING
For my Software Dev class, I've had to give up my one true programming language love, Python. But it also opened up the wonderful world of Java to me. And of course, when I learn a new language, my first instinct is to start making a game engine! It keeps getting more efficient as I learn new things about Java, and I have basic position, velocity, and acceleration physics with object collision implemented. Next, I'm going to work on user interface stuff… super exciting.
This Saturday, I'm going to a 9am to 6pm hackathon. I know what I'll be working on (unrelated to game programming surprisingly), but I'll wait until next week, so I have something real to show off.
Here's a sneak preview of quick sketch art for a game that I'll be tailoring my engine specifically for.
I'll have an update on everything sometime next week after the hackathon!
Thanks!

On 16 June 2017, Reddit user u/GoblinsStoleMyHouse published a lengthy story of revenge involving trees to r/trees (a marijuana-themed subreddit). Their claim was later posted to revenge–themed subreddits (and copied by blogs).
In the original post, the Redditor wrote:
Hi, I'm an arborist. This means I am a professional in the cultivation, management, and study of trees. I love trees. I think they're some of the most beautiful, majestic, ancient living beings on our planet. Today I am here to tell you a story of death, new life, and revenge. Three years ago today, the city council of Redondo Beach California ordered the death of my 30 year old pepper tree. It's roots had begun to penetrate the pavement in front of my house. The city noticed and issued the death warrant of my tree. They furthermore made me pay for the damages to the sidewalk and for the tree removal. I loved Clyde. I'm beginning to get older, and planting something that I knew would live well beyond my lifetime was something very special. I took very good care of him. I drained their soil, I gave them a crutch to lean on when they were a young lad, and I watched them grow. Just as Clyde was becoming a strong healthy individual, expanding their root system, developing a canopy, and making their own way in life, the mayor took it upon themselves to uproot my beautiful child. Mayor Steve Aspel. You killed my child. For this, you will pay. Two years and seven months ago, I secretly planted 45 California Redwoods and 82 Giant Sequoias in various parks, yards, and state properties around your city. Today, each of their root systems will be at least 30 feet in diameter, and deeply embedded in the soil. You may have noticed the trees growing in front of city council, or that new one that sprouted up in your backyard. That's a Giant Sequoia, and its growth will begin accelerating rapidly in the coming months. You killed Clyde, but I have replaced them with over 100 living giants. And giant they will become. In a few years, they'll begin breaking heights of 100-300 feet and live well beyond 2,500 years. That's way longer ago than Jesus was born. To remove even one of them at this point will cost well over $1500… And I'm stiffing you with the bill, just like you did to me 3 years ago today. Good day to you, sir. May your city be overrun by trees. And may Clyde rest in peace.
In addition to claiming that they had planted dozens of redwood and sequoia trees around Redondo Beach, California, GoblinsStoleMyHouse also maintained that they were “beginning to get older” and that the vengeful planting had occurred roughly three years prior after they were engaged in a homeowner's dispute with the city. However, four months previously, they had described themselves as a biology major (i.e., someone still in college), not an aging homeowner:
Four months before that, the same user had mentioned living in a dormitory room “on a college campus” (not a residence maintained by a homeowner) in a separate thread. The user also freely discussed “trolling” fellow Redditors in mid-2017:
Although the claims made in the original post about “Clyde,” sequoia/redwood trees, Redondo Beach, and petty revenge are not impossible, they are highly implausible. An arborist would know, for one thing, that giant sequoias and redwoods would not be able to grow at the rate described in Redondo Beach — or likely at all, given the historic drought that overtook southern California for several years until it officially ended in late 2016. Those trees, which once thickly carpeted all of North America, need quite a lot of groundwater (and, in the case of coastal redwoods, fog) to survive.
Mike Garcia, a state licensed tree services and landscaping contractor who has lived and worked in Redondo Beach for half a century, told us that this story is impossible for a number of reasons.
“Southern California is pretty much a desert,” Garcia said. “Where are all the sequoias located? North, in San Francisco where we get a lot of rain,” adding that:
You could actually plant a sequoia and you could water them a lot, but I think at last count there's over 100 million trees in Southern California that have died from drought-related causes. The only time that those [deep] roots get watered at a really deep level is when it rains because rain pushes water down for hours or days, so we are getting 5 or 6 feet deep. And that's what they need. so in L.A., you can grow a baby sequoia for a while, a few years, but it won't get water at the deepest roots.
Coastal redwoods, Garcia told us, only grow in Northern California because of its exponentially higher coastal rainfall, a contrast with Southern California's relatively arid Mediterranean climate: “I was born and raised in Redondo, I've worked in this town every single day, and I haven't seen any sequoias or redwoods growing around here.”
They noted that if a tree were encroaching on a public sidewalk but was growing on private property, the city would not uproot the tree but would instead perform what they call root pruning or root trimming:
They will cut the sidewalk out and they will cut the root out and lay the sidewalk again. Otherwise everybody's trees would be torn out!
We also called the city of Redondo Beach, who told us that the story was completely untrue. Ted Semaan, Redondo Beach's public works director, said that the story initially caused some concern, but they soon realized that what it described would have been impossible:
If somebody had planted 127 trees without our knowledge, we would have picked up some of them — there aren't 127 trees that were mysteriously planted on city property.
Furthermore, a giant sequoia or coastal redwood does not have a marked growth spurt after two or three years, under even optimum conditions, and there is no way that the root system would be so involved as to cost taxpayers more than a thousand dollars each to remove all 127 saplings.
These facts, combined with with u/GoblinsStoleMyHouse's posting history and description as a college student with an affinity for chess and trolling fellow Redditors (an individual who would almost certainly know r/trees was not a subreddit for literal trees), it is clear that the tale of the vengeful arborist is nothing more, or less, than a clever leg-pull.
In other words, anyone who thinks that this story is true is barking up the wrong tree.
This report is the second (part 1/part 3) in a series examining the years-long decline in both spending on lobbyists and the number of active lobbyists.
As the total amount of money spent on lobbying continues to fall, many analysts — including the staff at the Center for Responsive Politics — cite congressional gridlock as a cause of the decline. The 113th Congress, one of the least popular in history, is known for its apparent inability to pass legislation. Given the perceived ineffectiveness of Congress, it may be no surprise that the amount spent on lobbying – which is usually undertaken to influence members of the House and Senate — has declined. While a lobbying campaign could have resulted in the passage of a bill or a helpful earmark in the past, those who pay the lobbyists' bills may find a gridlocked Congress to be an unappealing target. When faced with decisions about how to spend limited funds, clients may not be willing to gamble on Congress to come through for them.
But the notion that lobbying dollars might flow more freely when Congress is passing many bills, though plausible, is untested. In this report, the second in our series documenting the decline in lobbying, we looked at whether the data actually supports the explanation that lobbying increases when Congress is productive. The results are a decidedly mixed bag.
Congressional productivity and lobbying dollars
If we want to see whether lobbying clients will spend more money during times when Congress is more active, we are faced with a conundrum: How does one measure congressional productivity? In the 111th Congress, lawmakers passed 861 bills, but many of those were largely symbolic pieces of legislation, like the renaming of a post office or the commemoration of some famous individual. More interesting to us is the number of substantive bills passed by Congress, which can do anything from reducing tariff rates to radically restructuring the U.S. healthcare system. That, too, though, is probably a poor measure of productivity, because a bill like the Affordable Care Act of 2009 may involve more debate and affect a significantly larger number of lobbying clients than a simple cut in an import tariff on a specialty chemical.
Simply charting the number of bills passed over the amount of lobbying dollars spent, by year, it is clear that a variety of other factors affect the amount of lobbying. (We can stipulate that we expect to see more bills passed in the second year of any Congress than in the first, as it takes time to draft and file legislation.) Most importantly, the overall amount of lobbying spending has dramatically increased since 1998, even though the total has fallen in the last few years.This means that any basic exploration of the relationship between the number of bills and the amount of lobbying is likely to be skewed by the strong upward trend in increasing lobbying dollars. In fact, the amount of lobbying money spent is actually negatively correlated with the number of bills in Congress, indicating that when Congress is passing more bills, lobbying dollars decrease. That seems counterintuitive, and calls for more probing.
(If you'd prefer not to read our methodology, skip to just below the next table)
To really explore the relationship between congressional productivity and the amount spent on lobbying by companies and other parties, we need to consider the many other factors which could cause lobbying expenditures to rise or fall. In this case, we want to figure out whether the total spent on lobbying is influenced by the number of bills passed by Congress. However, there could be other factors that affect the level of lobbying expenditures, like whether it is the second year of a Congress, or whether members of Congress were allowed to use earmarks. In social science lingo, the total amount of lobbying is a dependent variable, meaning that it is affected by a variety of “independent” variables (like the number of bills in Congress).
In circumstances where many independent variables affect a single dependent variable, we need to “model” the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. Factors which could affect the dependent variable but are not of interest are a special kind of independent variable known as a control. By adding control variables to a model, it allows us to see whether the independent variable of interest — in this case the number of bills passed by Congress — has any effect on the amount of lobbying even accounting for a variety of other explanations for lobbying.
For us, one of the strongest independent variables is simply the passage of time. Some dependent variables always grow (think the U.S. GDP because of inflation), and lobbying activitiy looks like it might be one of those kinds of variables. Given this, we can't safely just use the total amount of lobbying as our dependent variable. Instead, we took the difference between two years as the dependent variable. This means that when lobbying increases, our dependent variable will be a positive number, but when it decreases it will be negative.
Our main independent variable of interest is the number of bills passed by Congress. In addition to that, we also include “dummy” (which means it is either “yes” or “no”) variables for whether Congress was allowed to use earmarks, whether the year was the second year of a Congress, and whether or not Congress was divided. We also include a measure of congressional disapproval, which ranged from 29 percent disapproval in 2002 to 81 percent disapproval in 2013.
In the table, you can see the different variables, and whether they were “significant.” If the variable was significant, this means that there is only a 5 percent chance that a relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable could have occurred by chance. If the variable is not significant, it means that we are not confident enough to say that the independent variable affects the dependent variable. All of these results are in the table below; the statistically-minded can click on the result to see more information.
Dependent Variable Significant or Not?
(Mouse over for values) Earmarks Allowed Significant! Congressional Disapproval Not Significant Second year of Congress Not Significant Divided Congress Not Significant Number of Bills Passed Not Significant
The results of the analysis suggest that the number of bills passed in Congress is not related to the amount of money spent on lobbying. The only variable that significantly predicted the level of lobbying dollars was whether or not Congress had the ability to use earmarks. However, it could also just be the case that the years following the earmark ban just happen to be the years where lobbying decreased (which is true) and something else is the cause of the decline.
Onward, then, to further research. Using the measure of the number of bills passed as the main explanatory variable is problematic, as it counts the passage of a tariff bill as equal to the passage of an omnibus appropriations bill. One bill might attract lobbying interest from a single client, while the other may attract the attention of thousands.
Even though it does not appear that the productivity of Congress has much to do with the waxing and waning of lobbying activities, it is still hard to believe that the spike in lobbying in 2009-2010 was unrelated to the flurry of attention given to major bills under consideration at that time. Due to the way clients disclose their lobbying activities, it is impossible to tell how much money a client spends on lobbying a specific bill or issue. However, we can see how many clients target a specific bill in a given year. A bill that attracts more attention would probably be considered a more important and significant bill, and it alone could spur significant lobbying activity.
Since 2006, only 64 bills have attracted the lobbying attention of at least 10 percent of all lobbying clients. Seven bills were under consideration for multiple years in a Congress. The bill that attracted the most attention since 2006 was the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (also known as the “bailout”), on which 47 percent of all clients reported lobbying.
Year Number of Clients Bill Name Percent Lobbied 2009 7473 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 46.2% 2010 4368 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 30.2% 2009 4764 American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 29.4% 2010 4255 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 29.4% 2010 4211 American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 29.1% 2010 4064 Unemployment Compensation Extension Acts of 2010 28.1% 2011 3448 Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 26.5% 2012 2949 MAP-21 25.1% 2009 3556 Americas Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 (and other versions of the health care overhaul) 22.0% 2008 3228 Emergency Economic Stabilization Acts of 2008 21.1%
All of the top six most lobbied bills were debated in 2009 or 2010, and with the exceptions of the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act (which was actually the federal budget in 2012) and the MAP-21 bill (another major funding package), all were debated before 2011, at which point the lobbying decline began.
Year Bills lobbied by 10% + 2007 6 2008 11 2009 11 2010 12 2011 7 2012 9 2013 10
The number of bills attracting at least 10 percent of all lobbying clients did, indeed, peak in 2010 at the same time the overall lobbying total peaked, but the decline since then has not been particularly dramatic. However, it does appear as that the number of “major” bills has declined slightly since the heyday in 2009 and 2010.
Changing patterns of political activity
Another explanation for the decline in lobbying is that clients have chosen to send their money not to K street lobbyists, but to members' campaign coffers. Of the top 500 lobbying clients from 2009, 400 had affiliated PACs which contributed to candidates in the 2010 and 2012 cycles. Were those clients ramping up their PAC contributions as they cut back their lobbying expenditures?
The data does not suggest that's what happened. Of 399 clients who have data in both time periods, only 72 have decreased their lobbying (relative to the average decrease) while increasing their PAC spending (relative to the average increase), indicating that companies inclined to decrease their lobbying also decreased their spending. Generally, “consistent” behaviors were more common, with companies tending to increase both their lobbying and PAC contributions or decrease both over the time period.
Changes in spending Number of Clients Increase Lobbying/Decrease PAC 107 Increase Lobbying/Increase PAC 115 Decrease Lobbying/Decrease PAC 105 Decrease Lobbying/Increase PAC 72
Conclusions
Three findings emerged from our analysis: One, earmarks disappeared at the same time the lobbying decline began, and holding a variety of other factors constant seems to indicate that the earmark ban may be significantly related to the decline. Our second finding is that Congress considered a larger than the usual number of “major” bills right as the lobbying peak occurred, and this could be related to the increase in lobbying spending. Finally, it does not appear that companies have shifted their attention to political giving instead of lobbying. Companies that increased their lobbying activity (or kept it stable) also increased their campaign spending, and vice versa.
It does seem clear that congressional productivity (as measured by the number of bills), or lack thereof, is not the cause of the decline. This finding, while helpful, does not tell the whole story. Often, lobbying clients seek to block new legislation and rules changes because they want to avoid greater regulation of their industry.
These findings all help to explain the decline in lobbying, but none stand alone. We hope to explore further explanations for the decrease in lobbying spending in more detail in future reports in this series.

In a message sent to Church leadership and to be read in worship services throughout the world, the Council of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has announced changes for future general conferences.
The letter states that "beginning in April 2018, the general women's session will no longer be held on the Saturday preceding the other sessions of general conference. Rather, the general priesthood and general women's sessions will each be held annually, with the general priesthood session being in April and the general women's session being in October." It continues, "These meetings will originate from the Conference Center on Saturday evening following the morning and afternoon sessions of the conference."
According to the letter, consolidating general conference sessions into one weekend furthers Church efforts "of reducing and simplifying the work of the Church and the demands made upon leaders and members."
Republican lawmakers on Sunday criticized President Obama's vision for winding down the war on terrorism, using talk show appearances to accuse them of misunderstanding the threat in a way that will embolden unfriendly nations.
“We show this lack of resolve, talking about the war being over,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said on “Fox News Sunday.” “What do you think the Iranians are thinking? At the end of the day, this is the most tone-deaf president I ever could imagine.”
In their first major foreign policy address of their second term, Mr. Obama said last week that it was time for the United States to narrow the scope of its long battle against terrorists and begin a transition away from a war footing.
In addition to renewing their call to close the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, they said they would seek to limit their own war powers. They also issued new policy guidelines that would shift the responsibility for drone strikes to the military from the Central Intelligence Agency, and said there would be stricter standards for such attacks.
Mr. Graham, a strong supporter of the drone program, said they objected to changing the standards. Separately, they called for a special counsel to investigate both the Justice Department, which has come under scrutiny for seizing journalists' phone records, and the Internal Revenue Service, which has acknowledged that it unfairly targeted conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status.
Democrats, including Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida and Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, praised Mr. Obama for what they said was a necessary rebalancing of civil liberties and national security interests. “We have to balance our values,” Ms. Wasserman Schultz said Sunday on the ABC News program “This Week.”
But at least two lawmakers — the current and former chairpeople of the House Homeland Security Committee, Representative Michael McCaul of Texas and Peter T. King of New York — complained specifically about the president's remarks about Guantánamo Bay.
Mr. McCaul warned against closing the detention center, especially if it meant moving prisoners to the United States. “Name me one American city that would like to host these guys,” they said on the CNN program “State of the Union.”
More than half the remaining 166 detainees at Guantánamo Bay are Yemeni; of these, 56 have been cleared to go home. Mr. Obama has proposed repatriating detainees when they can, but will still face the thorny question of what to do several dozen men who cannot be prosecuted and who have been deemed to be too dangerous to release.
Mr. King, appearing with Ms. Wasserman Schultz on “This Week,” said the detention facility had been a success. “Many experts believe it did work,” they said, adding that they were “very concerned about sending detainees back to Yemen.” Noting that Mr. Obama had campaigned on a promise to close the prison, they said the president “could have done a lot more than they have done if they were serious about it rather than just moralizing.”
In calling for a special counsel, Mr. Graham said the Justice Department had begun to “criminalize journalism” and had engaged in “an overreach” in investigating leaks of classified national security information. They also complained of an “organized effort” within the I.R.S. to target political opponents of the president. “I think it comes from the top,” they said, although current and former I.R.S. officials have said Mr. Obama did not know of the targeting.
Google has reported a 71 per cent increase in UK government requests to remove items from its search and web services properties over the course of 2011.
The company's latest transparency report said that Google received 44 requests from the UK government over the first half of the year, the majority relating to YouTube, where police and other government groups asked for the removal of 220 videos.
The report revealed that 135 videos were taken down on the grounds of national security, and 61 over "privacy and security" complaints.
Privacy and security also led to the takedown of 67 Google image entries in the UK, along with 43 web search results and two Blogger entries.
The takedowns represent an increase over the second half of 2010, during which Google reported just 153 takedown requests. Overall numbers for 2010 were greatly skewed by a major government takedown in which more than 93,300 Google Ads entries were taken offline.
In the US, Google received 757 takedown requests across its sites and services, up 70 per cent from the second half of last year. More than half were from Google Groups, where the company removed 379 pages deemed defamatory.
US authorities also called for the removal of 113 videos from YouTube, including several documenting alleged police brutality which Google refused to take down.
Swimming is always one of the marquee events of the Olympics, and the Rio Games are brimming with great matchups. From Katie Ledecky‘s quest for gold to Australia's Campbell sisters gunning for history to Michael Phelps' final stand, here are the must-watch races of the 2016 Olympics:
Sat Aug 6
Men's 400m Freestyle 9:30 pm EDT
Sun Yang of China is the defending champion, but Australian Mack Horton has the fastest time this year. And watch out for U.S. swimmer Conor Dwyer who clocked the third fastest time of 2016.
Women's 4x100m Freestyle relay 10:24pm EDT
This might belong to the Australians, whose team will feature sisters Bronte and Cate Campbell. The U.S. women haven't won this event since 2000. But they're doing everything they can to change that. Freestyle phenom Katie Ledecky, who swam the morning heats to qualify the U.S., will swim again in the final, as the anchor leg. That's unusual since Ledecky is known more as a distance swimmer and because she'll swim their first individual race the following day.
(Read More: 60 Athletes to Watch in Rio)
Sun Aug 7
Women's 400m Freestyle 10:01pm EDT
It's all about Ledecky, who swims in the 400 m freestyle for their first chance at an individual Olympic gold. On the men's side, Americans Nathan Adrian and Michael Phelps will likely be part of a strong 4x100m freestyle relay team, but the French and Russians have both swum blistering qualifying times.
Tues Aug 9
Women's 200m Freestyle 9:19pm EDT
Ledecky goes for their second individual medal. She'll be racing against teammate Missy Franklin, and will have to keep an eye on Sarah Sjostrom from Sweden.
Men's 200m Butterfly 9:28pm EDT
For the men, it's a rivalry repeat. Phelps, Chad le Clos of South Africa and Laszlo Cseh of Hungary are back to battle for the wall again. Cseh and Phelps own the two fastest times this year, and there's high anticipation for another photo finish to rival the fingertip's edge that Phelps gained over Milorad Cavic from Serbia in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.
Women's 200m Individual Medley 10:29pm EDT
Maya Di Rado of the U.S. also swims in the 200m individual medley; Along with Michael Phelps and Ledecky, the Stanford grad is one of three U.S. swimmers racing in three individual events. She'll go stroke for stroke with Siobhan-Marie O'Connor of Great Britain, who qualified in the event with the fastest time.
Men's 4x200m Freestyle Relay 10:38pm EDT
The U.S. men will try to defend their gold this relay, which they dominated in 2012 with the help of Phelps. That win established Phelps as the most decorated Olympian of all time.
(Read More: Sex Abuse Allegations Reach Gymnasts in Rio)
Wed Aug 10
Men's 100m Freestyle 10:03pm EDT
This one moves fast and furious. Nathan Adrian will be defending their title (assuming they make it through the heats), but he'll have competition from Australia's Cameron McEvoy.
Women's 4x200m Freestyle Relay 10:55pm EDT
It's the women's turn in the 4x200m freestyle relay, and Ledecky has another chance for a medal.
Thurs Aug 11
Men's 200m Individual Medley 10:01pm EDT
Phelps aims to defend their gold in what's become their signature event, but teammate Ryan Lochte will be pushing them to the wall.
Women's 100m Freestyle 10:18pm EDT
If the Campbell sisters both climb to the podium, it would be the first time siblings shared the Olympic medal stand in an individual swimming event. The U.S.'s Simone Manuel, and Sweden's Sjostrom could also be in the mix.
(Read More: The Best of Michael Phelps May Lie Ahead)
Fri Aug 12
Men's 100m Butterfly 9:12pm EDT
Your last chance to see Phelps in an individual race — if he's serious this time about retiring. He'll have some familiar competition — Cseh and le Clos.
Women's 800m Freestyle 9:20pm EDT
It's also Ledecky's last individual race at the Games — the longest one, the 800m freestyle. She's the defending Olympic champion and is eager to repeat.
Men's 50m Freestyle 9:44pm
The men's splash-and-dash — 50m freestyle — is a mad sprint down one length of the pool. The defending champion from France, Florent Manadou, is back to defend their title but the U.S.'s Adrian and Australia's McEvoy will also be racing them to the wall.
Sat Aug 13
Women's 50m Freestyle 9:03pm EDT
It's the women sprinters' turn and it's likely to be a tight race between the likes of the Campbell sisters, Sjostrom and even the U.S.'s Manuel.
Women's 4x100m Medley Relay 9:49pm EDT
Men's 4x100m Medley Relay 10:04pm EDT
The Chinese are the world champions and the Australians and Swedes are close behind so the U.S. women will have to fight for a spot on the podium. On the men's side, the U.S. are the world champions and have won this Olympic event every year they've attended since 1960. It's also likely Phelps' last appearance in an Olympic race — again, if they actually retire.

About 450 icebergs – up from 37 a week earlier – have drifted into waters where Titanic sank, forcing vessels to divert and raising global warming fears
More than 400 icebergs have drifted into the North Atlantic shipping lanes over the past week in an unusually large swarm for this early in the season, forcing vessels to slow to a crawl or take detours of hundreds of kilometres.
Greenland: the country set to cash in on climate change Read more
Experts are attributing it to uncommonly strong counter-clockwise winds that are drawing the icebergs south, and perhaps also global warming, which is accelerating the process by which chunks of the Greenland ice sheet break off and float away.
As of Monday, there were about 450 icebergs near the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, up from 37 a week earlier, according to the US Coast Guard's international ice patrol in New London, Connecticut. Those kinds of numbers are usually not seen until late May or early June. The average for this time of year is about 80.
In the waters close to where the Titanic went down in 1912, the icebergs are forcing ships to take precautions.
Instead of cutting straight across the ocean, trans-Atlantic vessels are taking detours that can add around 650km (400 miles) to the trip. That's a day and a half of added travel time for many large cargo ships.
Close to the Newfoundland coast, cargo ships owned by Oceanex are throttling way back to three or four knots as they make their way to their home port in St John's, which can add up to a day to the trip, said executive chairperson Captain Sid Hynes.
One ship was pulled out of service for repairs after hitting a chunk of ice, they said.
“It makes everything more expensive,” Hynes said. “You're burning more fuel, it's taking a longer time, and it's hard on the equipment.” They called it a “very unusual year”.
US Coast Guard Commander Gabrielle McGrath, who leads the ice patrol, said they had never seen such a drastic increase in such a short time. Adding to the danger, three icebergs were discovered outside the boundaries of the area the Coast Guard had advised mariners to avoid, they said.
McGrath is predicting a fourth consecutive “extreme ice season” with more than 600 icebergs in the shipping lanes.
Most icebergs entering the North Atlantic have “calved” off the Greenland ice sheet. Michael Mann, director of the earth system science center at Pennsylvania State University, said it was possible climate change was leading to more icebergs in the shipping lanes, but wind patterns were also important.
Giant iceberg poised to break off from Antarctic shelf Read more
In 2014, there were 1,546 icebergs in the shipping lanes – the sixth most severe season on record since 1900, according to the patrol. There were 1,165 icebergs in 2015 and 687 in 2016.
The international ice patrol was formed after the sinking of the Titanic to monitor iceberg danger in the North Atlantic and warn ships. It conducts reconnaissance flights that are used to produce charts.
In 104 years, no ship that has heeded the warnings has struck an iceberg, according to the ice patrol.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman, as we end today's show on El Salvador, where both candidates have claimed victory in Sunday's presidential election after a preliminary count showed the vote too close to call. The race pitted the governing party's Salvador Sánchez Cerén against the right-wing candidate, Norman Quijano. Sánchez Cerén, a former rebel commander, was running to replace Mauricio Funes, marking the first time an FMLN candidate succeeds another after decades of right-wing governments. Sánchez Cerén was seen as the favorite coming in, but the latest results show them ahead less than 1 percent.
We go now to San Salvador, where we're joined by Laura Embree-Lowry, the program director of CISPES, the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador. She's been based in San Salvador for the last five years.
Welcome to Democracy Now! What is the latest news on this election, Laura?
LAURA EMBREE-LOWRY: Thank you, Amy, and good morning.
So, as you mentioned, it's a very, very close race. The preliminary results are showing 50.11 percent for the FMLN and 49.89 percent for the right-wing ARENA party. That's with over 99.9 percent of the tables reporting at this point. So the electoral authority, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, has said that because of the closeness of the race, they won't be declaring an official winner until they've actually done the final count of the—you know, the original results from each table. But what we're seeing right now is, in the preliminary results, that the FMLN, the leftist party, is ahead by over 6,300 votes.
What's really concerning is the right-wing party having declared victory extremely early, when less than 70 percent of the voting tables were reporting. And it seems to go along with the trends that we saw before the election of them setting up the stage to discredit the election results after they had been announced. And last night, when Norman Quijano, the right-wing ARENA candidate was declaring victory, they were already calling fraud and saying that the TSC's refusal to give a definitive result right now is a sign of fraud. They were also—called on the armed forces to protect democracy and to defend El Salvador's democracy against the fraud that was being committed. So this is very concerning, especially because all of the observer missions have noted the transparency of the process, the tranquility with which it developed. The OAS, Organization of American States, observer mission has said that El Salvador's electoral system is cutting-edge for the Central American region. So, also, the ARENA candidate, Norman Quijano, also said that their party was ready for war—
AMY GOODMAN: He's the mayor of San Salvador.
LAURA EMBREE-LOWRY: —in terms of defending democracy [inaudible] fraud. I'm sorry?
AMY GOODMAN: He's the mayor of San Salvador?
LAURA EMBREE-LOWRY: Yes, he's the mayor of San Salvador and the candidate for the right-wing ARENA party.
AMY GOODMAN: Right. And then talk about the significance of Sánchez Cerén, also from the FMLN, as the current president, Mauricio Funes, is.
LAURA EMBREE-LOWRY: Well, Sánchez Cerén is a former guerrilla commander from when the FMLN was a rebel group during the civil war. The FMLN was, of course, incorporated into the electoral system after the peace accords were signed in 1992, and Sánchez Cerén has served as vice president in Mauricio Funes's administration, as well as minister of education, in which they launched some really cutting—I guess some really amazing social programs, including free uniforms, free school lunches for school children, a literacy program to eradicate illiteracy in the country. And so he's really a very popular candidate because of how those programs have touched so many lives of the poor majority in El Salvador.
AMY GOODMAN: Well, of course, we'll continue to cover these results. Again, they have not been announced yet, the election for president in El Salvador. Laura Embree-Lowry, speaking to us from San Salvador, program director at CISPES, the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador.
And that does it for our broadcast. I'll be on the road tomorrow on—as we mark the third anniversary of the meltdown at Fukushima, we'll be playing an interview with the former Japanese prime minister, Naoto Kan. When we were in Tokyo, we interviewed him. Tomorrow night, I'll be speaking at University of Massachusetts, Amherst, at Bowker Auditorium at 7:00 p.m. On Thursday, in Flagstaff at Northern Arizona University at the Cline Library at 7:00. Friday in Santa Fe, speaking at the Lensic. And on Saturday, I'll be in Denver, Colorado. All are welcome. Go to our website at democracynow.org.
Regulation: It sounds like the punchline to a bad joke: Former Fed chief Ben Bernanke was recently turned down to refinance their mortgage. If the nation's former top bank regulator can't qualify, something's very wrong.
'Just between the two of us," Bernanke told Moody's economist Mark Zandi at a recent conference, "I recently tried to refinance my mortgage, and I was unsuccessful." Though played for laughs, it was no joke.
"I'm not making that up," Bernanke said. "I think it's entirely possible (lenders) may have gone a little bit too far on mortgage credit conditions."
Ya think?
It's a stunning admission of failure, coming from the nation's one-time chief bank manager, who was given enhanced powers over the banking system under the Dodd-Frank financial reforms.
It shows that few of the actions that Bernanke's Fed took — including the zero-interest-rate policy and quantitative easing, which added trillions of dollars to the banking system — did what they were supposed to.
More broadly, it's also a reminder that following the government-created financial crisis and subsequent "fixes" — in particular, the Dodd-Frank law — our financial system remains dysfunctional.
Of course, Bernanke's revelation is just one of several recently by former regulators or legislators who played a role in our meltdown. Prime among these confessors of failure was former Rep. Barney Frank, who for years denied that the government played any role at all in the financial meltdown of 2007 and 2008.
But last year, the one-time chairperson of the House Financial Services Committee admitted the two-decade-long affordable housing campaign that began under President Clinton put millions of low-income people into houses they couldn't afford, triggering the financial crisis. In fact, Frank says, the federal government "propelled" banks to make loans they shouldn't have.
As Frank now admits, the government's fingerprints were all over the financial crisis. Dodd-Frank reform was supposed to fix it, but as Bernanke shows, it didn't.
What it did do was reregulate the financial sector in the worst possible way. It kept in place government rules forcing banks to lend to uncreditworthy low-income and minority borrowers.
It punished banks by making it costlier to do business. (A report this week noted that banks have shut a record 1,600 branches this year due to rising costs.)
And it punished regular borrowers, many of whom, like Bernanke, find themselves unable to qualify for loans despite living at a time of "easy money."
Our banking system is demoralized and shrinking, thanks to ill-advised and heavy-handed regulations.
The 2,300 page Dodd-Frank bill, wrote Peter Wallison, who served on the commission looking into the financial meltdown, "focused on placing additional restrictions on financial firms, often for no apparent purpose other than to extend government control."
Exactly. Welcome, Mr. Bernanke, to the system you helped create.
One of the most hyped scenes in Taika Waititi's Thor: Ragnarok is a gladiatorial battle on the planet Sakaar between Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth).
Although Hulk is a CGI character (with Thor also being digital at times, too), the fight feels real and visceral. And there's a reason for that: not only was it staged with the principal actors, but the stunt doubles were specially chosen to represent the appropriate scales of the towering Hulk and the shorter, but still powerful, Thor — in a way you might not expect.
The visual effects crew behind the work break down how they accomplished the dramatic fight for SYFY WIRE.
Staging a stadium showdown
In previous Marvel film fights involving Hulk, the big challenge was to represent the huge character on set with either Ruffalo or a stunt performer stand-in (who would be replaced later with the CGI character). Often Ruffalo or a stunt double in motion capture gear would wear a backpack rig that added extra "bulk" and even a cardboard cut-out head while taking aim at an opposing actor or stunt double.
But according to Thor: Ragnarok's overall visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison, "that would often end up just being a bunch of guys throwing punches at each other, like a bar brawl. There's a limit to what you can do interaction-wise because the other guy is just wearing a stand-in rig on top. You can't really wrestle that well."
The solution was to re-think the problem and do some "reverse engineering math."
"I went, look, if Chris is 6'4 so Thor is 6'4 and our Hulk is 8'6, that's a certain percentage scale up," says Morrison. "What if we do it the other way around, and say that the Hulk is actually 6'4, what's the reverse math to this — what could be the smallest Thor we could shoot?"
That appropriate height turned out to be 4'8 or 4'9. The next question was finding a stunt performer who was around that tall. Luckily, one existed by the name of Paul Lowe, a well-known stunt performer with credits such as The Dark Knight Rises and The Mummy Returns, who regularly doubles for children. Standing in for Thor, Lowe battled other stunt doubles for Hulk. Because of the height difference, Lowe would have to punch upwards (just like Thor would to Hulk), or if they kicked Hulk it would hit the character's knee at just the right height.
Stuntman Paul Lowe posted these images on their Twitter account from the Thor: Ragnarok shoot.
This part of the fight was motion captured, and followed beats set out by storyboards, and by previsualization from The Third Floor. Later, Chris Hemsworth would repeat the actions on a bluescreen against heavy bags and focus pads. "But now we knew the height at which the punches had to be," notes Morrison, "and whether they had to jump up and leap onto Hulk's neck. We had built pieces of rigging to represent Hulk, too, and even painted them green so the right light bounced off onto Chris."
When other footage of Hemsworth, a motion captured Ruffalo, stunt doubles, and the earlier fight pieces were ultimately brought together — care of visual effects from Industrial Light & Magic — they clicked. "ILM would embellish the scenes, and their animators really just ran with it," explains Morrison. "They did incredible stuff, and we had such a strong foundation for the fight to begin with."
Same Hulk, but different
Hulk has been stuck on Sakaar for some time and in permanent monster form, instead of Bruce Banner. That gave the filmmakers scope to present the CGI character with a slightly new look. "ILM went back to first principles and rebuilt the Hulk from scratch," says Morrison. "We knew that we needed the fidelity of the model to be much higher to be able to do all this spatial animation and deliver dialogue."
For the re-build, ILM went back to Marvel Studios' head of visual development Ryan Meinerding. "Ryan continued developing Hulk's evolution, and really put an emphasis on making sure Hulk felt appropriately heroic which was reflected by a more chiselled and athletic Hulk with the square jaw of a champion," outlines ILM visual effects supervisor Chad Wiebe. "Hulk's hair groom also changed to something more Sakaarian, compared to the shaggy beast in the Avengers films. Their color and skin were also updated, and we added scarring from previous arena battles, along with extra layers of sweat and subtle details indicating their new life in Sakaar."
"Performance wise," adds ILM animation supervisor Steven Nichols, "ILM had the exciting opportunity to have Hulk carry out full-blown conversations! Mark Ruffalo's performance was captured on set to maintain the timing, dialogue and relationship with the other actors. Due to the improvised nature of some of the scenes, this approach allowed a level of flexibility to capture new ideas or different takes that really made Hulk's character emerge through Chris and Mark's exploration."
Video of Thor: Ragnarok - 'We Know Each Other'
Morrison gives ILM much credit for delivering this new kind of Hulk for the Sakaar scenes. They also, of course, says that Mark Ruffalo was easily able to adapt to provide the definitive Hulk performance.
"Mark is the Hulk, he's the best at being Hulk in the whole world. Every time they come to doing Hulk, they get back in the character and I guess it's like riding a bike. But it was fun to see a fundamentally different Hulk this time around."

A growing coalition is getting very vocal about the use of child workers on tobacco farms across Virginia. However, late Tuesday afternoon, a House committee defeated a bill to put limits on the practice.
A Human Rights Watch report released last year revealed disturbing details about child labor on tobacco farms. Cancer, poisoning or permanent neurological damage are just some of the risks some experts say children are more likely to suffer from working on tobacco farms.
"One of the refrains we hear from kids who do this kind of work is, when they get the tobacco sickness, they say, 'I felt like I was going to die,'" said Reid Maki, Director of Social Responsibility and Fair Labor Standards Coordinator, Child Labor Coalition for National Consumers League.
Virginia House Bill 1906 would have made it illegal for minors to work directly with tobacco plants or their dried leaves. The bill would have made an exception for children working, as part of a tradition, on family farms.
"The overwhelming majority of children interviewed reported experiencing symptoms consistent with acute nicotine poisoning," said 49th District Delegate Alfonso Lopez (D).
Some of the opponents of the bill feel the conclusions made in the Human Rights Watch report are unfair to make at this point.
"My grandmother raised tobacco," said 14th District Del. Daniel Marshall III (R). "I grew up in a tobacco family...My whole life I had been exposed to tobacco."
Del. Marshall says they introduced the motion to defeat HB 1906 because they don't like where it was going.
"Only thing they made were accusations, didn't hear any facts," Marshall said. "The other issue that I worried about is it tobacco this year What's next year?"
A House committee tabled the bill, essentially defeating it for now.
Del. Lopez says that while tobacco companies are taking steps on their own to limit child labor, they still believe a legal protection should be in place and they will introduce this bill again next year.

Not long ago, the most prominent supporters of the public option were touting it as essential for healthcare reform. Now, suddenly, it's incidental.
In fact, many who were lauding a public option as the key to a better healthcare future are now condemning just about anyone who insists that the absence of a public option makes the current bill unworthy of support.
Consider this statement: "If I were a senator, I would not vote for the current healthcare bill. Any measure that expands private insurers' monopoly over healthcare and transfers millions of taxpayer dollars to private corporations is not real healthcare reform."
That statement is as true today as it was when Howard Dean, former chairperson of the Democratic National Committee, made it three months ago in a Washington Post op-ed. But now, a concerted political blitz is depicting anyone who takes such a position as a menace to "real healthcare reform."
After devoting vast amounts of time, money, energy and political capital to banging the drum for the public option as absolutely vital during 2009 and through this winter, countless liberal organizations and prominent Democrats in Congress have made a short-order shift.
You are now to understand that the public option isn't essential -- it's expendable. And all of the sudden, people who assert that a public option is a minimal requirement for meaningful healthcare reform are no longer principled -- they're pernicious.
This dynamic goes way beyond the routine malleability of political positions. While the whips crack on Capitol Hill, what we're seeing is a stampede of herd doublethink.
*****
I continue to believe that guaranteed healthcare -- a.k.a. single-payer or enhanced Medicare for all -- is the only way to solve this country's enormous healthcare crisis. But early last year, before the public option shrank and shrank some more and then disappeared under the bus of the Obama administration, it appeared to possibly be a significant step forward.
But the White House, even while claiming to want a public option, was cutting deals with the pharmaceutical and hospital industries while ditching the public option. For those who doubt that the administration engaged in double-dealing to such an extent, I recommend the March 16 article by Huffington Post writer Miles Mogulescu, "NY Times Reporter Confirms Obama Made Deal to Kill Public Option."
A postscript from Mogulescu voices a broader outlook. I'll quote a couple of paragraphs here:
"Whenever I write blogs which are critical of Obama and Congressional Democrats for making corporatist deals, I get numerous comments from people who believe they are progressive but say they will never vote for Obama or Democrats again, that they will stay home at the next election, or that they will vote for small third parties who have no chance of winning. It's not my intent to encourage those views. Do people making these comments really think bringing Republicans back to power would make things better? . . . "Progressives need to have a sophisticated and nuanced relationship with elected Democrats. After the 2008 elections, too many progressive organizations demobilized believing their job was simply to take orders from the White House to support Obama's agenda, whatever it was. That was a mistake. It's equally a mistake for progressives to overreact in the opposite direction and think they can abandon electoral politics and do nothing to prevent the Republicans from regaining power. What's needed is a powerful grassroot progressive movement to force elected officials to do the right thing more often and to counter-balance the power of big money in politics. The periods of progressive change in American politics, like the Progressive Era, The New Deal, and the Great Society, have come when strong progressive movements have forced elites and elected officials to enact somewhat progressive legislation."
The dynamic now in full force on Capitol Hill was aptly described by Dean in their Post op-ed midway through December: "In Washington, when major bills near final passage, an inside-the-Beltway mentality takes hold. Any bill becomes a victory. Clear thinking is thrown out the window for political calculus. In the heat of battle, decisions are being made that set an irreversible course for how future health reform is done. The result is legislation that has been crafted to get votes, not to reform healthcare."
A week after Dean's article, the Senate approved the healthcare bill that is now on track to be "deemed" by the House -- with the avid support of Dean and numerous other public-option enthusiasts, and also for that matter with the support of Rep. John Conyers and many other single-payer enthusiasts (including, as of Wednesday, Rep. Dennis Kucinich).
SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Help Keep Common Dreams Alive Our progressive news model only survives if those informed and inspired by this work support our efforts
The quality of the Senate healthcare legislation hasn't improved in the three months since Dean condemned it. What has gone over the top is the cacophony of voices and pressures to tout doublethink as virtuous pragmatism.

But there are big problems with skipping lightly past the absence of a public option in the current bill. And none is bigger than the reality of the individual mandate in the legislation.
It's remarkable and sadly revealing that boosters of the bill have scarcely mentioned -- much less publicly come to terms with -- the dire implications of a nearly enacted law that requires people to have health insurance and offers no option other than further enriching the private insurance industry.
Last year, when the subject came up, progressive supporters of the White House's general approach were quick to offer assurances that a public option would mitigate the unpleasant aspects of mandated coverage. After all, the story went, people could select a nonprofit government-run entity for insurance coverage rather than being forced to choose between corporate insurance policies.
But now, if the pending bill becomes law, people will be forced to choose between corporate insurance policies.
Meanwhile, all the hype about how 30 million more Americans "will be covered" fails to deal with the quality and cost of their purported coverage, much less how much real access to healthcare will actually result.
For many, the available coverage would be bottom-of-the-barrel quality -- and even then, given thin personal finances, would cause added strains to pay for premiums. In the absence of public-option health insurance run for purposes other than maximizing profits, the built-in unfairness of an individual mandate becomes magnified.
What's more, the very concept of healthcare as a human right will be fundamentally undermined by placing the health-insurance burden on individuals. Many who receive government subsidies will routinely struggle to make ends meet, while making do with shoddy health plans as part of a new configuration of healthcare apartheid. And, inevitably, the extent of government subsidies will be vulnerable to attacks from politicians eager to cut "entitlements."
On a political level, the mandate provision is a massive gift to the Republican Party, all set to keep on giving to the right wing for many years. With a highly intrusive requirement that personal funds and government subsidies be paid to private corporations, the law would further empower right-wing populists who want to pose as foes of government "elites" bent on enriching Wall Street.
With this turn of the "healthcare reform" screw, the Democratic Party will be cast -- with strong evidence -- as a powerful tool of corporate America. But the Democrats on Capitol Hill and the organizations eagerly whipping for passage are determined to celebrate the enactment of something called "healthcare reform."

"When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said, "it means just what I choose it to mean -- neither more nor less."
"The question is," Alice replied, "whether you can make words mean so many different things."
"The question is," Humpty Dumpty responded, "which is to be master -- that's all."
Many well-informed and insightful people are now hoping that the current healthcare bill will become law and then lead to something better. But few backers want to dwell on its requirement that everyone get health coverage from the private insurance industry -- a stunning, deeply structural transfer of humongous power and wealth that would greatly boost the leverage of an already autocratic corporate state.
First and foremost, to put your mind and ease and to verify that your transaction was correctly sent to your address, use this guide to verify your transaction:
How do I, as a recipient, verify that my transaction actually arrived?
It should show that you have one output with output match? = True for the amount you expect to receive. If this checks out, you can proceed with the rest of the guide.
It's important to make sure you're running the latest version ( v0.13.0.4 at the time of writing). You can check the version # on the Settings page of the GUI (under Debug info ). If you're not running v0.13.0.4 , please upgrade first:
How do I upgrade my software to the newest version?
The following assumes you're using a local node
First, you can check whether you are using a local node by going to the Settings page and looking at the daemon address. It should state localhost (or 127.0.0.1 ) with port 18081 .
Now, the most common "problem" is that people are not fully synced yet or their GUI wallet is erroneously stating that it's fully synced. If you're not fully synced yet, the GUI will not be able to "see" your transaction. To confirm your fully synced, perform these steps:
[1] Go to the Settings page of the GUI.
[2] Go to the Log tab.
[3] Type status into the command + enter (e.g. 'help' or 'status') box.
[4] An output will be displayed that looks like:
Height: 1456425/1456425 (100.0%) on mainnet, not mining, net hash 290.20 MH/s, v6, up to date, x(out)+x(in) connections, uptime xd xh xm xs
Where x is simply an integer. For example, you could have 8 outgoing connections and 2 incoming connections. The Height can be explained as follows. The first number is the height you (personally) are currently on, whereas the second number is the top height (most recent block on the blockchain). The first number can be lower than the second number if you haven't completed the initial sync yet.
[5] Now to verify that you're actually fully synced, compare the first number to the height displayed on a blockchain explorer like, for instance, XMRchain. You're fully synced if your height matches the height displayed on a block explorer.
[6] If the GUI is stating that you're fully synced (100.0%), but your height doesn't match the height displayed on a block explorer (and is off by a large number), it is erroneously reporting that you're fully synced. This is, fortunately, easily resolved as follows. First, exit the GUI and make sure to stop the daemon as well. Second, restart the GUI + daemon. Third, use the status command to verify that it's now correctly displaying the top height.
[7] If the GUI is correctly stating the top block height, but is stuck on a particular block, perform these steps. First, exit the GUI and make sure to stop the daemon as well. Second, restart the GUI + daemon. Third, use Show status to verify that it's now syncing past the block it was stuck on.
[8] On the 18th of October (block 1685555 ) a scheduled network upgrade occurred. If you are still running a v0.12 version, you can be reasonably certain that you're on the wrong (alternative) chain. Intuitively, the GUI will not be able to see a transaction sent to your wallet if it's on the wrong (alternative) chain. Fortunately, this is easily resolved by following this guide
Note that after the daemon is fully synced, the wallet will start refreshing. In addition, in Monero, there's two "syncs". First, the blockchain sync, which is basically downloading the blockchain from other nodes / peers. Second, the wallet sync, which is the wallet "refreshing" / scanning blocks looking for transactions belonging to your address / wallet. You should see your funds once both syncs have been fully completed.
Now, if you're fully synced, the wallet fully refreshed and you don't see your funds yet, perform these steps:
Exit the GUI, but keep the daemon running. Browse to the directory your wallet files are located ( Documents\Monero\<wallet-name> on Windows | home/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name> on Linux | Users/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name> Mac OS X). Rename <wallet-name> (the file without extension) to <wallet-name>-old Restart the GUI. This will trigger a wallet refresh from scratch, which shouldn't take longer than 30 minutes. Once it states Connected (in the left bottom) you should see your funds.
Still not seeing your funds? Your wallet may, for some reason, have an erroneous Wallet creation height . You can resolve this as follows:
Go to the Settings page of the GUI. Go to the Info tab. Change the Wallet creation height to 1740000 This will trigger a wallet refresh from scratch, which shouldn't take longer than 30 minutes. You should see your balance once it completes.
Still not seeing your funds? It might be that a small part of your blockchain is corrupted and it's, coincidentally, the part that contained your transaction. Perform these steps:
Go to the Settings page of the GUI. Go to the Node tab. Switch the wallet mode to Remote node In the address box enter node.moneroworld.com In the port box enter 18089 Clicks in another empty box on the page to ensure your settings are properly saved. Again browse to the directory your wallet files are located ( Documents\Monero\<wallet-name> on Windows | home/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name> on Linux | Users/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name> Mac OS X). Rename <wallet-name> (the file without extension) to <wallet-name>-old2 Restart the GUI. This will trigger a wallet refresh from scratch, which shouldn't take longer than 30 minutes. Once it states Connected (in the left bottom) you should see your funds.
The following assumes you're using a remote node
If you're using a remote node, you're basically using someone else's public node / blockchain. Therefore, it's unlikely that an uncompleted sync is the issue. Thus, perform these steps:
Exit the GUI. Browse to the directory your wallet files are located ( Documents\Monero\<wallet-name> on Windows | home/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name> on Linux | Users/<username>/Monero/<wallet-name> Mac OS X). Rename <wallet-name> (the file without extension) to <wallet-name>-old Restart the GUI. This will trigger a wallet refresh from scratch, which shouldn't take longer than 30 minutes. Once it states Connected (in the left bottom) you should see your funds.
Still not seeing your funds? Your wallet may, for some reason, have an erroneous Wallet creation height . You can resolve this as follows:
Go to the Settings page of the GUI. Go to the Info tab. Change the Wallet creation height to 1740000 This will trigger a wallet refresh from scratch, which shouldn't take longer than 30 minutes. You should see your balance once it completes.
If you, after all these steps, still don't see your funds (but verified with this guide that they were correctly sent to your address), it'd be best to either open a new issue the GUI repository or contact me on Reddit.
ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- New potential owners of the Rochester Rhinos have stepped forward. David and Wendy Dworkin plan to keep the team playing at Sahlen's Stadium, according to the City of Rochester.
The Dworkins are stakeholders of the National Basketball Association's Sacramento Kings, and a local company, LLD Enterprises.
The city is seeking a lease agreement for the Dworkins to take over operation and maintenance at Sahlen Stadium. Mayor Lovely Warren has submitted the legislation to city council for approval at Tuesday's meeting. The city stated that the Dworkins also plan to make upgrades at the stadium, including replacing the turf, at no expense to the city.
This whole arrangement is contingent on the Dworkens purchasing the Rhinos back from it's league, the United Soccer League, which took over ownership earlier in January.
If this new agreement is approved, operation will be transferred by Feb. 1.
“From a league perspective, we're excited," said Tom Veit, USL Chief Marketing Officer. "Our goal all along was to keep the Rhinos in Rochester. They are one of the most storied franchises in professional soccer and from the beginning we had hoped to find local ownership and to keep the Rochester Rhinos there. We're happy the city was able to come to an agreement with Dworkins."
When reached by Time Warner Cable News, David Dworkin said, "Wendy and I are honored to fulfill our goal of keeping the Rhinos in Rochester and turning the stadium into one of the premier outdoor venues in upstate New York."
New Delhi: Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia clarified today that "Only interest accrued on 60 per cent contribution to EPF after April 1, 2016 will be taxed; principal amount to remain tax exempt". Also " PPF contributions will continue to be tax exempt; no tax on withdrawal and small salaried employees with up to Rs 15,000/month income will be kept out of purview of proposed taxation of EPF" they said.
Yesterday while announcing the Budget, to bring about parity in New Pension Scheme and other retirement schemes, the government decided to impose tax at the time of withdrawal on 60 per cent of the contributions made after 1 April, 2016, to EPF and other schemes. The proposal has come as an unexpected shocker for the salaried class.
At present, social security schemes run by retirement fund body EPFO are tax free EEE scheme. That means deposits, accrual of interest and withdrawals are tax free under the scheme.
In order to bring greater parity in tax treatment of different types of pension plans, it is proposed that the contributions made on or after April 1, 2016 by an employee participating in a recognised provident fund and superannuation fund, up to 40 per cent of the accumulated balance attributable to such contributions on withdrawal shall be exempt from tax, said Budget Memorandum.
It is proposed to provide that any payment in commutation of an annuity purchased out of contributions made on or after April 1, 2016, which exceeds 40 per cent of the annuity, shall be chargeable to tax.
Under the existing provisions of section 80CCD, any payment from National Pension System Trust to an employee on account of closure or their opting out of the pension scheme is chargeable to tax.
Announcing measures for moving towards a pensioned society, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said, "Pension schemes offer financial protection to senior citizens. I believe that the tax treatment should be uniform for defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans."
They said, "I propose to make withdrawal up to 40 per cent of the corpus at the time of retirement tax exempt in the case of National Pension Scheme. In case of superannuation funds and recognised provident funds, including EPF, the same norm of 40 per cent of corpus to be tax free will apply in respect of corpus created out of contributions made after April 1, 2016."
The minister also said that the annuity fund which goes to the legal heir after the death of pensioner will not be taxable in all three cases.
They proposed a monetary limit for contribution of employer in recognised Provident and Superannuation Fund of Rs 1.5 lakh per annum for taking tax benefit.
The minister also proposed to exempt from service tax the Annuity services provided by the National Pension System (NPS) and Services provided by EPFO to employees.
The government has also proposed that 14 per cent service tax on services provided by Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) to employees, being exempted, with effect April, 2016.
The budget has also proposed to increase the threshold for deducting tax deducted at source (TDS) on payment of accumulated balance due to an employee in EPF Rs 50,000 from existing Rs 30,000.
Last year budget had provided that the members of private provident fund trusts will not have to pay tax on pre-mature withdrawals provided the amount is either less than Rs 30,000 or their tax liability is nil even after including the withdrawn sum to their income.
Not surprisingly, the government's decision on EPF met with strong reactions on social media:
Why only tax the only social security, paying decent safe returns to fall back on for rainy day for working class? Take the whole away! #EPF — AnanD (@aThakkali) March 1, 2016
Trade unions have also reacted strongly yo the proposal.
G Sanjeeva Reddy, president, INTUC, also a member of the EPFO's Central Board of Trustees has been quoted as saying in a report in The Indian Express that the proposal will have to be rolled back. "If they don't roll it back, we will hold a nationwide strike,” they have threatened.
Interestingly, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a BJP arm is not favour too, the IE report said.
A report in The Times of India noted that it is the younger tax payers who will be more affected than those who have only a few years to retire.
With the concerns over EPF heightening, minister of state for finance Jayant Sinha was forced to tweet that the government will come out with an FAQ:
1/ We have noted concerns about changes in tax treatment for EPF/PPF/NPS. Full clarification with FAQs will be issued shortly. @adhia03 — Jayant Sinha (@jayantsinha) February 29, 2016

Security researchers have uncovered an active malware campaign in the wild that steals the Apple ID credentials from jailbroken iPhones and iPads.
News of the malware dubbed "unflod," based on the name of a library that's installed on infected devices, first surfaced late last week on a pair of reddit threads here and here. In the posts, readers reported their jailbroken iOS devices recently started experiencing repeated crashes, often after installing jailbroken-specific customizations known as tweaks that were not a part of the official Cydia market, which acts as an alternative to Apple's App Store.
Since then, security researcher Stefan Esser has performed what's called a static analysis on the binary code that the reddit users isolated on compromised devices. In a blog post reporting the results, they said unflod hooks into the SSLWrite function of an infected device's security framework. It then scans it for strings accompanying the Apple ID and password that's transmitted to Apple servers. When the credentials are found, they're transmitted to attacker-controlled servers.
In an e-mail to Ars, Esser said the malicious code works only on 32-bit versions of jailbroken iOS devices. "There is no ARM 64-bit version of the code in the copy of the library we got," they wrote. "This means the malware should never be successful on [the] iPhone 5S/iPad Air or iPad mini 2G."
reddit readers said unflod infections can be detected by opening the SSH/Terminal and searching the folder /Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries for the presence of the Unflod.dylib file. Compromised devices may possibly be disinfected by deleting the dynamic library, but since no one so far has been able to figure out how the malicious file is installed in the first place, there's no guarantee it won't somehow subsequently reappear.
"That is why we recommend restoring the device," Esser told Ars. "However, that means people will lose their jailbreak until a new one is released, and the majority of jailbreak users will not do that."
Of course, whichever course of disinfection users of infected devices choose, they should also change their Apple ID password as soon as possible.
The unflod campaign, which was also analyzed by researchers from antivirus provider Sophos, underscores the risks associated with installing unknown apps on jailbroken iPhones.
"I will also again take this moment to point out to anyone concerned that the probability of this coming from a default [Cydia] repository is fairly low," Cydia developer Jay Freeman, aka Saurik, wrote in one reddit comment. "I don't recommend people go adding random URLs to Cydia and downloading random software from untrusted people any more than I recommend opening the .exe files you receive by e-mail on your desktop computer."
Today Valve announced that the fee for submitting to Steam Direct will be $100 per game. That's right. For $100, anyone will be able to put a game on Steam.
This is a huge relief for many indie developers. Before this announcement, the only information we had was that the fee would be anywhere in the range of $100-$5,000. That is an incredible degree of uncertainty. Speaking as an indie dev who literally started this year, the $5,000 price tag per game would have been a huge kick in the teeth for us before we even got our feet wet. The announcement of the rock-bottom $100 fee is nothing short of amazing for us. However, a lot of people have major concerns.
Open the floodgates!
Hooray! Anyone with $100 can sell on Steam!... Oh, crap. ANYONE with $100 can sell on Steam! It's no secret that for various reasons (cough, cough, Steam trading cards), absolute garbage games get through Greenlight. Now those developers will be able to flood Steam with their crappy, lazy, cash grab games. Valve has promised some major revamps to improve curation. If they can successfully weed out terrible games whilst showcasing the gems, Steam Direct will be awesome. For the sake of argument, let's assume the curation system will be awful. We still want the low Steam Direct fee. Why?
Driving your own traffic to Greenlight sucks!
I'm not in the business of blaming Greenlight for Intrusion Protocol's (which you can vote for now *wink* *wink*) slow Greenlight performance. I accept we made some missteps. We launched on a Friday evening. For the first few hours our branding image was dark and dull. We did not build a following ahead of time. You live, you learn.

What should we make of North Korea? It's the most isolated country on the planet with a leadership which boasts that it has nuclear devices. Our correspondent Steve Evans is there and reports that it is a country which is changing.
What jumps out at you as you drive into Pyongyang is the darkness. There is a famous picture of North Korea taken from a satellite showing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a dark mass in contrast to the neon festival of light which is South Korea shining up into space.
But that darkness becomes real at street level: as night falls, you pass apartment block after apartment block in Pyongyang with barely a light glimmering from the windows. This remains a country where electricity is in short supply.
Image copyright AP Image caption Satellite photos taken in 1986 (L) and 1996 (R) of the Korean Peninsula at night show how brightness greatly expanded in South Korea, the lower part of the peninsula, while darkness spread throughout North Korea, except Pyongyang, during that decade
During the day, small solar panels are visible on some balconies, an indication of how ordinary people are bypassing official sources - literally taking power into their own hands.
That assertion of private action is happening in lots of ways. After the famine in the 90s, the economy started to change. Starving people found ways of growing their own food and then trading it - private markets helped relieve a problem of life and death. Once invented, these markets have refused to disappear. They are now tacitly acknowledged by the authorities. On top of that, some enterprises behave like capitalist organisations, offering managers the ability to keep profits - they get a private cut and the state gets its public cut.
'Creeping capitalism'
A kind of creeping capitalism is occurring in North Korea.
That means there is money there - some money for some people. As well as a changing way of doing business internally, a porous border with China to the north means all kinds of goods are entering. In the department stores of Pyongyang, products are available for those who can afford them (the crucial caveat).
Image copyright Reuters Image caption North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the region and among the most insular in the world
It should be said, though, that North Korea remains much poorer than many other countries, particularly South Korea. Even in Pyongyang, there are not riches to compare with Seoul.
Apart from the view of North Korea from space, there is another classic picture: that of long, empty roads, completely devoid of traffic apart from the odd ox cart.
Today, there are traffic jams in Pyongyang, traffic jams on roads clogged with Chinese vehicles, but also with BMWs and VWs.
Political control
But what hasn't changed is the level of political control. On Saturday, there is a big parade for what is a big celebration. Dignitaries and busloads of journalists are arriving to witness a display of military hardware - and of power over the country's own citizenry. Every street seems to have gangs of workers, often in military uniform. The squares of Pyongyang are filled with young people rehearsing the most minute choreographed move.
Minders are allocated to all journalists and these government officials supervise their charges rigorously, ruling out any contact with ordinary people, telling cameramen not to film. Books about North Korea are confiscated from incomers at the spanking new Pyongyang Airport.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Pyongyang has a new international airport
The airport illustrates the dilemma for the regime. It's been built to facilitate the arrival of millions of visitors clutching dollars and euros.
But the authorities remain very mistrustful of outsiders. They want them and their cash but not their disrupting ideas. How can North Korea get outsiders in while blocking material which it feels would corrupt the citizens with dangerous outside ideas like democracy or Christianity?
The 5th Brigade was an infantry brigade of the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA). The 5th Brigade was created in 1981 from three former battalions of the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA).[1] It later incorporated over 3,000 ex-ZANLA guerrillas from various units.[1] The brigade was based in Gweru and participated in the Mozambican Civil War[2] as well as a controversial domestic operation known as Gukurahundi which targeted disgruntled former Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) guerrillas and their supporters.[4]
The 5th Brigade was reactivated in 2006 following a prolonged period of inactivity.[5]
Organization [ edit ]
The 5th Brigade was subordinate only to the Chief of the Zimbabwe National Army.[1] In 1983, it consisted of five infantry battalions as well as an armoured company equipped with T-54 tanks.[1] The brigade was at least partly mechanised and possessed a number of BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers.[1]
History [ edit ]
The Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) was created in 1980 through the amalgamation of the former Rhodesian Army with the militant wings of two rival guerrilla organisations: the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA).[1] To ease the integration process, large numbers of former Rhodesian servicemen and guerrillas were demobilised and the remaining troops interspersed throughout new units.[1] By 1981, the bulk of the ZNA's manpower was concentrated in thirty-seven new light infantry battalions composed of about 37,000 personnel, almost all of whom were former ZANLA and ZIPRA guerrillas.[1] The battalions were to be trained by a combination of British and former Rhodesian military instructors.[1] Guerrillas from both sides resisted integration by establishing separate camps.[3]
The infantry battalions were almost immediately wracked by inter-factional skirmishes in in 1980 and again in 1981.[3] Zimbabwean prime minister Robert Mugabe and their government responded by disbanding three battalions and reorganising the remainder into four separate brigades.[1] Furthermore, all former guerrillas awaiting integration with their new units were to be disarmed en masse.[3] Upon learning of this policy, some former ZIPRA personnel began to desert the army, taking their weapons with them.[3] They complained that the disarmament campaign targeted them unfairly and was being used to buttress the military influence of ex-ZANLA troops at their expense.[3] Mutinies by ZIPRA elements in the ZNA became notoriously common.[3] In 1982 there were several hundred disgruntled and otherwise unemployed ZIPRA fighters at large in the provinces of Matabeleland South and Matabeleland North, many of whom had resorted to armed banditry.[6] The Zimbabwean government referred to the ex-ZIPRA deserters simply as "dissidents".[6]
In the wake of escalating dissident activity, Mugabe announced their intention to form a fifth infantry brigade composed solely of ex-ZANLA troops.[1] In August 1981, two preexisting ZANLA battalions and an additional 3,000 ZANLA guerrillas from various units were selected for training in the new 5th Brigade.[1] The officers were largely drawn from ex-ZANLA officer candidates whose poor educational qualifications had resulted in their failing standardised officer school.[7] A smaller number of ex-ZIPRA officers from 4th Brigade were also transferred to the 5th Brigade to serve in various technical and specialist roles.[7]
Unlike the ZNA's other four brigades, this unit was to be armed and trained by a special North Korean military mission.[2] The 5th Brigade was not structured for conventional military operations but rather as a specialized counter-insurgency unit.[2] Ex-ZIPRA and Rhodesian troops resented the brigade for its apparent exclusiveness and the fact that it was permitted to operate independently from the ZNA's normal command structure, being subordinate only to the Chief of the Army.[1] The 5th Brigade was trained from August 1981 to June 1982 at Inyanga, an isolated mountain base near the Zimbabwean-Mozambican border.[1] It was then moved to its permanent base in Gweru.[1]
At the time of its formation, the 5th Brigade was the ZNA's only mechanised infantry brigade, and most of its arsenal—including T-54 tanks, BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers, BRDM-2 scout cars, towed anti-tank artillery, and multiple rocket launchers, far exceeded the capabilities of ground weapons in the other four brigades' inventories.[1] However, serious practical difficulties also resulted in the brigade's use of unique codes and radio equipment which were otherwise incompatible with those of other army units.[8]
Mozambican Civil War [ edit ]
The 5th Brigade was one of the first ZNA units to be deployed into Mozambique during the Mozambican Civil War.[9] In mid-1982 the brigade was deployed to defend a strategic rail line from Beira to the Zimbabwean border from sabotage attempts by the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO).[9] Counteroffensives against RENAMO were jointly planned at the command level by Zimbabwean, Mozambican, and North Korean officers.[9]
Tensions with ex-ZIPRA forces [ edit ]
The 5th Brigade's independent nature soon placed it at sometimes violent odds with other brigades of the ZNA.[7] In September 1982, some of its personnel fired on ex-ZIPRA troops serving in the 4th Brigade.[7] This prompted a mass exodus of former ZIPRA personnel from 4th Brigade, which was forced to disband four of its battalions due to the loss of personnel to desertion.[7]
In December 1982, the 5th Brigade dismissed all its ex-ZIPRA officers.[7] Ex-ZIPRA personnel accused the 5th Brigade of purposefully instigating tensions between the factional elements in the other four brigades.[7]
Anti-dissident operations [ edit ]
In January 1983 the 5th Brigade was deployed into Matabeleland North with the objective of eliminating the local dissidents.[8] Its anti-dissident campaign was known simply as Gukurahundi, a Shona language term defined as "the rain which blows away the chaff before spring".[8] The word had been also been applied to ZANLA mobilization tactics during the Rhodesian Bush War in 1979.[8] Prime Minister Mugabe had bestowed the nickname Gukurahundi to the brigade in December 1982 and it figured prominently in the 5th Brigade's emblems and standards.[8]
The Zimbabwean government provided the 5th Brigade with meticulous records of ex-ZIPRA deserters and demobilized ZIPRA personnel, who were to be detained for questioning.[8] While the brigade's directives specified a search for ex-ZIPRA guerrillas, it failed to differentiate between those affiliated with ZIPRA and the same movement's political wing, the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU).[7] Prior to the deployment, this attitude had been reinforced by the alleged discovery of arms on several ZAPU properties, leading to the mass dismissal of ZAPU officials from the government and the arrest of senior ex-ZIPRA army officers.[3] In March 1983, 5th Brigade troops ransacked the home of ZAPU chairperson Joshua Nkomo, shooting three of their domestic staff during the raid.[8] The 5th Brigade's commander, Perence Shiri, perceived all ex-ZIPRA troops, including those employed in the civil service or the ZNA, as potential dissidents.[7] Detention by the 5th Brigade was arbitrary and extrajudicial killings of ZIPRA veterans became frequent.[8]
The 5th Brigade imposed a curfew in Matabeleland North, banned the movement of civilians within the operational area, and closed the majority of local businesses.[8] Its constituent battalions rounded up all the residents of a specific district and marched them to central locations, where they were collectively interrogated on dissident activity.[8] The 5th Brigade also conducted house to house searches in Bulawayo for deserters and arms caches.[8] In an attempt to isolate the civilian population from the dissidents, the brigade relocated a number of rural dwellers to police outposts, mining compounds, and old Rhodesian military bases repurposed into makeshift detention camps.[10] Conditions in the camps quickly deteriorated due to overcrowded and inadequate facilities.[10]
Allegations of politicisation [ edit ]
The 5th Brigade has been frequently criticised for its apparent political nature. Responding to an inquiry about North Korea's role in the unit's formation, then-Prime Minister Mugabe simply stated that "they were trained by the North Koreans because we wanted one arm of the army to have a political orientation which stems from our philosophy as ZANU-PF".[8] Zimbabwean Minister of Home Affairs and chief opposition figure Joshua Nkomo denounced the formation of the 5th Brigade as being politically motivated; they believed Mugabe was using the unit to intimidate their opponents and secure the forcible implementation of a de facto one-party state.[3] Historian Paul Moorcraft claimed the 5th Brigade was "marked by its fanatical ideological loyalty to Mugabe...[it] was run from the prime minister's office and was answerable only to Mugabe".[3] Another historian and noted sociologist, Ronald Weitzer, found that the 5th Brigade was perceived as being "highly politicised and loyal to the government, poorly led, and palpably anti-Ndebele".[11]
